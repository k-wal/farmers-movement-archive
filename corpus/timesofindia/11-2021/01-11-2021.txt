Nearly a dozen prominent political workers, including two former NC legislators, joined the BJP here on Sunday, with its Jammu and Kashmir unit president Ravinder Raina exuding confidence of forming the next government on its own in the Union Territory. Those who joined BJP on Sunday included former minister Prem Sagar Aziz, former MLA Kamal Arora, NC Jammu district chief and ex-deputy mayor Dharmavir Jamwal among others. भाजपा परिवार में सभी का हार्दिक स्वागत एवं अभिनदंन https://t.co/hNlcpmtQpC— Tarun Chugh (@tarunchughbjp) 1635676386000BJP national general secretary and Jammu and Kashmir in-charge Tarun Chugh and Raina welcomed the new entrants, along with hundreds of their supporters, into the party fold in presence of senior leaders, including Rana and Slathia, who recently joined the saffron party. Rana, the younger brother of Union minister Jitendra Singh and provincial president of the National Conference, along with senior party colleague and former minister Slathia had quit his party on October 10 and both of them joined the BJP in Delhi next day. Majority of those who joined the BJP, including both the former legislators Prem Sagar Aziz and Kamal Arora, are considered close to Rana. Accompanied by their supporters wearing different types of turbans representing different cultures, including the Dogras, Sikhs, Gujjars and Bakarwals, the leaders were welcomed by massive sloganeering at the BJP headquarters in Trikuta Nagar, Jammu, where the joining function was organised. “The new entrants – whether from the National Conference, Congress or the PDP – are welcome with open heart and they will be given due respect and rightful position without any discrimination. The injustice which was going on for decades ended when the prime minister abrogated the discriminatory Article 370 in August 2019 and bestowed Jammu and Kashmir with real freedom,” Chugh said. “The BJP has taken every possible step to ensure development of every community and every region for unprecedented development with the target of ‘Antodaya’,” he said. Reacting to sudden leaving of the two party heavyweights – Devender Singh Rana and Surjit Singh Slathia – on October 10, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah had said, “In politics, leaders quit parties. This isn’t anything new.” He had added that this should not lead to “discouragement and dejection” among the party workers and should instead make them more united.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/another-jolt-to-nc-ex-minister-former-mla-among-dozen-leaders-join-bjp-in-jammu/articleshow/87442121.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The pitch for NSG membership, which India has said it should get on the basis of its responsible conduct as a nuclear state, comes as part of its demand for the principle of "Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)" being the basis for climate action at the G20 meeting in Italy.

For example, for our technology to be replaced from coal to, may be, nuclear, we will need large amounts of capital for setting up nuclear power plants, both to replace our current demand, and for our future demand that our development imperative requires. We will need to be a member of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group for adequate availability of raw material for nuclear supply and several other associated concerns around cost of power." Addressing a news conference, India’s key interlocutor at the all-powerful grouping said there was an acknowledgement from countries on the importance of shared standards for seamless travel — including testing requirements and results, vaccination certificates and mutual recognition of digital applications — something that India had been pushing for. The Indian position reflects an assertive stance that seeks to counter the pressure being mounted by the West on all nations adopting a net zero target.

The statement is crucial as homegrown Covaxin has been awaiting emergency health approval from the WHO for several months. A key element of discussion at the meeting of G20 leaders in Rome focused on climate change ahead of the Glasgow meet. Goyal said that instead of only focusing on the climate goals, India, along with other developing countries, was able to introduce language in the final declaration on steps that are required including by developed countries to achieve these goals. "For the first time, G20 has identified sustainable and responsible consumption and production, along with provision of finance and technology as ‘critical enablers’ for achieving climate goals of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach," he said, adding that this was in line with PM Narendra Modi’s vision of promoting sustainable lifestyles globally.

---||India||Govt, judiciary now in sync on IAS-like service for judges||The idea of an All India Judicial Service on the lines of central services like IAS and IPS seems to be coming closer to fruition with the Centre building a broader consensus with the higher judiciary on the issue and setting the stage for consultations with states. Law minister Kiren Rijiju has called a state law ministers’ meeting in November where the formation of AIJS is likely to be on the table along with the issue of development of infrastructure for subordinate courts, reports Pradeep Thakur. To bring the states on board, the Centre is not averse to accommodating concerns of various states on being given freedom to continue with the recruitment of judicial officers for the subordinate judiciary. According to a source, the top judiciary seems to be in sync with the government’s major push to reform the recruitment of judges at the level of additional district judges. The option of higher judicial service, once introduced, will attract talented professionals to fill up the ranks of high courts and Supreme Court judges at an early age. "Taking up AIJS is a long pending reform which the government and the higher judiciary has to take a call now. The states have to come on board as they, too, agree that there is discrimination against direct recruits in the state judicial services who never make it to the SC and a very few get chance to be elevated to the high courts," the source said. If an Army officer can become the Army chief and an IAS officer can become a secretary to head a central administrative function, why can’t a direct recruit from the judicial service rise up to the rank of an SC judge, he added. Currently, less than 25% of judicial officers have some chance of being elevated as judges of high courts, with the majority of them managing to reach only the rank of district judges towards the end of their professional career. The remaining 75% quota is fixed for recruitment of HC judges from the Bar. None from the judicial service can even aspire to go up to the Supreme Court. "Probably this is the reason judicial services are not considered an appealing option for the talented," the source said, adding that once the AIJS is introduced, the HC and SC will have a better talent pool with a younger age profile to choose from. Another point of disagreement between the states and the Centre has been the language barrier. The government is prepared to train all recruits to the proposed AIJS in the same manner as an IAS or an IPS officer who are expected to learn local languages of states they are assigned to. With a shortage of competent candidates to fill up vacancies in the 25 high courts where more than 471 posts are vacant (as on October 1), the higher judiciary seems to be fine with the idea of having an AIJS which can attract the best talent from the industry. At present, bright minds are more inclined to take up jobs with private law firms rather than joining the judicial services with lack of promotional avenues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-judiciary-now-in-sync-on-ias-like-service-for-judges/articleshow/87443608.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Senior officers are engaged in active discussions with some of the top semiconductor makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), Intel, AMD, Fujitsu, United Microelectronics Corp., as the government steps up efforts to drive in the much-wanted semiconductor investments into the country. Read AlsoMaruti Suzuki misses profit view as chip crunch slams productionCar makers have been forced to make sharp production cuts this year as supply chain disruptions and booming demand for consumer electronics have led to an acute shortage of chips, which have become a critical component in automobiles, powering everything from fuel injection to entertainment systems.The ambitious plan is being coordinated and monitored closely by the Prime Minister’s office (PMO) and multi-ministries have been roped into the process as the government works overtime to finalise an attractive policy to woo the semiconductor companies, which are also being chased by other countries such as the US, and those in Europe. “The government is willing to talk capital support. We are closer to it like never before,” a top source engaged in the process told TOI. The government recently had a high-level meeting on the matter which had telecom and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, principal scientific adviser K VijayRaghavan, top scientist and Niti Aayog member VK Saraswat, Minister of State for IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar, representatives from the electronics, IT and telecom ministries, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), surface transport and space departments and the academia. “The idea is to have representatives from various ministries and departments who are in-charge of industries that are impacted by the semiconductor shortage,” the source said. On the cards could be financial support on capital expenditure, tariff reductions on certain components, and benefits through programmes such as Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and production-linked incentive (PLI). “All efforts will be made to formulate an attractive and investment-conducive scheme for companies looking at India.” Read AlsoCritical shortage of chips hits life-saving medtech devicesMUMBAI: The severe shortage of semiconductor chips is now going to hit where it hurts — critical life-saving devices and the medtech industry. The growing uncertainty and supply disruptions of chips globally has already led to an increase in prices of certain devices, with some facing stockoutsCurrently, India imports almost all semiconductors to meet demand estimated to reach around $100 billion by 2025 from about $24 billion now. Previous efforts to get companies to invest in the semiconductor space have failed, especially as the sophisticated manufacturing processes requires heavy investments, apart from need for supply of uninterrupted clean water and electricity. While India is seen as strong in the area of chip design, it has failed to get the much-touted fab manufacturing into the country which involves investments ranging between $5 billion and $10 billion. However, the break-out of corona pandemic in early 2020 and strategy of many global companies to look at ‘China plus 1’ policy for procurements is likely to help get investments in India. The government is confident that a large and fast-growing electronics market, apart from needs in other industries such as defence, automobiles, space and new-age technologies such as 5G and internet of things (IoT), will prompt the companies to invest in India. “The domestic demand is going to be very high. The government expects domestic production of electronics to move up to $350-400 billion by 2025, against the estimated $75 billion now. This will be a big enabler to get in investments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/semiconductor-crunch-govt-plans-mega-package-to-woo-investments/articleshow/87443837.cms||Pankaj Doval

This has happened with loans to industry as of end-September 2021 shrinking by Rs 66,239 crore over March 2021 levels, while loans to individuals grew Rs 73,011 crore during the period. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India, bank credit outstanding on the last Friday of September was Rs 109.5 lakh crore. Of this, the share of loans to industry dropped to 26% (Rs 28.3 lakh crore) from 27% a year earlier. Personal loans, which were a quarter of all bank loans in September 2020, increased to 27% (Rs 29.2 lakh crore) by end-September 2021. The drop in bank credit to the industry segment was largely due to companies in core industries deleveraging. Loans to iron and steel industries dropped by Rs 39,249 crore and loans to chemicals (which includes fertilisers, drugs and petrochemicals) shrunk by Rs 10,146 crore in the six months ended September. The few sectors which saw growth in credit were roads, ports and power. However, even this was not enough to show positive credit growth in the infrastructure segment. Overall credit outstanding to large industry shrunk by 5% in the first six months of the fiscal. This has pulled down industrial loan growth to 2.3% despite credit to small and medium businesses rising. In the personal segment, banks added Rs 20,096 crore of home loans to their portfolio in the last six months. They also increased their auto loan and gold loan book by Rs 3,000 crore each. Other personal loans were up by Rs 45,000 crore. Overall loans outstanding in the personal loan segment grew by Rs 73,000 crore in the six months ended September 2021. This has expanded the personal loan portfolio to Rs 29.18 lakh crore. The data appears to indicate that banks have wrested market share from finance companies in the credit market. Typically, NBFCs borrow from banks and debt markets and lend. Bank credit to NBFCs, which is the largest component in loans to services sector, shrunk by Rs 61,124 crore in the last six months. This has resulted in the share of credit to NBFCs dropping from 9% (Rs 9.4 lakh crore) on end March 2021 to 8% (Rs 8.8 lakh crore) as of end September 2021. This has resulted in outstanding bank credit to the services sector declining by 3% since March 2021. According to bankers, the decline in bank credit to large companies could be attributed to their deleveraging coupled with shifting to the debt market where cheaper money is available through commercial paper. Some businesses are seeing better cash realisations and do not feel the need to borrow. In the NBFC segment, the classification of a large borrower as a non-performing asset by banks could have added to the decline in the segment. The home loan portfolio displays more consistency and does not occasionally shrink like other segments because home loans are long term and fresh disbursements have a compounding impact on the size of the portfolio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-first-personal-loans-beat-credit-to-industry/articleshow/87443603.cms||Mayur Shetty

During the past two wee-ks (October 16-22 and October 23-29), the vaccination rate has improved with an average of 53 lakh and 58.5 lakh doses pushed daily, respectively. The daily average had dropped to 45.5 lakh doses during October 9-15. However, the vaccination rate still remains far less than what was achieved in first few weeks of September when the government pushed states to maximise coverage of first dose before the festival season kicked in. It peaked during the September 11-17 week when an average 95.5 lakh doses were given dailywhile a total 6.7 crore doses were administered during the week, of which 61% were first doses. As majority of the eligible population got covered with the first dose in most states, the rate of growth of people taking the first dose has started declining. During the October 9-15 week, a total 3.2 crore doses were administered, down 52% from the number of doses given almost a month ago. The trend has changed again during the past two weeks as the second dose coverage has now started picking up. Officials, however, maintain that the pace of vaccination going forward is likely to be slower as compared to August-September as recipients will have to follow the dosage gap between two shots of the jab. The coverage is expected to rise as per the speed observed 12-16 weeks ago as maximum people have received Covishield which is given in two doses with a similar gap. Overall, 78% of the eligible adult population across the country has received at least the first dose, whereas around 35% are fully vaccinated. The Centre has been pushing states with low coverage to accelerate pace and coverage of vaccination. The health ministry is also planning to start a door-to-door campaign in states with low coverage. In September 11-17 week an average 95.5 lakh doses were given daily while 6.7 crore doses were administered during the week, of which 61% were first doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-vaccination-rate-gets-a-boost-as-second-dose-coverage-rises/articleshow/87444065.cms||Sushmi Dey

Domestic airlines had carried a record 3.27 lakh passengers on the Sunday after Dussehra and now on the weekend before Diwali, a new record has been set, what with 3.38 lakh passengers boarding over 2,500 domestic flights on Saturday, the highest per day volume of passengers and flights flown since March 23 last year. Domestic passenger traffic breached the 3-lakh per day mark on six days this month; all of them weekend days, except for 18 October, which was a Monday. Compared to Friday, passenger numbers on Saturday and Sunday were found to be higher. Prior to this, domestic passenger traffic had almost touched the 3-lakh per day mark in the first week of March this year. It tumbled thereafter as the Covid second wave swept away the demand for air travel. Said an airline official, requesting anonymity: “We expect to carry a higher volume of passengers for the coming weekend. Typically, Sunday sees the highest passenger loads on flights that arrive into metros like Delhi, Mumbai.” For passengers wishing to escape the festive rush, Tuesdays would be the day to board a flight as passenger traffic dipped on this day on all weeks this month. For instance: on October 26, a Tuesday, airlines carried a total of 2.56 lakh passengers, while the passenger traffic the previous day, a Monday, was 2.84 lakh and, on Wednesday, it was 2.66 lakh. It was a similar pattern for the earlier weeks of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/airlines-fly-3-38-lakh-highest-per-day-volume-since-march-2020/articleshow/87444386.cms||---

The panchayat of the village where he is posted has officially stated that he cannot get a house locally as there is no housing settlement for Valmikis, classified as a scheduled caste (SC), in the village. The blatant discrimination has led to the state’s social justice and empowerment department writing a letter to the education department last week, acknowledging that “the teacher from the scheduled caste has been a victim of torture, discrimination, inequality and casteism”. Kanhaiyalal Baraiya, who resides at Chhatriyala village in Surendranagar district, was transferred to a school at Ninama village, which is located 75 kilometres away, in the same district . “When I went and reported for duty, I began enquiring to rent a house. I was told that there is no Valmiki settlement in the village and hence I cannot get a house on rent in the village,” he said. In fact, the talati and sarpanch – the administrative and elected heads of the village – provided this in writing on the official letterhead of the village panchayat on December 16, 2020 to Baraiya. “I have made official complaints to all departments concerned – the social justice, education and other departments – about this. Finally, the social justice department last week wrote to the education department to transfer me,” Baraiya told TOI.

The yatra underwent a four-month delay because the Uttarakhand HC had refused to allow it until it was satisfied with the government’s preparations. As per current restrictions, only fully vaccinated people, or those carrying a Covid-negative report, are allowed to visit the shrines. Harish Gaur, media in-charge of Devasthanam Board, said, “The maximum pilgrims visited Kedarnath, followed by Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri shrines.” Almost 2.2 lakh pilgrims visited the Kedarnath shrine, while 1.2 lakh came to Badrinath. Over 32,000 pilgrims visited Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines each, according to the Devasthanam Board. Meanwhile, the portals of Tungnath, the world’s highest Shiva temple, closed for the winter on Saturday. The Valley of Flowers, a Unesco world heritage site, shut for tourists from Sunday. “This year, at least 5,500 pilgrims visited the Tungnath temple, situated at a height of 3,470 meters, near Chopta in Rudraprayag," said Gaur. In 2017, nearly 22 lakh devotees had visited the Char Dham shrines. This number went up to 26 lakh in 2018 and hit a high of 32 lakh in 2019. In 2020, due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, only around 3 lakh pilgrims came for the annual pilgrimage.

Nearly 82% of the total toll charge comes from commercial and heavy vehicles, while cars contribute to barely 18% of the cumulative toll. Besides higher traffic on highways, the other two factors that have contributed to the increase in toll collection are annual hike in toll charges and bringing more completed stretches under the tolling system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/record-fastag-collection-points-to-recovery-road/articleshow/87444837.cms||Dipak K Dash

India recorded just over 96,500 cases during the week (October 25-31), a drop of 11% from the total in the previous seven days. Last week, Covid cases in the country had remained flat, with a drop of just 1%, raising fears of a surge in numbers during the festive season. This week’s case count was the lowest since the beginning of the second wave in mid-February, when less than 90,000 cases were recorded in February 15-21. The sharp drop in numbers this week was mainly on account of cases falling in Kerala, Maharashtra and other southern states. While Maharashtra logged a drop of 23%, with 8,633 new cases as opposed to 11,264 last week. Weekly cases in the state have fallen below 10,000 for the first time since the initial months of the pandemic.

While Wasim Ali, who is in his mid-20s, of Baghpat to jail, Mohd Farukh, 22, was arrested. His friend, unidentified in the FIR, was also booked. Ali, a daily wager, was booked under the IT Act, apart from being slapped with IPC Sections 505 (2) (promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes and communities) and 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot). This comes close on the heels of sedition charges being slapped on three Kashmiri students in Agra. “The accused had cheered for Pakistan and wrote ‘Pakistan zindabad’ on his Facebook status. This is objectionable. Local residents also claimed that he had burst firecrackers following India’s defeat,” said Chandi Nagar police station in charge Satender Singh. Police claimed that after initial investigation, it was found that the allegations against Ali were true. This comes close on the heels of five cases being registered against seven persons in Agra, Bareilly, Budaun and Sitapur for allegedly using indecent words against the Indian cricket team and celebrating Pakistan’s victory. The Pakistan cricket team had defeated the Indian side by 10 wickets in a Super 12 game in Dubai on October 24. On Sunday, speaking to a news channel in Ayodhya, Yogi said: “Agar Hindustan mein rahenge toh Hindustan ke prati natmastak hona padega…unhein har haal mein samman vyakt bhi karna padega….Bharat mein rah kar ke, Bharat ki dharti ka ann kha kar ke agar Pakistan ke gun gaoge to usi layak bana denge jis layak Bhartiya sena un logon ko banati hai (One has to owe his or her allegiance to Hindustan if you are living in this country. If you praise Pakistan while living in India and being nurtured here, you would face the same fate that Indian soldiers make of them).” Yogi maintained that he was not against anyone praising a particular player if he performed well. “Win and loss are part of the game. But if you start raising slogans in support of an enemy country, it won’t be tolerated. Such an act will come under the category of ‘desh droh’ (treason) and we will take strict action against them,” he said. Yogi said that his government had also taken action against people who supported the Taliban. “We will not let anyone take law in his hand. We will not let anyone spread anarchy and disorder in the state,” the CM said. Yogi also said that lord Ram was not associated with politics and was not a mean to retain power. “No one can imagine Bharat without Ram,” he said, asserting that it was victory of the BJP ideology that people who used to call Ram an imaginary figure have started accepting his existence. Yogi categorically termed the erstwhile “disputed structure” in Ayodhya and elsewhere a “sign of slavery” which “insulted the cultural identity” of the country. “Whoever opposed Ram got ruined,” he said, adding that Ram Rajya did not mean a religious state or rule of a particular community. “Ram Rajya for us means elevating the status of poor, providing them a house, electricity and gas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chanting-slogans-in-support-of-enemy-country-wont-be-tolerated-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87445176.cms||Pankaj Shah

He went on to state that it was Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who imposed a ban on an ideology and that the people of the same ideology are indulging in divisive politics now. #WATCH | Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute. Th… https://t.co/N3w2awI0kn— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) 1635736766000Repealing farm laws would be govt’s true tribute to Sardar Patel: AkhileshAkhilesh was addressing a public meeting in Hardoi on Sunday, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, to mark the start of the second phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ which thereafter reached Bangarmau in Unnao. In his speech, he praised Sardar Patel describing him as a man who had the knack for understanding the ground realities and take decisions accordingly. It was because of this quality that he was also known as the Iron Man ... the Loh Purush, he said. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to say: “Sardar Patel ji, Rashtra pita Mahatama Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Jinnah ek his sansathan mein padh kar ke bairistar banker kar ke aye the … ek hi jagah par padhai likhai ki unhone … woh baristar bane … unhoone ne aazadi dilai … unhe kisi bhi tarah ka sangarsh karna parda ho, to who peeche nahi hate … ek vichar dhara jispar pabandi lagai … agar kisi ne pabandi lagai thi … to lauh purush sardar patel ji ne us vichar dhara par pabandi lagane ka kaam kiya tha .. (Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Jinnah went to the same educational institute and became barristers … they brought freedom … they never shied away from struggles … there was one ideology that was banned … the person who banned that ideology was Iron Man Sardar Patel),” Akhilesh said. The SP chief went on to state that same people were now talking of uniting the country and are dividing people on lines of caste and religion. He further said Sardar Patel always wanted that farmers should prosper.  "If the government wants to pay tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the right earnest, then the three black farms laws should be repealed today (on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel) itself. We cannot forget the contribution of Sardar Patel post-independence. It was he who persuaded the princely states (which were then not part of India) to accede to India," the former UP CM said. He credited the farmers of handling the country’s economy and said if the farm laws will be implemented then the farming sector will land in the hands of the industrialists. Sharpening his attack on the UP chief minister, Akhilesh quoted a bureaucrat to claim that he does not know how to operate a mobile phone and said how would he then be able to understand the aspirations of today’s youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/on-patel-anniversay-akhilesh-yadav-invokes-jinnah-with-bapu-and-nehru/articleshow/87445299.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Covid committee for lifting of night curfew after November 8||BENGALURU: The Covid Technical Advisory Committee has recommended the lifting of the 10pm to 6am night curfew that will hopefully bring nightlife back to Karnataka after nearly seven months. Officials said the state government is likely to remove night curfew after November 8. This is the only curb in place right now. All other major restrictions having been lifted in the state. The committee has taken this decision in view of the reducing infection spread, including the impact of the new variant AY 4.2 which is a sub-lineage of Delta Plus. “The Covid situation has remarkably improved with the pandemic wave hitting the baseline. While it is important to ensure economic recovery along with the measures to contain the spread of pandemic, we have observed that this is the time for lifting the night curfew completely. We have advised it to be lifted from November 8,” committee chairman Dr MK Sudarshan said. The night curfew began from April 10, under the then Yediyurappa government and continues to be in force despite no strict implementation. The government is likely to lift it curfew after Deepavali which will be celebrated for three days from November 3. Confirming the committee’s recommendation, health principal secretary TK Anilkumar said the recommendation had been forwarded to the disaster management wing for its opinion. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar said the curbs, which are in force at present, will continue till November 8. The latest guidelines were issued on October 25. “There are virtually no curbs, except the night curfew, which is applicable till November 8. We will convene a meeting before that to deliberate the TAC recommendation and issue new guidelines based on the outcome of the meeting,” Ravi Kumar said. The move is expected to give much-needed respite to primarily the entertainment and hospitality sector. “With night curfew in place, multiplexes in malls are not able to have the night shows. Food outlets are shutting well before 10pm. Because of these two factors, the malls are missing out on the dinner crowd, which contributes to the major chunk of business, although the footfall has improved to 60% of normal level. If the night curfew is lifted, then business will return to pre-Covid levels and start growing from there,” said Manoj Singh, cluster director of Nexus Malls that runs PVR Malls. The committee, however, has warned the government against the possibility of people violating Covid norms. “We may need to examine the impact of the congregation witnessed at the Kanteerava Stadium as people thronged to pay their last respects to the late actor Puneeth Rajkumar. Its impact will be known in two weeks. We have asked the government to test people with symptoms of common cold and fever,” Dr Sudarashan said. Home minister Araga Jnanendra claimed an estimated turnout of 25 lakh at Kanteerava Stadium and the concern is that people violated Covid appropriate behaviour. The committee has recommended the government to ensure at least 1.1 lakh RT-PCR tests a day, of which 50,000 tests should be conducted in Bengaluru city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-committee-for-lifting-of-night-curfew-after-november-8/articleshow/87445422.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Rare procedure saves tuberculosis patient with spine trouble||BENGALURU: A rare procedure involving two surgeries by Bengaluru doctors has helped save the spine of a 36-year-old tuberculosis patient, which was on the verge of collapsing. Pushpa (name changed), a tuberculosis patient began experiencing severe back pain a year ago and was bedridden. She suffered weakness in lower limbs for the past few months despite being on anti-tubercular therapy and pain killers. Pushpa was suffering from a condition called Pott’s spine or Tuberculosis Spine where the doctors noticed vertebral (spine) body destruction in the mid spine area, marginal sclerosis and significant discitis (inflammation between intervertebral discs of the spine). There was also pus around the spine. Two expert surgeons, Dr Shashikiran (minimal access thoracic, gastrointestinal and general surgeon) and Dr Sanjeev MN, (orthopaedic surgeon), with help from consultant neurosurgeon from Ace Suhas Multispecialty Hospital, Jigani, Bengaluru, performed two surgeries — spine stabilisation and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) —on Pushpa. Dr Jagadish Hiremath, medical director of Ace Suhas Multispecialty Hospital and chairman at Aasra, said it is rare that both spine stabilisation and VATS are done on a single sitting as a therapeutic surgery. “Both are done independently but in this case, we needed both on a single sitting without which the condition would have aggravated, leading to spine collapse,” he said. Dr Hiremath said Pushpa’s condition was one of the oldest diseases known to mankind and has been found in Egyptian mummies dating back to 3400 BC. In cases where the patient suffers from Pott’s spine, the tuberculosis virus eats the bone in the spine which makes the spine weak and eventually collapse. The patient then develops Paraplegia, a condition where he/she loses sensation in the areas below the point at which the spine collapses, he said. After the surgeries that lasted for 11 hours, Pushpa will now be able to live a normal life. “It was a challenge for me to take care of my personal hygiene earlier. Now I can sit, stand and walk,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rare-procedure-saves-tb-patient-with-spine-trouble/articleshow/87445423.cms||---

This qualifying programme is different from LLM which is open only for aspirants who have a bachelor’s degree in law. Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy, vice-chancellor, made the announcement at the 29th convocation of the university. After its successful experiment with the five-year LLB programme 30 years ago, NLSIU will launch the programme, ‘Interdisciplinary 3-year LLB embedded in an experiential learning pedagogy’ in July 2022. “The university has got necessary approvals from the regulatory authorities and governing bodies. The inaugural batch will begin their education in July 2022. We have assembled the best faculty team to redevelop India’s oldest academic law degree, and we invite the brightest and the best graduates from any discipline to join us as we set out to radically transform legal education yet again,” the VC said. The institute will seek 12 more acres of land from the government to increase its student strength to 2,200 from the current 660 and faculty strength to 115 from 40. NLSIU plans to construct 90,000 sqft classroom and learning spaces, and 2,50,000 sqft of residential facilities. As announced in its Inclusion and Expansion Plan 2021-25, NLSIU will bring in reservation for OBC, EWS and women too, apart from the Karnataka domicile quota that is already introduced. “We also aim to develop a research faculty cadre to recruit scholars dedicated to path-breaking research, and re-organise research publications to achieve and sustain internationally peer-recognised scholarly output,” said the VC. The university is in the final stages of securing its largest capital grant ever: the Infosys Foundation has approved a Rs 5 crore grant to redevelop the Shri Narayan Rao Melgiri National Law Library to augment the capacity, redevelop and rezone the library and its surroundings, and adopt a digital learning and inclusion initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nlsiu-to-launch-3-year-programme-for-graduates/articleshow/87445425.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka resubmits development scheme for Chamundi Hills||BENGALURU: After a central snub, the Karnataka government has resubmitted its interest to secure funds for developing the religious tourism centre of Chamundi Hills in Mysuru under the Pilgrimage Rejuvenation And Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive (Prashad) and suggested new tourism circuits under the Swadesh scheme of the Union government. At the recently concluded southern region tourism and cultural ministers’ conclave, central tourism minister G Kishan Reddy and state tourism minister Anand Singh found each other at opposite ends over the reasons for Karnataka not being accorded funds under the two tourism schemes for development of state circuits. While Reddy had termed it a “failure” of Karnataka to provide the report, Singh and the state tourism department had said it was a “technical” rejection. With the event happening in Bengaluru and the ruling party being the same at both Centre and state, the two governments decided to “hurriedly” push through a fresh proposal for Prashad and push for new tourism circuits for Swadesh Darshan. With over Rs 100 crore of central government grants at stake, the schemes, if approved, are expected to help the Karnataka tourism sector, which is under distress due to the pandemic. “Imagine this. There are 6,000 hotel rooms in Mysuru which are practically empty because tourism in Mysuru is only a day affair. If the Chamundi Hills circuit is developed under Prashad, we expect it to help increase the distressed tourism sector,” said a tourism official, adding a similar impact will be seen in those districts and places which will be suggested under Swadesh. During the tourism conclave, the state made a detailed presentation of how it was going to develop the Chamundi Hills circuit at a cost of over Rs 50 crore. As per the presentation details accessed by TOI, the state government has proposed seven strategic ideas with unification of the temple precinct and the spiritual precinct, to be developed at the bottom of the Chamundi Hills. The government intends to beautify the precincts and upgrade facilities, restore and redevelop the Nandi statue, the Devi lake, improving the approach to the temple precinct with a guided walkway, centralised ticketing and parking facilities. The department has proposed a ‘Smart Heritage’ idea, which involves an interactive museum and interpretation centre narrating the history of Chamundi Hills and Mysuru with audio visual aid. The “Narratorium” will showcase the Wadiyars of Mysuru, souvenir collection stores and a children’s park with the theme of Mahisha and Mahishasura Mardhini. It will also have interactive signages, smart parking and information and weather alert systems. The new report also proposes a zero-carbon emission circuit with no vehicles to be allowed atop the hills and electric buses to ferry the devotees and people. “The central government officials were quite receptive to our presentation and we are hoping to secure the funding under Prashad soon,” said tourism secretary Pankaj Kumar Pandey. On the Swadesh scheme, the Karnataka government is waiting for the Centre to announce the Swadesh 2 programme under which it is likely to propose at least two to three new tourism circuits, including coastal, heritage and adventure sports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-resubmits-devpt-scheme-for-chamundi-hills/articleshow/87445427.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru foundation strives to turn non-Kannadiga to ‘naanu Kannadiga’||BENGALURU: Picture this: a Punjabi residing in Whitefield shaking his leg to a Kannada hit number and narrating how he finds an entire India residing in the city, while a Bengali speaks about his favourite travel destination in Karnataka—all in Kannada. On Kannada Rajyotsava, city-based Vimové Foundation plans to do just this – help non-Kannadigas converse and even perform in Kannada during their programme for Kannada Rajyotsava and premier a video to inspire others at 11am. The Vimové Foundation aims to build pride in Kannada language and inspire non-Kannadigas to learn Kannada. Vinay Shindhe, social entrepreneur, founder of the foundation and former IT leader, said they brought together 50 passionate non-Kannadigas to help them realise the journey from ‘Non-Kannadiga to Nanu Kannadiga and Kannad Gothilla to Kannada Baruthe.’ As part of the ‘Non-Kannadiga to Nanu Kannadiga, Nanna Bengaluru’, the participants will perform various activities based on a theme of their choice (art, music, history, food, travel, city, etc.,) for a short video of two to three minutes. “They will perform or speak in Kannada and give a summary of it in English at the end. They will be supported for this by Team Vimove Foundation,” he said. In addition to this, a conversation about Karnataka will also be hosted at various locations in Whitefield by the foundation for citizen engagement. The final recording of the participants and these conversations will be premiered on the foundation’s social media channels at 11am on November 1. To put this together and get people involved, Shindhe and his team reached out to various institutions, communities, public parks and IT Parks in and around Whitefield. “My aim is to build a sense of pride and responsibility among the non-Kannadigas, who have made Bengaluru their home. Celebrating Kannada Rajyotsava with Kannadigas is not difficult, but what will inspire everyone to share and spread our culture is bringing non-Kannadigas together,” he says. Shindhe, who lived in the United Kingdom for 10 years and returned to Bengaluru in 2009-10, said 98% of residents in Whitefield are non-Kannadigas and he felt the required cultural interventions is absent in the area to encourage people to be in touch with the local culture and language. That’s when he started the Kannada Rajyotsava celebrations in his gated community. “The success inspired me to start this on a bigger scale. Bengaluru belongs to all parts of the city, and this is also a way to claim the culture for our residents here and also share the economic and cultural contributions of Whitefield residents with the rest of the city,” he says. The foundation’s social media pages have already started hosting mini-lessons to help people learn basic conversational Kannada like purchasing vegetables or speaking with the auto driver, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-foundation-strives-to-turn-non-kannadiga-to-naanu-kannadiga/articleshow/87445429.cms||Farheen Hussain

The gold was seized in two separate cases registered in 2012 and 2016, respectively. The incident came to light during the inspection of the godown by a deputy director of Customs. Commercial Street police registered a case under IPC section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 420 (cheating) against two superintendents of Customs and two inspectors. Srinivas Gopal M, a superintendent of Customs (vigilance), is the complainant in the case. Gopal told police that the deputy director had inspected the godown of the department on July 15 and the officials concerned failed to produce 722 grams of gold seized in a case registered in 2012 and 1,042 grams of gold in connection with a 2016 case. The officials found that the gold was missing. “Two superintendents and two inspectors, who were in charge of supervising the godown, had misused the gold,” Gopal alleged. This is the second case registered against Customs officials in connection with disappearance of seized gold. In October, 2020, the CBI booked six Customs officials for disappearance of gold weighing 2.6kg from a warehouse at the airport in Bengaluru.

Pegged as the first-of-its-kind ride, they plan to end their journey outside Vidhana Soudha on Monday evening. HR professional Harshith BK, 30, from Kalyan Nagar has been a passionate rider with numerous road trips to his credit. He’s been yearning to do such a ride for many years to cover all corners of his home state and create the shape of the Karnataka map on his riding tracker. “I wanted to do it for Kannada Rajyotsava last year but Covid put the brakes on my plans. This year, there was no holding back,” Harshith added. Founder of Bikerstroop Bengaluru, a group of city-based bikers involved in road trips, Harshith inspired fellow Bengalurean and biker buddies Suraj Vasudeva, 24, and Surendra Karnataka, 42. They set out from Attibele early Saturday morning — Harshith on an Apache RR 310, Suraj on a KTM Duke 390 and Surendra on a KTM Duke Adventure 250. “We rode into Kanakapura Road and crossed Bandipur to reach Madikeri. We halted for a bit in Mangaluru and have reached Karwar,” Tavarekere-resident Suraj told TOI. Covering over 500km in a day, the trio is not taking many breaks and following a route along places on the state border. “It took me two months to chart places along the border and we’re following it,” said Harshith during a brief pitstop at Trasi beach near Kundapura. The bikers will travel through parts of Belagavi, Vijayapura, Bidar, Ballari, Chikkaballapura and enter Kolar to reach Bengaluru on Monday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-bluru-bikers-ride-along-ktaka-border/articleshow/87445433.cms||Petlee Peter

Six staff have been suspended on various charges, including rude behaviour with the public and collecting money from motorists without issuing receipts. There are 100 towing vehicles across 44 traffic police stations in the city. Each vehicle gets a different police station once in 45 days. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said one towing vehicle was found working without the knowledge of traffic police in Jayanagar recently. “In each vehicle, there should be an assistant sub inspector of the traffic police station concerned to monitor the lifting of vehicles from no-parking zone. But this particular vehicle was roaming around in Jayanagar without the ASI and towing away vehicles. We have pulled back the vehicle from the service for an inquiry,” he said.  He said the staffers were found behaving roughly with the public. “Two of them were found taking money from owners and releasing the vehicles without receipts,” he said. DCP (traffic-west) Kuldeep Kumar Jain said out of 32 towing vehicles that were pulled back from service, 30 belonged to his division. “Most of them had no cameras on the vehicle. The standard operating procedure (SOP) says one each camera should be fixed in the front and back portion of the vehicle, which can show wrongly parked vehicles. But many of them had no cameras. Also, some of them were found not reporting on time and not following other SOP measures like wearing uniform and courteous behaviour,” he said.  “We’ve spent Rs 10 lakh per towing vehicle and the government gives us Rs 350 per vehicle that is towed. We’ve monthly expenses up to Rs 1 lakh that includes salary of four staff, the driver and fuel. Sometimes, our bills get struck down for no reason. Our Earnest Money Deposit, Rs 40,000 per vehicle, paid during the tender is still stuck with the government,” saidowner of a vehicle .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cops-call-back-32-towing-vehicles-suspend-6-staffers/articleshow/87445435.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Though the government advocate made a submission that Shyam being convicted in three murder cases cannot claim parole and furlough as a matter of right and in view of his blameworthy track record, he may flee from the clutches of law, the court was not impressed. The court pointed out that the main purpose of releasing a serving convict on parole is to afford to him an opportunity to solve his personal and family problems and to enable him to maintain his links with the civil society. “One cannot forget that in matters like this, a humanistic approach needs to be adopted qua the convicts...,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed . Shyam’s wife Suma had approached the court after the authorities rejected her representation submitted in October, wherein she had prayed for releasing her husband on parole/ furlough for two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-says-every-sinner-has-future-grants-parole-to-convict/articleshow/87445439.cms||---

China has a number of players in the segment, as does Europe, including UK-based Dija, founded by former Deliveroo employees, Germany's Gorillas and Flink, and France's Cajoo. Zepto is expanding across Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi-NCR and will be launching in Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata over the next month. It has its tech office in Bengaluru and operations in Mumbai. Zepto has hired senior leaders from Flipkart, Uber, Dream11, Pharmeasy, and Pepperfry. Zepto is also hiring for roles across engineering, operations, marketing, and finance.Palicha said they are seeing a 200% growth month-on-month, with a monthly retention rate of 78%. “We want to provide a frictionless delivery experience. Our median delivery time is 8 mins 47 seconds. The magic of the model is how we pack and dispatch goods in under 60 seconds. The last mile is like any other delivery model,” he said.The venture operates on a hub-and-spoke model through a network of dark stores or retail distribution centres that caters exclusively to online shopping.Vohra, who is CTO, said, “The data speaks for itself – once we started delivering in 10 minutes, our NPS (net promoter score) shot up and has constantly remained at around 85, with a 50% week-on-week user retention rate, which shows the incredibly strong customer love for our product.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/q-commerce-venture-zepto-raises-60-million/articleshow/87445445.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Wabtec expands B’luru engineering capabilities||Bengaluru: Wabtec, one of the world’s biggest locomotive makers, has significantly expanded the engineering capabilities at its Bengaluru centre, adding to it a world-class global engineering lab to enable rail component design and performance. The centre is involved, among other things, in the development of the battery-electric locomotive, the first versions of which have just been launched in the US and Australia, and the hydrogen fuel-cell based locomotive, which is expected to be launched in a couple of years. Wabtec’s CTO Eric Gebhardt noted that 3D printing capabilities were added to the India centre last year. “That was a big step. Now, we’ll have the global engineering lab. It has capabilities that the whole globe will use, in areas like engine testing, fuel testing for engines, coupler testing for teams in Europe,” he said. Gopal Madabhushi, corporate vice president at Wabtec, said the Bengaluru centre, with 1,100 engineers, is the largest technology site for Wabtec. The new lab, he said, can house more than 30 complex test rigs. “It’s a Rs 50 crore investment we have made. We’ll move Rs 200 crore worth of equipment from around the world to this facility,” he said. The rigs will reduce locomotive development costs by helping to do tests before a product is put into the locomotive, so that minimal changes would be required thereafter. For the battery-electric locomotive, Madabhushi said the centre here works on the structural integrity of the electric battery, and the power electronics. “When you are coupling the locomotive, there is a large amount of load coming on to it. So the battery needs to be properly packaged and positioned, otherwise there will be cracks and the battery could fail and result in a fire. We also work on how the battery is charged, discharged, at what speed, what frequencies,” he said. Gebhardt said the great thing about battery-electric is the way braking regenerates the battery. “I rode the battery-electric locomotive in California, and over a 375 mile run, it discharged and recharged the battery three times. It’s that much energy. Every time you completely stop a locomotive, you have several thousand trailing tonnes behind it, so you are charging 20-30% of the battery,” he said. In a car or truck, that regenerative capacity is much smaller. The latest battery-electric version is expected to give 30% more fuel efficiency and 30% reduction in emissions compared to diesel locomotives. But it cannot handle very long distances by itself. Hydrogen will not have that issue. “It will replace the 5,000 gallons of diesel in a diesel locomotive. Right now, you have one battery-electric between two diesel locomotives (on long-distance freight locomotives). In the future, I picture a battery-electric between two hydrogen hybrids,” Gebhardt said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wabtec-expands-bluru-engineering-capabilities/articleshow/87445447.cms||---

It usually contributes about half of the total annual sales. The next big season is winter, which contributes about 25%.The company has forayed into energy drinks. Alchoholic beverage makers are increasingly getting into non-alcoholic beverages. AB InBev launched its first non-alcoholic beverages (zero alcohol beers for Budweiser and Hoegaarden) two years ago, while its larger competitor in India, United Breweries, did the same with the launch of Kingfisher Radler. Many young drinkers are veering towards non-alcoholic drinks globally. The energy drinks market in India is dominated by Red Bull with a 85% market share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ab-inbev-expects-beer-sales-to-improve-in-oct-dec-qtr/articleshow/87445449.cms||---

The move comes at a time when premiumisation has become a clear trend in the industry, driven by young and affluent Indians. “The portfolio reshape will happen through attention to our scotch and global portfolio. We will be looking to bring in more new brands from our global stable into the country,” Nagarajan said in an interaction with TOI, one of her first interactions with media after taking charge in July. Diageo’s prestige-and-above (P&A) segment, which includes drinks like Johnny Walker and Vat 69 whisky and Smirnoff vodka, contributes almost 75% to the topline annually, up from less than half five years ago. For the second quarter ended September, the segment was up 20% compared to last year. They also provide better margins. The focus started under the previous CEO, Anand Kripalu. Nagarajan said she wants to take it to the next level. “It was earlier a combination of moderate growth and margin expansion,” referring to the time when the company was trying to move out of Vijay Mallya’s shadow. “Now we are making a very big shift, to have double-digit profitable growth. We will accelerate our luxury and premium portfolio, play stronger in upper prestige, and also reshape the value in both lower prestige and mid-prestige segments," she said. That level of focus will not be given to the popular segment -- lower cost drinks such as Captain Morgan’s rum and Bagpiper whisky. “No, the innovation for premium will not be applicable for this segment,” Nagarajan said. The company is reviewing its popular brands. It may franchise more of it to third parties, or even sell some of those brands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ceo-usl-to-focus-only-on-premium-drinks-now/articleshow/87445452.cms||Avik Das
---||Bengaluru||To reduce error rates, AWS is working on fault-tolerant quantum computers||Bengaluru: Current quantum computing hardware is too error prone. So Oskar Painter, head of quantum hardware research at the AWS Centre for Quantum Computing, and his team have been fiddling with quantum bits and computing technologies to figure out a way to solve this problem.Quantum computers use the principles of quantum physics – the physics of the atomic and subatomic world – to perform computations. These computers use qubits, which harness the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state (a 1 or a 0 at the same time), as opposed to computers today that can only encode information in bits that take the value of 1 or 0. Painter says the current error rates in a quantum computer for each individual operation lies somewhere between 0.1% and 1%. “That means if I want to run an operation with 1 qubit, I’ll get an error if I run that operation just a 1,000 times,” he says. Errors occur because subatomic particles are very sensitive to heat and energy changes – could be the heat from the quantum machine, could be cosmic rays, strong electromagnetic radiation. Computers today can also make mistakes, for example cosmic-rays can hit a semiconductor chip and switch the value of the transistor to a 1 or 0 causing an error. This is much more common in quantum computersIf an error occurs the information will effectively be scrambled or lost. For example, a video file saved in a quantum computer might suddenly be unplayable because the qubits' values were changed due to external radiation of some sort.The beauty of quantum computing, Painter says, is that we don’t need a lot of qubits to do really powerful calculations. Over the last five years, companies have been able to build machines which have 50-100 qubits. That’s starting to approach a level where they can solve practical problems. “But if we want to solve some of the really hard problems that got everyone interested in quantum computers in the first place, we need something like a 1000 qubits, and we need to be able to perform about 100,000 to a million operations. Which is why we need error rates of about 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than what we currently have,” he says. Research has shown Painter and his team that while single qubits are unstable, grouping them together makes them much more stable. Such a grouping is called a logical qubit, and this has a lower error rate. “This is the whole idea behind what’s called a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Which means even though the physical hardware is noisy (qubits getting influenced by external forces), we can build in additional resources so that we can actually perform the computations we need,” he says. That’s the approach the team is taking to reduce errors.Richard Moulds, general manager at Amazon Braket (AWS’s quantum computing service), says the goal of the Braket service is to make it easy for customers to experiment with quantum computing technology. “Some machines have been made available publicly for some years, but often the wait times to get onto those machines can be long, while other machines have been confined to laboratories, universities or startups. It was hard for mainstream customers to get a feel for where this technology is,” he says.The Braket service provides a developer framework and developer tooling through a consistent user interface so that customers can literally design a quantum algorithm and then run it through a variety of different quantum hardware and simulators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/to-reduce-error-rates-aws-is-working-on-fault-tolerant-quantum-computers/articleshow/87445454.cms||Akhil George

The incident took place on October 25 when the girl had gone to the house of one Nurul Amin to buy a pair of earphones. The matter came to light on Sunday after she decided to share her experience. On October 29, the girl had filed an FIR against Amin, who runs a business of electronic items at his rented accommodation, alleging that the sexagenarian had hurled abuses at her for not wearing a burkha and pushed her out of his house. According to the FIR, Amin’s sons had also thrashed her father on October 28. Biswanath Chariali police station officer-in-charge Sanjib Roy said Amin and his two sons were picked up for questioning. They were released later in the day. “Nurul Amin has also lodged an FIR against the woman’s family, alleging manhandling,” Roy added. Talking to reporters, the girl said: “I had gone to Amin’s house wearing decent clothes, a pair of jeans, to buy earphones. He suddenly started scolding me. When I asked him the reason, he hurled expletives at me and pushed me out of his house. He asked me to visit his house in a burkha. How can a person force me to wear a burkha?

PS. I know Capt (Amarinder Singh) saab won’t mind my using this Punjab government ad from last year as none appeared today,” tweeted Jakhar, attaching newspaper advertisement published last year with photos of Indira Gandhi and then CM Amarinder Singh. In his second tweet, while referring to the controversy on appointment of one of the accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Jagdish Tytler, to the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Jakhar questioned, “Or is it a case of ‘once burned twice shy’ – in light of certain appointment two days ago?” Jakhar seemed to have reminded chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi about the fundamental issue that party leaders cannot forget the contributions of party stalwarts just because they find it politically inconvenient at a particular time and in this case may be fearing the backlash from the hardcore Sikh elements in the run up to the state assembly polls early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-cong-govt-forgot-indira-ex-party-president/articleshow/87445533.cms||---

A thinktank had written to the AG seeking his consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Owaisi for his remarks. Venugopal said it is true that the judgment of the top court also notes the fact that Savarkar has been found not guilty of Gandhiji’s murder in the criminal trial. However, if one reads the judgment as a whole, it is clear that the court was disinclined to go into the findings of the Justice Kapoor Commission of Inquiry, the AG said. “I may also point out that Justice Kapoor has retired as a judge of the Supreme Court in the year 1962, and hence was a retired judge when he was appointed as Commission of Inquiry in 1966. The statement made by Owaisi is relatable, therefore, to the finding of Justice Kapoor Commission and not the Supreme Court. "It would therefore be difficult to hold that he has committed contempt of the Supreme Court by suggesting and/or implying that a sitting judge of the Supreme Court had held that Savarkar was complicit in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi, which is completely contrary to factual reality,” the AG in his reply dated October 26 said. In a letter to Owaisi, the Abhinav Bharat Congress and its founder Pankaj Phadnis had referred to a Supreme Court judgment dated March 28, 2018, which stated, “The submission of the petitioner that Shri Savarkar has been held guilty for the murder of Gandhiji is misplaced”. “After this categorical assertion by the highest court of the country, where is the scope to suggest that Savarkar ‘murdered’ Gandhi ji, as you are reported to have said?” the thinktank had said in its letter to Owaisi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/savarkar-row-no-ag-nod-to-contempt-case-against-owaisi/articleshow/87445663.cms||---

The RTC is going to make a head start by introducing 100 electric buses but the road is too long for it to achieve the target within the stipulated time. The state government in its Electric Vehicle (EV) policy document, envisaged to convert more than 11,000 buses owned by APSRTC into electric vehicles by 2029 way back in 2018 but it has taken more than three years for the RTC to make a beginning. The state government set a target to convert 100 per cent of the APSRTC fleet in the top four cities into electric by 2024 in the first phase. Achieving this target would be next to impossible with the present operating conditions of APSRTC and the support it is getting from the government, according to insiders of the corporation. The problem areas for slow progress on the ambitious plan are the cost of the electric buses, lack of support from governments and infrastructure requirements. The cost of electric buses is still not within reach of APSRTC, according to Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, vice-chairman and managing director (VC&MD). He observed that with the cost of one electric bus, APSRTC can purchase three top end AC buses which serve the same purpose and are in much demand. Passengers do not bother about whether it is an electric bus or diesel bus as long as they get the desired comfort at cheap price. The demand for luxury buses continues to grow over the years and APSRTC is under pressure to increase buses in this segment. Without policy incentives for electric buses from central and state governments, the APSRTC is not able to acquire electric buses on its own. Another problematic area for APSRTC is that of lack of infrastructure and skilled manpower to handle electric buses. Tirumala Rao observed that they will have to train drivers, mechanics, and maintenance persons prior to acquiring electric buses. We also need to develop charging infrastructure, he said and added that without having proper infrastructure “we cannot go and invest aggressively on electric buses as of now”. “However, technology is emerging fast, and we are hopeful that the costs will come down in the near future where we can go for aggressive adoption of electric buses,” said Tirumala Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rtc-to-introduce-100-electric-buses/articleshow/87441429.cms||Srikanth Aluri

We also need to develop charging infrastructure, he said and added that without having proper infrastructure “we cannot go and invest aggressively on electric buses as of now”. “However, technology is emerging fast, and we are hopeful that the costs will come down in the near future where we can go for aggressive adoption of electric buses,” said Tirumala Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/rtc-to-introduce-100-electric-buses/articleshow/87454165.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The development took place after the Andhra Pradesh high court questioned the government for making the governor in his personal capacity a guarantor to the debts. Sources said the finance department has requested the bankers to revise the MoU by removing references to the governor as a guarantor to avoid legal issues. Although the government initially defended that all transactions of the government would be handled in the name of the governor as he is the constitutional head of the state, the government backtracked after the issue became a controversy involving a constitutional authority. The government has already secured a Rs 25,000 crore loan by escrowing the excise revenues as a counter guarantee. The state government’s decision to constitute APSDC exclusively to borrow monies from different financial institutions had kicked up controversy as several PILs were filed in the AP high court. The Union finance ministry had also sought clarification from the state government following a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on formation of SDC as it suspected that the new entity was constituted to bypass the consolidated fund and treasury rules. However, the state government condemned the allegations about the SDC. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave arguing on behalf of the state government in the HC said the petitioners were only trying to scuttle the state government securing loans for developmental works. “All the revenues are reflected in the consolidated fund as per the treasury procedure before being allowed for expenditure,” said a senior official with the finance department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/mou-for-apsdc-loan-likely-to-see-revision/articleshow/87441159.cms||Samdani MN

---||Patna||Hooch claims 66 lives in Bihar this year||PATNA: Spurious liquor has claimed at least 66 lives in 13 separate incidents across Bihar this year so far. Complete prohibition was enforced in Bihar in April 2016. The latest hooch tragedy happened in Rupauli and Vishahar Patti villages under Saraiya police station area in Muzaffarpur district. Eight persons died since October 28 night and four were still undergoing treatment at different hospitals. They had consumed spurious liquor on October 27 night. This is the third biggest hooch tragedy in the state this year in terms of deaths. Overall, six persons, including Santosh Kumar, have been arrested till now. Police said Santosh had been making hooch for the last one month. Raids are still on to arrest more persons involved the making and smuggling liquor. This is the third hooch poisoning case in Muzaffarpur since January and third in state in October. Earlier, five persons had died after consuming spurious liquor at Dargah under Katra police station area of Muzaffarpur on February 17 and 18 this year. Two more villagers died at Vishanpur Giddha under Maniyar police station area of Muzaffarpur again from hooch poisoning on February 26. One Ranjeet Kumar Singh (55) died and Aman Kumar (25) fell ill from hooch at Baikunthpur village under Rajapakar police station area in Vaishali on October 12. Four more persons died from hooch poisoning at Belauri under Guthani police station area in Siwan on October 24. At least 16 persons were killed in different villages under Town police station area of Nawada district just after Holi and then the same number of casualties was reported from Lauria in West Champaran in July. These were the top two hooch tragedies in state this year so far. Besides, two hooch deaths were reported from Bakhri in Begusarai after Holi, four in Kochas, one at Kargahar in Rohtas, two from Town police station area in Kaimur, three from Manjhaulia under Vijaypur police station area in Gopalganj, one from Barhi Bigha under Mufassil police station area in Nawada and one from Mukundpur village under Mahua police station area in Vaishali. The opposition has attacked the state government over its failure to enforce liquor prohibition in the state. RJD spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan said prohibition is only an eyewash and it has given birth to a parallel economy. “Liquor manufacturing, smuggling and home supply are common everywhere, especially in villages. Policemen also patronise those in involved in liquor smuggling, leading to the death of innocent people from hooch poisoning,” he added. However, JD(U) spokesperson Dr Suheli Mehta said CM Nitish Kumar is very serious on hooch incidents. “The CM has directed top police and excise department officers to take stern action in all such cases and act seriously against those involved in manufacturing liquor,” she said. Mehta said these incidents are painful and should not take place at any cost. “However, it can’t be stopped only by the government. Active participation of society is also required,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hooch-claims-66-lives-in-state-this-yr/articleshow/87439581.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: Three Ganga ghats declared dangerous||PATNA: The district administration has put up boards of ‘dangerous ghat’ at the entrance of LCT Ghat, Bans Ghat and Pahalwan Ghat after a preliminary inspection by Patna DM Chandra Shekhar Singh with the officials of water resources department (WRD). The DM said around 20-22 ghats are declared dangerous every year due to rise in water level, swamp and soil erosion. “During the inspection, we found that three ghats are not suitable for the Chhath rituals due to marshy land and too much of slush. The list of dangerous ghats will be released on Monday after getting the report from the WRD executives. Another round of inspection will be done before declaring the final list of dangerous ghats by November 5,” he told this newspaper on Sunday. Singh said the devotees will not be allowed to visit dangerous or unsafe ghats for Chhath Puja. Besides proper barricading along with signboards informing the devotees, security personnel will be deployed at such ghats to restrict the people. The Chhath festivities will begin with the nahay-khay on November 8, followed by ‘kharna’ on November 9 and the evening ‘arghya’ to the Sun God the next day. The Chhath festivities will conclude on November 11 with the morning ‘arghya’. The DM said 48 ponds and 92 ghats were being cleaned in the city areas. “As many as 95 control rooms and 131 auxiliary control rooms and watch towers will be set up for the safety of Chhath vratis during the rituals. Provision is being made to set up five temporary hospitals, 161 toilets and 265 urinals. Around 95 medical teams and 28 ambulances will be deputed at the Ganga ghats,” he said. Besides barricading, arrangements were being made for generator set, electricity supply, signage, public address system, changing room, drinking water, mobile medical team, deputation of NDRF and SDRF personnel. Local divers will also be near the embankments. The DM visited Patna zoo, BMP-5, Anisabad pond and Kachi Talab in Gardanibagh to review the preparations for Chhath. DMD instructions to DMs: State disaster management department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has issued instructions to all the DMs to make special arrangements for the safety of devotees and their family members at ponds and ghats. Agarwal said ghats and ponds should be barricaded with proper markings. “Security forces, magistrates, police force and other volunteers should be deputed at all ghats. Paramedical teams, along with doctors, should be deputed to ensure necessary medical arrangements at the ghats,” he said, adding that arrangements should also be made for ambulances at the ghats as per the requirement. “Control rooms will be operated uninterruptedly at the ghats. All the important telephone numbers should be available in the control rooms so that information can be immediately given to the district control room and state emergency operation centre at Patna. Private boats will be banned,” he aid. Agarwal also said there will be a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers from November 8 to November 11 on the banks of the river and approach roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-ganga-ghats-declared-dangerous-list-of-more-today/articleshow/87441128.cms||Faryal Rumi

As the hospitality business surges after the Covid-induced ebb, Rameswaram and Tuticorin have emerged as the new surfing destinations in Tamil Nadu. As for the less adventurous, there are the stately bungalows of Chettinad that once catered mostly to foreigners whose flow has dried up since last year. "Surf tourism in pockets of Rameswaram and Tuticorin has been gaining traction in the adventure circuit over the past couple of months," said Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, a customised holiday company. Monsoon may not be the right time to surf, but bookings are looking up. A better option in the rainy season, as a growing number of domestic tourists are finding, would be to experience the regal life in the traditional bungalows. Among the top picks are Chettinad bungalows in Karaikudi, Svatma in Thanjavur or Cocoa Lagoon in Pollachi. "Domestic Demand has gone up 330% for cottages and resorts in tourist places like Yercaud. Room prices are inflated by a minimum of 30% (i.e) from `10,000 to `13,000 per night, because even corporate companies are booking rooms, cottages and beach houses in ECR and OMR, to meet their colleagues and friends," says Ganapathy. The average stays are booked for two nights and three days. "Locked in at home for long, people have saved money and want to splurge at the first opportunity," says Ganapathy. Santhosh Kanna, VP-holidays, Thomas Cook (India), says there is a higher demand from the millennials for biking trips to Mamallapuram and Puducherry. Mamallapuram, Puducherry, Coonoor, Kodaikanal, Yercaud, Ooty and Yelagiri are sold out on weekends. Marquee hotels in Chennai and other cities are registering pre-Covid occupancy rates. "We are sold out on weekends and the occupancy is 80% on weekdays," says ITC Grand Chola general manager Zubin Songadwala. "Once the restrictions are off, business will be 20% more than that of 2019." Room tariffs are inching north as Covid sanitation cost is added to the bill, and nobody is complaining. Hygiene and F&B are the main attractions as families and friends set out on road trip vacations across the state. Ganapathy puts the increase in tariffs at 30% to 40%. That’s because the demand from pre-Diwali to Pongal is up to 70% more, says Daniel D’Souza, president & country head, SOTC Travel. "People are booking extended weekends in Puducherry. Young professionals come in for staycations and workations; multigenerational families are looking at villa stays in tea plantations of Coonoor," says D’Souza. Hotel managers say guests always ask if all the hotel staff have been vaccinated, and often the answer is yes. Says Shubhangi N, GM sales and marketing, GRT Hotels & Resorts: "There is rush for the Mamallapuram beach property and our resorts in Yercaud and Kodaikanal. Between wedding bookings and the holiday rush, we are having to refuse bookings every day." It’s not that deals are off. Says Thomas Cook’s Kanna: "Offers like buy one-get one companion offer and early bird family discount are driving bookings for the last quarter of 2021 up to Pongal." Ramesh Ramanathan, CMD, Sterling Holiday Resorts, says his resorts, which are mostly occupied by club members, are getting bookings from non-members this season. That more than 20% of guests are from other states may be an indicator that Tamil Nadu is ready to ride another crest of domestic tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/surf-the-rameswaram-waves-live-the-chettinad-dream-this-festival/articleshow/87439360.cms||---
---||Patna||Take steps to protect environment: Experts||PATNA: Even as the state government has, of late, taken several initiatives for conserving its natural environment and increasing its green cover, it is still far away from meeting the national standards. The vegetative cover of the state is less than 15% of its geographical area and a large segment of its population have not yet been provided with the minimum basic facilities of health and sanitation, say experts. They pleaded that necessary steps should be taken for protecting the urban environment from getting polluted and ensuring safe disposal of solid and liquid wastes. “Our old time-tested conservation practices should be brought back in practice for ensuring the sound health of all ecosystems,” they said. State water resources minister Sanjay Jha observed that the state has already been successfully implementing its Jal-Jivan-Harilyali scheme for meeting the various environmental needs all over the state. “Pure drinking water is likely to be made available in water-scarce regions like Gaya, Rajgir and Nalanda under the Ganga Water Lift Scheme,” Jha said, adding that work on intra-river linking projects is also going on in full swing and some projects are likely to come up soon. After the implementation of these projects droughts and floods problems would be solved. Jha further pointed out that dead water bodies are being restored and unauthorised construction on river beds and encroachments of water bodies for the purpose of settlement are also being removed. “The entire wetland cover of the state will be rejuvenated and restored,” he said. The principal secretary of state environment, forest and climate change, Dipak Kumar Singh, said that even though the state lacks adequate natural forest cover owing to its dense population and fertile agricultural land, steps have been initiated for providing scattered tree cover along road side and canals. Besides, the agro-forestry initiative of the government is also likely to increase the green cover of the state. “The rainwater harvesting structures are being installed in all government buildings with a view to raise the groundwater table in different parts of the state. Owners of private buildings will also be motivated to construct these structures in their premises,” he said. The Zoological Survey of India’s (Bihar region) joint director Gopal Sharma said, indiscriminate sand mining on river beds has been posing a serious threat to the river ecosystem. This unscientific mining must be stopped and steps should be taken for ensuring only need-based sand mining. “Besides, proper awareness for the conservation of environment should be created among the children by organising mass rallies and workshops at regular intervals,” he added. Patna University botany department teacher Birendra Prasad said, steps should be initiated for the restoration of all dead water bodies, including ponds, lakes, canals and wells and disiltation of dried rivers in the state. He also pleaded for an intensive bio-prospecting of the entire state so that our indigenous plants could be saved from extinction. Social scientist Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, facilities of clean water and sanitation should be provided to all, including the urban poor. In rural areas, every household should have a smokeless ‘chulha’ (stove) and a sound sewerage connectivity for leading a healthy life. “Smart city projects must also be implemented at the earliest and more cities of the state should be included under this scheme,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/take-steps-to-protect-environment-experts/articleshow/87439712.cms||B K Mishra

He was born on Republic Day in 1950 at Pandur in Tiruvallur district in an agrarian family, which migrated to Tamil Nadu when Andhra Pradesh was carved out of Madras Presidency. Anandan’s early schooling was a struggle as his mother tongue was Telugu while the medium of instruction was Tamil. The result: 45% in school and third class in BCom. And then fortunes changed. He joined Fraser & Ross thanks to T T Rangaswamy (father of T T Srinivasaraghavan, former MD of Sundaram Finance). "I finished chartered accountancy in February 1976 with the 50th rank all India," he recalls. "I suppose I am good with numbers, maybe it’s in my DNA." That April he joined the Murugappa group, which he served for more than 30 years before retiring as managing director of Cholamandalam Finance, the first from outside the family. "I have written my CV and attended an interview only once in my life." His second innings started after retirement in 2006. With his payoff, he picked up stakes in three companies _ Equitas Microfinance, Manapuram Gold Finance and Five Star Business Credits. "Life was boring. I wanted a more active role. So I told all three companies that I am exiting to start my mortgage lending business." He set aside some money for family and used the remaining `30 crore as capital to start Aptus Value Housing on January 26, 2010, his 60th birthday. "My lifetime earnings were invested here. Therefore, I could not take any risks, which is why I chose mortgage lending (which is secured and asset backed) and that too to the unattended segments as existing lenders then were focused on salaried borrowers," says Anandan. For the first three years, Anandan personally approved every loan proposal. "We didn’t outsource any operation. Everything was in-house, which gave us more control," he said. Over the last decade, the firm has disbursed `5,800crore to 72,500 customers with the lowest operating expenditure and the highest return on assets at 7%, double that of the closest competitor. "We will not be a pan-Indian player; we are a focused south Indian lender. We will not get wider, but will go deeper," says Anandan. "As growth was unbelievably fast, investors flocked in and we raised multiple rounds of funds and, earlier this year, our public listing happened on stock exchanges. When the shares were listed, our valuation was Rs 17,500 crore," he says. His investment of Rs 30 crore in 2010 had with 11 years of steadfast work resulted in shareholders getting a value of Rs 17,500 crore. "My holding is now Rs 4,450 crore," says Anandan. At 71, Anandan believes he has at least another four years on the job. "If I am not in office, I am at home. I plan to retire sometime and then I will look at some charity work," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/this-senior-citizen-scores-big-in-second-innings/articleshow/87439374.cms||---

The Bihar State Pollution Control Board has also announced a blanket ban on the sale and bursting of crackers in Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur till New Year, citing worsening air quality and its effect on those who had recovered from the Covid-19. In the remaining districts, only green crackers are allowed and that, too, for only two hours on Diwali. Sonu Kumar, a firecracker dealer in Patna City’s Khajekalan area, said no trader was ready to buy the crackers even though they were selling green crackers. “It takes months to prepare such a huge stock of firecrackers, but after the ban order, we are completely in dilemma. This year, we have bought crackers worth Rs9-10 lakh and even got the license to sell. Now, we have to talk to the manufacturing company about the goods — whether to sell in such districts where green crackers are allowed or return the items to the company,” he told this newspaper. “Previous year, we bought crackers worth around Rs6 lakh, but unfortunately, we returned the items to the company and got only Rs4 lakh in return. We suffered a loss of Rs2 lakh. With our small business, we are just trying to make some money as these fireworks will not harm the environment,” Kumar said. Another dealer at Gurhatta was also facing a similar situation. Its proprietor Ajeet Singh urged the state to allow at least the sale and use of green crackers. He said they will face huge losses for the second consecutive year as crackers worth lakhs of rupees have already been stocked by them. Sarfaraz Hussain, manager of a firework dealing shop at Paschim Darwaza, said they have bought little stock of green crackers after the loss last year. “I have no idea what to do with the stock of my firecrackers. Maybe, I will distribute them among people or just throw away because the company did not give any refund,” he said. “Green firecrackers do not cause pollution and the state should allow it as bursting crackers during Diwali, which is considered a shagun. The state should put some restrictions like fixing a time schedule to burst crackers. Crackers are not banned in weddings or Durga Puja, then why in Diwali,” said Anuj, manager of a firecracker shop at Patna City’s Yadav Market. As per the NGT’s order, Rs10,000 fine will be realised on selling any kind of fireworks. The fine for those bursting or allowing the use of firecrackers is Rs 2,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/firecracker-traders-stare-at-losses-for-2nd-consecutive-year/articleshow/87441186.cms||Faryal Rumi

It was the first official screening on the 75x42 feet screen installed by the Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) by utilizing the funds to the tune of Rs6.98 crore. CM Nitish Kumar had inaugurated the mega screen in September last year, but no screening was done due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Most government schools have devised different means to call students to stick to the 50% strength outlined by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Last week, DDMA and Delhi government had given the go-ahead for reopening schools for junior students from November 1. Primary class students had not been to school since March 2020. On September 1, schools reopened only for students of classes IX to XII. Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector 8 of Rohini, which has nursery to Class XII, has called students and their parents on Monday to get their consent. “Due to the festive season, proper attendance will be seen only after Diwali. I have invited parents of students of primary classes to take part in an orientation. While 50% of the students will come tomorrow, the rest will come another day,” said AK Jha, principal of the school. Each class has been allotted three hours of study. The first shift will be from 8am to 11am and the next till 2pm. At Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Ambedkar Nagar, one class has been divided into half. The school caters to students of classes VI to XII. Only around 450 government schools have classes from nursery. Aruna Anand, principal of the school, said, “While 50% of students of classes VI to XII will come for three days, the rest will come for three days after that.” Government Boys Senior Secondary School at Ghitorni has decided to call junior students from Tuesday. Sunil Kumar Joon, an English teacher at the school, said, “The pre-boards for classes X and XII are ongoing. Junior classes will come only from Tuesday as we will not be able to accommodate all of them together.” “The construction of the new school building has been completed. We have been told that it will soon be handed over to us. With the new four-storey building, following social distancing norms will not be a problem,” added Joon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-schools-brace-to-welcome-junior-students/articleshow/87441856.cms||---

The vice-president shared his experience of visiting the 118-year-old library on social media. “Efforts of the Rammohan Library founders should be applauded. They collected funds to buy a piece of land for construction of this library, which paved the path for library movement. Many eminent scholars and academicians spent time here and learnt many things. Mahatma Gandhi visited this library three times and all those memories made me proud,” he said. The vice-president garlanded the photograph of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the latter’s birth anniversary and donated Rs 2.5 lakh on behalf of Swarna Bharat Trust, run by his daughter Deepa Venkat, and Rs 2.5 lakh on behalf of Muppavarapu Foundation, which is run by his son M Harshavardhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vp-visits-118-year-old-library-in-vijayawada/articleshow/87441551.cms||---

The South Goa planning and development authority (SGPDA) and the Greater Panaji planning & development authority (GPPDA) have kept the ODPs of the planning areas for viewing. The planning bodies have also given a two-month period for the inputs regarding change of land use and zone change. The two planning bodies had submitted the draft ODP-2031 in September to the town and country planning board, which granted provisional approval for the draft ODP-2031 in October. The BJP government made a similar move in December 2016, when the SGPDA opened up the Margao and Ponda ODP. The move had invited allegations of corruption and favouritism as it came just months before the 2017 state assembly elections. Copies of the draft ODP-2031 of the Kadamba Plateau, Margao, Panaji and Ponda planning areas have been kept for inspection at the offices of the SGPDA and NGPDA apart from the offices of the municipal bodies of the respective areas. “This authority is informing and requesting the public concerned and inviting objections, if any, in writing, with respect to the draft ODP-2031 for a period of two months,” said the public notification. The two-month period is expected to end by December-end, while the announcement for the state elections is expected in early January. “The general public is further hereby informed that this authority shall hear the general public who submit such objections and also who request for being heard in the office of the Greater Panaji planning and development authority with prior notice,” said the NGPDA in a notification. Incidentally, the present ODP was supposed to have taken care of the planning requirements till 2028, but has been opened up again as per the decision of the state government. The NGPDA has already notified the ODP 2030 of the Arpora-Nagoa-Parra planning area while in November 2020, the TCP approved the draft outline development (ODP) plan for the Mormugao planning area.

With a record 3.2 lakh active openings across sectors, October registered a 12% growth over September this year. The growth, on a year-on-year basis is 16%. The report, shared exclusively with TOI, says the number for active openings for October takes the active jobs count to nearly 30% higher than the volume register in pre-Covid months. What’s driving the hiring volume is organisations servicing current demand and also taking into account the capacity expansions for the upcoming year. To fill in vacancies, organisations are said to be relying on a healthy mix of entry level and lateral hiring. On the other hand, startups are fuelling the lateral hiring markets with attractive salary packages for experienced professionals. Entry-level openings formed the bulk — 31% — of the overall volume and was up 1%. Mid-junior openings (28% of volume) grew by 13% followed by mid-senior roles (23% of volume) at 11% growth in volume. While this is the strongest point in a rising curve so far, Xpheno’s co-founder Kamal Karanth, said the best is yet to come. “It’s not surprising to see the active job openings at an all-time high arising out of the new digital world’s pent-up demand. However, the best is yet to come as many traditional sectors like manufacturing, construction, BFSI & hospitality & travel industry haven’t come back to their pre-Covid peak yet,” said Karanth. “The average active jobs funnel over the last 4 months has expanded by nearly 45% compared to the funnel in the same period last year. This is a strong sign of recovery and consistent positive hiring action across key sectors,” said Karanth. Multinational companies (MNCs), said Karanth, are seen contributing to active jobs in the last quarter of the year that’s otherwise known to be a slow hiring quarter. Aggressive and active hiring funnels from MNCs is a clear indicator of the business demand and talent needs for the next year. Some of the prominent employers with active openings for the month were Accenture, IBM, Siemens, Bajaj Finserv, EY, SAP, Wipro, Shell, JP Morgan Chase, Oracle, Kyndryl, Google, Amazon, Zeta, Paytm and Byju’s. “We haven’t hit the peak of active jobs yet as the technology industry is still driving the bulk of the demand. However, an inclusive job market is likely to return in the last quarter of this fiscal when a higher vaccination rate would encourage previously affected sectors like hospitality and travel, construction, manufacturing and BFSI to open up further,” he said. What strengthens the long-term confidence among employers in onboarding permanent headcount, full time opportunities contributed to 94% of overall active jobs. The slice of full-time opportunities has grown by 67% this fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/white-collar-job-openings-rise-to-20-month-high/articleshow/87442724.cms||Namrata Singh

The jump in the value of FPI holding is mainly due to the recent rally in the stock market and the increase in the number of companies they have invested in, which was at 1,370, also an all-time high, a report by Prime Infobase said. According to Pranav Haldea, MD, Prime Database Group, of which Prime Infobase is an arm, the increase in value of FPI holding to Rs 54.7 lakh crore showed a 12% jump during the September quarter primarily due to a buoyant secondary market. However, net inflow from FPIs was at just Rs 3,928 crore during the quarter, resulting in a slight decline in their total holding to 21.5% at the end of the quarter from 21.7% as of end-June 2021. Unlike FPIs, mutual funds (MFs) reversed their ownership trend during the previous quarter. After five quarters of consecutive decline, holding of MFs in companies listed on the NSE increased to 7.36% as on September 30 from 7.25% as on June 30. The increase in MFs’ share came on the back of a Rs 38,221-crore net inflows during the quarter, Haldea said. In value terms too, MFs’ holding went up by 14.8% to an all-time high of Rs 18.8 lakh crore as on September 30 from Rs 16.3 lakh crore as on June 30. Insurance companies too followed the FPIs, the report noted. During the previous quarter, holding of insurance companies declined to a six-year low of 4.81% from 4.89% as on June 30. In value terms though, it went up to an all-time high of Rs 12.3 lakh crore. The aggregate holdings of domestic institutional investors (DII), which includes MFs, insurance companies, banks, financial institutions and pension funds also recorded a slide to a three-year trough at 13.12% as on September 30 from 13.19% as on June 30, despite net inflows of Rs 31,237 crore during the quarter. In value terms, DII holding went up to an all-time high of Rs 33.4 lakh crore, the report noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/value-of-fpi-stake-in-indian-cos-at-record-rs-55-lakh-crore/articleshow/87442657.cms||---

Over 20 lakh e-mandates have been registered by cardholders with a host of merchants. According to payment industry sources, the banks whose credit cards are eligible for new standing payment mandate include SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, American Express, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, HSBC, RBL Bank, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Several banks have enabled the mandate for both debit cards as well as credit cards. Automatic recurring payments also require the merchant to be on-boarded to the new e-mandate framework. The compliant businesses include most of the OTT (over-the-top) streaming platforms, private life & general insurance companies, global IT giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and McAfee, as well as some edtech companies. Interestingly, Indian cardholders who have registered with overseas service providers, having payment gateways abroad, are not subject to the new rules. This is because the RBI has no jurisdiction to impose second-factor authentication in those markets. It is up to the customer to disable international transactions on their cards. What has facilitated the fast on-boarding of merchants is IT solutions like SI Hub developed by BillDesk and Mandate HQ developed by Razorpay. However, some domestic banks like Canara Bank & Punjab National Bank and Standard Chartered Bank were until last week in the process of making the necessary system changes. According to the sources, card-based recurring transactions are 2.5% in terms of the number of transactions and 1.5% in terms of the value of the total card payments done in the country. On average, approximately 75% of domestic recurring transactions are of values of up to Rs 5,000. The corresponding figure for cross-border recurring transactions is approximately 85%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-with-95-cards-implement-rbi-order-on-recurring-payments/articleshow/87442781.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Fuel prices increase by over Rs 8 per litre in October||PATNA: Petrol and diesel have become costlier by Rs8.45 and Rs 8.30 per litre in October after the hike by 33 and 36 paise per litre, respectively, on Sunday. It is the highest hike in a month since May last year. Petrol was sold at all-time high of Rs 113.31/litre and diesel at Rs 104.91/litre in Patna on Sunday. According to the executives of retail fuel stations, the petrol and diesel prices increased on 24 days in October. Vijay Kumar, sales executive of a fuel station near Gandhi Maidan, said the daily sales had dropped by 15-20% this month compared to September. “Customers who used to get the tank of their vehicles full have reduced the fuel amount,” he said. The skyrocketing fuel prices are burning a hole in the pockets of the common man. Mohan Kumar, a cab driver, said driving taxi was no longer a profitable business as his earnings declined while the maintenance cost of car increased with rise in fuel prices. “Despite having increased the rate by Rs30 to 60 per ride, I am still facing losses. Everything is costlier and it is hard to run the family,” he said. Somesh Chatterjee of Lodipur guessed the fuel prices would be more than Rs120 per litre. “The government is making all the money while putting the burden on common people,” he complained. “I have to think twice before taking out my scooty. I have been avoiding outing with my friends after college hours. I spent Rs1,150 on petrol in September and almost Rs1,500 in October,” said Jyoti Sinha, a college student and resident of Anisabad Colony. Pankaj Kumar of Kadamkuan said he was now planning to get a bicycle as maintenance of his two-wheeler was getting impossible. “In Patna, too, petrol pumps should stop sales like in Kolkata for 30 minutes to protest fuel prices hike,” he said. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, said the fuel prices have shown an upward trend because of increase in crude oil prices. “The international prices are expected to remain high due increase in global demand. In the short run, only option with the governments is to reduce taxes to provide relief to the consumers. It will also boost demand in the economy. The resulting fiscal deficit due to lower taxes can be compensated by government borrowing and disinvestment,” he said. “Similarly, there is pressure on LPG prices, which also increased in recent times. Unlike petrol and diesel, LPG prices are still regulated and the under-recoveries or losses have increased and so has the subsidy burden on the government. Therefore, the tax policies need to be carefully calibrated to support the demand in the economy,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fuel-prices-increase-by-over-rs-8-per-litre-in-oct/articleshow/87441077.cms||Faryal Rumi

Irate villagers not only blocked NH-107 near Rampur village under the Murliganj police station area for hours but also set houses and bikes on fire of the suspected accused. The blockade continued till late evening which was lifted after the intervention of senior police officers. Manoj Swarnakar, a cousin of the slain youth said, “Pappu worked as an employee of a local jewellery dealer Deepak Kumar, son of Ramchandra Yadav, who used to sell gold and silver made ornaments to local retailers. Few days back while returning home, the victim was robbed of some ornaments near Jorgama village. The incident was informed to the dealer but he did not lodge any complaint with the police and started mounting pressure on Pappu to pay the price of the jewellery lost.” Deepak also forcibly took away Pappu’s bike to his house and publicly threatened him of dire consequences only four day back. On Tuesday, Pappu was called by Deepak at his house from where he did not return even the next day. His family members inquired Deepak about his whereabouts who also pretended to be unaware of it. Some women farmers located the decomposed body of the victim in a nearby bamboo bust in the village on Saturday and informed other villagers. The information spread like wild fire and soon villagers thronged the spot. On seeing Pappu’s body, they grew angry and vandalized properties of Deepak and subsequently blocked the road. “One person has been arrested in this connection so far,” said Murliganj PS SHO Akhilesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/madhepura-villagers-go-on-rampage/articleshow/87439916.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes ex-min’s order to issue liquor licence to city club||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has quashed and set aside an order by former state excise minister Chandrashekhar Bawankhule directing the collector (Mumbai suburbs) to issue liquor licence to a club in Kandivli (west). “The minister could not have issued such a cryptic order. He ought to have assigned reasons,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni on October 25. It heard a PIL by activist Reji Abraham challenging Bawankhule’s September 20, 2019 order passed on a revision plea by Kamla Vihar Sports Club. The PIL said the club is built on 2.5 acres of open space reserved for a recreation ground. In 1997, the BMC let it out under its caretaker policy to develop a garden and recreation centre, and also gave permission to develop a sports complex with a swimming pool. When the sports complex was not handed over to it, BMC terminated the agreement and litigation ensued. Meanwhile, Abraham moved the Lokayukta which in May 2017, directed the principal secretary to examine whether the club’s permit room licence can be suspended. The collector on May 16, 2017, suspended the licence. The club then moved the HC, saying the order was passed without hearing it. The HC directed the collector to hear the club. On August 3, 2017, the collector directed closure of its permit room. The excise commissioner upheld this order. But Bawankhule set aside the collector’s order. Abraham’s advocate Vijay Kantharia argued that the order is wholly illegal and the then minister has not given reasons for allowing the grant of liquor licence.  The judges, after perusing the agreement, remarked that it specifically prohibits sale of alcohol or running a permit room in the sports complex. The club’s advocate Surel Shah said it has 4,000 members, and it will not cater to outsiders. He, however, agreed with the judges that the matter could be heard afresh by the revisional authority. Setting aside Bawankhule’s order, the judges relegated the matter before the revisional authority to decide it expeditiously and within 6 weeks. The judges were told by state’s advocate that the minister’s powers are delegated to the secretary to conduct revision proceedings. The judges have allowed Abraham and BMC to be heard by the revisional authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-quashes-ex-mins-order-to-issue-liquor-licence-to-city-club/articleshow/87443238.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Sharan, who inaugurated a 100-bed ward named as Covid-19 Care Unit constructed under CSR project of the ICICI Foundation on Saturday, said the proposal for setting up another ward for the treatment of cancer will be submitted by the health department to the cabinet for its approval. The chief secretary directed the health department’s additional secretary, Kaushal Kishore, who was present on the occasion, to initiate the process at the earliest and submit the proposal for cabinet’s nod. At present, there is a 150-bed cancer ward, a unit of the Tata Memorial Institute, at the SKMCH. Earlier, the chief secretary inaugurated a 100-bed ward at the SKMCH for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. It will also provide the facility of chemotherapy to the patients infected with cancer. It has been built under the CSR project of the ICICI Foundation. The ward will have interrupted supply of oxygen. The ward will function under the supervision of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre. The Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) clinic, the first of its kind in the state, will cater to the need of the cancer patients, who earlier had to visit Mumbai or Delhi to avail the facility. ICICI Bank zonal head Nilesh Ranjan and regional head Shiv Patnaik said the Covid Care Unit will play an important role in providing proper treatment to the patients infected with the virus. Tirhut divisional commissioner Mihir Kumar Singh, Muzaffarpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar and deputy development commissioner of Muzaffarpur, Ashtush Dwivedi, were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/350-bed-ward-for-cancer-patients-at-skmch-soon/articleshow/87439785.cms||Ramashankar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Boy dies after falling into stream||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 10-year-old boy died on Sunday after he slipped and fell into an overflowing stream near his house while walking along with his father. The tragedy occurred near Kudappanakunnu Devi Temple under Mannanthala police station limits. Dev, son of Sreelal, who is an engineer at Doordarshan Kendra here and Divya S Kumar of Rajasaras house at Kudappanakunnu, is the deceased. According to police, the mishap occurred around 4.30 pm on Sunday when Sreelal took Dev out to go to a shop nearby. Dev reportedly slipped and fell into the stream. Owing to the incessant rains, the current was strong in the stream. Dev was swept away a few feet before people in the vicinity pulled him out of the stream. Though he was taken to the hospital, he died around 6 pm. The police said the stream was not deep enough for a child to drown. But, the water might have entered the boy's lungs owing to the heavy flow. Dev was a child with learning disabilities and was a lower primary student of Government Higher Secondary School, Pattom. He is survived by his parents, twin brother Devesh and elder sister Diya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/boy-dies-after-falling-into-stream/articleshow/87441863.cms||---

The stress will be on checking vehicles at odd hours, and not just limit this to the night restriction period. Cops say this will include special night checks and mandatory searches, especially on roads linking the city with the firecracker hubs of South 24 Parganas. Two special teams with 11 personnel along with a Pollution Control Board, official have been prepared to carry out raids at major godowns in the city in two shifts each day. So far cops have seized 3080 kg of firecrackers. Police have also announced they will deploy men on the roads for Kali Puja duty between November 3 and 7, with maximum deployment on November 4-5. Multiple teams, comprising six local officers each, will monitor markets. Eighteen teams will carry out surprise checks across the city in each of the nine divisions. Reserved Force personnel - including from the KP combat unit - will be accompanying these teams wherever necessary. On Kali Puja day, 16 DCPs will take charge of four police stations each. Cops will be monitoring the situation in the remote corners of their respective police stations in police jeeps and bikes. A total of 115 autos have been hired from 4 pm for 48 hours leading up to Diwali to reach those bylanes which bigger vehicles can’t access. Police control room vehicles and heavy radio flying squads will be criss-crossing the city to try and stop the use of firecrackers and to ensure the mandatory 5m distance from Kali Puja pandals is maintained . Cops have identified locations, including Phoolbagan, Behala, Sarsuna, Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Ballygunge, Lake Gardens, Patuli, Jadavpur, Entally and Cossipore, that will have special teams monitoring them. A WBPCB hotline is also likely to be maintained, besides the dedicated police lines.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Caste-based NREGA payments causing friction’||MUMBAI: This year, the Centre segregated the payment of wages under the National Rural Employment Guarantee (NREGA) scheme according to caste. A new study which analysed 18 lakh wage payments to workers has found that payments by the Centre to SC and ST workers were done quicker than to those in the “Others” category. However, the result was far from ideal. The segregated payments tripled the work-load of block level officials and resulted in caste-based and religious tensions among workers, the study found. The study analysed 18 lakh NREGA fund transfer orders across 10 states. It found that 46% of the fund transfers from the Centre to workers from the SC category was completed in the mandated 7-day period and 80% of the payments to SCs was done in 15 days. This was 37% and 63% for STs. For the ‘Other’ category, only 26% payments were completed by the Centre in 7 days and 51% payments in 15 days. The study analysed fund transfer orders for the scheme between April and September this year. While affirmative action is important, caste-based segregation of wage transfers to workers is not the answer, says the study. “This is at odds with the universal nature of the programme. Caste-based payments create very little protection for the marginalised communities. On the contrary, it has increased the work of block officials and fractured communities across caste and religious lines,” says Rajendran Narayanan, co-author of the report and a faculty member of the Azim Premji University. The study titled, ‘Heavy Wait: Wage Payment Delays in NREGA by the Central Government across Caste and Payment Type’ was conducted by LibTech India, a group of social scientists, engineers and data scientists aiming to improve transparency in public service delivery in the country. In some places where a work group had members of all castes but dalits got paid earlier than those of other castes, it reportedly led to accusing some local government functionaries and NREGA mates of being partial. In some places where the ‘Other’ category comprises largely of Muslims, it reportedly led to religious tensions as well, said the study. The study also revealed the extent of wage payment delays in the scheme, saying that as many 71% of the payments from the Centre to workers accounts were delayed beyond the mandated 7-day period. In this time period, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh and Madhya Pradesh faced the highest delays from the Centre. The study found that 45% of the wage payments to West Bengal in its sample was pending as on October 13. No wage payments in West Bengal had been processed between August 15 and October 13. It also highlighted rejected wage payments due to technical errors. Wage payments worth over Rs 4 crore were rejected in the sample, affecting nearly 35,000 job cards. Chhattisgarh had the highest percentage of rejections, affecting 21,537 job cards. “For Aadhaar and account-based payments, the rejection rate is approximately the same at 3%. However, resolving Aadhaar related rejections is significantly harder, and often even block/bank officials do not know how to do it,” the study says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-caste-based-nrega-payments-causing-friction/articleshow/87443339.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Delhi||Terminal 1 of Delhi airport back in business, flight operations resume after 18 long months||NEW DELHI: With operations resuming at Terminal 1 of IGI Airport on Sunday, 133 flights had landed and taken off till 6pm. The airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), had earlier informed TOI that about 200 flights would be handled throughout the day. “We resumed flight operations at T1 after over 18 months of its closure with IndiGo and SpiceJet domestic flights. The first flight to arrive was the Durgapur-Delhi SpiceJet flight (SG-226) at 1am. The first flight to depart was Delhi-Mumbai Indigo flight (6E-171) at 1.49am,” said a DIAL spokesperson. No flights were handled at T1 since March 25, 2020, when domestic flights were suspended due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Flyers saw a very different T1 due to the ongoing expansion plan. Now, a significant part of the terminal lies out of bounds for passengers. The terminal saw a reduced footfall of passengers and security staff deployment was 70% compared with the pre-pandemic days. “With T1 shrinking to half its area for expansion works, the number of barricades and quick response teams (QRTs) are fewer in number compared with the pre-pandemic days. Today, we only deployed two QRTs and set up two barricades. The number of security staff has also seen a stark reduction,” said a CISF official. The security measures in place at T1 included queues to ensure social distancing, deployment of queue managers, floor markings, allocation of alternate seats and installation of automatic hand sanitiser at various points. Usually, 4-5 conveyor belts were used at the terminal for handling baggage, but only two were operational on Sunday. There were only four entry gates, security check gates and boarding gates open against eight earlier. Also, there were only two check-in islands and four queues for the security check of passengers. Mohit Thakur, who was flying to Ahmedabad on an evening flight, said, “I was constantly being updated via email and SMS about my IndiGo flight being diverted to another terminal. This might be day one of T1’s operations, but I’m having a hassle-free journey.” “My Delhi-Mumbai flight scheduled at 8pm was earlier scheduled to take off from T2. But I was informed in advance about it being diverted to T1,” said another flyer, Amit Karat. IndiGo volunteers guiding the passengers at T1 departure gates said eight out of 68 flights were diverted from T1 to other terminals. “We had to face a little chaos with the flight diversions, but we successfully escorted the passengers to the other terminals in cabs.” However, the experience of flyers of SpiceJet, which was to operate 65 flights from T1, was not smooth. Several passengers claimed that every fourth flight at T1 was getting rescheduled by several hours. Monica Pandit, whose Pune-Delhi flight at 4pm was rescheduled to the next day, said, “Despite rescheduling our flight, the airline has not provided us a hotel room. We have an infant with us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/t1-back-in-business-flight-ops-resume-after-18-long-months/articleshow/87443349.cms||Zumbish
---||Delhi||3 Delhi corporations may make all properties up to 50 sqm free from tax burden||NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of a similar move by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the south and east civic bodies are also contemplating waiving off property tax for plots up to 50 square metres. A south corporation councillor stated that the civic agency might even exempt plots of up to 100 square meters from paying taxes.. Earlier in August, north corporation had passed a proposal in the House, stating that properties of 50 square metre in size or less in residential areas will be exempted from the tax net. Former mayor Jai Prakash had first brought in the proposal that all residential properties up to 50 square metres, including those in approved colonies, rural areas and even unauthorised ones, may be exempt from paying house tax. “Delhi government rules prohibit only one corporation making this change, we have talked to our councillors in the other two corporations and there is consensus on this matter that all of us should come together and waive off property tax for plots up to 50 sqm. This is a people friendly move in these tough times” said Prakash. South corporation, in fcat, plans to go a step further. “We are even planning to increase the area up to 100 square metres and provide relief to the economically weaker sections of Delhi. The discussion is going on in the party, but the final decision is yet to be made” said Indrajeet Sehrawat, leader of the house, south corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-corpns-may-make-all-properties-up-to-50-sqm-free-from-tax-burden/articleshow/87441914.cms||---

A day ago, the police had conducted raids at shops in the proximity of schools and seized huge amounts of banned tobacco products that were smuggled from other states. Numerous cases were registered at all police stations in this regard. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law & Order and Traffic) Vaibhav Saxena said that steps will be taken to cancel the trade license of the offenders booked during the raids. ''The safety of students was always our main priority. But in the past, it meant ensuring they are safe on roads and away from the reach of social evils such as drug peddlers and eve teasers, this time we face an additional danger in the form of Covid,” said The DCP. Hence, the cops deployed on traffic duty near schools are given an additional task to ensure that students are at safe distance from not just vehicles, but from the public too. Anticipating a sudden increase of traffic volume on the city roads, the police have devised special plans to manage traffic. They have identified pressure points in the city based on the presence of schools nearby. More officers will be deployed in and around these pressure points. Personnel of the city traffic wing, local stations, control room and pink patrol squads will manage the traffic at pressure points. At other places, the personnel of local stations will manage the traffic. All officers deployed will be provided with wireless communication devices to ensure smooth coordination of activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/banned-tobacco-products-seized/articleshow/87441927.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Road fatalities in Gujarat at 10-year low in 2020||AHMEDABAD: Call it the positive side effect of Covid-19 pandemic, but the lockdowns and subsequent restriction on movements drastically reduced the road fatalities in Gujarat. In fact, with drop of 20.7% compared to the cases in 2019 (8,440), it was the decade’s lowest death number for the state at 6,693. The data was shared in National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publication ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2020.’ While it was the lowest fatalities at least since 2011 for Surat and Vadodara that recorded drop of 36% and 7.5% respectively, Ahmedabad and Rajkot recorded drop of 20% and 22% - their lowest since 2013. However, on the other hand, the state recorded increase in pedestrian deaths – from 728 in 2019 to 824 in 2020, rise of 13%. Moreover, analysis of the vehicles involved reveal that two-wheelers, which were involved in 35% of the fatal accidents in 2019, rose to 41% in 2020. On the other hand, cars’ share remained the same at 14%. According to the report, 75% or three-fourths of the fatal road accidents were attributed to over-speeding. The rural and semi-urban areas accounted for 77% of the fatal accidents, whereas the rest 33% were recorded in the urban areas according to the report. City-based road safety experts said that apart from the higher speed of vehicles, lack of quicker medical attention after the incident could also be the reason for higher fatality in areas outside cities. In terms of accidental deaths, Gujarat recorded 13% drop in numbers, from 23,770 in 2019 to 20,644 in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/road-fatalities-at-10-yr-low-in-2020/articleshow/87441956.cms||Parth Shastri

He always put the interest of the country first. Under his inspiration, India is becoming fully capable of dealing with all kinds of challenges, both external and internal. In the last seven years, the country has got rid of the archaic laws and has given new heights to the ideals that cherish national unity,” Modi said on Sunday in his address via video conferencing on Patel’s 146th birth anniversary celebrated as ‘National Unity Day’. “The construction of modern infrastructure in the country is removing the geographical and cultural distances in the country. If the people of the country have to think a hundred times before moving from one part to another, then how will it work? When there will be ease of reaching every nook and corner of the country, then the distance of hearts between people will also be bridged and the unity of the country will be strengthened,” the PM said. Modi said India's capability and determination on every front, water-land-sky-space, is unprecedented. “India has embarked on a new mission of self-reliance to safeguard its interests,” he said. The PM urged farmers to contribute in strengthening the mission of ‘self-reliance’ by adopting new techniques and new crops according to the needs of the country. “Where the lack of unity brings new crises, the collective effort of everyone takes the country to new heights,” he added. “Sardar Patel always wanted a strong, inclusive, sensitive, alert, humble and developed India.

As per EOU sources, Rs 92.8 lakh was found deposited in bank accounts of Sharma and his wife. He joined police service as a sub-inspector in 1994 and is presently an inspector-rank officer. The raids were conducted at Sharma’s office-cum-residence at Jakkanpur police station in the city, flat number 104 in Shreya Apartment, flat number 401 in Orchid Apartment (both at Ara garden road under Airport police station area) and at his paternal residence at Maker in Saran district. Sharma has shown overall Rs31.37 lakh as deed value of the two flats at Ara Garden, but EOU sleuths estimate that both the properties have been shown undervalued and their market price is estimated to be above Rs1 crore. Sharma’s estimated earnings from all sources of income have been calculated at Rs1.88 crore and his expenditure comes around Rs1.57 crore. EOU sources said passbooks and other documents showing 11 bank accounts in the name of Sharma and his wife were found. Sources said preliminary inquiry was initiated after receiving complaints about his disproportionate assets and income. A DA case was registered on Friday before the EOU got search warrants issued by the court against him. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said it’s yet unknown how much money Sharma has deposited in the 11 bank accounts, which was revealed after the raids. “The bank accounts have been freezed on EOU’s request. Sharma has told the EOU about one bank locker, but we suspect more about which information would be gathered from the banks. All these will take Sharma’s DA much beyond Rs2.5 crore at present,” Khan said. This is the eighth DA case of the EOU since August this year. Seven of the cases were related to action against illegal sand mining and its transportation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-on-patna-sho-yield-rs2-5cr-assets/articleshow/87408059.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Mehul Kosurkar of Green Vigil Foundation said, “Along with particulate matter, fire crackers also emit toxic chemicals like potassium nitrate, sulphur, aluminium, zinc, cadmium, copper, lead etc which are highly injurious to health and cause respiratory problems, skin allergy, eye and throat irritation, asthma, blood pressure fluctuation etc.” Dr Sheetal Chaudhary and Shriya Jogey said, “Green Vigil is keen on creating awareness on air and noise pollution due to crackers. Bursting of crackers not only impacts humans but is very harmful for animal life including birds, cats and dogs. Hence, restricting the use of firecrackers during Diwali is essential.” Green Vigil is also conducting door-to-door campaign for celebrating eco-friendly Diwali. Green Vigil team members Kaustav Chatterjee, Mehul Kosurkar, Sheetal Choudhary, Bishnudeo Yadav, Shriya Jogey, Gauri Shrikhandkar, Priya Yadav, Sujay Kalbande, Trupti Bangadkar, Deepak Prasad, Dhanashree Agre and others worked hard for the success of the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/green-vigil-foundation-bats-for-eco-friendly-diwali-celebrations/articleshow/87441920.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

When they did not return home till evening, their families started searching for them and at night, lodged a complaint with police. Police have circulated the missing girls' photographs on social networking sites and set up four teams to find them. An FIR has been registered under IPC section of "abduction" since all the three girls are 15 years old. Vijay Dhull, Kheri’s SSP, told TO that the girls study in the same school and belong to farming families. He said, “The girls left for school at around 9.15 am together on their bicycles and later, went missing. So far, we have not found any instance of foul play. The girls were carrying a change of clothes in their school bags. Our teams have been able to track their movement and we hope to find them within 24 hours.” A police officer said, “We have recovered CCTV footage showing the girls parking their bicycles and boarding a bus. They later reached a place where they took an e-rickshaw and met someone. We have managed to speak with the bus conductor and the e-rickshaw driver and have got important evidence. The girls are safe and will hopefully be recovered by Sunday night.” Earlier this year, three friends from Kheri had gone missing and were later found "holidaying" in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-schoolgirls-15-go-missing-in-kheri/articleshow/87437318.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Experts, however, pointed out that hundreds of these shoppers either didn’t wear masks or didn’t wear it properly. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the first wave was experienced in the city after the Diwali festivities. “This year, the scenario is different with good vaccination numbers, but we must realize that the worry is not over, and it’s in our hands to ensure that we thwart the third wave by ensuring wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing in public places,” he said. With arrival of early salaries and bonuses in several companies and bonus for government employees, the sweet shops, firecracker shops and clothes stores saw a heavy rush. Traditional shopping districts such as Law Garden, Parimal Garden, etc. and a majority of the malls in the western city parts were full with shoppers. While the parking at a mall in Vastrapur ran full.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-gets-a-rebate/articleshow/87441953.cms||---

BJP leaders in Vidarbha have asked the employees to continue with the strike and 60% of the operations are still shut. A senior MSRTC official told TOI, “Employees are digging their own graves by launching strikes. The corporation is already in the red and closure of operations during Diwali season would be disastrous. The strike has already put MSRTC into a loss of Rs2.5 crore in the last two days.” The joint action committee of various MSRTC unions had launched a strike from October 27 to demand an increase in DA from 12% to 28%, in salary from 2% to 3%, and in HRA from Rs71,421 to Rs 81,624, respectively. However, transport minister Anil Parab and finance minister Ajit Pawar talked to the joint action committee leaders and agreed to the demand, after which the strike was called off. Sandeep Shinde of Maharashtra ST Kamgar Sanghatana said BJP MLA Gopichand Padalkar had created confusion. “He tried to hijack the agitation by raising the demand of merger of MSRTC with the government. We are not part of this agitation, which has been hyped up by local BJP leaders,” Shinde said. The top MSRTC official added, “The industrial court has already declared the strike as illegal. The striking employees have been declared as absent and will not get wages. Options to cut wages for eight days for a day-long strike are open. Over 60% of operations have been affected in Yavatmal, Wardha, Gadchiroli, and Chandrapur divisions in Vidarbha. Over 5,000 field employees are on strike.” During the last two days, the BJP leaders tried to halt bus operations from Wardhaman Nagar and Ganeshpeth depots. On Sunday, 10-15 BJP protesters were arrested at the bus stand and released later. On the BJP-fuelled strike inconveniencing passengers, MLC Pravin Datke — who led the strike here — said, “This is not a BJP-sponsored agitation. Employees had sought our support to demand MSRTC merger with the government. Many employees have died by suicide due to shabby treatment to meted out to them.” However, Shinde of the joint action committee said, “Most of the employees’ financial demands have been met. We are also in favour of the merger demand but it cannot be done easily. When BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar was finance minister he had clearly said that MSRTC merger is not possible. Now, BJP is playing politics by raking up the same issue. Why did it not act when its government was in power?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-fuelled-staff-strike-bleeds-msrtc-coffers/articleshow/87441942.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Toxic waste dumped on farmland||AHMEDABAD: It’s no more a question of Whodunnit, but who’ll clear the mess? Since July 19, bureaucratic red tape is allowing tonnes of highly toxic acidic waste, allegedly dumped by factories of industrial clusters around Ahmedabad to lie strewn over large parts of a farm in Rasam village in Bavla taluka, a few kilometres from Ahmedabad city. Scientific officer of Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) Dr Pradip Dave, in his statement to the Bavla police has said, “The waste is harmful to the environment and may endanger human life.” A visit to this farm will reveal existence of a well-organized racket. For many months, channels were dug and pumps installed to empty untreated toxic industrial effluents from tanker-trucks into various pools secured by mud embankments. GPCB officials claim that the toxic waste was being processed to be used as fuel for industrial boilers. Fluid from the toxic pools now trickle into nesting sites of migratory birds posing a grave danger for wildlife. On July 19, Bavla police received a tip-off that three men — Ramanji Thakor, a truck driver, and his two cleaners — Muman Sulia and Manuji Thakor, all from Patan, had dumped hazardous waste near a brick klin in Rasam village.  Cops immediately informed GPCB, which sent a team to the spot, took samples and found that 70 drums of 200 litres each, and 15 sacks of around 1 tonne of toxic waste had been dumped at the spot. “The court has already ordered clearing of the mess. What worries locals is that this toxic chemical may seep into groundwater and pose serious threats. The GPCB should clear the mess first,” says a farmer Praful Mehta from Bavla area. Senior GPCB officials claim, “The waste has to be disposed of scientifically or incinerated. But we suspect this was an organized racket. A few accused in the case have got bail.” Meanwhile, local police claim that GPCB is to clear the mess, and have posted three constables to prevent trespassing into the farm and tampering with the toxic evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bavla-toxic-waste-dumped-on-farmland/articleshow/87441961.cms||Paul John

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘BMC still owes nearly Rs 80cr for coastal road’s CRZ permit’||MUMBAI: Despite the environmentally conscious Thackerays leading the state government and the BMC, the civic body is yet to fully pay the cost for environmental mitigation measures for the coastal road project. Among the many conditions for grant of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for the controversial project was payment of 2% of the total project cost for mitigation measures to the mangrove conservation cell. The cell had raised a demand for Rs 254.52 crore. So far, the corporation has paid only Rs 175 crore, as per documents obtained under the Right to Information Act by the Akhil Maharashtra Machhimar Kruti Samiti. The money is to be paid before work starts on the ground. Work on the project started around 2017-18, and yet, till October 2020, the cash-rich corporation had paid only Rs 25 crore. After a reminder from the mangrove conservation cell in October 2020, the BMC paid another Rs 150 crore. However, the civic body is supposed to pay another Rs 79.52 crore, according to the cell. “The BMC has paid only 2% of the estimated cost, and not the actual cost,” said Virendra Tiwari, chief conservator at the cell. But Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of the coastal road project, insisted that the BMC had cleared its dues. She said, “The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) NOC is issued only after all due amount is paid. The required amount is 2% of construction cost, which is Rs 8,249 crore, plus 4% contingency, which comes to Rs 175 crore, and it is paid in full.” Bhide added that the amount of Rs 254.52 crore would only arise if calculated on the total project cost, which includes water, sewerage charges and supervision charges, which are notional and not part of the actual construction cost. “So no more amount is payable from BMC to the mangrove cell,” she said. The Samiti, which supports the fight of the Worli fishing community against the coastal road project, wants the BMC to widen the distance between the pillars of the bridge from the current 60 metres to at least 200 metres so that they can navigate their boats out to sea and back without crashing on the rocks. Fishermen have been staging a sit-in out at seato highlight their grievances. “The mangrove conservation cell is supposed to use these funds to study the project’s impact on fisheries and aqua culture. However, so far, not a single paisa has been spent for the study,” said Devendra Tandel, president of the Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-still-owes-nearly-rs-80cr-for-coastal-roads-crz-permit/articleshow/87443379.cms||Clara Lewis

While police were investigating the motive, family members claimed the accused was unhappy with his sister marrying the victim. The victim, Deva, lives in Jahangirpuri with his wife Heena and runs a gym in Adarsh Nagar. The couple got married in July, but were not living with their families. Constable Santosh Kapoor from Model Town police station informed the SHO that a man was lying with a bullet injury near Shalimar Bagh. The injured was taken to a hospital in a serious condition. Investigation revealed that the victim was shot twice, one in the head and second in the shoulder. Deva’s family claimed he had reached Model Town with two pillion riders on a motorcycle, who shot him with a country-made pistol and fled. A case under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) and sections 25 and 27 of Arms Act has been registered at Model Town police station. Two men, Shahanwaz (21) and his friend Harshit (20), were apprehended by the police station’s special staff. “Both firearms used in the crime, one live cartridge and the victim’s motorcycle were seized from them,” said an officer. DCP (Northwest) Usha Rangnani said Shahnawaz was Heena’s brother. Asked whether the motive behind the crime was interfaith marriage, she said an investigation was on. Around 3pm, Heena was seen crying at the hospital. She also fainted and fell to the ground after which her family members took her inside a car. Heena told reporters that on Friday, Shahnawaz called her husband for the first time. “My husband called and told me about the phone call. Later, even I talked to my brother,” she added. Shahnawaz told his sister to come and meet him along with Deva. “We met my brother, who then took my husband to Model Town. His phone became unreachable after that,” said Heena. Ravindra, the victim’s elder brother, told TOI, “On Saturday night, my brother’s friend Pawan called him to ask his whereabouts. A policeman received the call and informed him that he was receiving treatment for injuries. Heena told us that the policeman showed some CCTV grabs through which her brother was identified. Their family was unhappy with the interfaith marriage.” “On the day of the court marriage, Deva and Heena didn’t inform anyone as both the families did not support them. We were not in regular touch as he was living away from the family. He never told me about any threat,” said Ravindra. Other family members and friends of the victim alleged it was a preplanned conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-shot-at-by-brother-in-law-kin-say-accused-unhappy-with-match/articleshow/87441949.cms||Abhay Singh

The mangoes will be transported to APMC market in Vashi by Konkan railways. A meeting of stakeholders including farmers, aggregators and traders was held on Friday, where it was decided to run an Alphonso mango express to Navi Mumbai. Possibilities of running one such train to Delhi, Bengaluru, and other cities are being explored. Konkan produces over 3.5 lakh MT of alphonso mangoes. “Over 1.25 lakh farmers collectively grow Alphonso mangoes on over 1.86 lakh hectares of land in Konkan. About 186 lakh trees collectively produce over 3.5 lakh MT Alphonso mangoes. Kesar, Payari, Ratna and Sindhu varieties are also cultivated in these orchards,” said Dr Bharat Salvi, associate dean of the College of Horticulture of Dr Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth (DBSKKV), Dapoli. “Mango producers and traders are fully dependent upon costly road transport. The special mango train will be beneficial for all. The railways should also transport jackfruit, coconut, cereals, rice and vegetables to big cities,” added Dr Salvi. “The stakeholders’ meeting was held on Friday in Ratnagiri to start mango special trains from Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts to APMC, Vashi, from April 2022 onwards,” said LK Verma, chief PRO, KRCL.

The NMC administration had conducted rallies at Pancahvati and Nashik Road divisions a fortnight back, urging the taxpayers to pay property and water tax dues at the earliest. However, the civic body collected property tax worth Rs 4 crore only during the past 15 days. Similarly, the water tax collection has been only Rs 2 crore. Over 3,500 big property tax defaulters have dues of above Rs 50,000, while over 10,000 water tax defaulters have pending dues of over Rs 25,000. The NMC officials said the divisional-level NMC squads will visit big property and water tax defaulters’ homes and talk to them about their dues. “The officials will ask the defaulters to pay their tax dues. If they fail to do so, warrants will be issued on the spot, giving the defaulters an ultimatum of 21 days to pay the taxes or face action of confiscation of their properties,” said the civic officials. The revenue collection of the civic body has been badly affected due to the ongoing pandemic. The NMC had set the property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore, but it collected only Rs 86 crore so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-plans-to-visit-homes-of-big-tax-defaulters-to-recover-dues/articleshow/87438660.cms||Tushar Pawar

Kande also presented a letter to the district collector threatening self-immolation if there was any move to discuss and close funds for the 2020-21 financial year by finalizing minutes of expenses. Kande had defeated Bhujbal’s son Pankaj in the 2019 assembly election. Kande said he has been raising the issue of funds not being allotted to his constituency for the 2020-21 fiscal and has even moved Bombay HC. “I approached the HC seeking Bhujbal’s removal as the district guardian minister. I met the CM on Thursday and apprised him about the issue. The CM has assured me that he would look into the matter soon,” Kande said. Kande further alleged that Bhujbal was diverting extra funds to his own constituency — Yeola. Kande pointed out that his issue was related to the DPC funds for 2020-21 and not the ongoing fiscal and said the meeting in November should not entail any discussions of disbursement, allocation, and completion of funds. “Any discussion of funds would mean contempt of court. If it happens, I will register a police complaint and will self-immolate outside the meeting hall,” Kande added. Bhujbal has already clarified that the funds by DPC were issued by the collector based on the developmental works proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sena-mla-meets-cm-over-bhujbal/articleshow/87438705.cms||---

Dr Guha is yet to get back any money though two arrests were made in the case last week, after two years of follow-ups. Dr Guha, a senior under officer in medical NCC, had volunteered his services in the medical unit to help the Army and civilians on the Indo-Bangladesh border during his final year of MBBS. He spent a month serving ailing army personnel and civilians at various places along the border until the Pakistani army was vanquished. The doctor, who fought two Pakistani soldiers with bare hands instead of revealing the location of the Indian Army during the war, has been running pillar to post to get justice now. The doctor had called up an astrology service that promised to redress grievances in life. “Someone identifying himself as Madhukar guruji and his assistant started communicating with me. They assured to help me out of my hardship spiritually, and I believed them,” he said. Dr Guha said the tricksters started demanding money on some or the other pretext for performing a puja. “They used to furnish different bank account numbers for depositing amounts for purchasing materials and valuables for the puja, travelling and so on. I went on paying, believing their word as they sounded convincing,” he said. Dr Guha said he was even more convinced when the tricksters said the final puja and other rituals would be performed at his house. “I had deposited more money for their travel to the city, purchasing more puja materials and different other things. Later, their phones were switched off,” said Dr Guha, who approached cops after realizing he was duped. It was after much follow ups and legwork by the gynaecologist that Sadar police managed to nab the tricksters, Avinash Singh and Nitish Parmar Singh, two years after the complaint, with the help of cyber cell from West Bengal and Bihar. After being arrested on October 26, Avinash and Nitish were sent to Nagpur Central Jail on Saturday. Though the perpetrators are finally behind bars, the septuagenarian doctor is hoping to see at least some of his money is retrieved. Though the police claim the amount defrauded was Rs4.19 lakh, Dr Guha says it was closer to Rs10 lakh. Dr Guha said he was supported by Assistant PI Keshav Wagh of Cyber cell and later by former city police chief BK Upadhyay. “Unfortunately, Covid put a brake on the investigations for a year before I was delighted to be informed by Wagh that two accused were nabbed,” he said. Assistant PI Mohan Dere of Sadar police station, who worked under senior inspector Vinod Choudhury and zonal DCP Vinita S, said the accused were nabbed using their address in the banks where the amounts were deposited. “We have frozen their accounts but cash could not be recovered as yet,” said Dere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bdesh-war-veteran-doc-duped-of-rs4l-by-spiritual-healers/articleshow/87441988.cms||Soumitra Bose

The exam also passed off smoothly across 65 centres in Nashik without glitches like the ones reported from two of the 51 centres earlier. “The exams for the Group-D posts were conducted in one session from 2 pm onwards. In the Nashik circle, the examinations were conducted at 65 centres and were held without any issues,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of Nashik, who was in charge of the examinations that were conducted. Of the 27,006 candidates who had registered, 16,941 (63%) attended the examination. “It may be noted that the UPSC examination held in Nashik for the first time also registered only 60% attendance. By that standard, this is a good turnout. The attendance was better than the last week’s examinations,” another senior officer said. The first session of the Group-C exam conducted last Sunday had 38% attendance, while the second session registered 60% turnout. In last week exam, one of the exam centres received fewer than the required question papers, while another centre got the wrong set. The issues were resolved with the intervention of Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare and Dr Thorat. The officer pointed out that there were several people with double hall tickets — one for Nashik and the other for Aurangabad or even Pune circle. But since the exam was to be conducted on a single day it was their choice to attend the examination at the circle of their choice. The person attending the exam in Nashik circle, if and when gets selected, will get an appointment in Nashik circle comprising Nashik, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Dhule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/63-turnout-for-health-dept-group-d-exams/articleshow/87438755.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Anti-social elements thrive as officials fail to curb menace||KOCHI: Many areas in the city have become safe havens for antisocial elements. Marine Drive walkway, KSRTC bus garage, certain pockets in South, etc. are the main areas where antisocial elements including drug peddlers are active even in the broad daylight. According to a complaint raised by T J Vinod, MLA, at the district development council (DDC) meeting on Saturday, the number of such hideouts in the city are going up as the authorities fail to pay adequate attention for curbing the menace. “The KSRTC garage adjacent to the bus station is a major hideout of drug peddlers. It is learnt that dealings of drugs are being held there,” Vinod said. “Similarly, some of the nuns have lodged complaints with the police stating that certain spots in Udaya Colony are being misused by drug peddlers. Another area where antisocial elements camp is near Ambedkar Stadium,” Vinod said. It is reported that the use of drugs has been on the rise post Covid-19. “One of the factors which has led to more youngsters using drugs may be the hike in the price of liquor. I have raised all these issues at the DDC meeting,” Vinod said. “There was an issue of a pavilion erected by KMRL near South being used by street dwellers for drinking and other illegal activities. After we took up the issue before the police authorities, they deployed policemen for manning the area. The container toilets erected at South also are being misused for drinking, etc.,” Vinod said. “The presence of such antisocial elements can be seen under the Metro pillars as well,” he said. District collector Jafar Malik said that instructions have been given to the agencies concerned to tackle the issue. “We have given instructions to the police as well as excise officers in this regard. We have asked the excise department to plan special drives to conduct inspection in the areas pointed out by the MLA,” Malik said. Marine Drive walkway, which is thronged by hundreds of people every day, is another area where antisocial elements camp. “The stretch between Kettuvallam bridge and High Court boat jetty is a den of antisocial elements. This area is full of bushes and this makes it an apt place for criminals and antisocial elements to camp. There were incidents in which visitors fell prey to antisocial activities,” said Renjith Thampi, an activist. “The morning walkers also face the brunt of the criminals. People drinking in the broad daylight can be seen on Marine Drive. Police should beef up checking in the area,” he said. The incidents of private bus workers attacking drivers of other vehicles are being reported. A few days ago, workers of a private bus stopped a mini truck in the middle of the road and assaulted the driver mercilessly near Kaloor. The bus workers, including the driver, were not wearing uniforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anti-social-elements-thrive-as-officials-fail-to-curb-menace/articleshow/87442086.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The 65-year-old Pratap Bhimani and his 34-year-old son Vijay were found dead in the balcony on the second floor of Jai Khodiyar Chambers on Rajputpura main road on Saturday morning. The duo ran a tea stall outside Rajeshree Cinema and their business was affected due to the pandemic. With cinema halls due to the government guidelines, their tea stall didn’t do much business after the lockdown was lifted. For their survival, they had borrowed money from different lenders. For the past few weeks, the lenders had started asking for their money and the duo sought more time,” said sub-inspector S H Nimavat of A Division police station. The two realized that they would not be able to repay the loan. A few days ago, Vijay took her mother to an old-age home and made arrangements for her stay. Sometime between October 29 night and Saturday morning, Pratap and Vijay went to Jai Khodiyar Chambers and consumed poison to end their lives. They were identified from Aadhaar cards found in their pockets. Probe revealed a man named Hitesh had disappeared with Rs 15 lakh which the deceased had lent him. After they lost the money, the family was forced to live in a rented house and start a tea stall for survival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/facing-financial-crisis-man-and-son-end-lives/articleshow/87440313.cms||---

A herd of 18-22 elephants is on the move in Gadchiroli’s south Murumgaon and south Dhanora forest ranges. Elephants have re-entered the region after 300 years. The herd is near Munjalgondi lake in south Dhanora, where there is good fodder in the form of bamboo and grass. According to forest officials, this herd had started in 2014 in Odisha. Limaye said, “We have sought help from the Stripes And Green Earth (SAGE) Foundation in West Bengal, working on elephant conservation. One purpose of the visit is to identify suitable areas where elephants can stay undisturbed and people are also not harmed. Capacity-building of the staff is also on the agenda.” SAGE is working in the Sanjay-Dubri Tiger Reserve and now in Kotma range of Annupur on human-animal conflict, and is training the field staff on identification, body language, drive management etc. “We have also sought help from Gadchiroli police superintendent Ankit Goyal and district collector Sanjay Meena for security and compensation, if some houses are damaged. Being paddy harvesting season, the crop is ripe and we are in the process of paying compensation for crop damage by elephants,” said Limaye. The PCCF added, “I’ve also invited NGO Wildlife SOS that had radio-collared elephants in Chhattisgarh as part of the man-animal conflict mitigation. One of the elephants in the herd was collared earlier and the collar has fallen now. We have kept the option to collar the elephant open and have invited the NGO, if it wishes to take up such an operation.” A day before, urban development minister Eknath Shinde had identified Chaprala wildlife sanctuary as an alternative site for elephants. However, Gadchiroli conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said, “Chaprala is a teak forest and not suitable for elephants.” Meanwhile, a three-member team from SAGE Foundation led by Sagnik Sengupta arrived in the city and will leave for Gadchiroli with Limaye on Monday. Another elephant expert Anand Shinde from Mumbai, who had earlier handled captive elephants in Tadoba and Kamlapur in Gadchiroli, is already camping in Gadchiroli. During discussions with Limaye, NGO SAGE is also likely to come up with a suggestion to install early warning devices, either at the village or forest entry points of the elephants. The NGO had earlier implemented the GSM-based prototype in Sanjay-Dubri in Chhattisgarh. The technique works on solar energy and sends alerts to mobile phones, also generating hooter sounds wherever fixed. Sengupta said, “Paddy is cultivated in Gadchiroli in a big way. The crop is ripe and it is one of the favourite foods of elephants. The herd may stay till the end of winter and onset of summer, and may try to migrate again towards Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh. The herd may come back next year with more numbers. It may stay for long if alternative fodder and water is available, and provided it is not disturbed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/elephant-experts-in-gadchiroli-today-collaring-option-open/articleshow/87442081.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the police, accused Piyush Vasavadiya and Mansukh Meghani took Rs 5.5 lakh from the victims promising them houses in an RMC housing scheme in the city which is yet to be constructed. Meghani used to lure the victims, while Vasavadiya made them fill application forms for the houses in Shahid Udham Singh Township near Amul circle. After collecting the forged application letters, the duo informed the victims that houses had been allotted to them and even gave them forged sale deeds and other documents of the properties. When people asked about possession of their houses, the accused would start dilly dallying. Recently, the victims went to the site of the housing scheme and were shocked to find that no construction activity had even begun there. On realizing that they had been cheated, the victims approached police and made complaints against Vasavadiya and Meghani. Based on the complaints and evidence gathered, an offence of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy was registered at Thorala police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dozen-cheated-by-2-posing-as-rmc-officials/articleshow/87440364.cms||---

The group, comprised of district collector Jafar Malik, Fort Kochi sub-collector P Vishnuraj, CSML CEO S Shanavas, officials, people’s representatives and others, started from Folklore Cultural Theatre at 9am after discussing the plan and concluded at the same place by 11am. The participants were divided into five groups and each group took different routes. They collected more than 100 suggestions from guides, local people, and hotel and homestay operators on the issues plaguing the tourist destinations. Most of the respondents complained about littering of waste in the streets, lack of lighting, drainage system and encroachments on footpaths. Some demanded to arrange facilities for night life. “Collector has asked me to identify two to three streets for implementing night life plan. Princess Street, South Beach and the street near Fort Kochi police station is good for night life. During our walk, some people complained that about encroachments on the footpath are disrupting the view of Chinese nets near the beach,” said Fort Kochi councillor Antony Kureethara. Many respondents demanded to speed up the remaining beautification works undertaken by CSML. They also called for beautification of the beach by constructing seawalls and removing weeds. All the suggestions will be categorized based on priority and a committee, with sub-collector as nodal officer, has been formed for the purpose. “Various departments and agencies need to work together to address the issues raised by the stakeholders,” said Shanavas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-walk-down-the-heritage-lanes-of-kochi/articleshow/87442125.cms||---

If approved, the goon would be externed for two years from the railway, city and district limits. The proposal was planned and prepared by assistant police inspector (API) Mubarak Shaikh of Itwari GRP. It was sent to the sub-divisional magistrate and DCP of Zone III for consideration. The goon, whose name was not revealed, and his armed gang had barged into a coach of train running on the Howrah line in March. Apart from robbing some passengers, the goon had injured others in the train. The gang was nabbed but railway police started keeping him under watch. In June this year, the GRP Itwari team had slapped a preventive action on the goon who stayed within the limits of Pachpaoli police station. Apart from railway police, it’s learnt the goon is also a challenge for Pachpaoli police who had initiated preventive action against him in December last year. API Shaikh said the goon stays near Howrah track along with his gang and is a major threat for the railway passengers. “If we can extern a goon, then it would be the first one after 35 years,” he said. “Earlier, none attempted to propose externment because it needs approval from city police as the goons and criminals mostly stayed within their limits," he said. GRP sources stated that SP Rajkumar had instructed stringent drive against goons posing threats to passengers. “In the first phase, we are contemplating externing three goons, and imposing MPDA if possible. We are now exploring the records of such criminals,” said the sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/grps-first-proposal-in-35-yrs-to-extern-rly-robber/articleshow/87442127.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa CM’s pothole deadline passes, crucial tourist link has no road||SIOLIM: It has been a dusty four years for Theresa Fernandes and her family, who live along the Marna-Siolim road. Nearly 4km of this road resembles a back-breaking off-roading track. While CM Pramod Sawant had promised that he would make it tough to spot a pothole on Goan roads by November 1, hours before the deadline ended on Sunday, any hopes of the Marna-Siolim road being repaired were dashed for the Fernandes family. The road is not only used by Siolim locals but is a crucial link between Mapusa and Pernem for locals and tourists headed to the Ashvem-Arambol coastal belt. “We have been waiting for years now for the road to be repaired,” said Theresa.  Last year, tired of the unbearable dust entering the house, we finally covered the front of our house in mesh to keep the dust out,” said Theresa, from Chaudi Vaddo. “The road via Marna was the main road for people travelling from Pernem to Mapusa and vice-versa. But everyone now takes the much narrower Siolim-Mapusa road via Sodiem, to avoid the potholed road via Marna. As a result, the Sodiem road has turned into a traffic nightmare, especially on the weekends, with a huge rush of tourists going to Morjim, Arambol, Mandrem, Ashvem and Keri,” said Siolim local Joaquim Almeida. The Marna road was first dug up around four years ago to lay a WRD irrigation pipeline, remember locals. Siolim residents have not seen the road in good shape since. “Today, the November 1 deadline ends. You tell me, where is the road? Since the road was dug up four years ago, only superficial repairs have been carried out, and there have never been attempts to layer the entire stretch with a coat of hotmix. I drive on this road nearly every day. In the monsoon, it is difficult to tell where the water ends and where the road begins,” said Milan Sadekar, a resident of Igrez Vaddo, Siolim. Deputy sarpanch of Siolim-Marna panchayat and member of the ward with the affected road stretch, William Fernandes, said that he has been running from pillar to post for years now to get the road hotmixed. “I have written to every possible authority over the last three years or so to get the road repaired. Now, they are preparing to hotmix the road and it will be done soon, I have been informed. But there are leakages in seven places in the pipeline laid below the road. If the leakages are not plugged first and the road is hotmixed, then the road will be back to its poor state in no time,” said Fernandes. The November 1 deadline also missed, locals have given up on any possibility of a better road. “For locals, the Siolim road has become the benchmark of a bad road in Goa. If a Siolkar mentions a bad road, we ask him if it is as bad as the Marna road. If it is not as bad, it is not a bad road,” said Almeida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cms-pothole-deadline-passes-crucial-tourist-link-has-no-road/articleshow/87443497.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Cops said that the deceased, Dipesh Pethani, in his suicide note, said that he was mentally tired. Pethani was found hanging at his home around 10.30pm. Police found a suicide note in which Pethani didn’t blame anyone for taking the extreme step. Pethani wrote that he was mentally tired and he used to hope that the next day his situation would improve but it never did. So, for peace of mind he decided to end his life. “I have not done anything wrong and had never imagined I would have to see such days,” Pethani wrote. But the suicide note did not shed any light on the problems he was facing. Addressing his friends, Pethani wrote that they should not hold anyone responsible for his suicide and asked them to take care of his parents. Police said that, through the suicide note, he even asked his parents to not do any post-death rituals, but just hold a prayer meeting. Police are checking his phone records and other evidence to find out if he was being harassed by anyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mentally-tired-gym-trainer-hangs-self/articleshow/87440401.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: In festive mood, only 21,000 get jabbed during Sunday special drive in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: At least 21,070 were jabbed against Covid-19 in the district on Sunday during the special drive organised by the health authorities to boost vaccination rate which witnessed a decline in October in comparison to the previous month. While generally government vaccination centres are closed on Sundays, the special drive was organised at 133 vaccination booths on the weekly off day with a hope that public participation will be more. However, the response was not as per the expectations. As a result, October ended with a total 7.3 lakh inoculations, less than September’s 11.4 lakh vaccinations. Health officers said that turnout continues to be low because of the festival season. Another reason is that now a large section of the 37.4 lakh adult population eligible for vaccine has taken at least a dose, hence many who have taken their first dose are waiting for the 12-16-week gap period to be over to take the second. Officiating Chief medical officer Dr M K Singh said, “About 14.8 lakh people aged 18 years or above have completed their course and 16.2 lakh have taken a dose. This means that 31 lakh (82.8%) people out of 37.4 lakh have taken at least a dose. Hence, there is some stagnation, resulting in low turnout.” However, the figures also show that 6.4 lakh people have not taken any dose so far. TIMES VIEW People need to give vaccination top priority because getting the jab is as auspicious as celebrating festivals. A vaccinated person not only protects her/himself, but also family members, friends and society. Hence, one should avail the benefit of the special drives being organised by the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-festive-mood-only-21k-get-jabbed-during-sunday-special-drive/articleshow/87443500.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||India||Ex-TMC min Rajib Banerjee returns to Mamata’s flock||KOLKATA: Less than a month after being made a special invitee to BJP's national executive, former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee on Sunday returned to Trinamool Congress with regret on his lips for the brief tryst with saffron and new-found respect for Mamata Banerjee as "not only Bengal's mother but the country's, too". "I was wrong. We were wrong," Rajib, among the first of the Trinamool turncoats to cross over to BJP before the polls, said in Agartala. "I failed to appreciate chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s worth...BJP thrives only on votes and power." MP and Trinamool's national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee handed the party flag to the ex-minister at the rally. "I have long ties with Tripura, my relatives and friends stay here. And it is from them that I learnt how hollow these double-engine claims (of BJP) are. Tripura supposedly has a double engine, yet it does not have a single social welfare scheme like that of single-engine Bengal. By the time I understood that, it was too late," Rajib said. Rajib had met Abhishek on August 7, over two months after his poll drubbing in Howrah’s Domjur, where he lost by over 33,000 votes. As a TMC member, he had won the same seat twice, in 2011 and 2016. "I didn’t agree with the personal attacks, had spoken out against it. Given our culture and mentality, I also couldn’t agree to this politics of religion, race, division and hatred," he said. "I had repeatedly raised several issues with the leadership, but was always told 'hobe' (it will happen)." Asish Das, a former BJP legislator from Tripura’s Surma, also defected to TMC at the rally. Das had quit BJP on October 5 and shaved his head in Kolkata's Kalighat as an "act of penance". In a statement, Trinamool said it "wholeheartedly welcomed" Rajib back to the party fold. But there were immediate rumblings within the party over his homecoming. MP Kalyan Banerjee, who had led the charge against the former MLA in Domjur, said, "The leadership had said anyone who had hurt the sentiments of party workers will not find a place in TMC again." Referring to the MP as "a respected guardian", Rajib said, "He has expressed his personal feelings. The party’s leadership has decided to take me back." BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said Rajib's short-lived association with his party wasn't surprising. "That he would return to TMC was known to all. They had a no-entry board till now – he went back the day they removed it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-tmc-min-rajib-banerjee-returns-to-mamatas-flock/articleshow/87445873.cms||---

The state government has released 75% of the total aid of Rs 404.5 crore in the first phase and has asked the respective district administrations to ensure that the aid reaches the farmers before Diwali. The aid of Rs 328.3 crore includes Rs 120.2 crore for Nashik district and Rs 208.1 crore for Jalgaon district. The number of farmers affected due to heavy rainfall is higher in Nashik than Jalgaon district, but the damage reported in Jalgaon is almost double than that reported in Nashik. As many as 3.58 lakh farmers in Nashik district were affected due to heavy rains with collectively damage to crops across 1.71 lakh hectare. In Jalgaon district, 3.06 lakh farmers were affected with crops on 3.05 lakh hectare being damaged. As per the state disaster response fund, the compensation for farmers — both irrigated and non-irrigated land across the two districts — was valued at Rs 404.5 crore and the state government has decided to give Rs 33.22 crore to the farmers as additional compensation. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has directed the government officials to ensure that the aid was transferred to the bank accounts of the farmers before Diwali. “The government is helping the farmers in ensuring they re-build their homes after they faced large numbers of difficulties due to rains,” said Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-328cr-relief-released-for-farmers-in-nashik-division/articleshow/87438810.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The drama has been written and directed by Malleshaiah HM, an assistant teacher at a government lower primary school in Koppal. Malleshaiah was impressed by the success of the ‘Vidyarthi Mane Mana Beti’ programme, through which teachers and locals visit the homes of SSLC students. Other than helping students with their studies, this initiative has helped teachers understand the problems of students. The department staff and teachers have helped students by providing them solar lamps, arranging electricity supply and even built house for a needy student with the help of philanthropists. Puttur block education officer (BEO) Lokesh C said, the drama written and directed by a school teacher in Koppal not only speaks about the success of the ‘Vidyarthi Mane Mana Beti’ programme, but also encourages students to make use of the available government hostels to complete their education. “The story revolves around a boy hailing from an economically poor background, but manages to clear the UPSC exams after his problems were understood by his teachers and officers during a visit to his house and he was shifted to a hostel. The drama will soon be presented by the children on All India Radio and we also hope to record or stage the 45-minute drama on DD Chandana,” he said. Malleshaiah travelled to Puttur and trained the children of Government Model Higher Primary School, Harady and Government Higher Primary School, Kabaka. Two teachers Gangavathi Rai from Harady school and Latha Kumari from Kabaka school ensured that the children practised regularly. “Malleshaiah has great interest in literature and got to know about this programme through media reports. He used to visit Puttur during the weekends to train the students. We hope for the digital release of the drama soon. Through this, we hope to encourage students to make use of the available facilities and prevent school dropouts,” BEO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-to-present-drama-on-edu-depts-mane-mana-beti-programme/articleshow/87439749.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The task force has seized 700 kg of perishable ‘foul smelling’ khoya from khoya mandi auction site, Mori Gate and from Sanjay Market, Bagh Deewar in the Walled City. The team also seized 630kg of blended mustard oil from Bawana, which is prohibited as per gazette notification dated March 20, 2021. The department said strict vigil is being kept to ensure safe food for all during the Diwali festival. Neha Bansal, commissioner, food safety, said that 12 food safety officers, along with other senior officials of the department, have been divided into two teams to ensure food safety during the festive season. “One team has been constituted to keep a watch on khoya and paneer, and another for ghee and mustard oil. We got inputs about blended oil, which is not allowed, and foul smelling khoya and these were picked up,” she said. “This 700 kg of khoya would have been used to make sweets and the blended mustard oil is not allowed as it is not food-grade oil,” Bansal added.

However, the twist this season's Diwali is the traditional and modern sweets fused together, which have replaced the usual 'soan papdis' and 'laddoos'. With city bakers and shopkeepers getting experimental with different flavours, customers too are very enthusiastic to take back home or gift hampers and sweets with a twist in taste this festive season. Savouries like 'cashew tiramisu', 'french cranberry laddoos', 'paan of nawabs', mixed dry fruit cookie, are some of the favourites picked by customers, not only because they are amalgamation of flavours, but also they are suger free. Ankit Sahni, owner of a prominent sweets and bakery chain in the city said that apart from sweets, people are opting for customised hampers with a mix of fusion sweets, coupled with dry fruits and chocolates. "We tried experimenting with the traditional flavours to give them a fresh new taste. The market is great when compared to earlier this year. Keeping the fitness freaks in mind we have tried making the sugar free sweets loaded with dry fruits and nuts. We have a good range of hampers from Rs 1,500 to Rs 10,000 to choose from along with other customized options available in a row," he said. Different varieties of 'Baklawas' are another prominent choice of many, especially the 'Kataifi Baklawa' (prepared from shredded Turkish filo and caramelized honey) and Honey cashew tart. "The hampers which consist of dry fruits and coconut are preferred over other products in the shop. With the changing needs, people are demanding chocolate bouquets and customised baskets for Diwali. Moreover, there's so much competition in the market now, especially in the F&B industry, that we need to make something new and better every festive season," said Narendra Tolani, a bakery and sweet shop owner in Indira Nagar. Keeping up the spirit of the festival, but also keeping precautions in mind, a couple of shops are also providing masks and sanitizers with gift hampers. "Every gift hamper has a mask and sanitiser in it. This is our way of reminding our customers and others that we still are in the middle of a pandemic. Talking about customers’ demand, the gold plated mewa roll is a special attraction this Diwali. To make our hampers more Diwali ready, we have also included scented sticks and candles," added Srijal Gupta, owner of a city-based restaurant and bakery chain. "The most preferred items among the pre-bookings is the gulab jamun and kaju katli flavoured doughnuts and tea cakes. Above all the flavoured makhanas (lotus seeds) and bubblegum flavored kajus have already begun going off the shelves. Masks are being provided with every purchase," said Manisha Pahwa, who owns a small bakery and an instagram store. Tanushree Gupta, the owner of bakery chains in the city said, "We are decorating cakes with lanterns, diyas, crackers and rangoli decorations on them for the entire Diwali week."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fusion-sweets-to-lift-diwali-spirits/articleshow/87443510.cms||Aditi Singh

The day also saw 2,406 take their first dose. The mega vaccination drive was organised to give one last push to the vaccination drive and after the directorate of health services found that 2.2 lakh persons weren’t coming forward to take their second dose despite the recommended 84 days after the first dose lapsing. The drive expected more people to turn up to take their second dose in preparation of tourists flocking to the state, and with schools reopening. Despite making vaccination available at 260-odd health centres and sub-centres at the drive on Sunday, the response was not up to the mark, said state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar. He said that 104% of the target population in Goa has received the first dose, and 78% the second dose. Goa’s double-vaccinated tally now stands at 9,07,587, and partially vaccinated at 3,33,165.

Active cases, at 352, are now at their lowest over the past one year and five months. The last time the state’s active count was this low was in June 2020. North Goa’s weekly case positivity rate at 1.9% continues to be higher than South Goa’s, which is marginally above 1%. In North Goa, 46% and in South Goa, 59% of the positive cases were detected via rapid antigen testing, and the rest by RT-PCR. Three persons were hospitalised and 20 opted for home isolation.

---||Delhi||JNU scholars claim being asked to give back fellowship money||NEW DELHI: With Jawaharlal Nehru University reportedly asking students to return the money they had received as part of the non-NET fellowship, Sunny Dhiman, a PhD scholar, has sought to know the rule being cited by the administration in doing so. Dhiman, like several others who have cleared the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) exam, claims that there has been no reply from the university. The students’ union has now taken up the issue with the University Grants Commission, which, according to them, has clarified that there was no rule mandating such a recovery. The students claimed that UGC has asked them to submit written applications in this regard. Dhiman, a scholar at JNU’s Centre for Studies in Science Policy, told TOI: “I had availed of the non-Net fellowship for three years. We get this fellowship without clearing any exams. Later, I cleared the JRF, which entitles me to a fellowship too. To avail of the five years of JRF fellowship, the university says, I need to return the money received as non-NET fellowship.” For Dhiman, this amount comes to over Rs 2 lakh. The non-NET fellowship amount ranges from Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 a month. With other students also raising the issue, the students’ union conducted a survey and took up the matter with UGC on October 27. The JNU administration didn’t respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-scholars-claim-being-asked-to-give-back-fellowship-money/articleshow/87443509.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur HIV+ rate dips to 0.4% in 10 years||KOLHAPUR: The district has been witnessing a consistent decline in HIV-positive cases, even though there is a high inflow of migratory population here. Over the past 10 years, the number of targets being tested for HIV has doubled from 75,000 to 1.42 lakh. In 2020-21, 93,000 individuals had tested for HIV and of them, only 397 were positive. Since April this year, the administration has tested 32,000 individuals and 191 have tested positive. Over the past 10 years, the administration has made several efforts that have helped bring down the number of HIV-positive cases. Dipa Shipurkar, the district programme officer for the AIDS prevention and control unit (DAPCU), said, “We emphasise on making high-risk and vulnerable populations aware of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of HIV. Initially, we were among the first five districts with a high prevalence of HIV, but now, we are at ninth position, which shows that the HIV infection rate is declining.” “We have tied up with several associations and corporates to make eradication of HIV a mass movement. We have worked with several groups who were easily prone to the infection. We held film festivals, gram sabhas and workshops for women to help them understand the causes and get rid of the social taboos faced by the infected persons,” she added. In the case of pregnant women, the HIV infection rate has come down to 0.05% from 0.2% in the past 10 years. Over 6.3 lakh pregnant women were tested, and 414 were HIV-positive during this period. Due to early diagnosis, the administration made it possible for HIV-infected mothers to deliver healthy babies. Out of 51 deliveries, only one baby tested positive in 2020-21. The authorities have claimed that the strong network of anti-retroviral therapy centres in the district has helped in reaching out to positive patients. So far, only 484 patients were lost-to-follow-up (LFU), meaning they discontinued treatment midway. The officials claimed that most of LFU patients were brought back to treatment through counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-hiv-rate-dips-to-0-4-in-10-yrs/articleshow/87438817.cms||---

Each month, KMC employees get salaries on the seventh day of the month. The salary depends on government grants, which are released on the fifth day of every month. KMC spends over Rs 22 crore every month on salaries of its 4,500-odd employees. Sanjay Sarnaik, the chief accountant of KMC, said, “We have spent Rs5 crore to pay the advance amount as demanded by Class the III and IV workers. Class IV workers, who form a large chunk of our workforce, have been paid Rs 12,500, while Class III staffers have been paid Rs 5,000. Since we are yet to get the government grants, we have not paid the staff their salaries yet.” The KMC employees had threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the advances were not paid to them. Earlier, the KMC used to pay its employees a bonus ahead of Diwali. This was stopped and instead, the employees were given a salary advances, which were recovered from their monthly pay over the next 10 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-not-to-pay-staff-before-diwali/articleshow/87438825.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Yogi attacks Rajbhar, says time toshut shops of ‘political blackmailers’||Lucknow: Mounting a fierce attack on former ally, SBSP chief OP Rajbhar, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath termed the leader a “blackmailer” who was interested only in the “development of his own family”. Yogi’s offensive came days after Rajbhar announced an “unconditional” support to the Samajwadi Party in the UP assembly elections due in the next few months. Speaking at Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan to consolidate Rajbhar community, Yogi said, “The father wants to become a minister. One son wants to be an MP while the other aspires to become an MLC. The shop of such political blackmailers has to be closed.” This is perhaps for the first time that Yogi has launched a stinging attacked on the SBSP chief, who has been flexing muscles to sabotage BJP’s prospects in the elections. Invoking 11th century Hindu king, Raja Suheldev, who defeated and killed Ghaznavid general Ghazi Miyan at Bahraich in 1034, Yogi said the followers of Ghazi were afraid of Suheldev out of fear of votebank. “There were two Rajbhar ministers in my cabinet. One of them had opposed the proposal to build a memorial of Maharaja Suheldev in Bahraich, while Anil Rajbhar wanted a grand monument,” Yogi said. According to political analysts, Yogi’s statement is an attempt to drive a wedge between the SBSP and the SP, which banks on strong support of Muslims. “They fear that if Suheldev’s memorial is built, people will forget Ghazi and the public will throw political blackmailers in the garbage,” Yogi said. The state government had stepped up the construction of Suheldev memorial in Bahraich to reach out to Rajbhar community which has a sizable presence, especially in east UP. This also marks BJP’s counter to SP which has been able to wean away some of the prominent Rajbhar leaders from Mayawati’s BSP. The state government has also named Bahraich Medical College after Maharaja Suheldev. “Opposition parties should be asked what these parties have done for Maharaja Suheldev,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-attacks-rajbhar-says-time-toshut-shops-of-political-blackmailers/articleshow/87443513.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP assembly polls: RLD announces its election manifesto, promises to get farm laws scrapped||LUCKNOW: Getting the new farm laws scrapped, grant of the status of martyrs to those who died while protesting against the said laws and employment to 1 crore youth are some of the key promises made by the Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal in its  manifesto announced on Sunday. This was the first election manifesto by a political party ahead of the state polls due in the next few months. The development marked RLD positioning itself against the saffron outfit ostensibly in the restive west UP region which was also impacted by the farmers' stir against the farm laws brought in by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. The move attained pertinence in the wake of Lakhimpur incident in which eight people, including four protesting farmers died after an SUV belonging to junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s son ploughed through them. The incident had attained political overtones following alleged involvement of junior home minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish. Jayant also declared that on forming the government, a financial grant of Rs 12,000 per annum would be given to farmers on December 23 which is observed as `Kisan Diwas' to mark the birth anniversary of his grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh. "Alongside, small farmers cultivating barren lands along the border will receive Rs 15,000 annually on the day," the manifesto said. The move is seen as counter to NDA government’s PM Kisan Samman Nidhi which entails an annual grant of Rs 6,000 to farmers annually. "Currently, 2 crore and 82 lakh farmers receive Rs. 6,000 in three annual installments under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. The additional amount will be credited to the bank accounts of farmers in lump-sum on ‘Kisan Diwas’," the manifesto said. The RLD chief also said that his party will help double the growth of the state's agricultural sector. At the same time, a commission on agriculture will be strengthened and made more effective. In a bid to provide relief to the farmers from the high cost of electricity, a policy of ‘Puraane Bill Maaf, Bijli Dar Half’ (Scrapping of Old Bills, Halving of New Bills) will be implemented, the party said. The manifesto further promised that the State Advisory Price (SAP) for sugarcane will be announced at the time of its sowing of the crop. The announcement assumed pertinence as RLD has its political base essentially in the west UP which is rich in cane cultivation. The RLD categorically promised that in the first session, SAP worth 1.5 times the cost will be announced and thereafter, the price of sugarcane will be attached to the inflation index. "Payments for sugarcane will be made in 14 days. Defaulting sugar mills will be made to undergo forensic audits. Strict legal action will be taken against sugar mills and mill owners found delaying payments to farmers," the manifesto read. It added that installation of distilleries and production of ethanol will be made compulsory for all sugar mills. Moreover, Farmers’ Cooperatives and small private units will be granted licenses for the production of ethanol. A proposal will be submitted to the GST Council to reduce the GST rates on tractors and other farming implements. Subsidies on farming implements will be directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers. Also a new ‘Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana’ will replace the PM Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). A premium will be paid to the farmers by the state government. A compensation for crops destroyed by stray animals will also be decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rld-announces-its-election-manifesto-promises-to-get-farm-laws-scrapped/articleshow/87443516.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||How 33 policemen donned different hats to curb crime in north Delhi||NEW DELHI: For the past month, a group of 33 policemen had been acting as fruit vendors, labourers, pedestrians and tourists to nab snatchers, robbers and vehicle thieves in Outer-North district. The cops were given training to think how criminals functioned. “Over time, criminals change their modus operandi to dodge police, so even we changed our ways to catch them,” said a policeman who was a part of the team. Head constable Chetan Yadav had disguised himself as a fruit vendor and labourer over the past 28 days to catch criminals. “My team members and I used to visit markets and stay connected through Bluetooth devices,” he said. They would first ask the vendors the rate of fruits and then sell the wares on their cart to customers at the same price. The original vendors would also be asked to cooperate in the operation and made to stand near the fruit carts like co-workers. Another policeman said he disguised himself as a labourer after getting calls about snatching in an area. “I used to keep a sack on my shoulders and ask pedestrians and commuters about a delivery address to avoid suspicion about my identity. This would help me spend time in that area,” he added. Constable Pradeep was deployed near a mall, bus stops and Delhi Metro stations to sell water in a trolley. “I had to keep an eye on suspects, apart from catering to regular customers,” he added. “We wore dhotis, turbans and even pyjamas during the operation. There were days when no suspects arrived, but we always remained on the lookout,” said another cop. An officer said four cops were deployed at a spot, one to tell his colleagues about the movements of suspicious people and the other three to catch the suspects. “In several cases, we recovered stolen mobile phones from the suspects. First, they would tell us that the device belonged to them, but later could never open the lock pattern,” he added. When they arrested robbers and snatchers, they were found high on drugs. “One of them told us that he was flying a plane and no one could catch him. Another said he didn’t know what he was doing. The investigation also revealed that they were procuring the drugs from children. The drugs procured from other states were packed in small pouches of 5-10 grams and given to poor children to sell them,” said another policeman. DCP (Outer-North) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said, “After analysing the crime pattern of the area, this unique policing activity was started. Cops were deployed at sensitive places to get fruitful results.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-33-policemen-donned-different-hats-to-curb-crime/articleshow/87442143.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Lucknow||Patel’s ‘rashtra bhakti’ made India a formidable nation: Yogi||Lucknow: Leaders cutting across party lines vied for the legacy of India’s first deputy prime minister and home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 146th birth anniversary on Sunday. CM Yogi Adityanath said the country was once again taking the pledge of national unity which was crafted by Patel despite “conspiracies” of few elements who did not want India to stay united after Independence. “But Patel demonstrated his ‘rashtra bhakti’ and brought together various princely states to build a formidable nation,” Yogi said after flagging off a rally of 75 motorcycles to Kakori memorial in Lucknow to mark Patel’s birth anniversary celebrations as well as 75th years of India’s independence. Apna Dal (S) chief and Union minister Anupriya Patel hailed Vallabhbhai Patel as “Yug Purush” who strived for uniform human rights. Anupriya had reached Badaun to attend a function hosted by Bhartiya Kurmi Mahasabha. She had unveiled a statue of Patel on Saturday. Apna Dal (S) has been projecting Patel as its prominent ideologue to consolidate Kurmi sub-caste amongst the OBC which has a sizable presence in UP. Citing the example of Bardoli Satyagraha, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra recalled Patel as a leader who “raised the voice of farmers’ rights and self-respect”. “His struggle inspires us to stand like a rock in the fight for justice against the oppression of farmers and for their rights,” she tweeted. Analysts interpreted Priyanka’s statement as referring to the farmers’ stir against the new farm laws and the recent killings of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri district. SP chief Akilesh Yadav unveiled a statue of Patel in Hardoi, which has a significant population of Kurmis. BSP chief Mayawati too paid tributes to Patel saying there was a “dire need” to strengthen the harmony and unity in the country by following the path shown by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patels-rashtra-bhakti-made-india-a-formidable-nation-yogi/articleshow/87443518.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A number of workers were in the factory when they noticed smoke coming out of the godown at the rear. They rushed out, raised the alarm and informed the fire department. Flames had covered the rear of the unit.Sub-fire officer Aatish Rai, said, “We started dousing the blaze from the front part of the factory to restrict the flames to one side. With the help of a JCB machine, we broke a backside wall to reach the godown. Due to a huge quantity of yarn kept in the godown, the fire spread. At least 12 fire tenders were stationed at the spot and they made more than 50 rounds. The flames were brought under control around 2pm.” The rear of the building has developed cracks.As the factory is spread over a large area, the fire tenders had enough space to move around and act quickly.The factory owners said the cause of fire was yet to be ascertained and they were still to calculate the loss incurred.The incident created panic in the area, with thick, black smoke covering the blue sky. With onlookers busy making videos and coming in the way of the fire-fighters’ work, cops had to chase them away. No water supply makes operation difficultThe firemen faced problems while carrying out the operation as there was no water supply on the premises as well as at nearby factories. The fire tenders were refilled from Sunder Nagar fire station, which took much time due to traffic jams on national highway. The fire tenders had to take the route of Samrala Chowk and Basti Jodhewal Chowk, which was longer and congested. They took at least 20 minutes to reach the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/major-fire-breaks-out-at-kakka-road-yarn-factory/articleshow/87433809.cms||---

Jewellery worth Rs1.74 lakh was reported missing from the flat, police said, and added the assailant(s) used a heavy, blunt object to bludgeon the victim, who lived. Her son, Virat (39), who stays in an adjoining building, found her injured and motionless when he visited her flat around 10pm on Saturday, police said. Virat, a technician with a city hospital, called the police control room following which a Sinhagad Road police team rushed to the flat. A forensic team was summoned there to collect clues. The front door of the flat was bolted from the outside. Virat and his wife made a few calls to Shalini around 10pm before he reached the flat to check on her, police said. Inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Sinhagad Road police told TOI, “We suspect the murder occurred sometime between 12.30pm and 10pm. The bedroom cupboard was found open and things inside were scattered all over the place. Her son told us that gold ornaments totally worth Rs1.74 lakh were missing.” He said, “A preliminary post-mortem report has come with an ‘opinion reserved’ remark. For now, we are going by the theory of theft as the motive behind the murder. We will investigate further to see if there is any other angle. The suspect(s) left the gold ornaments, worn by the victim, untouched.” “Similarly, silver ornaments of a deity in an altar and cash of over Rs5,000 in a nearby small cupboard were left untouched. We searched the flat but did not find any murder weapon. Our team did not find any signs of a forced entry. The neighbours did not hear any commotion,” he added. Shalini’s husband, who was a village development officer at Ghodegaon in Manchar, died in 2009. She was living on his pension.

---||Lucknow||Chanting slogans in support of enemy country won’t be tolerated: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Days after sedition charges were slapped on sedition charges on three Kashmiri students in Agra for celebrating Pakistan’s victory against India in the recent T20 World Cup cricket match, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday made it clear that his government would “not tolerate” people who stand in support of the “enemy country” and praise it. “Agar Hindustan mein rahenge toh Hindustan ke prati natmastak hona padega…unhein har haal mein samman vyakt bhi karna padega….Bharat mein rah kar ke, Bharat ki dharti ka ann kha kar ke agar Pakistan ke gun gaoge to usi layak bana denge jis layak Bhartiya sena un logon ko banati hai,” he said while speaking to a news channel in Ayodhya where he had gone to review preparation for Deepotsav ahead of Diwali. Yogi maintained that he was not against praising a particular player if he/she performs well. “Win and loss are part of the game. But if you start raising slogan in support of an enemy country then it won’t be tolerated”. It will come under the category of `desh droh’ (treason) and we will take strict action against them,” he maintained. Yogi said that his government had also taken action against people who supported Taliban. “We will not let anyone take law in his hand. We will not let anyone spread anarchy and disorder in the state,” the CM said. The Pakistan cricket team had defeated the Indian side by 10 wickets in a Super 12 game in Dubai on Sunday. On Thursday, a total of five cases were registered against seven people in Agra, Bareilly, Budaun and Sitapur for allegedly using indecent words against the Indian cricket team and celebrating Pakistan’s vicory. Yogi also said that lord Ram was not associated with politics and was not a mean to retain power. “Ram is faith of the Bharat. No one can imagine Bharat without Ram,” he said, asserting that it was victory of BJP ideology that people who used to call Ram an imaginary figure have started accepting his existence. He compared the opposition leaders with the Mughal era rulers saying that both “served the interest of their families”. Yogi categorically termed the erstwhile “disputed structure” in Ayodhya and elsewhere a “sign of slavery” which “insulted the cultural identity” of the country. “Whoever opposed Ram got ruined,” he said, adding that Ram Rajya did not mean a religious state or rule of a particular community. “Ram Rajya for us means elevating the status of poor, providing them a house, electricity and gas,” he said. On the issue of Lakhimpur violence, Yogi said that the incident was unfortunate and a special investigation team was probing the case. "We are waiting for the report after which our party leaders would meet the families of the affected farmers," he said. Yogi also countered Congress' recent announcement of reserving 40% tickets for women saying that if the party was actually bothered about women then it should appoint a women from outside Gandhi family like Aradhna Mishra Mona (CLP leader in UP assembly) as party president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-chanting-slogans-in-support-ofenemy-country-wont-be-tolerated/articleshow/87443533.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||First in decade, cotton rates sustain 30% above MSP||NAGPUR: Opening on a higher side, prices of raw cotton continued to soar probably first time in last one decade with region’s agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) recording over Rs 8,500 per quintal. Amid the windfall, rumours of raw cotton fetching Rs 9,500/quintal at Achalpur open market went viral in several social media groups on Saturday. A purported bill issued by a ginner too was attached to the social media post. Achalpur APMC secretary Pawan Kumar said a complaint against the rumour mongering has been lodged with Paratwada police. “No such auction valued at Rs9,500 took place in Achalpur. Auctions started a couple of days back and the highest rate offered here is Rs8,500/quintal. The arrivals are good, with around 10 to 15 quintals a day,” said Kumar. A former APMC office-bearer at Achalpur claimed the news about higher rate is being deliberately spread to attract more cotton growers. “The current administration has recently taken over and it is under pressure to guarantee higher rates. About 10 quintals were sold at the high rates, which too may not be paid to the farmer citing quality issues later,” he said. Yet the mood among farmers and other APMC members is upbeat. The raw cotton rates normally come down after the opening day, but this year high demand has ensured growers get nearly 30 to 40% more than the minimum support price of Rs6,025 per quintal. Tukaram Chambhare, secretary of Hinganghat APMC yard which is a major cotton hub of Central India, said traditionally prices fall after the opening day sale, but due to higher demand of bales, the rates have gone up this time. Around 40% less production is another factor for the spike in prices and it is expected that the procurement season would close in three months. GH Wairale, former general manager, Maharashtra Cotton Growers Federation, said domestic consumption has increased as compared to availability of the produce. “Ideally, five pluckings are achieved in a cotton season from September to August. But this time, all cotton would be collected in two or three pluckings. The delayed withdrawal of rains has affected the produce,” he said. Wairale explained there is not enough stock to export. “The difference between international and domestic prices is not much. Hence, the export estimation is also pegged 40% low. Unless good returns are assured, exports are not happening,” he said. On November 2, the crop committee of Cotton Association of India (CAI) would be meeting to assess the shortfall in production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/first-in-decade-cotton-rates-sustain-30-above-msp/articleshow/87442145.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Derby is too early for East Bengal, but can’t give excuses: Manolo||Panaji: Manuel ‘Manolo’ Diaz gets reminded of the Kolkata derby all the time. During training, while addressing a press conference, having meals, travelling, or even just lazing on the lawns of the team hotel, the SC East Bengal coach is told just what the derby means to everyone at the club. Manolo, though, has seen it all in Madrid with Real versus Atletico. “The people at East Bengal – players, technical staff, members – they talk about the derby all the time,” Manolo said while speaking exclusively to TOI. “We know the importance of the derby, we know the history, we know what it means to the fans and we surely need those three points.” The former Real Madrid reserve team manager is new to East Bengal. He took over from Robbie Fowler less than two months ago and goes into this season with a hastily-arranged team. Fowler lost both derbies against bitter rivals ATK Mohun Bagan last season. But while Manolo starts almost afresh, he’ll have little time to settle down before the derby knocks at the door. “Our second match in the Indian Super League (on November 27) will be the derby. It’s too soon because we are now improving our level through friendlies and games. But we don’t look for excuses. We will be ready for the derby. “Also, we know the level of our opponents, the level of the coach (Antonio Habas) who has a lot of experience in India. As a squad they have been together for years. Also, they started the season maybe two and half months earlier. But we are not looking at any excuses. We will give 100 percent,” said Manolo. East Bengal have played three friendlies so far, winning all, against Vasco SC, Salgaocar FC and Gokulam Kerala. The coach has had a good look at his players for a month now, but these are still early days. “We have a short period of time to work with the team,” said the coach. “We have to improve the level of the squad, the skills of the players. The coaching staff is assessing the players week-by-week, match-by-match.” After being assessed during friendlies and training, eight of the players were told they have no role to play in the ISL, even before the league has kicked off. All of them have reluctantly left the team hotel, some grumbling that they didn’t get enough chances to impress. Manolo, though, says the decision to cut down on the squad was a “professional one.” “The size of the squad is too big. Now the final size is 24 plus three goalkeepers. That’s the ideal number for a professional team. To leave out the players is a professional football decision, and we think the size now is the best to work and improve,” said Manolo. East Bengal finished ninth among 11 teams last season, winning just three of their 20 league matches and losing both derbies against their fiercest rivals. Manolo is now looking to write a new chapter, though with another season where they were left to choose from an extremely limited pool of domestic players, it won’t be an easy task. “We are ambitious and want the best for East Bengal, but know that the work started late this season. We are training for a short period of time. We know it’s difficult, but we want to do the best possible. “This season, East Bengal have to take it step-by-step, week-by-week, match-by-match, because that’s the best way to improve our level. We know last season was bad, but we hope our numbers this year will improve,” said Manolo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/derby-is-too-early-for-east-bengal-but-cant-give-excuses-manolo/articleshow/87473690.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Lucknow||Will you apologize for firing at Ram Bhakts in Ayodhya in 1990, Yogi asks SP||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday mounted a fresh attack on Samajwadi Party, asking if it would apologise to Hindus for firing at hundreds of kar sevaks in Ayodhya on November 2, 1990. Terming the Opposition, particularly Samajwadi Party leaders as “Ram Drohis and poshak of aatankwad (betrayers of Ram who nurture terror)”, Yogi said, “kabhi kabhi to inke kritya dekh ke girgit bhi sharma jayega (even chameleons will be ashamed by their acts).” “Now, they are in the dock. What we would say about Ramjanmabhoomi was upheld by the Supreme Court. The same people will soon disguise themselves as followers of Ram. They will peddle lies and raise misleading slogans to woo people,” he said, while speaking at ‘Samijik Pratinidhi Sammelan’ hosted by BJP. Yogi also said, people should have “faith” in the current national leadership which strives for “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India)”. Emphasising that the nation’s image had improved dramatically after 2014 when BJP came to power at the Centre, Yogi hit out at the previous Congress-led UPA over multiple scams and leaving the country in “anarchy”. “Except during tenures of former PM and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, no one wanted to discuss ‘Bharat’ and ‘Bharatiyata’ between 1947 and 2014,” he said, asserting even the poor, farmers, traders, youth and women were never the priority of previous governments. “It was only the notion of ‘My Family’ which assumed prominence at the national and state level,” he said in a veiled attack on Congress. “These people constructed big ‘havelis’ (mansions) for themselves, but did not bother about the poor,” Yogi said. “It is only under the government led by PM Modi that 3crore poor got houses and 8 crore people received free gas connection,” he said, accusing Congress of indulging in black marketing of LPG. Yogi further said his government could provide a robust law and order structure in the state because of a “double engine” government and there was no room for individuals of a community, caste or religion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-you-apologize-for-firing-at-ram-bhakts-in-ayodhya-in-1990-yogi-asks-sp/articleshow/87443545.cms||Pankaj Shah

Offering obeisance to Ramjanmabhoomi in such trying conditions is commendable. I will seek blessing from Lord Ram for the courageous girl,” Yogi told reporters before driving down to Ayodhya. The chief minister displayed a tiny bottle carrying water from Kabul river, which was sent to PM Narendra Modi. Yogi said, he will offer Kabul water along with ‘Ganga Jal’ at Ramjanmabhoomi. “It’s a welcome gesture from people who want to preserve ‘Bharatiyata’ and respect their religious places of worship,” he said, asserting it was a matter of pride to see a Ram Temple coming up after breaking shackles that “enslaved” the people. “The temple is associated with sentiments of the country and the world,” he said. Later, speaking to a news channel, Yogi affirmed water from Kabul held relevance “since Kaikai was from Afghanistan”. “Kaikai na hoti toh Ram aaj bhagwan Ram na ho pate,” he said. Yogi was also scheduled to review preparations of five-day Deepotsav from Monday that would see illumination of 12 lakh earthen lamps to set a new record, the last before the 2022 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-offers-kabul-river-water-sent-by-hindu-afghan-girl-at-ramjanmabhoomi/articleshow/87443561.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Railway stations and ISBTs in Delhi gearing up for festive rush||NEW DELHI: The festive season is on and a surge in the number of passengers is expected at the capital’s railway stations and inter-state bus terminals (ISBT). While the railway and transport authorities are geared up with special arrangements to cater to the rush, this time they have the additional responsibility of ensuring that Covid-19 safety protocols are maintained. At the New Delhi Railway Station, tents have come up like every year to act as ‘temporary waiting halls’ to avoid crowding at platforms. There is, however, added emphasis on ensuring social distancing, both at the waiting areas and inside the railway station. “The festival season continues for around 40 days, which includes Diwali and Chhath festival, when special trains are deployed and special arrangements are made at railway stations to cater to the rush,” a Northern Railway official said. “The temporary waiting area is already in place to protect passengers from the elements and to also avoid crowding at platforms. However, we are now making more frequent announcements that include messages to ensure that Covid protocol is maintained, apart from the usual ones about train arrivals and departures, passenger assistance etc.,” he said, adding that additional teams of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) have been deployed, who are also making separate announcements. The official said that the waiting area has more water dispensers this time, apart from food counters serving food items at economical rates and information counters. “The arrangements have been made to ensure that passengers wouldn’t need to enter the platform until close to the arrival time of the train they want to board,” he said. As part of security arrangements and crowd management measures, Northern Railways has CCTV cameras under Integrated Security System in place at all major stations and at reservation centres. Special trains for the festive season are also usually ‘distributed’ across major stations to avoid overcrowding at any particular railway station. Apart from entry gates and platforms, the railway authorities are also ensuring that there is no crowding at the foot overbridges. The festive season witnesses more crowding for the unreserved coaches and which is why trains are brought in locked condition to the platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/railway-stations-and-isbts-gearing-up-for-festive-rush/articleshow/87442216.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He was speaking at a party rally held in Hardoi on Sunday. “Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Jinnah had studied in the same institute, later became barristers and fought for India’s freedom. “During their struggle for the country’s independence, they did not back out. Sardar Patel, also known as ‘Iron man of India’ did not hesitate to ban the organisation which propagated a particular ideology that was against the nation’s ethos. Today, the same people who are talking about uniting the country are dividing us in castes and religions”, Akhilesh said. He said Sardar Patel believed in the prosperity of farmers. “If the people sitting in the government want to pay tribute to Sardar Patelin a true way, then they should scrap all the three agricultural black laws”. “We cannot forget the contribution of Sardar Patel after the country got independence. He brought all the princely states into the Indian union”, he added. He said “Today, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, we all should take a pledge to ensure the prosperity of farmers. The people in power have enacted three black anti-farmer laws. If these laws are implemented, the control on agriculture will go in the hands of industrialists,” he said. Without taking the name of the CM of Uttar Pradesh, the former chief minister said, “We know that the ‘Baba’ CM does not know how to operate a laptop but recently a government official told me that he (Baba CM) even cannot operate a mobile phone. “Just think those who are unable to operate mobile phones or laptops in today’s era, will they ever understand the youths and their problems,” he added. “Whenever the Samajwadi Vijay Rath ran, the Samajwadi Party government was formed”, the SP president said. “When my party was in power in UP, we gave ‘UP100’ like the New York Police,” he said and added,” The system was such that even if someone from the village called at the number, the police would come to help him. But “Baba CM” when came to power changed “UP 100” to “Dial 112”.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/those-who-talk-about-unity-are-dividing-us-on-caste-communal-lines-akhilesh/articleshow/87443599.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Goa||Revised RERA rules allow return of registration fees||Panaji: Close to four years after the Goa Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act was formulated and notified, the Goa RERA has finally framed norms to return the registration fee paid by an agent or builder. Real estate agents have to pay up to Rs 1 lakh and real estate developers Rs 50,000 to Rs 10 lakh for registration with RERA. However, if the registration is rejected, the present norms have no scope to return the funds. The promoter may apply for withdrawal of application for registration of the real estate project within 30 days of submitting it to the authority. In such cases, the registration fee to the extent of 10% or Rs 50,000, whichever is higher, is retained as processing charges, while the remaining amount is supposed to be refunded within 30 days. “The authority has come across cases of different nature where project exempted from registration as the project received completion certificate prior to the cut off date determined by the government or cases where the RERA registration was rejected due to non-submission of required information,” chairperson of Goa RERA S Kumaraswamy said.Real estate brokerage firms have to pay Rs 1 lakh while an individual real estate agent has to pay Rs 10,000 to register. “The act and rule is silent about returning the registration fee of the agent in case registration is not accorded. The authority has deliberated in detail the provisions under the said act and rules and has decided to regulate the return of registration fee of real estate project and real estate agent,” Kumaraswamy said. The RERA has now decided that in the case of an exempted real estate project, the authority may deduct 1% of the registration fee or Rs 1,000, whichever is more, and return the remaining amount. Builders who want to withdraw their registration within the 30-day period will have to forfeit 10% or Rs 50,000, while the rest will be returned. “In the case of a real estate project where registration is rejected after hearing, registration fee to the extent of 10% or Rs 50,000 whichever is more would be deducted. Such projects will be registered with charging fee afresh on furnishing required documents,” he said. Real estate brokers who want to withdraw their registration within the initial 30 day period will be charged 10% of the registration fee and the remaining amount will be returned. If the registration application was rejected, then 10% or Rs 50,000 will be deducted. Goa RERA has also decided that all unclaimed fees will be treated as revenue and all future claims will be decided on a case to case basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revised-rera-rules-allow-return-of-registration-fees/articleshow/87443733.cms||Newton Sequeira

On Sunday, Wakad police inspector Santosh Patil said, “We have registered a case against the senior engineer and the junior engineer, besides, the site supervisor of a construction firm which was hired by the project developer for the slab work. They have been booked under section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code." Vivek Mugalikar, senior inspector of the Wakad police, told TOI, “There were eight workers atop the slab. They were preparing to come down after filling the cement concrete mixture when the accident happened. Three workers escaped unhurt and the remaining five sustained injuries.” The construction site Avon Vista is located along the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass at Patilnagar in Wakad. The project consists of six buildings of 20 floors of which two have been completed, while one is near completion. “The construction work of other three buildings is underway,” an engineer at the site. Ranjeet Naiknavare, director of Naiknavare Developers, told TOI, “The accident took place when the slab work of the podium was going on. It was unfortunate. The injuries to the workers are not severe. Our first preference is to provide all the medical assistance to the injured workers and support their families.” Sujit Patil, fire officer from the PMRDA fire brigade, told TOI, “When the fire brigade team reached the spot, the engineers and other workers had already shifted the injured workers to a nearby hospital. After confirming no one stuck under the debris, we stopped the operation.” Inspector Santosh Patil of the Wakad police, who visited the spot, said that prima facie the steel support framework of the podium slab could not sustain the load and caved in slowly due to which the workers escaped with minor injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/7-injured-as-metal-frames-of-slab-cave-in-3-booked/articleshow/87440555.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Heavy vehicles on the downhill slope travel at a high speed and it becomes difficult for the drivers to apply sudden brakes if they spot a vehicle making its way onto the bypass via the illegal punctures or vehicles slowing down to exit from the bypass,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame. “Residents use the illegal entry and exit points to commute daily. We want them to use the service lanes to avert accidents on the bypass. Life is more important,” he said. He said they put forth this demand during a meeting called by the Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol last week, following three accidents on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. The NHAI officials had also attended the meeting. A senior NHAI officer said, “We can plug these punctures in the road railings, but there isopposition from the locals. The police and civic officials should first create a friendly atmosphere for this work and then we will execute it. We suspect that if we plug these illegal points, the residents will break the railings or will remove the cement blocks to make an entry or exit from the bypass.” Shrirame said, “People from Narhe and adjoining areas can move on the service lane till Navale bridge and then join the bypass lanes. We have requested NHAI officials to make proper channeling between the Navale bridge and Vadgaon Bridge.” The illegal entry-exit points on the 10km stretch between New Katraj Tunnel and Navale bridge include — near Katraj Tunnel, near Dari Pul, at Jambhulwadi and three between Bhumkar bridged and Navale bridge. Truck driver injured A truck driver injured his hand after his vehicle hit another truck plying ahead on Bhumkar bridge on Sunday morning. The truck was heading towards Mumbai from Satara. “The truck’s cabin was damaged. The driver said he lost control over the vehicle on the slope,” a Sinhagad Road police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-tell-nhai-to-block-all-illegal-openings-on-bypass/articleshow/87440522.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Mishra’s ultimatum came a day after Ashutosh Dubey, legal advisor to Maharashtra BJP, slapped a legal notice on Sabyasachi."I have warned earlier, and I am issuing a personal warning to Sabyasachi Mukherjee. I’m giving him an ultimatum of 24 hours to withdraw the ad or else an FIR will be registered against him, legal action will be taken, and force will be sent," Mishra said.

With issues relating to distance, legal hurdles and proximity to a firing range weighing down the earlier two allotted lands at Daund and Wadachiwadi, the CID has started a fresh hunt for an apt location to set up its proposed dog training school. CID trains puppies, aged three months, for a period of six months. They are trained to identify narcotic substances, explosives and to chase suspects involved in house-break-ins and crimes like murder and rape. “We are working on a 25 acre land at Baramati, which is sufficient to set up the facility,” CID chief Ritesh Kumar told TOI. As of now, the CID’s dog training school is operating out of the Shivajinagar police headquarters. The facility is small as it can accommodate only 26 dogs and it does not have a hostel-like facility for dog handlers. Seven years ago, the state government had allotted a 13acre land at Daund, but the CID did not proceed to acquire the land due to distance from the city and other legal issues. Last year, the state allotted a 5acre land at Wadachiwadi near Kondhwa, but it was close to a police firing range. “We conducted a feasibility study of the land and found that continuous firing will disturb the dogs. In such an atmosphere, it will be difficult to train them,” the CID chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-cid-hunts-for-land-for-proposed-dog-training-school/articleshow/87440567.cms||---

As the duo was taken to SSKM Hospital, Priyanka was declared dead. The condition of Advika, an aspirant for NEET, was stated to be stable. “We might record her statement in next 48 hours,” said an officer of Rabindra sarobar police station. The accused said that after his daughter secured 95% marks in her Class XII boards, he had admitted her in swimming class as per her wish. This led to a major argument with his wife. He claimed that on Saturday evening, he had asked for the keys to open the locker as he needed some silver utensils for Diwali. The couple got involved in a heated argument over opening the locker and suddenly, Arvind attacked his wife with a kitchen knife. Cops will speak to Arvind’s daughter and in-laws. “The in-laws lodged a complaint of misbehaviour against him while his wife had earlier spoken to cops about this,” said the officer. “Arvind had called the police, hoping that they would come with an ambulance and his daughter could be shifted to the hospital,” said a family friend of the accused on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/couple-fought-over-silver-utensils-cops/articleshow/87442283.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Barmer district collector Lok Bandhu initiated the distribution of 21,000 earthen lamps under the initiative at the district collectorate premises on Sunday. Additional district collector OP Vishnoi, municipal council commissioner Daleep Punia, Jodhpur discom SE Ajay Mathur, team Barmer patron Dr BD Tater, Babita and convener Suresh Jatol were also present. The administration workers later distributed the lamps in several colonies. Bandhu urged the residents to support the potters and buy earthen products like lamps, accessories and utensils. He said several artisans were forced to quit their family businesses as the demand for earthen lamps had reduced. However, the green initiative of the administration has brought smiles to the faces of the local potters, who were disappointed due to the hold of Chinese items in the markets. Potters said at least the collectors thought about the poor. Coordinator Suresh Jatol said, "We have a target of distributing 21,000 earthen lamps and we have already covered several areas." The Jaisalmer administration will start the distribution of earthen lamps on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barmer-admn-starts-distributing-earthen-lamps-among-people/articleshow/87442325.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Priyanka invokes Yogi’s guru in his backyard, says he runs counter to his master’s teachings||Gorakhpur: In a deft political move, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi rallied people in Yogi’s backyard Gorakhpur and invoked his guru, Gorakshnath, telling surging crowds that chief minister Yogi Adityanath was working against the teachings of his own guru, who professed love, harmony and acceptance of all sections of society, including poor and impoverished. “In Yogi’s regime, weavers, backwards, minorities and Brahmins are being exploited and harassed,” she said at the Pratigya rally. She took a giant leap to woo Nishads by promising a university in the name of their guru, Machchendranath, and giving them rights over river and sand even as she reiterated her pledge to reserve 40% tickets for women in 2022 assembly elections. “I want to tell my sisters, I will fight for you, Congress will empower you. When 40% women enter politics, they will change the face of politics”. Priyanka also remembered her grandmother, Indira Gandhi, on her death anniversary, saying: “She knew she could be killed, but never bowed down. It is because of her that I am standing in front of you and I will never break your faith”. Responding to Samajwadi Party’s jibe that she was hand in glove with BJP, she said, “Why don't they stand by you in your tough times? I will die, but I will never have any relationship with BJP. You know who shut down sugarcane mills established during Congress governments here. SP and BSP regimes shut mills and they are saying Congress is working in collusion with BJP,” she said. Raking up the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, she said: “The way farmers were mowed down in Lakhimpur Kheri and the fact no one heard their plight shows the reality of this government. Houses of poor were bulldozed, a Dalit man was killed by Agra police before his wife, Nishad community’s boats were burnt in Prayagraj, farmers committed suicide due to fertilizer scarcity and Kanpur businessman, Manish Gupta, was killed by police in a Gorakhpur hotel.” There is a stark difference between the ground reality and BJP’s ad blitz on development schemes, she said. “When I tour the state, villagers say PM Modi and CM Yogi are repeatedly talking about development, then it must be happening somewhere. So, what if it hasn’t reached our door," she said. Hitting out at rising fuel prices, Priyanka said, “PM Modi claims people wearing ‘hawai chappals’ could travel by air, but unfortunately they are unable to travel on road due to skyrocketing fuel prices.” Talking on the issue of minimum support price for sugarcane produce, the Congress leader cornered the Yogi Adityanath government, saying: “Why are you raising MSP now? What have you been doing in the last 4.5 years?” Sharing the stage with Priyanka Gandhi, Chhattisgarh’s Congress chief minister Bhupesh Baghel termed chief minister Yogi Adiyanath as ‘Bulldozernath’ and said they follow the tradition of those who touch Mahatma Gandhi’s feet and then stab him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/priyanka-invokes-yogis-guru-in-his-backyard-says-he-runs-counter-to-his-masters-teachings/articleshow/87443702.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Mkts abuzz with shoppers, Diwali purchases to grow 30% over 2019||Jaipur: Decked up bazaars and crowded markets better describe the sentiment of people leading up to Diwali celebrations. After lacklustre festival last year due to the fear of a deadly disease, job losses, shuttered businesses, people are excited to get soaked in the festivities. Footfall in shops, stores, and showrooms selling gold jewellery, silverware, TVs, refrigerators, furniture, cars and other household items have been rising over the past few days, said representatives of many market associations. Suresh Agarwal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI) said, “Long traffic on the road is a good indicator how people are excited to go to market and make purchases. Demand for everything has increased. There is short supply of cars and items imported from China. The sentiment has certainly improved vastly.” Market associations in various areas feel the transactions during this Diwali would be at least 30% more than 2019, which was a non-Covid year. Kailash Mittal, president of Sarafa Traders Committee, said, “There is a good demand for gold jewellery and silverware. We expect to sell 30% more than what we did in 2019.” But the automobile dealers cannot capitalise on the rush of buyers. Car production has lagged demand due to chip shortage. Sai Girdhar, a car dealer in Jaipur said, “We cannot meet the demand for cars. The supply has fallen short of demand. But this is going to be a much better Diwali. We will sell at least 25% more cars than we did during 2019 Diwali season.” Representatives of market associations said that purchases of white goods have also picked up. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapar Mahasangh, said, “The demand for TVs, refrigerators, washing machines and other white goods started coming in from one month back and now it is in full swing. The segment will see 25% increase over the Diwali sales of 2019 and about 60% more compared to 2020.” With the chances of third wave receding, people who had surplus money are now opening the purse strings as well. “Earlier people who had surplus money were cautious because of a possible third wave. But the chances of it receding due to the vaccine coverage of larger population, they are now buying the things they had postponed earlier,” added Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mkts-abuzz-with-shoppers-diwali-purchases-to-grow-30-over-2019/articleshow/87442308.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The city recorded the poorest air in the past three months (since July 2) on Sunday, when the air quality index (AQI) was 254. The value comes under the poor category and can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Last week, the AQI was mostly moderate, shows the data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The data of the month shows that on October 12, the AQI in Ludhiana was under poor category with a value of 205. For six days, it was 150 or more. For nine days, it was between 100 and less-than-150, which comes under the moderate category with possible health impacts as “breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases”. For another six days, it was below 100 but above 50, which comes under satisfactory category with “minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people”. For nine days, the AQI was not available for city. In September, the AQI was mostly satisfactory. On two of its days, it was in moderate category with more than 100 value. In August as well, the AQI was in satisfactory category. On four of its days, it was moderate with maximum value of 127.This October was better, as the previous year, the month saw eight days when AQI was poor in the city; the value was between 150 and less-than-200 for 10 days; between 100 and less-than-150 for 10 days and between 50 and less-than-100 on three days. In 2019, the AQI was above 200 but below 300 on nine days of the month; once it was very poor; on five days it was above 150 but below 200; on 11 days it was above 50 but below 100; and on one day it was in good category (with value of 37).Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) authorities say AQI rises during this season.Chief environmental engineer of PPCB in Ludhiana Gulshan Rai says, “There are multiple factors for rise in AQI, like bursting of crackers during festivals, stubble burning and weather. As temperatures have fallen, dissipation of air pollutants doesn’t take place as compared with when the temperature is higher.”The residents, meanwhile, want the authorities to get cracking.“The authorities should check bursting of crackers that pollute the air and stubble burning,” says Narinder Singh, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-records-worst-air-quality-in-three-months/articleshow/87434038.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Goa||AFC Women’s Club Championship: With little time on hand, Gokulam Kerala look to get combination right||Panaji: Not everything has gone according to plan for Gokulam Kerala FC in their preparation for next week’s AFC Women’s Club Championship in Jordan. Vincenzo Annese, their men’s team coach, was on a scouting mission in Ghana when he took time off to watch women play as well. At least three players caught his eye, but they did well in the league and got national calls. “These players were unavailable because their assignments clashed with the AFC Women’s Club Championship,” said club president VC Praveen. Next on the list was another bunch of impressive players from Uganda. Gokulam Kerala missed them too, thanks to their engagements with the national team. The Indian Women’s League (IWL) champions continued their hunt for players across the world and ended up signing five of them from four different continents. The foreign players include Adriana Tirado (Puerto Rico), Win Theingi Tun (Myanmar), Karen Steffany (Colombia), Susan Duah and Elshaddai Acheampong (both Ghana). “They key to our success will be the combination and understanding with the foreigners,” coach PV Priya told TOI. “If we get it right, we have a chance. Our (foreign) players are good, but maybe they’ll need time to succeed.” Time is in short supply for Gokulam Kerala as the team has few days to prepare for the pilot tournament. Priya, also India’s assistant coach, herself took charge of the team four days ago, along with 10 other players who are part of the national team preparing for Asian Cup 2022 at home. “I am not worried about the domestic players. Since there are 10 from the national team who have been training and playing together, we have an advantage. But we need to align different playing styles,” said Priya. The AFC Women’s Club Championship kicks off next week in Jordan where the IWL champions will test themselves against Amman Club (Jordan), FC Bunyodkor (Uzbekistan) and Shahrdari Sirjan (Iran). This is a first for Indian football, but that won’t stop Gokulam Kerala from aiming for the top. “We are preparing to become champions,” said Praveen. “Whenever we play, our thinking is to go for victory. We won the women’s league in our second season and the need of the hour is to take women's football to the next level. “It’s true that one of our shortcomings has been that we do not have enough time to train (with the full team) since the national camp is being held simultaneously. But we cannot discount the fact that these players now have gained so much experience playing internationally.” Praveen said the players have been told that they are not just representing the club, or the state of Kerala. That the goal in Jordan is much bigger. “We have told the girls that winning is not just important for the club and the state but also Indian football. When we started (the women’s team in Kerala), there were few players, but our league triumph made a lot of difference. “Now there are about 20-25 good players. Kerala is starting a women’s league too with seven or eight teams. That’s a big change. Our triumph in Jordan can be a game changer,” said Praveen. TEAM: Aditi Chauhan, Shreya Hooda, Ranjana Chanu, Manju Baby, Ritu Rani, Dalima Chibber, Soumya Guguloth, Adriana Tirado (Puerto Rico), Win Theingi Tun (Myanmar), Manisha, Dangmei Grace, Jyoti, Kashmina, Elshaddai Acheampong (Ghana), Karishma Shirvoikar, Anusha Samuel, Samiksha, Karen Steffany (Colombia), Sonali Chemate, Susan Duah (Ghana), Michel Castanha, Heera Raj, Femina Valappil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-womens-club-championship-with-little-time-on-hand-gokulam-kerala-look-to-get-combination-right/articleshow/87473766.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kochi||Kerala: Landslides, flash floods wash away hopes of children||IDUKKI: Vaiga, a Class 6 student of Olayanad School near Mukkulam in Enthayar, was eagerly waiting to go to school and meet her friends after a long time since the pandemic. But the serial landslides and flash floods destroyed her house and books, and the family was shifted to a relief camp. The family with three children temporarily moved to a relative’s house from the relief camp. “The teachers from the school called me and agreed to provide books and notes when we reach the school on Monday,” Vaiga said. Not just Vaiga, the flash floods washed away the hopes of nearly 200 students under Kokkayar panchayat in Idukki. According to Kokkayar panchayat secretary Aji K Panicker the serial landslides and floods destroyed many homes in the panchayat, and the books and gadgets were also destroyed. Madhu, a parent from Mukkulam, hoped that the government would provide books and other necessities to their kids to continue their studies. Kuttiveli Anish, a parent staying in a relief camp at Kanakapuram, said that his children studying in classes 5 and 3 had waited eagerly to meet their friends. “After the landslides, we shifted to a relief camp. The bridge which connected the school was destroyed, so now we have to travel an extra 7km to reach the school,” said Anish. Jobin Yendayar, a social worker, said that after the Mukkulam bridge was destroyed due to the landslide the students needed to travel more to reach their school. Idukki district collector Sheeba George said that the schools which functioned in the district as relief camps will be closed till November 3. Peruvanthanam panchayat secretary B Vinod said, presently, there is no way to shift the relief camps from the schools. “In Peruvanthanam alone, 54 homes were totally destroyed and the victims are marginalized people and they have no other shelter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kokkayar-floods-wash-away-hopes-of-kids/articleshow/87442327.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Delhi||Charges of murder & rioting against four in NE riots case||New Delhi: A Delhi court has framed murder and rioting charges against four people in two cases related to the deaths of two Muslim men during the northeast Delhi riots, saying that there was no escape from the conclusion at this stage that they were members of an unlawful assembly, the object of which was to cause riots, vandalism, destruction of property, etc. and they were part of the riotous mob that killed the victims. It further said that it was evident that if the evidence collected during the course of investigation and annexed to the chargesheet remains unrebutted, the conviction of the accused is reasonably possible. “They were identified by the eyewitness Shashikant Kashyap and have been specifically named by him. Electronic evidence produced along with the chargesheet shows their presence at the place of incident and in the mob. Thus, the material on record prima facie discloses commission of offence of rioting, murder etc. by the accused,” Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said in similar orders on October 30. The court, however, added that there was nothing on record to suggest that deceased Zakir and Ashfaq Hussain were killed in pursuance to any conspiracy hatched by the accused. “It appears that the accused developed the common intention to kill at the spur of the moment during the riotous clashes. The material on record does not indicate any prior agreement between the accused to kill deceased Zakir, which is the sine qua non for the charge of conspiracy. Therefore, the charge of criminal conspiracy u/s 120 B IPC is not made out against the accused,” it observed. It framed charges of 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder) against Ashok Kumar, Ajay, Subham and Jitender Kumar. It discharged accused Arif from the charge of murder in the case. Special Public Prosecutor, appearing for the police, submitted that Arif belonged to the Muslim community and was present with another faction of mob comprising of people belonging to his community, which had also allegedly resorted to violence. Advocate Abdul Gaffar Khan, appearing for Arif, submitted that it was the case of prosecution itself that he was in the mob consisting of people belonging to Muslim community, which was not involved in the killing of the deceased. The counsel for the other accused had argued that Kashyap was not a reliable witness. It was argued that since the witness was not seen in any photograph or CCTV footage of the spot, his presence at the spot becomes doubtful. The court said, “…considering the manner in which he has narrated the entire incident, it is difficult to accept at this stage that he was not present near the crime spot and had not witnessed the killings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charges-of-murder-rioting-against-four-in-ne-riots-case/articleshow/87443713.cms||Usha Das

The complainant is unemployed. He and his friends had decided to secure a job abroad and had obtained passports. Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Wanowrie police citing the FIR and said, “The victims learnt about Gosavi’s agency through word-of-mouth. They visited an office located in Camp in November 2018 and had a primary discussions. Following this, they visited Sanpada in Navi Mumbai where Gosavi had his office for further discussions. Following this, the trio paid a sum of Rs 1.45 lakh collectively after Gosavi and his two aides promised them jobs in a hotel in Malaysia.” According to the FIR, Gosavi and his aides did not process their documents, and they could not travel to Malaysia. They approached Gosavi’s agency again and demanded that they be sent to Malaysia or their money be returned. “When the complainant and his friends started demanding their money back, Gosavi showed them a pistol and issued threats of dire consequences if they demand a refund,” Lagad said.

Hence, the prices are up by 30% to 40% as compared to 2019. Jaipur police have issued temporary firecracker licenses to nearly 725 applicants after sorting about 1,000 applications. The wholesalers with permanent licenses said the retailers were still purchasing their stocks. "Usually, we start placing orders with the the manufacturers in August and start getting the crackers by September. This year, initially there was a ban and suddenly it was lifted. So, were not able to place orders on time," Bhagwan Das, a wholesaler of firecrackers at Kishanpole Bazaar. "Hence, with limited stocks and elevated demand, the prices have gone up. Also, as we were trying to place orders at the last moment. We are having to pay 15% extra. Which means retailers will charge 30% to 40% higher," he said. Meanwhile, only a few shops in the Walled City have green firecrackers despite the the specific directive by the government to sell only green firecrackers. "We have not got any green firecracker supply from the wholesalers. We had some stock of last year and have got some more," said a retail firecracker shop owner at Chandpole bazaar on the condition of anonymity. Retailers have decorated their firecracker shops to welcome buyers. "Customers will start coming from Monday it appears. So far, there has been a negligible sale. Prices are higher as we too have got it at higher prices," said Sunil Samtani, a retailer at Jhotwara. Markets are yet to see major footfall of customers. "The inclusion of green firecrackers has increased the cost. Also, in the past few years, the craze for firecrackers has gone down as people are aware about pollution. We also have a very limited stock this year," said Mustafa Saeed, who has permanent license for firecrackers, at the Hawa Mahal market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/firecrackers-dearer-by-40-as-retailers-dont-have-stocks/articleshow/87442341.cms||Ashish Mehta

Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the new higher secondary block at the AKG Memorial Government Higher Secondary School at Pinarayi on Sunday, Vijayan said that all adult members in houses with school-going children should get themselves vaccinated. “The ward-level committees should undertake monitoring in this regard and should encourage unvaccinated persons to get vaccinated. Also, it is very important that the children wear face masks, and care should be taken to ensure that the kids wear appropriate masks,” said the chief minister. “It is children who had to face the most difficulties due to the Covid pandemic as it is their time of growing up. As there is no vaccination drive for children currently, we have given them preventive homeo medicine,” he added. He said that the general education sector of the state had witnessed unprecedented developments during the last five years, and added that steps are underway as part of the Nava Kerala Mission to transform schools as centres of excellence. “The aim of Nava Kerala Mission is to ensure that all students have access to world-class education. The days when only a select few had access to quality education and the rest had to be content with not-so-good-quality education is over. From now on, everybody will be able to study in world-class schools and that is the change the state government is envisaging on the education front under the Nava Kerala Mission,” he added. Vijayan said that as a corollary of that, the higher education sector comprising colleges, universities and other higher education institutions will also witness a similar transformation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/maintain-high-vigil-take-appropriate-covid-precautions-cm/articleshow/87442371.cms||---

He was 88. Jog’s magnum opus was the Ganare Violin in Marathi, with a version in Hindi as well, where his mastery with the instrument made him able to reproduce popular tunes and songs in Marathi and Hindi film and non-film music. These were 80 solo events that captured many different moods and nuances. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed condolences on social media mourning Jog’s demise. Most famously, he collaborated with the composer Sudhir Phadke and the writer GD Madgulkar to produce the now-iconic Geet Ramayana albums which were broadcast on the All India Radio’s Pune station between 1955 and 1956. Jog collaborated with music composers in both the Hindi and Marathi film industries from Hridaynath Mangeshkar to SD Burman, Khayyam and Anu Malik. Jog was also a composer in his own right, with his composition Lapavilas Tu Hirwa Chapha being regarded by listeners and music critics as one of the finest examples of the Bhavgeet genre in Marathi. The song debuted on All India Radio in Pune with the vocals being recorded by his wife Neela. A visitor to his official website is greeted by his violin rendition of Lag Ja Gale composed by Madan Mohan and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. “The way he recreated songs in Ganare Violin was incredible. He was always an enthusiastic supporter of young violinists, encouraging and appreciating them,” said Atulkumar Upadhye, who runs a violin academy in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jog-who-made-the-violin-sing-passes-away-at-88/articleshow/87440703.cms||---

With this, the big cat population in the reserve has gone up to 77. The images of the tigress with the cubs were captured in a trap camera on October 29 at Chinawali top in the Khandar range. Expressing his happiness, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “It’s so good to see tigress T-63 with 3 new cubs in Ranthambore! The tigress with cubs is a sight to behold! Always a nice feeling that wildlife is thriving in Rajasthan.” this is the third litter for T-63, which was born to the famous big cat, T-19 named Krishna. The territory of the tigress encompasses Lahpur, Chinawali, Odikhoh area of the Khandar range. Head of forest force (HoFF) DN Pandey said, "The cubs are around 3 months old. The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve-1 has 20 adult male, 30 adult female tigers and 27 cubs." But increasing tiger population in the reserve means that space for big cats is decreasing. The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392 sq km with a buffer zone of 1,342 sq km. Of the total area of a little over 1,700 sq km in RTR, only 600 sq km can be used by tigers. As per a rough estimate, a male tiger requires approximately 25 sq km and a female about 15 sq km. The tiger population has been steadily increasing in the state. In September, tigress T-105 was spotted with three cubs in the Tapkan-Sultanpur area. As tigers in the reserve are squeezed for territory due to the high density, the chief conservator of forest (CCF) had put forward a proposal to relocate six of them. Three tigers and three tigresses were zeroed in for shifting and the proposal was sent to the chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The list consisted of male tigers T-113, T-121 and T-123 and female tigers T-119, T-124 and T-126. Sources said that senior forest officials were divided on the matter to shift tigers after receiving the proposal. “There was a view that the tigers should not be shifted from Ranthambore fearing territorial fights. Territorial fights will always occur in nature and the forest department should not intervene in the process,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/t-63-gives-birth-to-triplets-takes-tiger-count-to-77-in-rtr/articleshow/87443723.cms||---

---||Pune||In Pune rural, 17,000 disabled beneficiaries vaccinated||PUNE: With the inoculation of over 17,000 ‘divyang’ or disabled beneficiaries, Pune rural has taken a lead in the special category vaccination in the district. In the Pune civic limits, the number of such beneficiaries is around 6,000, while in Pimpri Chinchwad, it is just around 1,700. According to district health officials, focussed vaccination drives organised during the past few months for disabled beneficiaries has resulted in a good response. Officials said that disabled and other special category beneficiaries can also get vaccinated by directly visiting centres where they will be given priority. According to district health officials, the inoculation of disabled beneficiaries falls under the special category of vaccination, which also includes transgenders, pregnant women, bedridden citizens, senior citizens, students heading abroad, the industrial sector and others. Health officials said that in the special category vaccination, so far 20 lakh people have been vaccinated. Senior citizens top the list with over 8.51 lakh such beneficiaries getting their doses. The District Health Office (DHO) data also showed that as many as 1.48 lakh citizens from the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits and 3.10 lakh from Pune rural, who belong to the industrial sector, were vaccinated under special category drives. The report further said that 7,548 pregnant women have been vaccinated so far in the district, while around 1,417 bedridden citizens have got their shots. The report said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) topped in the vaccination of the students going abroad for studies, with over 9,621 such beneficiaries being vaccinated till October 14. The PMC has also vaccinated the maximum number of bedridden citizens with 767 such beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-pune-rural-17k-disabled-beneficiaries-vaccinated/articleshow/87440719.cms||---
---||Pune||Couples can start fertility treatment after Covid jab||PUNE: Those who are fully vaccinated can start their fertility treatment within a few days after the final dose of the Covid vaccine, the position statement-cum-recommendations of the Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction (ISAR) have stated. The guidelines have advised women to avoid Covid-19 vaccination at least three days prior and three days after the fertility treatments, including any surgical procedures, oocyte retrievals, embryo transfers, or intrauterine insemination. The short time interval is to allow for the immune reaction to settle in and tide over any fever following vaccination, the guidelines have clarified. Fertility treatments, medically termed in-vitro fertilization (IVF), have helped many infertile couples conceive. IVF services, badly hit during the pandemic, have started gaining momentum over the past few months. It is safe to carry on with IVF treatment post-vaccination, experts have emphasized. “The minor side effects of the Covid vaccine make it difficult to determine if the fever the patient has developed post-fertility treatment is related to the vaccine or due to a developing infection related to the IVF treatment. Hence, the guidelines have advised infertile couples to avoid Covid-19 vaccination at least three days prior and three days after the fertility treatments,” senior gynaecologist and IVF expert Sanjay Gupte, former national president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India, said. Everyone seeking fertility treatment need to be counselled and encouraged to proceed with Covid vaccination. “An important dilemma that may arise is that whether pregnancy should be postponed until after the second dose is received. Even though there is no data to guide the clinical practice in this scenario, balanced advice would be not to delay pregnancy; this is of relevance to women of advanced maternal age or reduced ovarian reserve,” IRAS recommendations have stated. Many couples are apprehensive of undergoing ART treatments post-Covid infection or vaccination. Infertility expert Sanjeev Khurd said, “Women who wish to conceive naturally or through ART should take the Covid-19 vaccine and then attempt pregnancy. Women can take the Covid-19 vaccine on any day of the menstrual cycle, even during the menstrual period.” While fertility has not been specifically studied in the clinical trials of the vaccine, no loss of fertility has been reported among trial participants or among the millions who have received the vaccines so far; no evidence of infertility appeared in animal studies either. Fertility clinics should monitor and compare the outcomes of assisted reproduction treatments in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients. This move will help in providing data to assess the safety of vaccines for pregnant women and their offspring, and guidance for future recommendations, experts have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couples-can-start-fertility-treatment-after-covid-jab/articleshow/87440704.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In the month of May, the district had received merely 5.43 lakh doses, which was the lowest for any month since the starting of the vaccination drive against Covid-19 in January.

The district has a total target of around 83.42 lakh beneficiaries, while around 78.42 lakh people have received their first shot. “Since the number of first doses has gone down, the arrival of the doses has also seen a major pause.

---||Nagpur||Covid caps, old movies blamed for lack of audience in cinema halls||Nagpur: Over a week after operations started, business at cinema halls is yet to pick up. Besides Covid-19 protocols, timing of easing curbs is a major factor behind the audiences staying away from theatres. The theatres restarted operations on October 23, with strict Covid protocols following permissions from the state government and local bodies. Pre-Diwali period has traditionally been a slack time for theatres, with no big ticket releases and people remaining preoccupied with preparations. Sporadic rush was observed for a couple of shows but that too was limited to 50% occupancy as per rules, which has not gone down well with theatre owners. They have demanded 100% occupancy post-Diwali and financial assistance to sustain their businesses. In the first week after opening up following a 20-month hiatus, cinema halls got lukewarm response as they ran films that had already been released on OTT platforms. Some halls also faced technical glitches. Pradeep Bajaj, who operates three screens in Wardha, said they ran shows of Bollywood and Hollywood films which released on OTT. “We got good collection in a couple of shows of a Hollywood film. But still the occupancy cap kept the numbers low,” he said. Sanjay Surana, who runs five single screen halls in the city, said in the last one week the situation was abysmal. “We don’t have fresh content to woo audiences. People are reluctant to enjoy cinema in theatre as they have to sit with a gap of one seat. This sounds ridiculous when a family comes together. They can stay together at home but can’t sit next to each other in a movie hall,” he said. Surana added that the restrictions on eating inside hall and 50% occupancy has only instilled fear. “Cinema halls remained shut all along yet audiences are apprehensive that the risk is higher there. This is due to the conditions imposed on us. All other services are now allowed to run to their capacity but for cinemas,” he said. He added that some technical challenges too cropped up during the screenings in last one week. Surana added that other state governments have waived off electricity bills to ease the financial burden on cinemas. “Maharashtra government too can help us out,” he said. Bajaj added that after Diwali they are expecting a revival. “We hope to get 100% occupancy permission like other states,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-caps-old-movies-blamed-for-lack-of-audience-in-cinema-halls/articleshow/87442384.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||Water supply resumes as KTPS checks fly ash leakage||Nagpur: Water supply in half of Nagpur resumed on Sunday after it was interrupted due to ash contaminated water discharged by the Khaparkheda Thermal Power Station in Kanhan river. Water works department officials confirmed the development and said it was restored on late Saturday itself. “No fly ash now and pumping has been normalised,” the official said. On Saturday, with the whitish discharge flowing towards the natural nullah towards the Kamptee road bridge, it was observed that the ash filter on the nullah was in a completely collapsed condition. This led to discharge of fly ash water in Kanhan river. As the Kanhan treatment plant could not treat the ash contaminated water of the river, the pumps located on the right bank of the river were stopped. This resulted in the Kanhan WTP operating at only 50% capacity affecting less and low-pressure water supply in the command areas connected to Kanhan feeder main. Residents coming under 28 elevated storage reservoirs from four zones of Ashi Nagar, Lakadganj, Satranjipura and Nehru Nagar zone faced water crisis on Saturday. “The discharge of fly ash water in Kanhan River started after an ash filter on the nullah collapsed. KTPS constructed a new filter. In a couple of days, a new Nandgaon ash bund will be made operational to reduce the burn on Waregaon ash bund,” said KTPS chief engineer Raju Ghuge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/water-supply-resumes-as-ktps-checks-fly-ash-leakage/articleshow/87442399.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Congress will launch mass agitations if the common people are burdened with such hikes,” he said. Shabbir said that the “unplanned lockdown had badly hit the economy.” “Lakhs have either lost their job or their income decreased drastically. They are already facing huge economic problems due to an increase in fuel prices, other essential commodities and services,” he said. Shabbir charged that TRS did not speak about hikes till Saturday due to the Huzurabad bypolls. “Now that election is over, the government should not dare increase the charges,” he said. He also added that Congress would put up a legal fight to protect interests of paddy farmers. “If FCI is refusing to buy paddy then state should purchase it,” he said. “TRS government took loans worth Rs 4 lakh crore for irrigation, other projects. Most were taken to pay contractors. But KCR is not willing to spend money to help farmers by giving them compensation or buying produce at MSP,” Shabbir charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protests-will-follow-power-rtc-charges-hike-shabbir/articleshow/87442398.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Some schools have also planned to have half a day classes for the first few days for classes 1 to 5.Offline classes began for classes 9-12 began from September 1.“Many government schools have planned classes on alternate days. This will help students get enough space in the classroom and maintain social distancing,” a teacher from a government school in Karamadai said.State president of Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association R Visalakshi expressed reservations on having classes on alternate days as it would not have continuity for students with the academic activity.Many of the private schools have planned to have half a day classes for students of classes 1–5. “This will avoid students having lunch in the school for which they have to remove their masks. Instead, they can be sent home at least for a month,” she said.Coimbatore district chief education officer N Geetha said that she has asked schools to make the first day memorable for children by greeting them with sweets and organising cultural events. This will encourage them to get used to the classroom environment especially when they are returning after a gap of over 18 months.There is a possibility of rain on Monday and parents can make their decision on sending the children to school based on the downpour. But schools have been asked to be prepared to welcome students, she said. Asked about people being in festival mood as Diwali falls on Thursday, she said that schools will only make the children get used to the atmosphere for the first one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-plan-offline-classes-on-alternate-days-for-i-to-viii/articleshow/87442386.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad firms join IPO rush on Dalal Street||HYDERABAD: After a long lull, there is an initial public offering (IPO) rush on Dalal Street and many Hyderabad companies too are hopping onto the bandwagon. Some of the prominent city-headquartered companies that have gone public in the last couple of months include KIMS Hospitals (Rs 2,143.74 IPO size), Vijaya Diagnostic Centre (Rs 1,894 crore), MTAR Technologies (Rs 596 crore) and Dodla Dairy (Rs 520 crore), among others. Some of the upcoming ones include Electronics Mart India Ltd (Rs 500 crore) , MedPlus Health Services (Rs 1,639 crore) , Penna Cements (Rs 1,550 crore), Gemini Edibles & Fats (Rs 2,500 crore), Hariom Pipe Inds Ltd (Rs 120 crore) and Sigachi Industries (Rs 125 crore). Pointing out that pharma and healthcare sector has been one of the largest wealth creators in Hyderabad, market analyst Cherukuri Kutumba Rao said this explains why many healthcare sector players from the city have gone for IPOs and if the buoyancy in the markets continue, many more unlisted players may be prompted to take the market route to raise capital for expansion in the next couple of months. Rao also added that the success of the MTAR issue and the recent sharp increase in the market cap of MTAR could also prompt many defence and engineering players to go for IPO too. “Hyderabad has historically been a big fund raiser and this year, there were a number of companies from the healthcare segment. Markets are booming and there seems to be always bundling of IPOs coming from specific cities other than Mumbai, where stock markets are located, and therefore we do see many companies coming from Hyderabad also,” Arun Kejriwal, founder of Mumbai-based Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt Ltd, said. Kejriwal pointed out that the sharp rally in the markets has given impetus to the companies looking to raise capital. However, one big difference this time is that the bulk of the issues coming to the market are not necessarily fresh issues and some are ‘offer for sale’ like the GEF issue. The offer for sale component goes to the people who are exiting the company or selling their shares, which is primarily led by private equity players this time. “On an average, anything between 75-80% is via offer for sale and the remaining by fresh issue these days,” he said. As per EY India IPO Report Q2, in BSE and NSE, there were seven IPOs in Q2 2021 as compared to no IPO in Q2 2020 and 17 IPOs in Q1 2021. “This represents an increase of 100% compared to Q2 2020 and a decrease of 59% compared to Q1 2021. The IPO pipeline has over 40 companies that have filed their draft red herring prospectus (DRHPs) and more than 30 PE-backed companies are planning exits,” the report said. It pointed out that as per the recent DRHP filings, most active sectors are technology, healthcare, and consumer products and retail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-firms-join-ipo-rush-on-dalal-street/articleshow/87442383.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Pune||Covid: Hotspot villages in rural Pune drop by over 50% in two weeks||PUNE: Hotspot villages in rural Pune have gone down by over 50% — from 78 on October 13 to 34 on October 30. A village with 10 or more active Covid patients is considered a ‘hotspot’ village. Pune district has 13 tehsils and 14 municipal council towns. The ZP officials said mass vaccination was one of the main reasons for the drop. “We have recorded a consistent decline in hotspot villages. In April, when the second wave had peaked, there were 465 hotspot villages in the district. This reduced to 397 in May, 186 in June and 100 in September. Now, for the first time since the second wave, the hotspot villages have dropped below 50 and we are expecting a further reduction,”said Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s CEO. ZP health department officials said they were focusing on these villages and had implemented vaccination drives aggressively. “Around 60 villages that had recorded more cases in the first and second waves, have now conducted 100% vaccination,” Prasad said. Despite the fall in the number, the officials claimed that they isolated Covid positive patients in time. “We had roped in volunteers in these villages and with their help, our staff could admit positive patients to the Covid Care Centrein time. At the same time, we also conducted Covid testsin the villages. This two-pronged strategy has worked out positively for us,” said Dr. Bhagwan Pawar, the district health officer. Prasad said, “Our aim is to reduce such villages to single digits in the next few weeks. We have adopted an aggressive vaccination strategy. It will be implemented effectively in these villages in the coming days to achieve the target.” Out of the 13 tehsils, seven tehsils — Ambegaon (10), Shirur (7), Daund (5), Haveli (5), Junnar (5), Mulshi (1) and Purandar (1) — have hotspot villages in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotspot-villages-drop-by-over-50-in-two-weeks/articleshow/87440738.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Rumi topi defies time, still popular||HYDERABAD: Rumi topi, popularised by Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, in the erstwhile princely state of Hyderabad, is successfully fighting against the odds of changed times, modernity and fashion to survive. While the Rumi topi (Roman cap) was banned in Turkey in 1922 after the fall of the Ottoman empire, the cylindrical red cap continued to be popular in Hyderabad and parts of undivided AP as late as 1980s. With manufacture restricted to a handful of places in the world — Hyderabad is one of them — the Rumi topi would have gone into oblivion, but thanks to people sporting it on special occasions like weddings and Eid prayers, it survives. Rumi topi, introduced to Hyderabad from Turkey, also highlighted the close relations between Ottoman Turkey and princely Hyderabad. After the abolition of the Caliph system in Turkey, the last ruler of Ottoman empire, Sultan Abdul Mejid II, willed that if the Caliphate were to be revived, his grandson Mukarram Jah should succeed him. Mukarram Jah is also the grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan, and former titular Nizam VIII of Hyderabad. Mukarram Jah too had often sported the Rumi topi during his visits to Hyderabad. Historians said while the cap is popular as Fez the world over, it is called the Rumi topi or Roman headdress in the sub-continent, as the Ottoman empire had succeeded the eastern Roman empire. Historian Allama Ejaz Farrukh said that the position of the tassel attached to the Rumi topi connotes the status of the wearer. It was once part of OU students’ uniform. Himayat Ali Mirza, great grandson of the Nizam, said Mir Osman Ali Khan never wore expensive clothes but wore the Rumi topi perhaps to cover up his short physical stature. “The Nizam advised his son, prince Moazzam Jah, who is my grandfather, to always wear the Rumi top and he did so as it is a symbol of respect,” he said. Muhammad Ilyas Bukhari of Muhammad Cap Mart, perhaps the only manufacturer of Rumi topi in these parts, told TOI the Rumi topi’s demand has never waned. “Priced between Rs 250 and Rs 6,000, Rumi topi continues to be the in-thing,” he said, recalling how a senior politician ordered 1,000 topis during separate Telangana movement. Apart from members of the Nizam’s family, the common Hyderabadi Muslim, mostly of old generation, prefer to sport it on Eid. Most old Telugu films identify Muslim characters with the Rumi topi. In Tollywood, former CM NT Rama Rao popularised it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rumi-topi-defies-time-still-popular/articleshow/87442380.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s first sero-surveillance at large scale to find out prevalence of Covid antibodies coming up||JAIPUR: For the first time, the state government will conduct a sero surveillance on a large scale to find out how much of its population has developed antibodies against Covid at a time when over 6 crore vaccine doses have already been administered. In July, the ICMR survey had released the figures stating that 76% of the population in the state had antibodies against Covid. The ICMR had taken the samples from three districts. But, now the state government has decided to expand the sero surveillance in 14 districts of the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma said, “Sero surveillance will be done in 14 districts to find out how much population has antibodies against Covid.” The health department has directed Sawai Man Singh Medical College to prepare the modalities for conducting sero-surveillance. A health department official said, “The SMS Medical College will prepare the guidelines for sero-surveillance. Training will also be imparted to those who will conduct it. Also, the guidelines from SMS Medical College will provide a roadmap for sero-surveillance as it will guide from where the samples will be taken, whose samples will be taken for more accurate results.” The sero surveillance has also become important as more than 6 crore doses of vaccines have already been administered. Since the sero surveillance done by ICMR indicated that antibodies developed were due to second wave of Covid and also due to vaccination, the proposed sero surveillance will give an idea how vaccination has developed antibodies among people. The Centre, in July, had advised the state to conduct its state-specific sero surveys in consultation with ICMR to generate district-level data on sero-prevalence as the findings would guide formulation of localized public health responses for Covid management. It was stated by the Union health secretary to the state government that such studies follow a standardized protocol and the findings of such studies can then be utilised quickly by the respective states to guide objective, transparent and evidence-based public health response to Covid. Wear masks, says CMAhead of Diwali, chief minister Ashok Gehlot appealed to people to remain alert on Covid. “I want to caution again as the corona cases are on the rise in several countries. In India, Covid cases have increased in comparison to earlier figures. Don’t forget following Covid protocols during the celebration of festivals.” He appealed to the people to wear masks, maintain social distancing and get two doses of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/states-first-sero-surveillance-at-largescale-to-find-out-prevalence-of-covid-antibodies-coming-up/articleshow/87442492.cms||---

The Vadavalli police have formed two special teams to nab them. A police officer said the incident took place when 62-year-old A Shanmugam, a resident of Gandhi Nagar at Sathyamangalam in Erode district, visited the city on Saturday to get hallmark for gold ornaments and supply them to a few jewellery shops.“He came down to the city on his bike.

---||Aurangabad||Sena, BJP trade charges over ‘vasooli’ remark||Aurangabad: Days after the BJP accused the state government of vasooli (recovery) over the ongoing regularisation of the gunthewari properties in Aurangabad, the local unit of the Shiv Sena on Sunday hit back saying the BJP was frustrated over the smooth execution of policy by the government for the benefit of property holders. Amid chaos and confusion, the civic body has extended the deadline for the regularization of properties till November 30. Targeting the Sena leaders, as well as, the civic administration, BJP city president Sanjay Kenekar had alleged that a rampant vasooli mission is going on in Aurangabad to collect an unreasonable amount of money from property holders by threatening action against their gunthewari properties. “While Covid has already wreaked havoc on the common man, Sena leaders and civic authorities are talking of erasing gunthewari properties purchased by the commoners with their hard-earned money. The elements concerned are liable for police action as they are spreading panic among the public and driving many to commit suicide,” Kenekar said. While replying to the allegations, Sena leader Raju Vaidya on Sunday said the BJP leaders should either prove the charges or tender an unconditional apology. “Property holders are happy that their gunthewari properties are getting regularized after a long time due to a favourable stand taken by the state government. The BJP leaders are jealous and are levelling baseless charges,” Vaidya said. The civic body, which has started the implementation of the amended Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, Up-gradation and Control) Act, had earlier announced stern action against property holders not getting their properties regularised before the deadline. Amid intervention from the Aurangabad district guardian minister Subhash Desai, the civic administration has further extended the deadline till November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sena-bjp-trade-charges-over-vasooli-remark/articleshow/87437833.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Liver cancer difficult to diagnose early: Experts||Hyderabad: Liver disease and liver cancer are common, but they have no symptoms till an advanced stage, leading to high mortality. As with most liver-related ailments like fatty liver, liver failure and hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, liver diseases progress silently, causing irreversible damage. “Untreated hepatitis B and C are the most common causes of liver cancer and these are rarely picked up in early stages. If detected early, surgery can be done, while in advanced stages transplant can be done,” said Dr K Sreekanth, surgical oncologist, Yashoda Hospitals. While these days detected in younger individuals too, liver cancer is common in 50 and above age-group. “Nowadays, patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) related cirrhosis (metabolic syndrome - diabetes , obesity and fatty liver) are increasingly being seen. Most of them come in advanced stage and in such cases palliative treatment to prolong survival by 1-2 years is the only option. If they come early, liver transplant can be done,” said Dr Sachin Daga, senior consultant liver surgeon and transplant specialist, Medicover Hospitals. Patients with hepatitis B or C should undergo regular screening of ultrasound of the abdomen and alfa fetoprotein once a year. Liver cancer symptoms can be non-specific, which makes it difficult to diagnose. “Several factors can increase the risk of liver cancer. The most common risk factor is long-standing infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Other risk factors could be age, liver cirrhosis, heavy alcohol use, obesity and Type-2 diabetes,” said Dr Palanki Satya Dattatreya, Renova Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/liver-cancer-difficult-to-diagnose-early-experts/articleshow/87442414.cms||Amrita Didyala

Under the transplantation of Human Organs Act, a living donor is required to be a close family relative which includes spouse, parents, siblings, grandparents and children. being healthy and passing all mandatory tests including liver and kidney related tests is mandatory for testing. “The donor has to be in the age group of 18-55 years, have a compatible blood group and a liver size large enough to provide adequate volume to the recipient as well as the donor. This is quite tough, which is why we get many requests for cadaver donations. Many a times, during screening, we find that the intended donor too has a liver disease,” said a senior official from the state government. In one such instance, the less volume of the liver became a hindrance despite all the other criteria meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-new-rules-liver-transplants-get-tough/articleshow/87442419.cms||---

Many herbivores and reptiles also use straw during the winters to stay warm. During winter, the air quality in the capital is severely affected by the burning of farm stubble in the neighbouring states. However, Delhi zoo officials said that paddy straws of great use to them. While herbivores, including deer, nilgai, blackbucks and Sambhar use the straw as bedding material, reptiles use it for hiding themselves. Sonali Ghosh, director, Delhi zoo, said, “It is breeding season for brow antlered-deer, who use paddy straw for comfort and safety. There are currently 75 adults brow antlered-deer in the zoo and six fawns were recently born. Other herbivore species use stubble as bedding while snakes and pythons need paddy straw for hibernation.” She added as paddy can be utilised in many ways and efforts should be taken for its proper use. A zoo official said 8,540 kg of paddy straw had been provided to animals so far during the winter season. There is a total requisition of 40,000 kg for the winter season. The official added the animals do not need paddy straw in the summer season as they prefer to lie on the grass. As the temperature is expected to drop rapidly in November, zoo officials are making other arrangements for animals to save them from cold. “We have closed all the opening of the animal houses by hessian, burlap cloth and mats. A wooden platform has been provided for all big carnivores like lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars," said an official. The zoo officials will also provideoil-filled or double rod heaters and heat convectors to all carnivores, primates, bears and reptiles. The official added the diet of animals is also being revised considering the seasonal change in the weather. Delhi zoo currently houses 92 species of animals and birds with a total population of around 1,200. Winter timings for visitors will be soon announced and the number of visitors will be increased to 4,000, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clearing-the-air-straw-could-be-saviour-too/articleshow/87443729.cms||---

During the Summit, we were able to have elaborate deliberations on issues of global importance such as fighting the pandemic, improving health infrastructure, boosting economic cooperation and furthering innovation,” Modi said on Twitter. Landed in Glasgow. Will be joining the @COP26 Summit, where I look forward to working with other world leaders on m… https://t.co/UH3fths4yI— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1635719819000The Prime Minister, who flew into Glasgow from the G20 Summit in Italy, is scheduled to begin the UK leg of his European tour with a meeting with community leaders and Indologists based in Scotland on Monday morning. He will then proceed for the opening ceremony of the World Leaders' Summit (WLS) at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, where he is set to address the summit plenary session. Modi's bilateral meeting with Boris Johnson is expected to take place soon after Monday's opening ceremony, which will include cultural performances and a speech by the UK Prime Minister. Johnson has said the summit will be the "world's moment of truth" and has urged world leaders to make the most of it. "The question everyone is asking is whether we seize this moment or let it slip away," he said, ahead of the two-week conference. His talks with Modi are expected to focus on the UK-India climate partnership as well as a stock-take of the 2030 Roadmap for stronger UK-India Strategic Partnership – signed by the two leaders during a virtual summit in May this year. “Both governments remain committed to the implementation of the Roadmap, within prescribed timelines. Accordingly, we are looking to launch negotiations in November 2021 for an Interim Agreement to be signed in March 2022 and eventually a comprehensive agreement, if all goes according to schedule, by November 2022,” India's High Commissioner to the UK, Gaitri Issar Kumar, said ahead of the prime ministerial talks – the first in-person meeting between Modi and Johnson following the UK PM's twice cancelled visit to India earlier this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Modi-Johnson meeting will be followed by a leader-level COP26 event entitled Action and Solidarity: The Critical Decade, with Modi set to deliver India's national statement on the country's climate action to the delegates soon after. “India is among the top countries in the world in terms of installed renewable energy, wind and solar energy capacity. At the WLS, I will share India's excellent track record on climate action and our achievements,” Modi said in a statement ahead of the summit. “I will also highlight the need to comprehensively address climate change issues including equitable distribution of carbon space, support for mitigation and adaptation and resilience building measures, mobilisation of finance, technology transfer and importance of sustainable lifestyles for green and inclusive growth,” he said. India's focus at the COP26 Summit will be on the country's “ambitious” Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goals for the post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement. These include a reduction in emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level, as well as achieving 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. Predictable and consistent financing of green technology for developing countries will be another key area of focus for India. At the end of day one of the World Leaders' Summit on Monday, Modi will join more than 120 Heads of Government and Heads of State at a special VVIP reception at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum – one of Scotland's most popular visitor attractions. The reception will also involve members of the royal family, including Prince Charles and wife Camilla and Prince William and wife Kate Middleton. Queen Elizabeth II was due to attend this special reception but pulled out last week after medical advice against travel. On Tuesday, the final day of Modi's UK visit, the PM is scheduled to hold a series of bilateral meetings with leaders of Switzerland, Finland, Israel, Nepal, Malawi, Ukraine, Japan and Argentina, as well as a meeting with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The launch of the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States initiative and a leader-level event entitled Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment are also scheduled for Tuesday before the Prime Minister flies back to New Delhi in the evening. The India-led International Solar Alliance (ISA) will launch a new Green Grids Initiative in partnership with the UK, with an ambition to connect different parts of the world with a common solar grid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-arrives-in-uk-for-cop26-summit-bilateral-talks-with-johnson/articleshow/87445918.cms||---

They repainted the classrooms to make it look exactly like the pictures in their textbooks. The students in the pre-primary, first and second grade will be at the school for the first time and the walls of the classroom recreate their syllabus. The first-grade pupils’ classroom was painted to match the illustration in their Malayalam textbook’s first chapter. Thara and Vimala, characters from the short novel “Tharayude Veed,” were painted in the classroom along with other elements such as the sky, mountain, trees, house, animals, and birds in the backdrop. The students have already identified the characters when it was shared on WhatsApp. Mathematics and other themes were also painted in the classroom. The benches and desks were also painted in a pleasing colour scheme and design. The old long desks and benches were refurbished and converted into colourful ones which can accommodate just two students. The artistic team took 10 days to finish the art works. “I feel happy to work in the school where I studied and consider it my good fortune,” said Jiji Thycaud. “We created an activity room for pre-primary students. For students of grades 1 and 2, we decided to make alterations in their classrooms too,” said Shaji M, the headmaster of the school. Of the 12 classrooms, four were converted into smart classes. The expense for smart class and painting in the classroom was contributed by the teachers of the school. The smart classes are set up for students of grade 1 and 2.

Headed by Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil as its ex-officio chairman, the panel is empowered to decide on the allocation of water for drinking, agriculture and industrial purposes among other needs. Besides Jayakwadi dam, the committee is also for Lower Dudhna major irrigation project in Parbhani district. The alleged official apathy behind the delay in conveying the meeting of the Canal Advisory Committee has drawn flak from water rights activists, who have sought meticulous planning for the release of water in phases from the nearly filled Jayakwadi dam. “As the per norm, the meeting should ideally take place by mid-October and declare water release schedule in advance. Such an announcement helps the farming community in planning their cropping pattern for rabi season and hot-weather season of crops,” said water rights activist Abhijit Dhanorkar. Highlighting large-scale damage of kharif crops during the outgoing monsoon, farmers’ activist Jayaji Surywanshi said tillers should get all possible support from the water resources department for effectively undertaking rabi season. “The Maharashtra water resources minister and the government authorities should explain reasons behind the delay in holding the meeting of the Canal Advisory Committee,” he said. When contacted, top officials at Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) said the extended monsoon resulted in the delay in holding the meeting in question. “The Canal Advisory Committee for Jayakwadi major irrigation project is likely to convey its meeting on November 8 to decide different water allocations. In absence of Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil, Aurangabad guardian minister is scheduled to chair the meeting,” a senior GMIDC official said, preferring anonymity. Patil could not be reached for his comments. Both Jayakwadi and Lower Dudhna major irrigation projects were almost filled to the designed capacity, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-committee-meet-on-jayakwadi-dam/articleshow/87437855.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Rains submerge Sukhatal project; breakwalls, other structures, too, hit||Nainital: The ₹29.16-crore project, aiming at rejuvenating Sukhatal lake, is in troubled waters, with torrential rains submerging breakwalls and other structures raised around the artificial lake. Launched on May 27, 2012, the project suffered a considerable damage, with water being drained out through pumps into Naini lake, which serves as its main recharge zone. After the assent of environmentalists and residents, the project started, with some wanting the restoration to be done in a natural way, while others favouring an artificial lake. The objective was to put an end to encroachments in Sukhatal once the project was completed. The seasonal Sukhatal lake, which is 800m away from Naini lake , absorbs water during monsoons and then this water recharges Naini lake during the dry season. Kumaon mandal vikas nigam, along with the district-level development authority, is tasked with the redevelopment work and told to ensure that the project does not disturb the local ecology. An artificial lake is to be built here, for which a security wall is being constructed. There are many houses, shops, roads, and parking lots around the dry lake. The project not only includes an artificial lake, but also a food court, an amusement park, shops and a parking area are also proposed as the part of the project being built by KMVN and DDA. Under the project, Sukhatal is to be developed as a tourist destination. Vishal Kumar, an environmentalist told TOI that the water is being drained out of Sukhatal lake through pumps, which will neither let the lake to fill nor will it benefit Naini lake. This area was supposed to be kept away from human disturbance as it is prone to tectonic movements. Before the implementation of the project, environmental impact assessment should have been done, he added. Kavita Upadhyay, a water policy expert, said that the whole catchment area of Sukhatal has been concretised under the project, which again will stop the 40-50% sub-surface recharge water to seep to Naini lake. She said drains were diverted by encroachers earlier and later people started throwing debris into Sukhatal. Manoj Jagati, ward member, Ayyarpata, told TOI that the drains coming out from the area of Balike school used to be a big source of water for Sukhatal, which had been diverted from there. In response to a question on the situation, ward member Ghazala Ahmed told TOI that she has appealed to the PWD several times to widen the estuary, but she was told by the department through messages that they tried to do so but could not widen it. On the query if administration has any combat plan to overcome the extreme rainfall events in the near future, AP Bajpai, GM (KMVN), told TOI that it is an ongoing project, which was to be completed by March. Till now, only 20-25% work has been done and to restart the work, the lake is supposed to be emptied. IIT Roorkee has prepared a detailed project report and has recommended a "trenchless technology", considering the cloudburst or excessive rain in the town. This will help in the proper drainage of the excessive water. He said IIT Roorkee has also recommended "geo-synthetic clay liner" to regulate the load of concrete in the lake and will also help to regulate the amount of water seepage from the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rains-submerge-sukhatal-project-breakwalls-other-structures-too-hit/articleshow/87440841.cms||---

In one instance, members of Save Chevella Banyans, wearing traditional attires and accompanied by several residents of the area lit lamps under Banyan trees on Sunday. Close to 1,000 banyan trees between Moinabad and Manneguda — many of them over 100-years-old — are under threat of being chopped down for road-widening work. In an effort to save the banyan trees, residents have taken the initiative to celebrate this Diwali with the trees by lighting lamps under them and singing songs to raise awareness. “Authorities claim these 1,000 trees will be replaced by saplings. By the time these saplings grow it will be too late. We need the ecosystem services now — oxygen, trapping particulate matter and mitigating heat island effects as well as other benefits,” said Kobita Das Kolli, a member of Nature Lovers of Hyderabad. Similarly, the Robin Hood Army is distributing sweet boxes to underprivileged families for Diwali. “So far, we have collected close to 60 sweet boxes from across the city. We are expecting more donations from people. We will be distributing these boxes to underprivileged families on Diwali in an effort to brighten up their lives,” said Akansha Varma, a volunteer with Robin Hood Army who is collecting sweet boxes from Sainikpuri area. Many other communities and individuals are taking up similar initiatives to brighten up the festivities for others. “Considering winter is close, we have bought a few blankets that we will be distributing among people who live on the streets.

The rock formations, which are part of the natural heritage of Telangana, are being destroyed at a rapid pace, said members of The Society to Save Rocks, which organized the event. People from all walks of life, including members of the Hyderabad Runners, were out to raise awareness about the need to conserve rocks. The run -- 6K and 21K – was flagged off at 6.30am from Fakhruddingutta (Khajaguda) via Ghar-E-Mubarak and back. The run was held as part of The Society to Save Rocks’ 25th anniversary celebrations. Incidentally, the starting point of the run, Fakhruddingutta, is also one of the sites that the Society is battling to protect. Speaking about the importance of rock formations, Sangeeta Varma, joint secretary, The Society to Save Rocks, said, “Rocks play a crucial role in formation of lakes and water recharging, apart from enriching the ground with the mineral content within them, providing home to many types of creatures and reptiles & lizards. If they are gone, the city will see drought and flood-like conditions.” On the need to balance growth and nature, she added, “There need to be lung spaces. Certain rock clusters can be made into parks. We must strike a balance with the environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rockathon-gets-rolling-150-people-participate-in-run-to-save-rocks/articleshow/87442477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With Diwali fast approaching, pop-up stall owners fear shrinking margins with every passing day. Having burnt their fingers last year, many retailers are unsure whether they should pay in advance for crackers or not. I Pratap Kumar, treasurer, All India Fireworks Dealers Association, who owns a wholesale fireworks shop in Secunderabad, said, “Last year, many retailers pledged their gold to buy crackers and had to face heavy losses as they couldn’t sell stock. This year, they are being very careful. Many are even hesitating to pay advance and book stock.” Kumar said wholesalers provided storage space, for a nominal amount from retailers, last year as many could not even collect their stock after paying an advance. This was because the National Green Tribunal had ordered use of green crackers. “We sold out stock to retailers, but they struggled,” he said. Retailers said that earlier they used to set up stalls during Dasara, but over the past few years, they have been getting permission only a week or so before the festival. The delay also leaves them with very little time to follow precautions, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-sit-on-permissions-for-pop-up-stalls-retailers-worried/articleshow/87442204.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The crime took place on June 15, and cops managed to pin down the accused after her mother identified him. The child is still in hospital and is in critical condition, officials said. Speaking to TOI, special public prosecutor OP Kaushik said, “Additional district and sessions judge Mumtaz Ali on Saturday awarded life sentence to the accused under IPC section 376 and section 5/6 of the Pocso Act. A penalty of Rs 50,000 was also imposed on the accused." Elaborating further, Kaushik added that the 35-year-old accused had raped the minor girl who used to live with her mother. Before the accused could flee from the spot after the crime, the girl’s mother tried to stop him, he said. “The accused still managed to flee. Locals took the girl to a hospital and later to the police station. The girl’s mother wasn’t in a condition to approach the police. So, a local, who used to stay near the railway station filed the police complaint,” Kaushik added. An FIR was registered on the same day, but there was no immediate breakthrough in the case. “The accused was caught when he visited the railway platform to check whether the girl was alive. This is when the girl's mother recognised him. The locals grabbed the man and handed him over to the police. The police arrested and interrogated him. He was then booked under Pocso Act along with other sections of the IPC. A charge-sheet was filed on June 21 and charges framed on August 26," Kaushik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-4-month-trial-man-gets-life-term-for-raping-6-year-old-girl-still-in-hospital/articleshow/87440954.cms||---

For, Doordarshan transmitter, atop Landour hill (at a height of over 7,000m), has gone off air from Sunday evening, courtesy digital media. An iconic landmark of the town, this 91-ft high transmitter has served cities, towns and villages in western Uttar Pradesh since its establishment in 1977. “With the live telecast reaching places as far as Meerut and Bareilly, the move has come as a shock for many,” said Manmohan Singh, deputy director, Doordarshan Kendra at Mussoorie. Singh said that the increasing influence of DTH and internet, decline in viewership of Doordarshan and outdated technology have been behind the decision. “Doordarshan transmitters across the country are being shut down and now it is the turn of the one in Mussoorie. However, the tower will remain and it will broadcast FM channels while several telecom companies have already set up their transponders on the tower,” Singh said. Meanwhile, the decision to shut down the transmission has left the elderly in particular disappointed. For, they have fond memories of watching some iconic programmes of the national broadcaster through the transmitter till the mid and late 1990s. “Before satellite TV came, Doordarshan was the most popular option and the transmitter at Mussoorie enabled us to watch programmes with clarity for several decades. I remember the entire family watching “Chitrahaar” and serials like “Buniyaad” on a black and white television,” reminisces Pramode Sawhney, a senior citizen. “This TV tower is an icon of Mussoorie, it is a part of the history and heritage of the town. The government must not stop transmission from it. Instead, it should be upgraded so that it could continues to function,” said Raj Bijalwan, a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doordarshan-transmitter-at-mussoorie-goes-off-air/articleshow/87440884.cms||Anmol Jain

Not by tying the knot but by simply taking vows and celebrating their togetherness for the last eight-years along with their friends and family. While same sex marriages are yet to be legalized in India, Supriyo Chakraborty and Abhay Dang have decided to instead hold a grand celebration of their relationship without involving any marital rituals or formalities. “The idea is to celebrate our union with our friends and family. We will have all symbolic rituals such as taking vows together, exchange of rings, cake cutting etc. We are happy together and that’s what we want to celebrate,” said Chakraborty, who works as a faculty member at a city-based hotel management institute. His partner, Abhay Dang, works as a software developer with an IT firm. The two had met through an online dating app way back in 2012. “In our first date itself, we knew that we both were meant for each-other. Back then, I had not come out of the closet. However, with Abhay’s support, I came out to my family and subsequently met his family. After a few hiccups, our families accepted each-other as a couple and for who we were,” said Supriyo. Even though their relationship may not be legalised in the country, they are hopeful that someday, they would be recognised as ‘husbands’. “We both believe that most people just don’t have any exposure to a queer couple. Therefore, their perception about gay couples is limited. Greater the awareness among people, greater would be the acceptance,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-time-in-t-gay-couple-to-say-i-do/articleshow/87442516.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Vadodara||‘Nobody can break India’s integrity’||Kevadia: The world’s tallest statue, Statue of Unity, which honours Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s contribution in making of modern India, has sent out a message to the world that India has a bright future and no one can dare to fracture the country’s unity and integrity, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday. In Kevadia to commemorate the 146th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on National Unity Day, Shah said the Iron Man’s vision will continue to inspire generations to come and help India prosper. Shah also slammed the opposition, saying that efforts were made to obliterate Sardar Patel’s mammoth efforts to unite India from several princely states after Independence. “It is unfortunate that efforts were made to forget Sardar Saheb. After Independence, his contributions were never given due respect and place. He was not conferred the Bharat Ratna. But it is said, how long can clouds keep the sun hidden,” he said. “The 'Statue of Unity' is a message to the entire world that nobody can break India's unity and integrity and nobody can tamper with India's universality,” he said, adding that Kevadia has become “a pilgrimage of India's unity, nationality, and patriotism.” Invoking Chanakya, who consolidated the Maurya empire, the home minister said, “At one time, Acharya Chanakya united India. Centuries later, Sardar Saheb united India. It is the result of this that the country is today proudly strengthening its place in the world. A leader like Sardar Patel is born once in centuries and inspires people for centuries” he said.  Recalling Patel's contribution to unite India by bringing together some of the princely states, Shah said nobody has paid attention to his contribution to make Lakshadweep a part of India. “When India became independent on August 15, Sardar Sahib sent the Indian Naval Ship Tir to Lakshadweep. A few hours after the Indian Navy unfurled the tricolour, Pakistani ships reached there. But, by that time, the tricolour was unfurled. It is because of this that Lakshadweep is a part of India, and a large part of India's coastline is secured from there,” Shah said. Shah said the government's decision to celebrate October 31 as the 'Rashtriya Ekta Diwas' was taken so that Sardar Patel's struggles for Independence and his perseverance in uniting the country continues to inspire people for centuries. The statue is a true homage to Sardar Patel by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had conceived the idea of the world's tallest structure, Shah said. Due to Modi's efforts to bring the country's 60 crore poor into the mainstream, they have become connected to the country's development process, Shah said. “Modi ji has set a target of a five trillion dollar economy, secure India, educated India as per the new education policy, and a target for the pride of our languages. Today, on the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas, we should take a pledge to make the country strong and as per the dreams of Sardar Patel, by walking on the path shown by him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nobody-can-break-indias-integrity/articleshow/87440969.cms||---

The hospital administration has claimed that the situation is likely to improve in the next two days. “We are in touch with the vendors of the kits. They have assured us that in the next two days the situation will improve,” said a senior hospital official. He said the kits are imported and have got stuck somewhere and the vendors are putting efforts to resolve the issue. Hospital doctors said that they had been collecting the samples of patients with fever and symptoms for scrub typhus. “For the past four days, we have not received the reports of the samples sent to the microbiology lab of SMS Medical College. We are providing the treatment on the basis of the symptoms of patients,” said a senior doctor at medicine department. In Jaipur, over 350 cases of scrub typhus have already been reported this year. According to the health department officials, there is a spike in scrub typhus cases after monsoon. Scrub typhus is a disease caused by the bite of a specific kind of a mite. Its symptoms include high grade fever with chills, body ache, muscle pain with rashes. If someone closely examine and find a small mark that looks like cigarette burn anywhere on the body especially on legs and hands, it could scrub typhus. The place where the mite bites, turns blackened just like a burning cigarette leaves a black mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sms-hosp-in-touch-with-vendors-of-scrub-typhus-testing-kits/articleshow/87442567.cms||---

Gone are the days when Chinese rice-lightings ruled the decorative lamp markets. Today, the lighting statement has grown bolder with bigger LED-studded lights luring the citizens. “We sell the products that are in demand and this time, there is a demand for the durable lightings. The rice lights are very small and delicate, hence, people no more buy them. The lights manufactured in India are in high demand this season,” said Satej Patil, a stall owner. As the last season was almost dull owing to Covid, people are spending a lot this time. New focus lamps and disco lamps are attracting people. “I bought some lanterns and found the innovative concept of decorative lamps quite interesting. I was particularly looking for ‘Made in India’ products,” said Akshay Kadam, a resident of Gangapur Road. The retailers have also pointed out that the rates of the decorative lamps have gone up by 10% when compared to the rates last year, however, there is no drop in the demand. “Our overall business this year is similar to the pre-Covid times when we would sell at least 50 different types of lightings daily, just before Diwali,” said Anuja Parab, a vendor. People are also buying a lot of items online. “I chose to buy lamps online as I got different varieties and I could easily compare those with other designs and prices,” said Saurabh Shahane, a resident of Nashik Road said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/made-in-india-decorative-lights-attract-citizens/articleshow/87437974.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Ensure children with rare disease do not succumb to the disease only for want of proper treatment: Court directs state govt||JAIPUR: The high court has directed the state government to provide all possible treatment including imported medicines so that children suffering from rare diseases do not succumb to diseases for want of care. The state government is likely to come up with a policy on the next date of hearing on November 26. The court’s order came on Thursday last when a bench of justices Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Farjand Ali was hearing a PIL. Various directions have already been issued by the court in the past aimed at ensuring treatment of children suffering from rare disease Gaucher. The petitioner sought to ventilate a grievance that proper treatment facility was not being provided to children suffering from Gaucher mainly because it incurs heavy medicine costs. “How it would be done is a matter to be considered by the authorities in the health department of the state but in any case, the treatment ot identified persons suffering from this disease has to be provided by the state,” the order stated. The court further ordered that the state had not framed any such policy to detail infrastructure support and treatment towards such rare disease, though learned counsel for the state would submit that in JK Lon Government Hospital, Jaipur, a rare disease centre, had been established, which is providing treatment to the persons suffering from rare diseases with whatever resources are available to them. In the court, the petitioner pointed out that the cost of treatment is heavy and the drugs are not only costly but rarely available and mostly required to be imported. Counsel for the state submitted before the court that procurement of costly medicines was an issue which the state government was trying to resolve but at present, children who are under treatment, would be provided best possible treatment. The court has also inquired from the Additional Solicitor General of India (ASGI) whether it intends to create infrastructure and other necessities to facilitate treatment of rare diseases in AIIMS, Jodhpur to which the ASGI submitted that he might be granted some time to seek instructions in the matter and clearly state before the court action plan in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-children-with-rare-disease-do-not-succumb-to-the-disease-only-for-want-of-proper-treatment-court-directs-state-govt/articleshow/87442577.cms||---

"People say that if Muslims vote for AIMIM, BJP would come to power. I want to ask them that AIMIM was not there in 2014 and 2017, so how did BJP win in UP?" he said at a public gathering. The Saharanpur public meet is Owaisi’s third poll rally in the sugarcane belt in a week. He had addressed two public rallies earlier in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar. The Hyderabadi leader added that since Independence, everyone got their own leader, but Muslims are still without one. He also criticised SP, BSP and Congress for not doing anything for the minority community. "Muslims have been voting for the Congress, RLD, BSP and SP. Now they need their own leader. The community which does not have a serious leadership, will never get justice," he said, adding that children belonging to minority families don't have schools to go to, they don't have jobs. Taking a swipe at the ruling party, Owaisi said, "But, if someone is killed by police in a fake encounter, he is a Muslim. If someone is defamed and called a terrorist, he is a Muslim. If an innocent is kept in prison, he is a Muslim."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/aimim-was-not-in-2014-17-then-how-did-bjp-win-in-up/articleshow/87441022.cms||Mohd Dilshad

A team from Ernst & Young, one of the largest professional services networks in the world, made its first presentation before Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board on Sunday. The firm will also develop IT solutions and software for crowd management in the premises. The remaining construction and finishing work of over Rs 700 crore Kashi Vishwanath Dham project is in full swing and is likely to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December. Ernst & Young has been roped in to design the model for revenue generation to assist the operations and maintenance of all the establishments in the corridor except Kashi Vishwanath temple which is looked after by the KV Temple Trust. Talking to TOI on Sunday, the board’s chairman and divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “E&Y was appointed consultant through tender process for preparing a model for operations and maintenance of KV Dham in mid-October. The company gave its first presentation before us today. We have made some suggestions in the proposed model which will be incorporated in the next presentation on November 10. Till then, the process for calling request for proposal (RFP) and expression of interest (EOI) will be completed.” “The trust looks after the affairs of KV Temple through donations that can be used for the temple only. The area of campus has now expanded to 5 lakh square feet in which 23 major buildings, including Mandir Chowk, guest houses, multipurpose hall, clinic and hospice, pilgrim facility centres, 70 shops, Varanasi gallery and museum, cafeteria and toilets are being constructed,” said Agrawal. Once the project is inaugurated and thrown open to public, it would require revenue for daily operations and maintenance, he added. “We needed a well thought out and designed model for seamless generation of revenue, its channelisation and accounting for meeting the requirements of operations and maintenance,” the commissioner said. In view of the requirements, the Board had decided to engage a top professional consultant for designing and developing the revenue model and finetuning the operations, he added. “Finding a consultant was no easy task as no company showed interest though we floated the tender thrice. When the tender was floated for the fourth time, only E&Y participated in it and the contract was awarded to it After a basic study, the company has estimated that about Rs 27 crore would be needed per annum for providing all services, facilities and maintenance of KV Dham,” he said. The company will also develop an IT solution and software for crowd management. “People will not have to stand for hours in queues to enter KVT as a software being developed will issue tokens with half an hour time slots. The pilgrims can visit other facilities in KV Dham instead of standing in queue,” Agrawal added. “The KV Dham will have three entrance points, from the Ganga, Saraswati Phatak and Godowlia Gate, while KVT premises has four entry points. E&Y will also propose a plan for seamless movement inside KV Dham while keeping the security arrangements in view,” the commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ernst-young-to-design-revenue-model-it-solutions-for-kv-dham/articleshow/87441010.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Surat||Boy’s parting gifts: Hands, organs||SURAT: In his passing, he became a legend by donating all his organs and even limbs too. But sadly, Diamond City’s 14-year-old Dharmik Kakadiya, who battled each day of his short life as he couldn’t find a matching kidney donor, on Sunday, gifted his heart to a 15-year-old class XI student from Junagadh in Ahmedabad, who became the youngest patient for heart transplant surgery done in the state. But Dharmik’s benevolence doesn’t end there, he became the youngest donor of the country to ‘giving’ his hands to a Pune resident, who had lost both his hands and legs due to electric shock. Incidentally, this is the 19th hand transplant surgery in the country. While the class X student died in pain, he breathed a new lease of life in seven people altogether by donating his heart, liver, lungs, eyes and also his hands. “My son lived in a painful condition and we are aware of how important organ donation is. Hence we agreed to donate whichever organs were useful,” said Ajay, Dharmik’s father and an employee in a diamond unit. Dharmik developed kidney problems five years ago and the condition kept deteriorating requiring him to undergo dialysis thrice a week. Even as family members wanted to donate their kidneys, but none matched and they were forced to register his name for donation. On October 27, Dharmik was admitted to the hospital after his blood pressure shot up following complaints of vomiting. He suffered brain haemorrhage and a blood clot had developed in the brain. Even though the clot was surgically removed, his condition was unlikely to improve and doctors declared him brain dead. “We approached the family and they agreed as they knew the importance of organ donation. It was a tough call for any family to agree to donate the outer organs of a young child,” said Nilesh Mandlewala of Donate Life. As the hands had to be transplanted within eight hours, three green corridors were created in the city for the first time by the city police to transport the vital organs at the earliest. The hands had to be transported by air to the Mumbai hospital within 105 minutes. The liver was transplanted to a 35-year-old Patan resident in Ahmedabad, lungs on a 44-year-old Andhra Pradesh resident in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/parting-gifts-hands-organs/articleshow/87441009.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Over 3,500 industrial units in both the industrial areas will remain closed for six days between November 3 and 8 on account of the festival. A meeting between office bearers of Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) and other associations was held with the police administration. Deputy commissioner of police Vijay Kharat and senior police officials from Satpur and Ambad police stations were present in the meeting. The DCP assured the industrial associations of providing tight 24x7 police security. He also instructed officials to deploy security guards individually or in a group of four to five during Diwali and ensure their identity before their deployment. Most manufacturing industries belong to the auto and electric sectors. Steel, aluminium and other metals are used as raw materials by these companies on a large scale. As the industries will remain close for six days, the cases of metal theft can take place in industrial areas during this period. Nikhil Panchal, the vice-president of AIMA said, “We had a positive meeting with the police administration in view of the security in industrial areas in the city during the festival. “Police administration will be providing strict security in industrial areas to prevent cases of thefts in the festival. Moreover, we are also providing two vehicles with drivers to police administration for patrolling in industrial areas,” said Panchal. “Instructions have been given to the industries to install CCTV cameras at the premises of industries as part of safety measures,” he said. “The police administration will put up barricades at all entry and exit points in both the industrial estates,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-24x7-police-security-in-industrial-estates-during-diwali/articleshow/87437987.cms||Tushar Pawar

Ali, in his mid-20s, was sent to 14-day judicial custody. Cops have booked the man under the IT Act, apart from slapping IPC sections 505 (2) (promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes and communities) and 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) on him. Since the past week, there have been multiple instances of people being booked for “celebrating” Pakistan’s win. On Saturday, Mohd Farukh, 22, was held on similar charges. His friend, unidentified in the FIR, was also booked. This came just days after police in Agra booked three Kashmiri students for cheering Pakistan’s victory. They were held under sedition and cyber-terrorism charges along with other sections of the IPC. The cops had also arrested one person from Sitapur for posting a status on WhatsApp in "support" of the neighbouring country. He was booked under IPC sections 507 (criminal intimidation by anonymous communication) and 151 (knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse). Another person was arrested from Budaun for posting a picture of the Pakistan flag. He had been booked under IPC section 124-A (sedition). Meanwhile, speaking about Sunday’s arrest, SHO of Chandi Nagar, Satendra Singh, said the complaint was filed by Akhilesh Kumar, one of the villagers in Khatta Prahladpur which falls within the police station limits. “The accused had cheered for Pakistan in the recent T-20 World Cup match and wrote ‘Pakistan zindabad’ on his Facebook status which was objectionable.

The work to broaden the trail – which is also named as Kipling trail after renowned author Rudyard Kipling who took the route during the 1880s to go up to Mussoorie – has recently been undertaken by the state tourism department. However, according to residents, the construction on the trail is disturbing the natural aesthetics of the area. “The Kipling trail has been a good hiking spot for several years. It is a historic spot and the area is rich in biodiversity. Concretisation will destroy the original trail. Any hiker prefers a kaccha trail. They are chiseling into the mountain and dumping concrete and muck along the hillside,” said Himanshu Arora of Citizens for Green Doon. The trail still has signboards dating back to the 1920s, depicting the charges that palanquins and carriages going on the road had to pay. Walkers can get panoramic views of the Doon valley, all the way up to Jharipani near Mussoorie. On the route are ruins of an old railway tunnel, natural springs, as well as the remnants of a colonial-era inn, Halfway House, where travellers of that time would stop for rest, food, and drinks. The area is also popular with birdwatchers because of the rich diversity of flora and fauna. Some environmentalists claim that the natural formations of the area are being destroyed due to the construction. “There is a stretch of reserve forest adjacent to the trail, which has now been lost to construction work. The Rispana riverbed also falls in this area and is a major local water source. It is being disturbed as well,” said Reenu Paul, president of Rajpur Community Initiative, a citizens’ collective. Residents add that cutting into the mountainside will make the area more landslide-prone. “These are limestone hills that are already weak. There have already been mini-slides here. Any further work can lead to major disasters,” said Arora. While officials claim that concretisation and broadening will make the route more convenient for motorists, locals disagree. “A part of the road has been concrete-based for the past several years, but it has been in a terrible condition for a long time. There is hardly any maintenance. Concretisation is pointless if there will be no preservation of the route,” said Saransh, a tea shop owner near the trail. Meanwhile, officials allege that the work will not affect the natural ecology of the area. “Any development work happening is being done keeping in mind the natural aesthetics of the area,” said Yugal Kishore Pant, ACEO, Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourism-depts-makeover-ruining-kipling-trail-9km-long-trek-route-from-dehradun-to-mussoorie-say-local-residents/articleshow/87441041.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The mid-day meal (MDM) scheme, renamed PM Poshan Shakti Nirman scheme last month, was suspended in March 2020, after schools were closed due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. "The offline classes for all students restarted last month in Uttarakhand and the student turnout has also gone up. Besides, the Covid-19 situation is under control now. All this has led to restarting the mid-day meal from Monday instead of giving compensation to the students through the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme,” said an education department official. A state government-appointed team will visit the schools in various districts to inspect the quality of the food being served to the students and will conduct a social audit as well, an official said. The number of students of classes I-VIII studying in the state government-run schools has gone up to 6.97 lakh. This year, around 30,000 new enrolments took place. Since the schools were closed in March 2020, the students were compensated by the money in lieu of the food. Later, the state government started giving packets of uncooked food items along with the compensation to the students. According to official data, a sum of Rs 4.48 per day is spent on the MDM of each primary school student while Rs 6.71 a day is spent on those in the upper primary classes 6-8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-schools-to-serve-mid-day-meals-from-today/articleshow/87441050.cms||Mohammad Anab

Smita Dixit, the principal of Jidnyasa Vikas Mandir said, “There are 150 students in the school but as the primary schools have not yet fully started, we called the students in batches of 10 every day, to make lanterns, clay lamps and Diwali gift boxes. Post-Covid we are getting a good response from the customers. However, since the students were not present in full attendance, we were a little short of our target. Around 10,000 clay lamps, 125 lanterns and 1,500 Diwali gift boxes have been made in the last one month.” Chetna Vikas Mandir, another school for differently-abled children has made more than 15,000 clay lamps. Krishnat Chougale, who works as an art teacher at the school said, “Our specially-abled students get a stipend from the sale of the Diwali goodies that they make.

Amid the pandemic situation, it has been observed that people prefer to buy products Made in India and traditional eco-friendly items. The Chinese goods and lanterns have been sidelined in the market. The traders have also displayed ‘Only Mase in India’ products at their shops and stalls. Sohail Bagwan, a stall owner at Paan Lane selling lanterns, said, “People are preferring the traditional-style lanterns. The Chinese lanterns are completely out of the market and no stall can be seen displaying Chinese lanterns. This year, bamboo-made designer lanterns and metal lanterns are new in the market.” While most of the stalls in Kolhapur have also displayed eco-friendly lanterns made from paper and bamboo.  Sachin Gatade, a stall owner at Mahadwar road said, “We have displayed lanterns which are made from colour paper, cloth and bamboo. As people are getting aware of the pollution caused by plastic, traditional and eco-friendly items are in demand. The cost of the lanterns falls in the range of Rs 200 to 3500.” The Kolhapur chamber of commerce has also appealed to all its traders to refrain from selling Chinese products and accordingly all the traders have agreed on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-kolhapur-city-eco-friendly-lanterns-in-demand/articleshow/87437998.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The youth was admitted to the hospital with irod rods pierced through his body on Saturday. The patient identified as Karan, from Bharsolapur village of Sonipat district, was on his way to get fuel from his home on Friday evening, when his bike hit a car carrying protruding iron rods. Two of the iron rods measuring approximately 40ft, penetrated through his upper body close to the chest, said doctors at PGIMS Rohtak. Nearby residents had shortened the iron rod and rushed him to BPS medical college, Khanpur Kalan hospital in Sonipat from where he was referred to PGIMS Rohtak. Doctors said they had never encountered such a case with two iron rods penetrating the chest wall and the patient was conscious. Talking to the media, Dr Lohchab, head of cardiac surgery, said the rods were extracted one by one and the lung injury found at four sites were stapled using a stapler gun. Fortunately, there was air leak from lungs and the patient was extubated on the first day and is currently doing well without any respiratory distress. “Removal or movement of penetrating rods should be avoided at home in such cases, as it may lead to fatal hemorrhage. Dr G Anupama, vice-chancellor UHS, Rohtak congratulated the whole team and particularly team leader Prof S S Lohchab for this extraordinary feat, which saved the life of the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgims-doctors-remove-2-iron-rods-penetrating-chest-wall-in-life-saving-surgery/articleshow/87442595.cms||Sat Singh

---||Nagpur||At 419 cases, October marks unlock, normalcy, festivity and promise||Nagpur: The month of October that began with the re-opening of schools in urban areas, followed by re-opening of the places of worship, and lastly opening of auditoriums and cinema halls across the state has been so far the most positive month in the pandemic. During the month, only 419 new Covid positives cases were reported in all 11 districts of Vidarbha; 510 patients recovered, and only six deaths were reported which makes October the best month statistically since April 2020. However, there are many other positive factors of last five weeks. Despite reopening of schools in urban areas, there is no surge in the paediatric Covid-19 cases is the most important and positive development. This is the evidence of the claims generally made by the paediatricians that a large chunk of paediatric population has already been infected and developed natural immunity. By last week of October, state allowed even colleges to take physical classes. Vaccine mandate has been kept for colleges which will result in more vaccination among youths in next two weeks. After re-opening of places of worships which followed the festivity of Navratri and Eid, a surge in new cases was expected. But, nothing of that sort happened despite festive rush. Experts have said that the multiplication rate of the virus is down and it has become weak now. Secondly, the vaccination has done an impressive work and infected people are mostly asymptomatic. In Vidarbha nearly 1.8 crore eligible people have taken at least one dose of vaccine till date. Rural Vidarbha has remained largely aloof from the spread of Covid-19 in October. Gondia reported only 5 new cases, Bhandara 8, and Wardha only 10 new cases. Barring Nagpur (147) and Chandrapur (80), no district reported more than 50 cases in this month despite conducting average number of tests daily. Bhandara, Wardha, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Amravati, and Yavatmal reported no Covid death throughout the month. Experts, who are following the pandemic since the beginning, said that chances of third wave are low now. “Although ‘zero Covid situation’ is just impossible, the baseline run of the virus will continue henceforth. We may witness some smaller surges in pockets but major wave is unlikely now,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. November is going to be a crucial month to see as major Diwali festivity is on cards. Experts have suggested ‘celebrate but vaccinate’ mantra to ensure that conditions will be further better in December. “Vaccination is playing its part. Once 50% plus population will get both the doses, we can be further ensured that a Covid wave won’t hit us again,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-419-cases-october-marks-unlock-normalcy-festivity-and-promise/articleshow/87441081.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Earlier Rs 38 crore were paid to the corporation for free travel of candidates in September. “A total of 18,60,560 candidates travelled in the roadways buses for multiple competitive examinations that were held in the state during the month of October. For this the reimbursement amount that will be given to the roadways is Rs 26,22,50,006. The previous dues have been cleared,” said an official of the corporation.

During his maiden visit to Anand, Shah appealed to cooperatives like Amul to look ahead.Shah said that a lot of changes are required in the cooperative sector and said, “ A charter for the newly formed ministry is being prepared with the core idea of ‘sahakaar se samruddhi’ (cooperation to wealth). Shah pointed out that as Amul completed 75 years, the country has failed to laud its achievements as much as it should have. “Had a foreign company completed 75 years, there would have been much pomp and show about it. Nevertheless, Amul does not need credit. The brand’s name and reputation are to its credit,” he said. Shah said that guided by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Tribhuvan Kaka, the farmers sowed the seeds of a foundation with a lot of struggle that today has grown as a big banyan tree. He also mentioned how Dr Verghese Kurien expanded Amul further. “From 200 litres at the time of establishment, Amul today has the capacity of processing and storing 30 million litres of milk,” he said. Shah said the dream of ‘White Revolution’ envisaged by Lal Bahadur Shastri has been realized. He however urged co-operatives like Amul, IFFCO and KRIBHCO to look ahead and share their success stories. Citing examples of organic, natural farming taken up by farmers in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, the union minister asked if someone can take the responsibility of testing organic crops and exporting them to international markets so that poor and marginal farmers get more returns. “A farmer cannot sell his five or ten tonnes wheat or horticulture products without any platform. Amul can explore if it can provide a platform to such products,” he suggested. In Amul Dairy’s visitors book, he mentioned that if Amul provides a platform to produce of farmers involved in organic/natural farming, it will be a beginning of a new chapter. Shah launched an automated cheese warehouse at Khatraj, Amul’s organic biofertilizer, souvenir, stamp and envelope marking 75 years of Amul and inaugurated newly constructed auditorium. He also launched the ‘Dairy Sahakar’ scheme of the National Cooperative Development Corporation with Rs 5,000 crore allocation. Shah’s take on ‘andalons’ Anand: Without making a mention of any agitation of farmers against farm laws, union home minister Amit Shah said that ‘andalons’ (protests) are supposed to bring problems to an end. Citing the example of the struggle of farmers against the injustice of private dairy that eventually led to formation of Amul, he said that the struggle took a positive turn with Sardar Patel’s inspiration and hardworking leader like Tribhuvandas Patel. “Their struggle, protest is not just an example for co-operation but also an example for those social workers who protest on behalf of the whole society. The protests are to bring the problems to an end, and not to further accentuate the problems,” he said. Had Amul buttermilk at Poonch’ Citing an example of Amul’s reach, union minister Amit Shah said that during his recent visit to Poonch, near the Pakistan border, he was happy when a young girl gave him masala buttermilk of Amul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cooperatives-key-to-making-india-a-5trillion-economy/articleshow/87441136.cms||---

The centre is being closed because the number of people coming to take their shots has reduced considerably, Candolim primary health centre (PHC) in-charge Dr Roshan Nazareth told TOI. “Most of the locals have already taken their second shots. The people coming now are mostly tourists and workers of hotels who took their first shot elsewhere,” he said. Those who want to get vaccinated will now have to visit the vaccination centre at Candolim at the residence of Nandan Kudchadkar which will continue to function for some more time, he said. “Even that we will close down soon because the owner wants to restart his business,” Nazareth said. After that is closed, vaccinations may be done at the Candolim PHC itself or at the panchayat or church hall. During the peak of the pandemic there were nine vaccination centres under the Candolim PHC at Calangute, Candolim, Arpora, Saligao, Sangolda, Guirim, Nerul and Reis Magos. Most of them have already been closed after the number of people coming reduced. Now only the Candolim and the Saligao PHC centres are open. “This will also reduce the load on our staff and they can now restart the other campaigns for diabetes, etc,” he added. However, Nazareth said they have one-day “mega vaccination” drives at different places whenever required. One such drive was held on Sunday, when 1,166 persons were vaccinated across all the centres. “Otherwise now we get around 100-200 people every day,” he said. The previous mega-vaccination drive was conducted around a month ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-centre-at-calangute-to-stop-operations-from-today/articleshow/87443838.cms||---

Gupta said to make the voters’ list clean and error-free, booth level officers have been directed to contact the birth and death registration offices in their respective areas to get a fresh list of the deceased. “After verifying the dead voter, as per the list, they should submit the report to the electoral registration officer for deletion of the names,” he said. As per the schedule, the final publication of voters’ lists will be done on January 5, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/eligible-voters-can-register-themselves-till-nov-30/articleshow/87442633.cms||---
---||Jaipur||SBI ex-chairman held for fraud in selling Raj hotel below market price||JAISALMER: Former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri was arrested by Jaisalmer police from his residence in Delhi on Sunday over an alleged fraud involving the sale of a hotel in Jaisalmer at a hugely undervalued price. He was remanded in judicial custody on Monday for 14 days after the chief judicial magistrate rejected his bail plea. He was sent to Jaisalmer jail. His advocate has filed another bail application in the district and sessions court; it will be heard on November 8. Chaudhuri sold the Rs 200-crore property for just Rs 25 crore, when the owners defaulted on a loan, to a company named Alchemist ARC , it is alleged. After retirement, he became one of the directors in the company that had bought the hotel. The CJM’s court agreed that selling the luxury hotel without getting it auctioned amounted to cheating. On October 23, the court issued arrest warrants against eight people, including Chaudhuri. The rest of the seven are yet to be arrested. Jaisalmer SP Ajay Singh said the CJM’s court had issued an arrest warrant against the eight under IPS Sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker…), and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy). Apart from the ex-banker, the other seven people are Alok Dhir, RK Kapur, SV Venkatakrishnan, Sasi Methadil, Devendra Jain, Tarun and Vijay Kishore Saxena. In 2008, the owner of Fort Rajwada Hotel, Dileep Singh Rathore, had decided to construct another hotel on Jaisalmer’s Khuhadi Road and took a term loan of Rs 24 crore from SBI Jodhpur. In 2010, he sought another loan of Rs 6 crore from SBI, but the bank denied him the loan. Later in the same year, Rathore died of a heart attack. Two months after his death, SBI converted the under-construction hotel into an NPA and seized the property. SBI had both hotels evaluated and exerted pressure on Rathore’s son, Harendra Singh Rathore, to repay the loan, it is claimed. Kanwraj Singh, advocate for Godawan Group Pvt Ltd, the owner of Rajwada Fort Hotels and Garh Rajwada (under-construction property), argued against Chaudhuri’s bail application. In the meantime, Chaudhari retired and within a month Alok Dhir, allegedly a middleman, became a director in the recovery company. The hotel owner learned of the plan to grab the hotel and lodged an FIR against eight people at Sadar police station in 2015. After a long hearing, the CJM’s court agreed that selling the hotel without getting it auctioned amounted to cheating. The court on October 23 issued arrest warrants against eight people, including Alok Dhir and Pratip Chaudhari, following which the Jaisalmer police arrested the former SBI chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaisalmer-police-arrest-ex-sbi-chairman-in-loan-scam-case/articleshow/87442649.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Teacher, peon, cook - all rolled into one||KOZHIKODE: Jisha MP, a teacher at multi-grade learning centre (MGLC), one of the 270 ‘single-teacher schools’ in the state, at Vayyode in Thavinjal panchayat, Wayanad, had been donning the role of a teacher, headmistress, peon and sometimes a cook for the last 20 years. Now, when her classrooms spring back to life after one-and-half years on Monday, she would literally have her hands full — right from measuring temperature of the kids to dispensing hand sanitizers and providing food, besides her core job of teaching four lower-primary classes in a single classroom, just like most teachers in MGLCs. Vayyode MGLC has 20 students in classes 1 to 4. “It is a big challenge for us to single-handedly ensure Covid guidelines and conduct classes at MGLCs, but we have to put in all our effort to ensure that our kids, who have reposed faith in us, are not left behind,” said Jisha. “To ensure social distancing and bio-bubble, we decided to split the students into two batches. We cleaned the classrooms and I personally bought hand sanitizers and face masks for students though the education department authorities provided us with a thermal scanner,” she said. Jisha personally visited tribal households and urged parents to send the students to class, but she has her fingers crossed on how many students would turn up on Monday due to Covid concerns. Biju Kumar, a teacher at MGLC, Kumizhi, located deep inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, said, “Our MGLC has only six students. Starting regular classes is very important for them as they are unable to assess digital classes properly due to very weak mobile signals there,” he said. The state has 344 MGLC teachers and they play a vital role in imparting education to students in remote, inaccessible locations mostly in the tribal belts. They get Rs 18,500 as honorarium but often have to wait for months to get their salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/teacher-peon-cook-all-rolled-into-one/articleshow/87442689.cms||K R Rajeev
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Need a complaint to probe into Wankhede’s caste certificate’||MUMBAI: While NCP minister Nawab Malik on Sunday reiterated that Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim who allegedly forged his caste certificate to get a central government job and National Commission for Scheduled Caste vice-chairman Arun Haldar defended the NCB zonal director, state officials pointed out that there has to be an official complaint for the caste scrutiny committee to verify his certificate’s validity. Social justice minister Dhananjay Munde confirmed: “If the competent authority receives a complaint over Wankhede’s caste certificate, it will be probed as per the rules.” Malik said a complaint is likely to be filed in a day or two. According to a bureaucrat, while a caste certificate is issued by the sub-divisional officer/deputy collector, it is verified by a high-level committee headed by an officer of the rank of joint secretary or additional collector. It is then valid-ated by the caste scrutiny committee as per the guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court in the Madhuri Patil case. The bureaucrat said that in case of doubt about a person’s caste certificate, the complaint is submitted to the caste scrutiny committee, a quasi-judicial authority. “The committee hears all parties, asks for all relevant certificates and if needed, visits the residence against whom the complaint has been made,” he said. “The social justice department has made the entire procedure very stringent and all cases are disposed of in a time-bound period.” If the certificate is found to be forged or false, the rule provides for six months’ jail term and fine. “In the central government, caste verification is not mandatory, but the state government is empowered to probe into the caste certificate of a resident of Maharashtra,” the bureaucrat said. According to reports, Haldar had met Wankhede and the latter had shown him all the relevant documents. “I personally feel that he belongs to the SC community and hails from Mahar caste and rose to such a position despite belonging to a poor family,” Haldar said, but was quick to add that he will wait for a report from the state government. Reacting on Hald-ar’s observations, Malik said it was unfortunate that a person holding a constitutional post arrived at the conclusion in ha-ste. “We have all the documents and records to establish that Wankhede is a Muslim community and does not belong to a scheduled caste,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-need-a-complaint-to-probe-into-wankhedes-caste-cert/articleshow/87442682.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

When VMC’s market superintendent Vijay Panchal reached the cattle pound in Lalbaug in the evening, he noticed a cow being taken away in a pick-up truck from there. When Panchal asked the truck driver, Ramesh Bajaniya, about the cow, the latter informed that the cow was being taken to Gorwa. Panchal told the police that he became suspicious about the bovine being taken away and so, he called the employees working at the pound and asked about the cow. The staff, and the security guard of the cattle pound said that the cow was impounded on Saturday morning from Gorwa area and brought there. Police said that the employees said that they were unaware who took the cow out of the pound. They said that when they were busy tagging the cattle and registering them, some unidentified persons broke into the cattle pound and managed to take the cow out and also load it on the pick-up truck. The cow was returned to the cattle pound and an offence was registered against Bajaniya and other unidentified persons at Makarpura police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/attempt-to-steal-cow-from-vmcs-cattle-pound-thwarted/articleshow/87441262.cms||---

A council meeting of MCC held on Saturday had referred a proposal in this regard to the Standing Committee on Town Planning. In fact, a proposal in this regard was mooted by Mangaluru City North MLA Y Bharath Shetty of the BJP. “Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was a freedom fighter who dedicated his life for the nation at a young age. Hence, to commemorate his sacrifice, the circle at Surathkal junction should be named after him,” the MLA wrote to the city corporation. Corporators from the SDPI Muneeb Bengre, Shamsad Aboobakker and opposition leader from Congress A C Vinayaraj have sought notices for the meeting of the Town Planning Standing Committee which is expected to discuss the proposal. Corporator Muneeb Bengre told TOI that the SDPI will move legally against the proposal of naming Surathkal junction after Savarkar. Bengre said that he will oppose the proposal in the Town Planning Standing Committee meeting. Meanwhile SDPI Surathkal block president Salam Kana said the BJP is trying to deviate people’s attention from core issues by proposing to name the circle after Savarkar. “SDPI will not tolerate the Sangh Parivar’s hidden agenda of renaming places. We will hold protests jointly in association with like-minded parties and organisations. The city corporation should reject the proposal and concentrate on solving various civic issues. Surathkal was a communally sensitive area, but in recent years, there is communal harmony. However, the BJP is trying to disrupt the peace through the proposal,” he added. According to officials, as per a government direction of 2009, Town Planning Standing committees of urban local bodies may verify any such proposals and the same needs to be published in two Kannada newspapers after a council approval. Thereafter, objections and suggestions should be invited from the public within a month and it should be placed before a council meeting again before sending it to the government for approval.

---||Trichy||1.3L dropouts enrolled back in schools in 5 months: Min||Trichy/Coimbatore: School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said on Sunday in Trichy that the school education department identified 1.28 lakh school dropouts in the past five months and have enrolled them back in the school education system. He said that the drive to bring back school dropouts during the outbreak of Covid-19 would continue even after the schools reopen on Monday. “After identifying the dropouts, the school education department has enrolled them back in schools through extensive interactions. If anybody finds young children not attending schools, they can inform headmasters or education department officials to enroll the child,” the minister said. After surveying the students who have neither approached the school for transfer certificates nor reported for online classes, school headmasters and teachers have contacted their parents to enroll their wards back in schools. “While some students have been employed at mechanic shops and construction sites, many are sitting idle at home,” K Maruthanayagam, block education officer in Trichy, said. The officials said that parents have made the idle students babysit infants of their elder siblings. “Rural civic body chiefs and the child welfare department have supported us in identifying the dropouts. Many phone calls were made to convince the parents. Internal migration within the state has also happened,” R Madan Kumar, chief educational officer, Karur district, said. Teachers have identified the children who had migrated to other districts and alerted their counterparts for follow-up. Students have been identified from all types of schools including government-aided, matriculation and CBSE schools. The students could be identified after their names fell in the common pool in the education management information system (EMIS). If a student was given a transfer certificate and the student hasn’t joined any other school for a certain period, the name of the student will go to the common pool. Meanwhile, as there was opposition from a section of people for the ‘education at doorstep’ scheme, minister Poyyamozhi said that the pilot project is being implemented carefully and the volunteers have been selected after four levels of scrutiny. He reiterated that NEP will not be implemented in the state as there is a proposal to formulate a separate educational policy for Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/1-3l-dropouts-enrolled-back-in-schools-in-5-months-min/articleshow/87442699.cms||---

He began his journey after a holy dip in the Ganga in Varanasi on August 25 last year. He has already covered 15 states. Rohan, who believes in learning through a process that is more like gurukul education, was in Mangaluru recently. He is currently in Belagavi. He stays in temples, mosques, churches, outside buildings, homes or on the streets. He is on his way to Goa and Maharashtra but has plans for much wider travel. “When I decided to learn through travelling, my parents thought it was a weird decision and I should not take it forward. This journey is the result of my reading and wanting to explore the world on my own. I have called this journey, ‘Hiking to Siberia without money’. In the next 10 years, I hope to reach Oymyakon in Russia by walking from Delhi. I started this journey with only Rs 2,500 of which Rs 1,000 was robbed, but I have been able to sustain myself. I don’t ask anyone for anything, but when anyone offers something, I do not refuse it,” he said. Throughout the journey, Rohan has volunteered in dog shelters and farms, worked in hotels, served as a chef in a hostel, taught English to underprivileged children and done all kinds of odd jobs. “I am keen on learning about religions and have realised that travel is an integral part of all religions. Despite seeing a lot of negativity around, I am glad that humanity still exists. On the journey, I have realised that the biggest problem is the plastic menace and there is lack of awareness on how to reduce the use of plastic. In the last one year, I have conducted and participated in about 15 clean-ups, “ he said. On why he selected Siberia as the final destination, Rohan said: “I have a problem facing extreme cold conditions, but believe that we can overcome anything as most problems are in the mind. The journey has been amazing so far as I am working and learning new skills,” he said. Rohan is the son of Ramesh Agrawal, who runs a water bottle store in Nagpur, and Seema Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/19-year-old-on-journey-across-india-hitch-hikes-through-15-states/articleshow/87440097.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Suspecting misuse of the man’s credentials for vaccination, the family urged the district administration and health department to inquire into the incident. The deceased, Selvaraj Govindhachettiyar, hailing from Beschi street in Woraiyur, had taken his first dose at MGMGH on April 28. Two weeks later, he contracted Covid-19 and succumbed to the infection on May 15. However, on Saturday the family received the acknowledgement message of his second dose Covishield vaccination on his mobile phone. According to the vaccination certificate, Selvaraj, five months after his death, has taken the second dose at a mini-clinic in Trichy during the seventh mass vaccination camp. “We wonder whether his personal information was misused further for the vaccination programme,” N S Karthi, son-in-law of Selvaraj, told TOI. Deputy director of health services A Subramani said a clerical mistake in updating the mobile number on CoWin platform had caused the gaffe and there was no intention to show high vaccination numbers. A section of medical officers involved in vaccination duty blamed the mess on the targets set for them at the mass drives on consecutive weeks, which caused fatigue and stress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-dead-5-mths-ago-got-dose-2-now-sms/articleshow/87442759.cms||Deepak Karthik

The model of a train has been mounted atop one of the school buildings. The train named Anthikad-Thiruvananthapuram Express is a veiled reference to several leaders like minister K Rajan and former minister VS Sunilkumar having studied there. Film personalities like T K Vasudevan, assistant director of the award winning film ‘Chemmeen’, had also studied in the school. The school campus also houses a model of a helicopter while the school gate itself has been designed like a school bus. A mini zoo, an aquarium and bio-diversity park have been set up in the school. The school, established in 1901 as Kolayamparambath Gopalan Memorial School, faced closure earlier due to various factors like fall in students, underdevelopment of infrastructure and competition from other schools in the area. “The school functioned then in a thatched-roof building. There was a system of four-and-half standard class where students who passed from fourth standard are admitted as a preparatory system for fifth standard,” said Vasudevan Subsequently, the school was brought under the staff management system in 1998. “The school authorities and people of the area worked in tandem for the school’s development,” said Sunilkumar . “The staff, students, PTA and the people of the area have established that it is possible to achieve excellence in an institution, even if located in a village area,” said Rajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/transporting-kids-to-their-future/articleshow/87442777.cms||T Ramavarman

The sudden showers lasted for nearly two hours and left many parts of the taluka flooded. Areas in and around the Valpoi town also faced power outage. A road in front of the Forest Training School (FTS) at Valpoi was inundated and traffic movement along the stretch was disrupted. Shubham Shivolkar, a resident of Melauli, said that the area opposite the Forest Training School has been facing a problem with water logging for the past several years. Every monsoon it is the same story, he said, adding that since the road opposite the Forest Training School is a main road and leads to Panaji, any disruption in traffic along the stretch causes major inconveniences for commuters. The government must come up with a permanent solution for this problem, Shivolkar said even as he was one of the many stranded on the road on Sunday. A large number of vehicles were seen stalled on either sides of the road. Traffic movement resumed only after the water receded. Roads were also inundated at Thane, Charvane, Nagargao and Hivre villages of Sattari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-showers-waterlogging-hit-traffic-in-sattari/articleshow/87443927.cms||---

The previous best was 84.42% in the 2018 assembly polls. Both TRS and BJP have claimed that the high turnout would benefit them respectively. Of the five mandals in the constituency, Ellanthakunta recorded the highest, 90.73% of its electorate casting their vote, followed by Veenavanka at 88.84%, Kamalapur 87.57%, Huzurabad 85.66% and Jammikunta 83.66%. Of 2,36,873 voters, 2,05,236 had exercised their franchise, registering 86.64% polling. While 87.05% male voters cast their vote, 86.25% women exercised their franchise. Huzurabad assembly constituency returning officer Ch Ravinder Reddy said all arrangements were being made for counting of votes on Tuesday (November 2). The result would be declared on the same day. He appealed to the people not to believe in social media rumours that one of the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) was shifted in a private vehicle in violation of election rules. BJP had raised an objection and also lodged a complaint with the chief electoral officer (CEO) about the VVPAT issue following which CEO Shashank Goel sought a report on VVPAT issue from the election officials in the Huzurabad constituency and Karimnagar district. Ravinder Reddy told reporters on Sunday that the local election officials had identified the technical glitch in the VVPAT during mock polling itself and had replaced it with a reserve VVPAT. “When the defective VVPAT was being shifted in a bus it was videographed by someone who made it viral on social media resulting in rumours. All rules were followed and there was nothing unofficial about it. The defective VVPAT was shifted from one government vehicle to another government and stored officially. Don’t believe in social media rumours,” he appealed to the people and political parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-logs-86-6-polling-sets-new-record/articleshow/87442732.cms||Roushan Ali

While the academic curriculum will not be taught for the next two weeks, managing students entering the classroom for the first time and fine-tuning them to sync with the traditional classroom environment amid the Covid-19 scare will test their acumen. School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said on Sunday that friendly competitions will be organized for the first few weeks to help children overcome pandemic fear and mingle with their friends. While schools with more students have opted to host classes for a section of them on alternative days, those with minimal strength plan to hold classes throughout the week. “Many parents may prefer to send their children after Diwali. Based on the response on Monday, we will streamline our activities to engage the children in a friendly way,” D Rajarajeshwari, headmistress of Trichy corporation middle school at Bhima Nagar, said. In rural government schools, teachers have sought the support of rural civic body representatives to boost the confidence of parents in sending their wards to school. “We have displayed motivational messages on boards near schools. The panchayat president was invited to preside and welcome the students on the reopening day,” A Allirani, second-grade teacher, Maduranpudukottai panchayat union primary school in Thanjavur said. With most of the parents working as daily wagers, teachers expect good support on the reopening day in rural areas.

Venugopal said it is true the judgment of the top court notes the fact that Savarkar has been found not guilty of Gandhiji's assassination in the criminal trial.However, if one reads the judgment as a whole, it is clear the court was disinclined to go into findings of the Justice Kapoor Commission of Inquiry “I may also point out that Justice Kapoor has retired as a judge of the Supreme Court in the year 1962, and hence was a retired judge when he was appointed as Commission of Inquiry in 1966. The statement made by Owaisi is relatable, therefore, to the finding of Justice Kapoor Commission and not the Supreme Court,” he said. “It would therefore be difficult to hold that he has committed contempt of the Supreme Court by suggesting and/or implying that a sitting judge of the Supreme Court had held that Savarkar was complicit in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi, which is completely contrary to factual reality. I am therefore constrained to decline consent for initiation of contempt proceedings against Owaisi,” the AG in his reply dated October 26 said. Owaisi demanded to know if RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat would refuse observations of Justice Kapur Commission of Inquiry in its report that Savarkar was complicit in Gandhiji's assassination.

---||Nagpur||Use green hydrogen to make steel too: Gadkari||Nagpur: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who has been advocating use of green hydrogen to run vehicles besides other alternate fuels, has also suggested its use in steel production. The minister was speaking at a function organized by Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL) on Sunday. The mini ratna PSU inducted a new vertical shaft at one of its mines in Nagpur district. Union steel minister Ram Chandra Prasad Singh was also present. Gadkari has been mooting the idea of separating hydrogen and oxygen from water to use it as fuel. Just like it can replace petroleum in vehicles, green hydrogen can also be used instead of coking coal in making steel, he said. Coking coal is largely imported for the domestic steel industry Manganese also goes into making steel and is used for strengthening the metal. The steel minister also agreed, saying that it is theoretically possible. It would take time for the technique to be fully adopted, he said. Singh said at present the country is heavily dependent on imports of coking coal. Gadkari also hit out at environmentalists for opposing mining projects by raising issues related to ecology. “How will the country progress without it? Even today over 45 lakh MT of manganese has to be imported in the country even when there are reserves in the country,” he said. “Even I am a strong champion of green fuel like ethanol, bio-diesel or CNG. But the country’s development also has to go side by side,” said the minister. Gadkari said as he is chairing the infrastructure clearance committee, he would ensure that no work is stalled unnecessarily. The steel minister also stressed on the need for increasing production. Currently, more than half of the country’s manganese requirement has to be imported. The steel production has been planned to be taken over 300 million MT over the years under the national steel policy of 2017. At present it is 110 million MT, said Singh. He also said the government has to adopt a convincing approach while dealing with locals in a mining areas. “The deposits are mainly located in tribal areas. If there is opposition by the locals, a win-win solution has to be derived. We are a democracy and cannot just bulldoze over them,” he said. Singh also said that the per capital consumption of steel is on the lower side. In urban areas it is 74kg while it is around 15kg in the rural parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/use-green-hydrogen-to-make-steel-too-gadkari/articleshow/87441407.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bail granted to party ‘organisers’ as they had no control over cruise & passengers||MUMBAI: Observing that it was pertinent to note that no one from Cordelia’s team and sponsors were made accused in the cruise drug bust case, a special NDPS court, that granted bail to the four alleged “organisers” of the party, said they had no control over the cruise liner and passengers, did not have the authority to regulate entry on board or assign rooms, and their company was only involved in conducting live entertainment on the ship. Directors Gopal Jee Anand, (35) and Sameer Sehgal (30) and employees Bhaskar Arora (33) and Manav Singhal (33), of Delhi-based Caneplus Trading Pvt Ltd operating under the brand name Namas’cray, were arrested on October 5, after the cruise ship returned to Mumbai. Accepting the submissions of defence advocate Sajal Yadav, the court said, “It can be gathered that they [alleged organisers] had no control over the cruise and passengers. Therefore, applicant(s) cannot be directly said to be connected with co-accused or with the recovery made at the instance of the co-accused.” Granting bail to the four on Saturday, the court, in four separate orders, made several common observations. While the stringent Section 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, which attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years and ensures a bar on granting bail, was invok-ed against the four, special judge V V Patil said the prosecution had not placed on record any evidence showing that they were in any way financing illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders. The court said nothing has been recovered from them and no element of conspiracy exists. “Thus, the case of the prosecution cannot be accepted that there was conspiracy in between the applicant (s) and co-accused for commission of offence pertaining to the NDPS Act.” Yadav had submitted that the company in its promotions, via social media and the ticketing site, had clearly warned every passenger to abstain from bringing any drugs or illegal substance, in view of their “zero tolerance policy for consuming and distributing drugs or substances”. The court, while granting bail, said: “Thus applicants’ company, on its part, has taken all necessary precautions...they have, in clear words, mentioned in all documents that no drugs or substances are allowed. It is therefore argued by advocate for the applicant (s) that in such circumstances, they cannot be connected with the alleged drugs recovered at the instance of the co-accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-granted-to-party-organisers-as-they-had-no-control-over-cruise-passengers/articleshow/87442811.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: BJP seeks CBI probe into EVM allegations in Huzurabad by-election||HYDERABAD: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into stopping an RTC bus carrying polling officials and material and allegedly replacing some electronic voting machines (EVMs) after the polling in the Huzurabad by-election. Telangana chief electoral officer (CEO) Shashank Goel, however, denied the allegations. BJP leaders DK Aruna and N Ramachander Rao, in a complaint to the Telangana CEO, alleged that after completion of poll, the control units and VVPATs were to be kept in a strong room at SR College, Karimnagar. “For transportation, RTC buses were used to shift control units, VVPATs, and other election material, presiding officer and other polling officials. In the early hours, when buses carrying EVMs were reaching SR College, a car driver was seen walking with a VVPAT in his hand and put it in a white car. BJP and Congress activists saw him and stopped the car. They asked the driver why he was taking a VVPAT in a car instead of the bus. He informed them that his officer had asked him to keep it in the car,” they claimed. Chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said, “The returning officer explained to political parties and verified all EVMs in the presence of their representatives. They were all shiffted safely to strongrooms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-seeks-cbi-probe-into-evm-allegations/articleshow/87442816.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kochi||Kerala: With digital divide gone, tribal students a happy lot||KOCHI: The tribal students residing in extremely rural areas are the happiest and most excited about the reopening of schools as they do not have to deal with the digital divide anymore. Teachers and education department officials said that students are happy to return to their schools as online education has been a difficult affair for most of them due to various reasons. Moreover, many of the tribal students, who study at model residential school (MRS) can get back to their hostels from Monday where they can enjoy better accommodation, food and learning facilities. All these MRS students were confined to their tribal settlements for more than 20 months after the closure of the schools due to the pandemic, and accessibility to online education was not possible for many. Even though the government plans a hybrid mode to continue, students and teachers think reopening is the ideal solution in many tribal areas. Teachers have already reached the schools and MGLCs in tribal settlements, which are difficult to access by road, ahead of the reopening to make the arrangements. In some schools, even students residing nearby were eager to help the authorities with the preparations but teachers had to discourage them due to Covid restrictions. “Most of the tribal students, especially those living in tribal settlements, were waiting to get back to school. In Ernakulam alone, around 700 of students, mostly from Pinavoorkudy and Mamalakandam in Kothamangalam, are studying in various MRSs. The digital divide was a major challenge for them. But besides learning, many are excited about getting back to school as they would get regular mid-day meals. Tribal students are more comfortable with offline learning,” said Honey G Alexander, deputy director of education, Ernakulam. Also, many students have decided to join schools not because of their passion for learning but for sports and games. All those activities had stopped due to the pandemic and they hope to resume it eventually after reopening. APM Mohammed Hanish, principal secretary of general education, said that the education department has directed district collectors to provide additional support in terms of manpower and resources to schools in tribal areas as many schools were affected by the recent heavy rains and floods. School authorities, with the help of PTA, civic bodies and well-wishers, have readied the infrastructure ahead of the reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-digital-divide-gone-tribal-students-a-happy-lot/articleshow/87442827.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Delhi||Half of Delhi fully vaccinated, 19 lakh adults still out of net||NEW DELHI: While Delhi is the only city in the country to have administered more than 2 crore vaccine doses and nearly half of its adult population is now fully vaccinated, over 19 lakh eligible people are yet to get the shots. A drive has now been started to identify these beneficiaries. Till 7pm on Sunday, 2,04,80,189 vaccine doses had been administered, including 1,30,54,901 first doses and 74,25,288 second. With the number of eligible people being around 1.5 crore, 49.5% of adults had been fully vaccinated and 87% had received at least one dose of the vaccine. With 19.4 lakh adults still not being vaccinated, this cause for concern was discussed in a recent meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority, sources said. In the meeting, it was discussed that though Delhi was leading in vaccination among metro cities, a “targeted approach” was being implemented to reach out to the remaining eligible beneficiaries who hadn’t received a single dose of the vaccine. Efforts were also on to create awareness about getting the second dose of the vaccine in time. Sources said efforts were on to first identify the population left out of the vaccination drive, either due to vaccine hesitancy or any other reason, and also carry out an extensive information, education and communication campaign to create awareness. Mobile teams to reach out to these beneficiaries had been created at the district-level to try and mobilise the eligible population to get vaccinated. Delhi government was also going to organise special camps for them, sources said. Out of the over 2 crore doses administered in Delhi, 64.3% (1,31,74,658) were received by those in the 18-44 years category. In the 45-59 years category, the number was 48,70,161 or 23.7% of the total doses administered. Those aged 60 and above had received 24,35,689 (12%) doses. While North West district had administered the highest number of vaccine doses at 24,42,392, South West district was at the second place with 23,65,116 doses. Compared with 8,48,730 second doses administered by North West district, South West district has administered 8,66,646. On the other hand, North East district saw the least number of second doses being administered at 3,96,468, even though it had more cumulative doses (9,03,571) compared with Shahdara and New Delhi districts, which have administered around 6 lakh total shots. While around 2 lakh vaccine doses were being administered a day earlier, it had dipped to around 75,000 daily of late. With a large number of the eligible population having received their first dose of the vaccine, the number of second doses being administered now was higher. The vaccination drive, which started on January 16 this year, reached a high of nearly 11 lakh doses being administered in a week between June 26 and July 2. It reached an all-time high of 11.6 lakh doses between September 18 and 24. More than 2 lakh people got vaccinated in a day on September 25 and 27, but the numbers have not crossed the 2-lakh mark in a day since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/half-of-delhi-fully-vaxxed-19l-adults-still-out-of-net/articleshow/87442820.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Madurai||HC denies retest for cop in SI recruitment||Madurai: Setting aside the order of a single bench which had directed the authorities to re-conduct physical ability test for a candidate who participated in the recruitment to the post of sub-inspector of police, Madras high court observed that the recruitment processes will completely go awry if such a practice is encouraged. Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board had challenged the order passed by the single bench dated June 17, which directed authorities to re-conduct test for petitioner P Jeyasundar, a police constable. Hearing the appeal, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M Duraiswamy observed that case made out by the petitioner was that since he was engaged in Covid-19 protection duty and had been infected, he took treatment from October 17, 2020 to October 23 in a government hospital. However, what is of relevance is that his indisposition did not lead to the petitioner missing the physical ability test conducted on October 13 prior to him being infected with Covid-19. He participated in the test and obtained two stars in rope climbing and long jump, but one star in the running race due to which he was not selected. The judges observed that the petitioner participated in the test and failed to make the mark. The fact that four days later he had contracted the infection is no ground for any discretion to be exercised in his favour at a time when the recruitment process has already been concluded. “Merely because a particular person feels to be under the weather or otherwise not up to the mark on a particular day when the test is scheduled, it does not imply that such person has to be afforded a further opportunity to take the test at his convenience. Recruitment processes will go completely awry if such a practice were to be encouraged,” observed the judges. Rejecting the petitioner’s contention that considerations were shown to other similarly placed people, the judges observed that Article 14 of the Constitution does not operate in a negative sense. If a few people have been erroneously conferred a benefit that they may not have been entitled to, the same cannot be cited as an instance to perpetuate the wrong. Hence, the judges set aside the single bench order while allowing an appeal preferred by TNUSRB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-denies-retest-for-cop-in-si-recruitment/articleshow/87442828.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Consider woman’s plea for compassionate posting: HC||Madurai: Taking into account that a woman was unable to obtain destitute widow certificate from the authorities on time due to the Covid-19 lockdown, Madras high court upheld the order of a single bench which had directed to consider a woman’s application seeking compassionate appointment. Petitioner R Manjula Devi’s husband who was working in the transport corporation in Madurai died during service on August 29, 2017. She had submitted an application seeking appointment on compassionate grounds on September 29 last year. However, the authorities rejected it saying she had submitted it after the three-year prescribed time limit. Aggrieved, the woman challenged it before high court this year. The single bench, by an order dated February 15, quashed the rejection order and remanded the matter back to the authorities for consideration. Challenging it, the transport corporation filed the present appeal. A division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that no doubt the petitioner should have submitted the application for compassionate appointment within three years of the date of her husband’s death, that is, before August 29, 2020. However, due to the lockdown last year, government offices were not functioning and the petitioner was able to receive the destitute widow certificate from the authorities only on September 12, 2020. Due to this reason she had submitted the application after a delay of one month, on September 29, said the judges. The judges observed that they were in total agreement with the order passed by the single judge directing the authorities to consider the application as a special case and provide employment to her, taking into consideration the lockdown during the pandemic. Saying so, the bench dismissed the appeal preferred by the transport corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/consider-womans-plea-for-compassionate-posting-hc/articleshow/87442823.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The Administrator also flagged off a large motorcycle rally, which was followed by a bicycle rally in which children also participated. The tableaux showcased at Parade Ground highlighted the message of unity. The Run for Unity, which has been a regular feature of Rashtriya Ekta Divas, was also flagged off from Parade Ground. Later in the evening, celebrations concluded with a performance by the police band, followed by a grand laser show at Sukhna lake on the journey of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Architect of United India.

---||Madurai||HC bail for MV official jailed in bribery case||Madurai: Madras high court has granted bail to a woman motor vehicle inspector who was arrested in a bribery case in Thanjavur district. R Kalaiselvi who sought bail was arrested by the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) sleuths on September 3. The prosecution said complainant Arun along with Anthony Yagappa, working in a two-wheeler agency, approached her on August 27 to receive RC books of two vehicles already registered at the Pattukottai RTO. The petitioner demanded Rs 4,500 from the complainant to issue the RC books and instructed to hand over the money to an agent, Karthickraja. Based on Arun’s complaint, DVAC officials had set up a trap and arrested the petitioner. The petitioner submitted through her counsel that even according to the prosecution, the bribe was handed over to Karthickraja who was in no way associated with the petitioner. She has been falsely implicated in this case and since she is in jail for over 55 days, she has not been able to extend assistance to her daughter who is suffering from certain health ailments. The additional public prosecutor opposed the grant of bail saying that another case was registered against her by the Virudhunagar district DVAC in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-bail-for-mv-official-jailed-in-bribery-case/articleshow/87442847.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||A tale from 1971 war: When Indian Army’s tank blitzkrieg forced Pak to retreat without fight||By Col Nitin ChandraFarakka Barrage in the north to Bay of Bengal in the south — apart from 4 Mountain Division and 9 Infantry Division on its ORBAT (short for order of battle), 2 Corps also had 45 Cavalry, a light amphibious armoured regiment and one T-55 tank squadron of 63 Cavalry under its command. The terrain in this alluvial plain sect was riverine with wide rivers, innumerable tributaries, nullahs, ponds and was wooded with bamboo groves. The water table was high, so the terrain was marshy. The 45 Cavalry was equipped with PT-76 tanks, designed by Russians to cross a network of rivers and canals in Europe. PT stood for ‘Plavushi Tanka’, meaning a tank that can swim/float and 76 was the caliber of the gun. It could carry 22 combat soldiers or an RCL gun mounted on a jeep and swim across a water obstacle. Being amphibious, it was light in weight and did not have much armour protection. It was, therefore, not suitable for tank-versus-tank battles. However, the fact that Charlie Squadron of 45 Cavalry, equipped with this tank, fought the historic battle of Garibpur — a tank-versus-tank battle in which 3 (I) Armoured Squadron of the Pakistan Army was annihilated — is another story. The plan of the 2 Corps in the 4 Mountain Division’s sector was to employ the division for an advance to Magura by way of Jibannagar-Kotchandpur-Jhenida and secure a ferry site on the Madhumati river. The division would then capture Faridpur, secure Goalandu Ghat, and mop up on Kushtia-Hardinge bridge. Opposing 2 Corps was Pakistan’s 9 Infantry Division with its headquarters at Jessore. It had two regular infantry brigades and one ad-hoc infantry brigade, two field artillery regiments, two armoured squadrons of M24 Chaffee tanks, and one reconnaissance and support battalion. After Dhaka, Jessore was the most important town in East Pakistan. Jhenida, north of Jessore, was another fortress and strategically important. Consequent to loss of Jibannagar, Uthali and Darsana, by December 4, 1971, Brig Manzoor Ahmad, commander of 57 Infantry Brigade of Pakistan, had assessed the next Indian objective would be Chuadanga, so he concentrated his troops there and sited his defences to face the Indian attack. To contain enemy troops within Chuadanga and deny reinforcement from Jhenida, Indian Army’s Maj Gen M S Brar decided to establish a roadblock at Uttar Narayanpur, with 5 Guards (less one infantry company) and Alfa Squadron of 45 Cavalry (less one tank troop), to cut the road between Chuadanga and Jhenida. A secondary roadblock with a balanced force (one infantry company and one tank troop) was planned at Paschim DurgapurMaj Gen M S Brar, GOC of 4 Mountain Division, however, planned differently. To contain enemy troops within Chuadanga, thereby denying reinforcement from Jhenida, he decided to establish a roadblock at Uttar Narayanpur with 5 Guards (less one infantry company) and Alfa Squadron of 45 Cavalry (less one tank troop), to cut the road between Chuadanga and Jhenida. A secondary roadblock with balanced force (one infantry company and one tank troop) was planned at Paschim Durgapur. Alfa Squadron of 45 Cavalry, commanded by Maj P K Batra and 5 Guards, advanced from Darsana and the force contacted Chitra river by 1pm on December 5. Tanks ferried stores and troops across the river and complete force was across by 4pm. When tanks were crossing Chitra, villagers on the far bank ran away except for one child, who kept standing. Tank troop leader Lt Harsh Vardhan, on reaching the far bank, got off the tank and gave the child a packet of biscuits. On seeing this, villagers returned in ones and twos. They said they though it was the Pakistani Army, so they ran away. On coming to know they were Indian tanks, they raised pro-India and Bangladesh slogans and offered fish and fresh vegetables. The tank crew reciprocated by giving them rice and dal. The advance was resumed and one tank troop under 2nd Lt S R Chandravarkar and one infantry company were detached to secure Paschim Durgapur. A few days later, 2nd Lt Chandravarkar was killed in a tank ambush. That will be covered in a subsequent column. The remaining force reached Uttar Narayanpur by 11pm. While infantry was in the process of taking up positions, a large convoy of enemy vehicles was reported to be approaching the roadblock from Chuadanga. Before the major chunk of the convoy could be destroyed, an inexperienced soldier in the outer tier of the roadblock opened fire in panic. Thereafter, hell broke loose and indiscriminate firing followed. Taking advantage of darkness and since few vehicles had come into range, several enemy vehicles escaped back towards Chuadanga. In all, 12 enemy vehicles (carrying FOL, ammunition and other war-like stores) were found destroyed, with some enemy soldiers killed. Brig Ahmad, on being informed of the attack, was taken aback. He wanted a report of the strength and spread of the Indian forces at the site of the attack. A reconnaissance was ordered. Things on the roadblocks at Uttar Narayanpur and Paschim Durgapur were settling down. Infantry had dug in and tanks had been deployed, arcs of fire, range cards had been prepared and allocated. As there was some respite, a tank commander told his driver to get off and brew some tea. While he was doing so, two Pakistani Army jeeps, most likely on reconnaissance mission, suddenly appeared and a hand grenade was lobbed at him. Showing reflexes, the driver threw back the grenade, which fell inside the jeep and its driver in panic drove down the embankment and the jeep overturned. The second jeep reversed and sped away. The grenade didn’t explode and three Pakistani soldiers were captured, almost unhurt. The Pakistanis cursed the poor quality of the grenade, but on being told by the subedar of 5 Guards that it was the same grenade that saved their lives, they all broke into a sheepish laugh. The Pakistani POWs were administered first aid and given tea. The roadblock was effective by first light on December 6. Around 11am, three trucks, seen coming from Jhenida side, were destroyed by tank fire. In all, 10 enemy soldiers were killed and one 3.7 Howitzer gun was captured. Having confirmed from all sources that it was a strong force which had established the roadblock, Brig Ahmad decided to launch a counter attack. Around 2pm, enemy artillery shelling commenced, while two infantry companies of the enemy started forming up in the northwest to counter-attack the roadblock. Time being vital, a tank troop under Naib Risaldar George Thomas was ordered to move onto the enemy’s flank and assault. Soon after the tank troop commenced move, the troop leader lost radio contact with the squadron commander and the follow up infantry company commander. He could see enemy infantry almost ready to move out of their forming up place (FUP). Enemy artillery had identified the location of the tanks and brought down artillery fire onto his tanks. In this shelling, a tank commander, Dafadar G Sishupalan, was killed. In the absence of orders due to breakdown in radio communication, Naib Risaldar Thomas, displaying leadership and courage, commenced an assault on the enemy. Heavy volume of tank main gun and machine gun fire caught the enemy, whose counter attack was broken even before it could be launched. This action by Naib Risaldar Thomas was a classic example of bravery, leadership, quick thinking and high initiative of a junior leader who used firepower, shock action, and mobility of the tanks to the maximum. Enemy could not reinforce The roadblock proved timely and effective. The enemy could not reinforce Jhenida. Pakistan’s 57 Infantry Brigade had to finally outflank from the north towards Kushtia-Hardinge bridge and de-induct out of this sector, without fighting any more battles. It had been proven that tanks were the mainstay for the success of these roadblocks. This action also broke the cohesiveness of Pakistan’s 9 Infantry Division, as 107 Infantry Brigade subsequently retreated south towards Khulna, while the division headquarters got cornered at Faridpur, across the Madhumati river, where they surrendered on December 16, 1971. This roadblock was established 23km inside enemy territory and was out of range of its own artillery guns. It also maintained complete surprise during the entire operation.

For the convenience of visitors, the UT forest and wildlife department submitted a proposal to the Centre for starting an electric bus to Nepli and Kansal forest areas of Sukhna Wildlife sanctuary from Sukhna Lake regulatory end. However, the Centre has not given funds from the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to the administration to buy the electric bus. Instead, the centre suggested that the UT administration consider hiring an electric bus to promote these places from the tourism point of view.’ A senior UT official said that they are taking up the matter with the UT Adviser and if needed, an electric bus can be hired from Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU). The UT had planned that the electric bus would be purchased by the UT forest and wildlife department. The proposal was also part of UT’s environment action plan 2021-22. Presently, UT forest and wildlife department issues permit for these forest areas to maximum of 100 persons a day. The permit was issued from the UT forest and wildlife department office, Paryavaran Bhawan, Sector 19, Chandigarh. Visitors use personal vehicles to visit these forest areas. UT planned to continue issuing around 70 permits from the forest and wildlife department office while the remaining 30 permits or tickets would be issued to visitors on the spot at Sukhna Lake regulatory end. They would proceed in an electric bus. With the introduction of an electric bus, the department aimed to reduce the number of vehicles in forest areas as noise of these vehicles affects animals in the wildlife sanctuary. The UT administration also planned to fix a nominal ticket fee for an electric bus, which would leave the regulatory end at around 10am to 11am and return by 3pm to 4pm. Box: Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, including Nepli and Kansal forests, forms part of Sukhna Lake catchment area, falling in Shivalik hills. It houses nine species of mammals and 63 species of birds. The sanctuary, spreading over an area of 26 sq km, is inhabited by a large number of Sambars, peacocks and endangered species like spotted deer, porcupine, pangolin, wild pigs and cheetal. As per the census report compiled by the Wildlife Institute of India in 2010, the Sanctuary has nearly 1,031 Sambars and 920 peacocks. The wildlife habitat also houses a wide variety of butterflies, moth, honey bee and other micro-organisms in abundance, besides a variety of reptiles including snakes like cobra, rat snake, Common krait, Russell’s Viper, Indian python, common monitor lizard (Gho) and freshwater turtle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-buy-hire-electric-bus-for-sukhna-wildlife-sanctuary-centre/articleshow/87441445.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The court passed the interim order while hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by N Neelakandan, president of the parents-teachers association of the panchayat union middle school at Ponnavarayankottai village in the district. The petitioner stated that the panchayat union middle school was constructed in 1957 on the land owned by the panchayat union while the village panchayat office was constructed on the land in 1986. That apart, an anganwadi, library, ration shop and post office were functioning on the same land. He stated that since the panchayat village panchayat office was in a dilapidated condition, the office was functioning from the library building. The library building was damaged due to cyclone Gaja in 2018 due to which the office was shifted to a different locality. A division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar ordered status quo to be maintained and sought response from the Thanjavur district administration officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-status-quo-on-building-panchayat-office-on-school-campus/articleshow/87442853.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Finally, Maharashtra govt allows daily train tickets for fully vaccinated||MUMBAI: The state government directed the railways to resume issuing daily journey tickets from booking counters on the suburban network from Sunday. As with the season pass, the condition is that only the double vaccinated who have completed 14 days since the last dose are allowed to buy tickets. As a safety measure, the government had barred daily journey tickets to avoid crowding, leading to a spurt in ticketless travel. It realised that rampant ticketless travel— Rs 29 crore recovered in fines from seven lakh ticketless travellers in the past seven months—was an even greater infection risk. Onus on railways to ensure only fully vaccinated take trainsAs the state government finally allowed daily train journeys from Sunday, stations witnessed a slight increase in the rush. Officials said the demand for single journey tickets was likely to go up from Monday. In the directive to the railways to allow daily tickets, principal secretary Aseem Gupta from the State Disaster Management Authority said that from now on full vaccination would be the only mandatory condition for issuance of any kind of ticket for travel on local and passenger trains. Gupta’s missive said it would be the responsibility of the railways to ensure only fully vaccinated people travelled on trains, irrespective of whether the traveller was from the essential or non-essential service sector. The letter to the divisional railway managers said: “While only fully vaccinated persons are allowed to travel using monthly passes, many citizens are demanding allowing travel using daily tickets. Due to several people needing to travel through local trains and absence of permission to travel on daily tickets, tendency to travel without valid tickets has increased and this is also leading to non-compliance of the requirement of travellers to be fully vaccinated. As a result, Railways is facing huge losses in revenue and it is more dangerous from the point of view of the spread of Covid-19 cases. “It has therefore been decided to permit all who are fully vaccinated as per the definition of state government to travel in local trains. All fully vaccinated citizens may travel in local and passenger trains on all routes and through all kinds of tickets, including daily tickets.” Last week, there were several complaints from passengers from the essential services category — government staff, people in medical and related fields, and other such — that they were unable to buy tickets as the railways had made it compulsory to go for monthly passes. Now, anyone can show a double vaccine certificate or universal pass and get a ticket, which is expected to substantially lower the incidence of ticketless travel. Subhash Gupta from the Rail Yatri Parishad said allowing daily tickets was a much-awaited decision. “We have been fighting for daily tickets for the past two months. It will not only lead to a rise in ridership gradually but will also give benefit to a cross-section of commuters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-onus-on-rlys-to-ensure-only-fully-vaccinated-take-trains/articleshow/87442874.cms||Somit Sen

The state is witnessing a jump in dengue, dengue-like illness, scrub typhus, and other vector-borne diseases such as malaria and chikungunya after the monsoon season, at a time when the Covid-19 cases are being reported in single-digit daily for more than a month. The threat of seasonal disease can be gauged with the fact that chief minister Ashok Gehlot had organised a video conference with doctors just before Diwali on seasonal diseases. Taking measures to prevent the spread of seasonal diseases, the health department has issued orders not to relieve the temporary Covid health consultants and assistants. A fleet of covid health consultants and covid health assistants, who were trained by the health department when it was grappling with Covid-19 during the aggressive second wave, will be retained till December. They were recruited for their services till July 31, but the health department had issued fresh orders extending their services till October. The health department is not taking any chance of leaving loose ends in the preparation for the third wave of Covid-19. The finance department had also approved retaining them till October. A health department official said Covid health consultants and assistants were recruited to bring down mortalities related to Covid by breaking the chain of infections and ensuring treatment to the patients, especially in the rural areas. They had distributed medicines door-to-door during the second wave and surveyed the rural areas to identify suspected Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/services-of-covid-consultants-extended-till-dec-to-tackle-dengue/articleshow/87573447.cms||---

A task force will be formed to scrutinise and clear incentives under the scheme, which will remain effective till September 2022. “In order to make the existing industry in Goa competitive at the state, national and international level, the government of Goa encourages units based in Goa to obtain certification from reputed certifying agencies relating to management systems, quality management systems, environment sustainability, product certification, food safety and social accountability as well as quality of service,” said an official from the department of industry, trade and commerce. The scheme, called the financial incentives for certification and intellectual property rights reimbursement scheme, is part of the state incentives to encourage investments scheme, 2017 (umbrella scheme). A similar scheme was notified in 2003 and 2017, but the department has amended the scheme as per changes introduced by the Centre. The department will reimburse 100% of actual expenditure per certification up to Rs 8 lakh, while a cap of Rs 15 lakh has been fixed for IPR. The department hopes that local industries will obtain national and international certification, which in turn will ensure that Goan firms meet the requisite international standards and enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. The industrial units in all categories who have obtained IPR, and have availed benefit of reimbursement under the ‘building awareness on intellectual property rights (IPR) for micro, small and medium enterprises’ scheme of the Union MSME ministry, are eligible to avail financial incentives under this scheme. However, firms such as startups and IT companies, which have already been reimbursed for IPR under the Goa startup policy or the Goa IT investment policy will not be able to claim benefits from the industries department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/up-to-rs-15-lakh-for-goa-inc-to-pursue-intellectual-rights/articleshow/87443940.cms||---

He clicked the pop-up, unwittingly giving hackers access to his phone. In eight transactions, cybercrooks stole Rs 49,900 from him. A BBA student from Ahmedabad was watching videos on a website when a pop-up laid out the prospect of meeting beautiful girls in his neighbourhood. He clicked and lost Rs 15,000 to scammers. The pop-up traps are ensnaring a growing number of people. So the cops and the state cyber cell, which comes under the CID (crime), have issued an advisory warning people about the risks of careless clicking. Apart from taking your money, cybercrooks may hack into your device and snoop into your personal life. The advisory, issued on Saturday by the state cyber cell, said: “Be cautious [about] phishing pop-up advertisements in apps. Do not download any apps with such pop-ups.” The advisory added: “Your personal content or videos can be made viral on social media.” Police said several apps give free passage to the cybercrooks into people’s devices. The pop-up is a common gateway into your devices. Even if a person inadvertently clicks on such pop-ups or links, cybercrooks can swiftly get access to the person’s device and obtain crucial information, said a cop from the cyber cell. Sometimes, the cop said, the cybercrooks also get access to a phone’s video camera and record personal activities and spy on the target. Thus, the cybercrooks can extort money with the threat of leaking personal information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/click-diwali-pop-up-trigger-fraud-bomb/articleshow/87441481.cms||---

More than 100 people joined the tour which was guided by Deepika Gandhi, director, Le Corbusier Centre. The group explored various buildings and features of the Capital Complex. Gandhi elaborated on the factors which made Capitol Complex worthy of been given World Heritage status and what this meant for the relatively young city of Chandigarh. The enthusiastic group comprising students and senior citizens learnt about the genesis of the Capitol Complex and Corbusier’s philosophy and theories about the making of the administrative head of the city. Each building was taken up in detail, with participants being told about unknown facets about their design and construction along with the symbolism behind the elements of the High Court and Assembly buildings. Citing examples, Gandhi delved into the technical feat of construction of the iconic buildings of the Capitol within the constraints of technology and finances. The participants were afforded a glimpse of the interiors of the Assembly Hall and a view from the terrace of the Secretariat building. The walk ended at the rooftop restaurant of the Secretariat building, the highest point of the city, where refreshments were served. Deepika Gandhi said this was the first Heritage Walk conducted after the Covid lockdown.

President of the chamber, Dr N Jegatheesan, has said that the traders and industrialists engaged in the textiles and clothing business are perturbed and shocked due to the GST council’s proposal to increase the GST base rate on textiles and clothing. He said that at present, 12% GST is levied on garments above Rs1,000 and 5% GST on garments below Rs1,000. If the GST rate is increased, less expensive clothes will also have to be charged 12% GST. In our country, textile readymade garments and knitting units are mostly cotton based industries, and they are producing a large portion of traditional garments such as dhoties and sarees. They are mainly used by people in the ‘middle income’ group and those below the poverty line. If an additional tax burden is imposed on them, it will only lead to consumer negativity. The GST council’s proposal for a tax base rate hike on textiles and clothing will greatly cripple the textile sector as the costs of raw materials such as yarn, fuel, packaging products and transport continue to rise day by day and they have already been struggling hard to bring their business back on track, which was badly hit by the Covid-19 lockdown. MSME units engaged in the textile sector are slightly recovering by availing additional loans under the emergency credit assistance scheme of banks. The 7% tax increase will adversely affect the textile industry, especially the MSME units. Nearly 11 million workers are employed in knitting, including readymade garments units in our country. Of these, eight million are in the domestic sector and three million in the export sector. A considerable number of workers are also engaged in embroidery and packing units indirectly. There has already been a 15-20% price increase in the final price of production in the textile sector. While consumers have already been reeling under job losses, wage cuts and rising prices of essential commodities, the 7% tax hike on clothing and apparel will lead to a sharp decline in the consumption and their livelihood will be severely affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/drop-proposed-tax-rate-hike-on-textiles-chamber/articleshow/87442891.cms||---

---||Madurai||Farmers protest release of Mullaperiyar water||Madurai: The Tamil Nadu government should not compromise on its rights on the Mullaperiyar dam at any cost as it would affect the livelihood of farmers of the five southern districts, said farmers at an emergency meeting in Madurai on Sunday. They said it should call for the dismissal of the two Kerala ministers who “acted unconstitutionally and opened the shutters of the dam”. Members of the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Association have decided to stage a protest in the Lower camp at Gudalur against Kerala’s action on November 12. Federation honorary zonal president Adhimoolam and state president P R Pandian said farmers in Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga depended on Mullaperiyar and Vaigai dams for irrigation but they have not been able to cultivate even a single crop properly for years. The letter to chief minister M K Stalin from his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan seems to have a vested interest. The monitoring committee appointed by the apex court was periodically inspecting the dam and ascertaining its stability. The southwest monsoon has ceased in Kerala and the water level in the Idukki dam was only at 444 feet against its maximum level of 555 feet. They said the false propaganda being made by actors, politicians and advocates in Kerala has caused fear among farmers, they said. Vijayan’s statement that Mullaperiyar dam was strong and action would be taken against those spreading false propaganda is comforting though their stand to construct a new dam at any cost arouses suspicion. Chief minister Stalin should communicate strongly to Kerala that the water level should be maintained at 142 feet.. The dam’s shutters were opened on October 29 when the water level reached 137 feet by Kerala irrigation minister Roshy Augustine and revenue minister K Rajan. Tamil Nadu government should seek the President’s intervention against the Kerala government’s efforts to take control of the dam. The leaders said the cooperation of traders in Theni would be sought for the protest. The major demands of the farmers included withdrawal of permission given by the Union government to Kerala for DIPR for a new dam, three-phase electric supply for the dam, restoration of boat service for PWD engineers and adequate protection for them to stay at the dam site and carry out their duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farmers-protest-release-of-mullaperiyar-water/articleshow/87442894.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Flight-ban lift a boon for businessmen, patients||KOLKATA: The lifting of partial restrictions on flights from Mumbai and Chennai to Kolkata, both high-density routes, will not only make life easier for businessmen and corporate executives travelling between the cities, but also help Kolkatans travelling abroad and Bangladeshis travelling to Chennai via Kolkata for healthcare. For the past 13 months, travel between the two cities and Kolkata had been restricted to three days a week — Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On Saturday, the state home department issued a notification withdrawing the curbs and allowing flights originating from these two cities to fly directly to Kolkata every day. The restriction on flights now remains for three cities — Pune, Nagpur and Ahmedabad. With potentially 52 additional flights between Mumbai and Kolkata — once airlines are able to redeploy the fleet and rejig their schedules — the hassle of flying to Kolkata from Mumbai for business travellers will be greatly eased. Till now, businessmen had to schedule their meetings in such a way that they arrived in either Kolkata or Mumbai early on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday and then took the late evening flight back. Or else, they either risked getting stuck for one, and at times two, additional days before being able to catch a direct flight back. The other option was to take a one-stop flight via some other city. The airlines also resorted to multiple ways to survive the challenge — from clubbing passengers of multiple flights on the same sector together to operating flights to Kolkata via a detour through other nearby sectors and even picking up passengers on the way for a functional revenue generation. “The lifting of curbs on the Mumbai-Kolkata flights will ensure that company executives don’t have to rush through the day in Mumbai to take a direct return flight the same day. Now, they can afford to stay over and take a flight the next morning,” said Travel Agents' Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. For corporate and leisure travellers from Kolkata who are looking forward to foreign travel, restoration of normal connectivity with Mumbai is a boon as it opens up a lot of international destinations. “Till now, scheduling arrivals via Mumbai had been complicated with the need for RT-PCR tests on arrival and furnishing the report to then fly to Kolkata. With fully vaccinated travellers no longer required to undergo RT-PCR test, it eases a lot of complications,” said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. On a similar removal of restrictions on flights between Chennai and Kolkata, travel agents said it will benefit Bangladeshis reaching Kolkata and then flying on the domestic sector to Chennai for treatment. Airlines can potentially add 48 additi-onal flights a week on the Chennai-Kolkata sector on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. “Medical tourism will get a fillip. When the severe restrictions were imposed and international flights were cancelled, there were plane-loads of Bangladeshis stuck in Chennai who had to then be evacuated on special flights,” Punjabi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flight-ban-lift-a-boon-for-bizmen-patients/articleshow/87441511.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Sukhbir participated in a massive road show from Siswan-T point to the Marble Market in Mullanpur with party candidate from this constituency, Ranjit Singh Gill and Prof Prem Singh Chandumajra. A large number of people came to support the SAD. Earlier, he interacted with people in Kharar. Sukhbir said it was surprising that despite being so close to the capital city of Chandigarh, the town did not have access to modern facilities. He said the SAD-BSP alliance government would develop Kharar in an integrated manner as per a master plan. In Nayagaon, he announced that the area would be developed on the pattern of the New Chandigarh project, by making it part of the new township once the SAD-BSP alliance government took over the reins. During a programme, “Coffee with youth,” Badal interacted with youth. He addressed their queries and outlined his vision of a new Punjab. The SAD president also held detailed discussions with traders, realtors, doctors, advocates and some sarpanches and panchayat members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-promises-devp-in-nayagaon-kharar-during-rally/articleshow/87441496.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

A preparatory meeting was held on Saturday in Madurai by school education department officials in the presence of S Nagaraja Murugan, additional state project director of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, and district chief educational officer (CEO) R Swaminathan. During the meeting, apart from officials being instructed on following Covid-19 safety measures, like ensuring availability of masks, hand sanitisers, space in classrooms for maintaining social distance and clean campus, they were also instructed to focus on psychological well-being of students. “Rather than forcing students to come to school, efforts must be taken to make students look forward to coming to school. Activities like reading, story-telling, drawing etc., can be encouraged,” said Nagaraja Murugan. Meanwhile, schools are anxious about attendance on the first day. “We are not sure how far students will be ready to come to school especially as Diwali is nearing and there have been rains too,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. On the other hand, many private schools have decided to reopen for classes I to VIII next week. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-expect-low-attendance-this-week/articleshow/87442917.cms||---

He said that both leaders, in their own ways, have focused on removing human suffering as well as poverty. They are also very passionate about climate change, a topic that needs great bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation, he said welcoming the meeting of the two leaders. Pillai said he is happy that he took the initiative in January to arrange the first-time meeting of the three cardinals of India with Modi on January 19, 2021, and one of the demands raised at that time, is going to be fulfilled now. The governor said that with the meeting of Modi and Pope Francis, India will surely march ahead on the path of development. Fr Gregory Noronha speaking at a function in Dasya at Porvorim, said he is happy that a new beginning has taken place with Modi visiting Pope Francis and two communities in India can live in harmony and peace.

---||Mumbai||October dip leaves Maharashtra with 90 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses, cloud over December target||MUMBAI: Even as the state sits on more than 90 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses, the October slump in vaccination has put a question mark on its plan to cover its entire eligible population with at least one shot by December. Immunisation against Covid-19 dropped by 31% in October compared to September due to festivities primarily and the diminishing fear of Covid itself. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday expressed concern over the slow pace of vaccination and said he will take up the issue during an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week. Thackeray, speaking during an informal meet with journalists, said that vaccine hesitancy was an issue and urged people to shed their inhibitions and get vaccinated. A cursory calculation shows that 100% single dose coverage could be achieved in the next two months (barring Sundays) if 4.66 lakh people come out to get vaccinated daily. The target can be reached much sooner if the daily average increases to 7.5 lakh doses, which was seen in September and has been Maharashtra’s best. Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary (health), confirmed that the state had more than 90 lakh doses and there was no shortage of supply. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the districts were certain that the first dose immunisation would not drag till next year. “We are positive that the daily numbers would see a rise post-Diwali,” he said. Maharashtra has an adult population of 9.14 crore, of which 73% has got a single shot. “That leaves over 2.46 crore to get their first jabs. That number can be covered easily if 4 lakh-5 lakh people come out and get vaccinated daily,” Desai said, adding that the state can handle triple that load. Maharashtra has claimed to have a capacity of administering 15lakh doses in a day, a landmark that was reached just once on September 8. In October, even the 10 lakh mark was not crossed even once. The highest single day coverage was a little over 8 lakh, achieved thrice. The daily average hovered around 5 lakh, down from 7.5 lakh in September. Overall, after a record 2.2 crore doses given in September, only 1.56 crore doses were given in October. “We have the stocks and capacity. Only people have to turn up,” the immunisation officer said. On Friday, the state received another 30 lakh doses, which pushed available stock to over 90 lakh. “The slackening of pace has been noted across India,” Desai said. Mumbai, the district that has vaccinated the most, is inches away from touching 100% single-dose coverage. “We have enough stocks, but turnout is very weak,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. The corporation had hoped to touch 100% by October but has fallen short by 2%. Of the city’s estimated population of 92 lakh, 91.15 lakh have got the first dose, according to CoWin. Kakani said that the second-dose coverage of the entire population could spill over till the end of January. In Mumbai, over 4 lakh have not taken their second shots despite being due for it. The state has fully vaccinated only a third of its population (3 crore), which means the immunisation programme would drag on to several months next year. More than 70 lakh people who are due for their second dose haven’t come forward to take the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oct-dip-leaves-state-with-90l-doses-cloud-over-dec-target/articleshow/87442932.cms||---
---||Business||Stanford in south Chennai||Inovate, imitate and replicate. That is the mantra the country’s largest and most successful startup incubator follows. The incubation cell at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) is modelled on the Stanford University’s system and aims at getting its best tech brains to handhold startups. Over the last ten years, the cell has incubated more than 240 startups, with the total valuation of these startups conservatively valued at more than Rs 11,400 crore.  . It has created more than 4,000 jobs, helped companies file more than 205 patents, and generated consolidated revenue of more than Rs 440 crore in FY 2020-21. And, it now wants to replicate this success in smaller towns and colleges and become a force multiplier in the startup ecosystem. "We are not happy with this, just as yet. We must do more and build more," says professor Ashok Jhunjunwala, president and moving force of the cell. "It took 10 years to incubate 240 companies. We have now readied a plan to reach tier-2 and tier-3 towns and partner with existing incubation cells in these places and reach 1,000 incubators by 2030 and incubate 1,000 companies a year," he says. "We must help the state’s universities replicate the IIT-M incubation model,’’ says Jhunjhunwala. The students often have ample entrepreneurial talent and just need a structured process to take them through the journey, he adds. The pandemic has drastically altered the tech sector’s fortunes and youth interest in building something on their own is at an all-time high, says Jhunjhunwala, adding that the IIT-M incubation cell should be able to partner with more than 50 colleges in tier-2/3 towns in the next 10 years. MoUs have been signed to partner with Crescent College in Chengalpet, MAM College of Engineering in Trichy, KSR College in Erode, and Sona College of Technology in Salem. The IIT-M incubation cell will provide holistic support to strengthen the incubation ecosystem and help amplify the reach of the startups to investors, industry and market. "Affordable technologies and promoting entrepreneurship at scale are going to be critical for the India growth story…the massive digitization of all things after the pandemic is creating huge inequality in our society and if we are not careful, we are going to leave people behind," says Jhunjhunwala. "Easy money kills," and the current funding boom is creating "an illusion of an easy life for young entrepreneurs," he warns. The IIT-M model takes cognizance of today’s volatile startup ecosystem and recognizes that entrepreneurship is not for all. While the programme, in the first stage, creates buzz and excitement around starting and running your own venture, the next stage is a typical ‘reality check’ that seeks to take the teams through the grind of running a business. From insisting on a monthly board meeting for its startups to creating a pool of reputable mentors for them to tap to diligent tracking of performance every quarter, the startups go through as much scrutiny as a public company. Though sector agnostic, the incubator has a specific focus on nurturing deep technology and knowledge-based ventures and on helping entrepreneurs building IP-driven businesses survive in a competitive market. IIT-M offers space and infrastructure, access to business support services, mentoring, training programmes to enhance the skills of entrepreneurs and seed funding in return for equity stakes ranging from 1% to 5%. The incubation cell’s board of directors include IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthi, and ex-Infosys veterans T V Mohandas Pai among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stanford-in-south-chennai/articleshow/87439328.cms||---

However, no death was reported, said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur. During October, Mohali has witnessed 29 deaths and two in September. According to the data provided by the health department, the dengue cases have already jumped six times in 10 months of 2021 as compared to 471 in 2020 and 354 in 2019. In October, 2,287 cases have been reported. The civil surgeon said in order to check anti-dengue activities, the deputy director-health and family welfare department Dr. Raju Dhir has visited all the high risk areas of Mohali district during his week-long tour. Health minister O P Soni had deputed Dhir as the special observer for Mohali with regard to dengue prevention. Dhir said during his tours he has covered Derabassi, Zirakpur, Lalru, Banur, Mohali, Kharar, Kurali and Boothgarh. He said that as per the instructions of Punjab government dengue patients are being treated free of cost in government health institutions and medicines are also being provided to them from the hospital pharmacy. Pointing out that the district health department has been fully active from day one for the prevention of dengue and working effectively to combat this deadly disease, Raju asserted that the situation is under control in Mohali and survey, fogging and awareness work is being carried out vigorously in the areas where cases are coming up. During the visit, Dhir also inquired about the condition of patients admitted in hospitals. He appealed to the people not to let water stagnate anywhere in and around their homes as this precaution would be effective in preventing dengue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-sees-100-new-dengue-cases/articleshow/87441524.cms||---

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), which is implementing most of the city Metro corridor projects, has proposed to state government for shifting Bidhan Market, commonly known as Maidan Market, and some of the tent clubs and emptying Manohar Das Tarag to facilitate the tunnelling and construction of the Esplanade station for the Joka-Esplanade Metro corridor. RVNL formally placed the proposal before the state government at a meeting convened by chief secretary H K Dwivedi on Friday. Officials from state transport department, PWD, KMC, Army, Kolkata Police and Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the East-West Metro corridor, were present at the meeting. RVNL hopes that they will be allowed to build a new Bidhan Market above the under-construction East-West Metro station on R R Avenue across the existing market. “Construction of the new market, within 50m of the existing one, can start immediately,” said a senior RVNL official. The agency has also asked that the water in Manohar Das Tarag be drained out for the first time since it was dug up in the early 19th century by Varanasi-based businessman Manohar Das Shah. It will be refilled in two years’ time while clubs like Police Athlete Club, Kennel Club, Rajasthan Club and Kidderpore Sports Club will be dismantled and rebuilt by RVNL. The chief secretary has called for a joint inspection of all the stakeholders. Transport secretary Rajesh Sinha will coordinate and help them reach a consensus on the site for the new Bidhan Market. An alternate spot is along the corridor connecting the Joka-Esplanade station with the East-West Metro station and the existing north-south station underground below R R Avenue. “For that we shall need a temporary location for the shops,” said a state official. “Shifting the 500-odd stall holders (450 permanent and the rest temporary) is a challenge because of the location of the market opposite the Oberoi Grand on Chowringhee Road,” said a state official. The market, inaugurated in 1972 by former chief minister SS Ray, was originally meant for the rehabilitation of the hawkers evicted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-work-bidhan-mkt-some-maidan-clubs-to-be-shifted/articleshow/87442942.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Ahmedabad||Trapping buyers with festive ‘loot’||Ahmedabad: Ahead of the Diwali festival, people keep trying to find out good discount while shopping online but this may trap them in the net of cybercrooks. Cyber experts and cops say that the cybercrooks have been offering “Diwali loot sale” or selling something in just Re 1 on popular online marketplaces to trap gullible people. In various cases, the amount is so small that people don’t even approach police to file complaints. A cop working with the city cybercrime police said, “We have been witnessing cases where heavy discounts are offered on websites. When the person approaches the number given in the advertisement, the crook seeks advance payment for swift delivery of articles and goes incommunicado after receiving the payment.” These crooks become more active during festivals when there is rush for shopping for clothes, utensils, jewellery and furniture. “Some sellers put the price at one rupee to lure people. When someone approaches them, they often say that they mistakenly set a wrong price and then tell a different price,” said a cop of state cyber cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trapping-buyers-with-festive-loot/articleshow/87441552.cms||---

The break in the rain also gave hope to vendors that they will salvage good sales before Diwali. “With all the fancy stores and big showrooms coming up, sales were already less for us compared to how it was some years ago. But, even then we had customers who prefer to buy from us. Since Covid-19 destroyed even that last year, we are praying that at least this year, Diwali brings good fortune,” said S Muthurajan, who sells readymade clothes for children. The vendors said that cost has also been a deterrent for many shoppers in buying from them. “Cost has gone up by around Rs 10-20 depending on the size and type of clothing. This year, with the rain last week, our sales were dampened. Only on Sunday, we started having some good sales,” said P Parimala Devi, a clothes and inner garments vendor from Alanganallur. Many like T Muthumari, a 62-year-old who sells bedspreads, pillow covers and mats, have been coming to Vilakkuthoon for decades. “Every year it is disappointing to see sales going down. Some customers bargain with us even though everyone is suffering financially. We have no choice but to give in,” she added. Another street vendor who sold clothes and accessories, S Mani, said that nowadays customers are also hesitating to buy in bulk. Vendors said that on the day before Diwali, they will allow more discounts and are hoping for a big crowd then. Things have changed for shoppers too. “When I came to these streets as a child, my parents used to splurge but splurging then meant Rs 100. Now, that is the bare minimum price for any item. Even then, I’m happy to shop from street vendors and some of the discounts are attractive,” said K Rajee, who came with her children to shop on South Masi Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/at-last-diwali-sales-pick-up-for-madurai-street-vendors/articleshow/87442934.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

At a mahapanchayat held on Dadri’s Mihir Bhoj PG College ground on Sunday, the leaders claimed that the sentiments of the Gurjars were “hurt” over the plaque row and they would not celebrate Diwali this year. Over 200 people from the community attended the mahapanchayat convened under the banner of Gurjar Swabhiman Sangharsh Samiti. Ravindra Bhati, the national vice president of Akhil Bhartiya Gurjar Parishad, told TOI, “We want UP CM to apologise to the Gurjar community, otherwise we will boycott BJP in the upcoming assembly elections. We also want the state government to rename the Noida Airport in Noida after King Mihir Bhoj. The central government should also add or name an army regiment.” Meanwhile, a heavy force was deployed at the college ground to maintain the law and order situation in view of the mahapanchayat, Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer of Dadri police station, said, adding that the department had allowed 200 people to assemble for the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/call-to-name-noida-airport-after-mihir-bhoj/articleshow/87443964.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Focus on masks as local trains run on holiday schedule; pre-Covid weekday operations from today||KOLKATA: Eastern Railway (ER), which carries the bulk of suburban passengers in its Howrah and Sealdah divisions, with lakhs depending on these services for daily commute, restarted local train services on Sunday. Much to the commuters’ surprise, the ticket examiners didn’t seem too interested in knowing if they had their tickets — their objective was checking if masks were on. In an aggressive mask-up drive, around 250 “WM” (without mask) commuters were fined Rs 200 each. They paid Rs 50 less than “WT” (without ticket) ones, but the solemnity of the measure didn’t seem any less. As soon as the trains pulled in at Howrah or Sealdah stations, dozens of TTEs stationed at the gates checked passengers’ faces. The ticket inspectors said they had strict instructions not to let off a single “WM” commuter. There were heated arguments, too, with those who refused to pay up. ER spokesperson Ekalabya Chakraborty said, “We can’t run smooth services in the pandemic unless the passengers cooperate and help us abide by the rules.” But then, Sunday’s operation was a dress rehearsal. The acid test of crowd control will begin on Monday. Green signalled by the state to run local trains for the general public with 50% occupancy after a 178-day Covid-induced hiatus, ER ran 984 trains — 350 EMUs in the Howrah division and 634 from Sealdah — on Day One. “We followed a holiday schedule today. From tomorrow, it will be like it was before the onset of Covid in March 2020, with the usual weekday timetable in place,” Chakraborty said. Before the pandemic, ER ran 920 services in Sealdah division and more than 488 in Howrah division in both Up and Down directions. South Eastern Railway (SER) operated 190 EMUs. On Sunday, SER ran 49 local trains and is aiming for its pre-pandemic fleet in the next fortnight. “Local trains have been running all this time as ‘specials’ for essential staff. Now everybody will troop in and choke the compartments. Who will implement the 50% seating diktat?” asked Abhijit Das, a daily commuter on the Sonarpur-Ballygunge route. Chakraborty said, “We are continuously announcing over the public address system so that people know to travel only when necessary. We need the commuters to meet us half way to fight the contagion.” According to ER officials, 124 passengers can usually board a local train compartment. For 50% occupancy, not more than 62 should ride and only 750 must be accommodated on a 12-coach train. But from 8am to 11am, the average number of passengers on a single train in different sections of Sealdah division is nearly 3,000 or around 250 passengers a coach. That is double the number of passengers allowed according to the state diktat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-masks-as-local-trains-run-on-holiday-schedule-pre-covid-weekday-ops-from-today/articleshow/87441559.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bars, eateries may shut by 10.45pm from today||KOLKATA: Restaurants across Kolkata are likely to shut down at 10.45pm from Monday to allow patrons and employees leave before night restrictions commence from 11pm. Many are making arrangements for employees to stay back for the night and will provide ID cards and a letter of authorization to those who have to travel back after work. TimesViewRecent numbers suggest that the virus is still there though it may have been weakened by vaccines and people's exposure to the virus. All the sectors that are going to operate with increased timings must keep Covid protocols in mind.Last week, the state allowed restaurants and bars to remain open till 11pm from November 1. The timing, however, coincided with the beginning of night restrictions. So far, restaurants had to shut down by 10.30pm. The Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) will issue a letter on Monday to members asking them to stick to a 10.45pm closure. “There is no clarity yet on whether restaurant employees and patrons will be allowed to travel during the night restrictions. We will seek clarification on this from the government if it doesn’t come through in a few days. Meanwhile, we are going to ask all our member restaurants to close by 10.45pm and let employees stay back in case they have to travel far,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. Some, like Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2, have set a 10.15pm cut-off for last orders. “We expect patrons to leave by 10.45pm, which will allow them sufficient time to be on some transport to reach home. All will not be able to reach home by 11pm though, so we hope the night restriction hours will be pushed back,” said owner Shiladitya Chaudhury. At Chili’s, which has outlets across several malls, last orders will be taken by 10.15pm as well. “We will make sure that our patrons finish their meal by 10.45pm. It may not be enough for all, unless they arrange their own transportation and live close enough. It would have been better if the night restrictions started from 11.30pm,” said owner Hrishi Bajoria. He said last orders will be taken even earlier at Royal China, a fine-dining restaurant that he owns. “Patrons must come in by 8.45pm and last orders have to be taken by 10pm. Else, we will not be able to wind up in time,” Bajoria said. Park Street restaurants, too, have decided to stick to the 10.45pm deadline. “Our patrons have now got into the habit of winding up by 10.15pm. So, we will have an additional half-an-hour,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis. Poddar, who owns Songhai, Manthan and MS Bar & Lounge, has allowed 29 employees to stay back at one of his restaurants. “The rest will carry our ID cards and we will urge others to do the same so that a section of employees can return home even while the restrictions are in place,” Poddar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-eateries-may-shut-by-10-45pm-from-today/articleshow/87441596.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Nagpur||MOIL approves Rs218 crore wage hike||Nagpur: Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL), the mini-ratna PSU based in Nagpur, has approved a pay hike and a bonus of Rs28,000 each for its 5,800 employees on Sunday. The wage revision, which was pending since 2017, will lead to a financial outflow of Rs218 crore for the company, with per annum impact being Rs87 crore. The wage revision will be valid from August 2017 to July 31, 2027 MOIL has seen a fall in profits over the years. It stood at Rs176 crore in the last financial year. In the current fiscal, the company has earned net profit of Rs61 crore for the quarter ending in June. It is a major progress since last year. Profits for the same quarter last year stood at Rs1.88 crore, which is being attributed to the Covid impact. The financials for the subsequent quarter this fiscal are being finalized. The company’s profit before tax has fallen from Rs700 crore to Rs400 crore in the last three or four fiscals. A provision has already been made for the wage increase in the books of account, said a press release issued by MOIL. The wage hike was announced in a rather dramatic fashion. A function to dedicate a vertical shaft at one of its mines was held on Sunday. Union leader Ramavtar Devangan raised the issue while addressing Union steel minister Ram Chandra Prasad Singh and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. He said the wage revision was long pending, and said the matter had been taken up before Gadkari too. As Singh came up to address the meet, he quickly announced the wage hike and bonus. Gadkari said if he put in a word for the hike, now it is also up to the workers to meet their commitments. The production needs to be increased, he said. Gadkari too expressed concern over falling profits while speaking about the need to hike production. MOIL CMD Mukund Chaudhary said the company could achieve profits to the tune of Rs700 crore due to higher price realization. There have been times when rate of manganese has been at Rs10,000 a tonne, and it has also fallen to Rs5,900 at some stage. The profits will depend on the rates. MOIL has to maintain the rates in line with the international market as imports are also available. MOIL’s operations have been limited to Nagpur, Bhandara and Balaghat districts. It has recently tied up with Gujarat Mining Development Corporation (GMDC) to exploit manganese deposits in the state. Similar tie-ups are planned in other areas too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/moil-approves-rs218-crore-wage-hike/articleshow/87441577.cms||Shishir Arya

Tweeting, Owaisi said, “Centre can allow the birth and death register to be used for voter enrolment. This violates Article 324 of the Constitution that gives independence to ECI. It also violates the Constitution as the NPR rules are unconstitutional and data should not be collected under it.” He said: “82.3% of children under the age of five in the richest group has birth certificates, only 40.7% in the poorest group.

Majority of those living in the housing complexes, high rises and stand-alone buildings agree that the restrictions imposed by the administration was a timely alert against spike in cases. Three-day market closure at Rajpur-Sonarpur and enforcement of mask compliance has brought about a positive change as more people have swung back to Covid-appropriate lifestyle. Even residents, who rushed back to markets to stock up perishables, were careful and orderly. “If the restrictions were not imposed, we would not know that the number of Covid cases were rising. If we are a bit more careful and follow the protocols, we can avoid having such stringent restrictions in our areas in near future,” said Apurba Ghosh, a retired government employee, who stays close to the municipality office. Significantly, more than 75 markets in 35 wards of Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality were closed for three days following a sudden spike of cases in Baruipur subdivision. More than 24 micro containment zones were created, majority of which were in this area. In the last three days, the administration enforced cent per cent mask compliance and physical distancing. “Of course, we had trouble in storing perishables and buying necessities. But it was a necessary move as people became too casual about the pandemic and dropped their guards against,”said Dibakar Kar Gupta, a resident of a high-rise in Narendrapur.. “We have received spontaneous support and cooperation from the citizens. The majority has stuck to a Covid-appropriate lifestyle. We sincerely wanted to break the chain of transmission,” said Suman Poddar, Baruipur sub divisional officer. He said people who initially refused to follow the rules have now realised how reckless they were. The micro-containment zones will persist till cases are down to zero. However, the containment zones will change shape and size depending upon the spike or dip in cases. Police were asked to show zero tolerance to people without masks. “There will be static and mobile monitoring committees who will move with policemen in plain clothes to enforce mask compliance. We hope to achieve good results,” said Pallab Das, administrator of Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality. In the Sonarpur and Narendrapur areas, more than 300 people were arrested for flouting Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housing-societies-on-citys-southern-fringes-vow-to-follow-cov-rules-despite-relaxations/articleshow/87441670.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

The yatra underwent a four-month delay because the Uttarakhand high court had refused to allow it until it was satisfied with the government’s preparations. As per current restrictions, only fully vaccinated people, or those carrying a Covid-negative report, are allowed to visit the shrines. Harish Gaur, media in-charge of Devasthanam Board, said, "The maximum pilgrims visited Kedarnath, followed by Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri shrines." Almost 2.22 lakh pilgrims visited the Kedarnath shrine, while 1.26 lakh came to Badrinath. Over 32,000 pilgrims visited Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines, each, according to the Devasthanam Board. Meanwhile, the portals of Tungnath, the world's highest Shiva temple, closed for the winter on Saturday. The Valley of Flowers, a UNESCO world heritage site, shut for tourists from Sunday. "This year, at least 5,500 pilgrims visited the Tungnath temple, situated at a height of 3,470 meters, near Chopta in Rudraprayag," said Gaur. In 2017, nearly 22 lakh devotees had visited the Char Dham shrines. This number went up to 26 lakh in 2018 and hit a high of 32 lakh in 2019. In 2020, due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, only around 3 lakh pilgrims came for the annual pilgrimage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/4l-pilgrims-at-char-dham-shrines-in-over-a-month/articleshow/87439753.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||PWD may not meet March deadline for Kazhakootam elevated highway||Thiruvananthapuram: Last week, after visiting the elevated highway construction site at Kazhakootam, PWD minister Mohammed Riyas had informed that the works will be completed by March next year. But, sources close to the project say that the path leading to this deadline is not so smooth. A lack of clarity in another project - the construction of three underpasses beneath the elevated highway - is what can pose as a major impediment to meeting this deadline. When the minister met the officials concerned and the stakeholders involved in the work last Sunday, a major topic of discussion was the construction of these underpasses. The government had already green signalled two of the three underpasses, at Attinkuzhy and Mukkolakkal, and has requested the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials here to submit a proposal for a third one in front of Technopark phase III. But, according to sources, there is confusion about who will bear the cost of this construction. The PWD authorities suggested that since this underpass was being constructed at the request of Technopark authorities, it would be better if they could bear the expenses. But, since the project would cost over Rs 10 crore, the Technopark authorities maintained that it was difficult to find such a huge fund. The NHAI officials have also taken the same stance. A source close to the project said that if the underpasses have to be realised, the works will have to be carried out simultaneously with the construction of the elevated highway. It would be impossible to construct the underpasses at a later stage if the elevated highway works are finished first, the source said, adding that a consensus with regard to bearing expenses of the project is yet to be reached. The government too is yet to take a decision in this regard. Meanwhile, the NHAI officials have submitted a revised proposal before the government, with a project estimate of Rs 35 crore, including the third underpass at Technopark phase III. It is learned to be pending under consideration of the PWD. The proposed LVUPs would be constructed at Attinkuzhy, Technopark Phase III and Mukkola along the NH bypass stretch. All three spots would come under the south end ramp of the elevated highway. Each underpass would be 5.5 meters tall. A year ago, the state government had suggested NHAI officials consider the possibility of underpasses connecting service roads on either side of the elevated highway. This request was made considering the concerns raised by Technopark management and employees who worried that they would have to cover too much distance while coming to and going from the Technopark campuses here on the east side of the highway. Techies who alight at Kazhakootam railway station on the west side of the highway would be the most affected. The elevated highway is a key infrastructure project that is expected to solve the traffic woes in the IT corridor. The four lane elevated highway is 2.7 km long starting from CSI Mission Hospital in the north and ending near Technopark Phase III junction in the south. According to RDS Constructions, the company that is carrying out the construction, more than 65% of the works have been completed so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pwd-may-not-meet-march-deadline-for-kazhakootam-elevated-highway/articleshow/87407730.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Show capability of Pak drones captured on border with Punjab: Khaira||Jalandhar: Bholath former MLA and Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Sunday urged the Punjab government to hold a demonstration of drones reportedly recovered by Punjab Police from near border to check their lifting capacity, range of flight and noise, while questioning how these were able to fly from across the border despite tight deployment of BSF. He urged the Punjab government to ask the Centre in writing if it lodged complaints with Pakistan over intruding drones. “When there is strict vigil, how are the drones able to cross? If these are indeed intruding, it means BSF is incompetent and failing to check trans-border intrusion,” he said in a video statement issued on Sunday. He said drones had limitations in terms of height they could attain with control from ground and the distance they could travel. “There is little possibility of these smuggling drones being controlled through satellites. The Punjab government should hold a demonstration of these drones before the media about their lifting capacity, their flying and control range, how they are being controlled, and how far their noise goes, so things are clear,” Khaira argued. He said there were elements preparing reports at the behest of Delhi, so interference of the central government could be increased in Punjab through BSF. “It is a conspiracy to take away rights of the Punjab government in significant parts,” said Khaira. He described seizures as propaganda to defame Punjab and Sikhs and to take indirect control of a significant part of Punjab. “Unfortunately, Capt Amarinder Singh has been pushing this narrative. They (Punjab Police) had seized drones, but had never shown their capacity: of how high they can fly, their travelling limit etc,” he said. He added Punjab was peaceful, even as there was frustration over unemployment. “When peace is already being maintained, people should not fall prey to false propaganda,” Khaira said, adding: “agencies should also stop their anti-Punjab propaganda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/show-capability-of-pak-drones-captured-on-border-with-punjab-khaira/articleshow/87443101.cms||---
---||Nashik||Recovery of power dues from cane payment protested||Kolhapur: Farmers’ leader Raju Shetti warned the sugar mills against deducting power supply dues from sugar cane payments. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has instructed the sugar commisionerate to ask the mills to deduct the power supply dues from the sugar cane payment to be made to the farmers. The decision has left the farmers fuming. The farmers from the sugarcane belt have bills worth hundreds of crores for the power consumed for irrigation due from the past two years. The farmers have not paid the dues despite the concessions offered by the MSEDCL. Till now, the loan dues were deducted from the sugar cane payment. Shetti claims the loan amount deductions were done only after the written consent of the farmers. “Under which law has the sugar commisionerate asked the mills to deduct the power supply dues from sugar cane payment? It is illegal unless the farmers give consent. Moreover, we are raising the issue of faulty power bills issued to the farmers. The meter readers, without checking the meters, have fixed the bill amount. We are demanding that the MSEDCL correct the bill amount. If the mills deduct the amount unilaterally, then the government will face the heat.” The MSEDCL has not just asked the mills to deduct the amount, they are also wooed by a promise of 10% reward of the amount they deduct from the sugar cane payment. The MSEDCL could not recover the dues on its own mainly due to the anger amongst the farmers over the faulty power bills. The farmers, under Shetti’s leadership, had held agitations. The bill receipts were burnt in public. At several places, the MSEDCL employees were manhandled by the farmers, which put the brakes on the recovery process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/recovery-of-power-dues-from-cane-payment-protested/articleshow/87438353.cms||---

A note purportedly signed by the three — Mohini Kamwani (87), her son Dilip (67) and her physically challenged daughter Kanta (63) — states that they were ending their lives over “injustice”. Earlier, Mohini had told the media that her husband, Naraindas Kamwani, had participated in the Quit India movement with Gandhiji. Senior inspector of Vashi police station, Ramesh Chavan, said that Dilip had called up the police control room around 7.30 am on Saturday. “He said that he, his mother and sister had consumed poison due to financial problems, and were experiencing discomfort.” Chavan said that a few police personnel rushed to their home and took them to NMMC Hospital, Vashi. While the daughter died about an hour later, the widow and her son died the same evening. The police officer claimed that Dilip, in his police statement given at the hospital, said that they had consumed a chemical, rat poison, and some pills “as they were depressed due to a financial crisis”. Chavan said they found bottles of a pest-killer chemical and rat poison at their flat. “The four-page suicide note states that the Supreme Court, high court, Central government and police are responsible” for spurring them to take the drastic step as they “did not render them justice in their legal battle”, said Chavan. The note also mentions a loan of Rs 3 lakh besides a deal to sell their flat. A high court advocate, Vinod Gangwal who had earlier represented the Kamwanis in a legal fight against police harassment said: “In 2014, I got FIRs registered through a court against four senior officers of Navi Mumbai police over the illegal arrest of Mohini and Dilip. “It’s shocking that they ended their lives as they were tough fighters. I have demanded an independent inquiry.” He said Mohini and her son were arrested in 2012 for threatening to commit suicide if an FIR was not filed against certain relatives. “The Kamwanis had monetary and trespass issues with some relatives, but the police were not registering a case,” said Gangwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-freedom-fighters-widow-2-children-end-lives-over-financial-issues-and-injustice/articleshow/87443104.cms||George Mendonca

---||Shimla||Manali-Leh road to close from November 2||MANALI: The civilian vehicles will no longer be able to ply on the 428km-long Manali-Leh highway for the next few months as it will officially close from November 2 due to high risk of road mishaps. The highway is now expected to open in April or May next year. Vehicles are struggling to move on the slippery highway these days. Also, there is a prediction of more snowfall from November 2. So, taking precautionary measures, the Lahaul-Spiti administration on Sunday decided not to allow any vehicle to go towards Sarchu and Leh. The Gramphu-Kaza highway will also be closed for all vehicles officially from November 2. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said both the highways will remain closed till next summer season. “Civilian vehicles will not be allowed to go beyond Darcha on the Manali-Leh highway. It’s too dangerous for civilians to drive on this road under extreme cold conditions which have triggered icing of the road surface. Keeping in view the risk of getting stranded in snowfall, possibility of avalanches and skidding on icy roads which may result in human loss, the vehicular movement will be stopped now,” he said. The DC said Gramphu-Losar stretch of the Keylong-Kaza highway will also be closed for traffic movement from November 2 so that any mishap could be averted. “Police will ensure strict compliance of the order. People entering Lahaul valley via Atal tunnel should follow the advisory issued by district administration from time to time. Avalanches and slippery roads make things worse. Those who don’t have experience of driving on snow should take extra precaution.” The Manali-Leh highway shall remain open for Army convoys for a few more days until heavy snowfall makes it impossible for Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to clear snow from the road. Many stretches of the road, especially on high passes including Baralacha pass, are still covered with a thin layer of snow even after BRO had removed snow from here and are unsafe for driving. These steep stretches are very difficult for vehicles to negotiate even after using snow chains on the tyres. The military convoys have four-wheel-drive trucks with anti-skid snow chains and required back-up. Civilian vehicles, including trucks, cars and SUVs, face trouble getting traction on slippery roads. And there are many tourists who insist on driving on this dangerous road without any experience. The Lahaul valley will remain open for civilian vehicles up to Darcha. The snowfall, however, may interrupt movement beyond Atal tunnel. The Manali-Leh highway has been blocked with snow since October 17 and was opened only for four-wheel-drive vehicles on October 28. As there were a large number of other vehicles stranded in Lahaul and Leh, the highway was opened for one-way traffic on Saturday. Lahaul-Spiti SP Manav Verma said, “The Manali-Leh highway was opened for one-way traffic from Darcha on Sunday. All 76 stranded vehicles have been sent to Leh. These include 59 heavy vehicles and 17 light vehicles. The vehicles had 136 passengers. People are requested to keep an eye on the weather forecast and adhere to safe winter driving habits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/manali-leh-road-to-close-from-nov-2/articleshow/87443130.cms||Suresh Sharma

A recent book by Guido van Meersbergen, an assistant professor of history at University of Warwick, ‘Ethnography and Encounter: The Dutch and English in Seventeenth-Century South Asia’ gives a peek into the mechanisms used by the European powers on Indian shores including Gujarat. The book primarily focuses on British East India Company (EIC) (1600-1857) and Dutch Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) (1602–1799). ‘The dynamics of accommodation and conflict that came to characterise the Dutch and English presence in the Mughal Empire first took shape in the early decades following their arrival in Gujarat in north-western India. The extensive corpus of EIC and VOC writing produced in sites such as Cambay (Khambhat), Ahmedabad, Bharuch, and above all Surat provides details of harmonious ‘reciprocal visits’ and ‘mutual embracing’ between Company representatives and local elites,’ mentions the book. However, all was not well, as the fight for supremacy had ensued between European forces. The book mentions that political disputes in Surat and other sites followed attempts by the companies to assert their maritime power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/everything-was-fair-in-trade-war-claims-book/articleshow/87441731.cms||---

Seeking leniency in sentencing, the accused, Rohit Singh, said that he wanted a chance to reform. However, the court said, “The apex court in number of cases has emphasised upon the courts that they must be sensitive while dealing with such offences, and the accused persons involved in such crimes can be said to be involved in weighing a financial war against the country virtually. Therefore the court cannot lose sight of said fact while interpreting the legal provision. Therefore, imposing sentence upon the accused for the period which he has already undergone in prison would amount to show him undue sympathy,” the court said. Singh has been in jail since October 2018. The maximum sentence for the offence is life imprisonment.  The court in its order said that Singh was apprised about the punishment that was imposed upon two other accused when they pleaded guilty. Singh continued to insist that he wanted to plead guilty. “It is found that the accused is pleading guilty voluntarily. Therefore, I have no hesitation to accept the plea of accused,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-youth-gets-7-yrs-ri-for-counterfeit-rs-2000-notes/articleshow/87443126.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Gauri Lankesh murder case: Special court frames charges against 17||BENGALURU: Close on the heels of the Supreme Court’s clearance for framing of charges against Mohan Nayak N, accused in the journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh murder case, under provisions of the Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act, 2000, a special court on Saturday framed charges against 17 accused. The accused are Amol Kale, Amit Baddi, Parashuram Wagmore, Ganesh Miskin, Amit Degwekar, Bharat Kurane, Rajesh D Bangera, Sudhanva Gondalekar, Mohan Nayak N, Suresh H L, Sharad B Kalaskar, Vasudev B Suryavanshi, Sujith Kumar, Manohar Yedave, Srikanth J Pangarkar, K T Naveen Kumar and Rushikesh Devadekar. The accused were charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 114 (abettor being present at the time of committing of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit heinous offence), 109 (abetment to committing offence), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 203 (false information about offence committed), 204 (destruction of evidence), 35 (criminal act by several persons); various Arms Act sections for possession and use of prohibited arms and ammunition, and Section 3 of KCOCA Act, 2000 pertaining to organised crime. Special judge Anil Bheemanna Katti read out charges via a video conference to the accused, who are in Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, Bengaluru; Arthur Road Jail, Mumbai, and Yerawada Prison, Pune, in Kannada and Marathi, languages known to the accused as per the requirement under CrPC. The accused pleaded not guilty and sought court permission to meet their advocates in jail before fixing of the date of trial. The court said they can move the necessary applications. The court posted the matter to December 8 for fixing the date of trial. To ensure a smooth trial, a direction was issued to jail authorities in Bengaluru not to shift/ transfer any of the accused housed there without specific court permission. On September 22, 2021, the special court had directed shifting of those accused housed in prisons at Tumakuru, Ballari, Mysuru and Shivamogga to the Central Prison, Bengaluru for framing of charges. Gauri Lankesh was shot dead by two bike-borne men on September 5, 2017, outside her house in Rajarajeshwarinagar, Bengaluru. The SIT identified 18 accused and managed to arrest 17, including mastermind Amol Kale, shooter Parashuram Wagmore and Ganesh Miskin, who rode the motorbike. Accused number 15, Vikas Patel alias Nihal, is absconding. The special judge read out charges via video conference to the accused, who are in Central Prison, Bengaluru; Arthur Road Jail, Mumbai, and Yerawada Prison, Pune, in Kannada and Marathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gauri-case-special-court-frames-charges-against-17/articleshow/87446483.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||SFJ holds ‘referendum’ on Punjab in London||London: Groups of British Sikhs travelled to London on Sunday to cast their vote in a so called ‘referendum’ on whether Punjab should seceded from India. The ‘referendum’ was organised by US-based Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) which is banned in India. The SFJ said that exercise began in London and would be held in other UK cities – in gurudwaras and community halls, before heading to Europe and then the US and Canada. Dozens of coaches were organised to bring Sikhs to the capital from different parts of the UK. Anyone aged 18 or above of Sikh Indian ethnicity was eligible to vote, SFJ declared. The voting took place inside the Queen Elizabeth II centre in Westminster. Several of those standing in queues held yellow and blue ‘Khalistan’ flags and chanted ‘Khalistan Zindabad’. Those participating had to register online and their ID was checked inside a private booth. The question on the ballot paper was: “Should Indian governed Punjab be an independent country?” All through its campaign, SFJ has skirted any mention of part of Punjab that went to Pakistan. Even a “map” of the proposed ‘Khalistan’ that it released failed to include Punjab in Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sfj-holds-referendum-on-punjab-in-london/articleshow/87443150.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Train mishaps halve in state, but Maha is still first on list||Mumbai: Maharashtra recorded the highest number of accidents and fatalities on railways in 2020, for the second straight year, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). But the silver lining of the pandemic-induced lockdown was that rail accidents decreased by half in the state — from 6,338 in 2019 to 2,697 in 2020. A majority of accidents on railways were caused during track crossing or from falling off a running train. Road crashes also reduced by 21% in the lockdown year from 57,228 in 2019 to 45,484. Maharashtra did better than five other states, including Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, recording lower road crashes. But the state’s performance slipped where it came to road fatalities, ranking second in the country with 12,018 deaths. Mumbai Railway Police commissioner Quaiser Khalid says crossing tracks is not always out of habit. “Many of those who lose their lives from being knocked down by trains are working professionals for whom reaching their workplace on time is a necessity. The nearest foot over-bridge or subway could be several metres away which prompts them to take a short-cut across the tracks. Railways must analyse where demand is the highest and construct new passenger infrastructure at that point,” he said. Central Railways chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said they have ongoing programmes to construct boundary walls alongside tracks, more lifts, escalators and FOBs at stations and in between stations. Joint surveys have been undertaken to identify spots where compound walls are broken by commuters to resume track crossing. But activists say that once a broken wall is mended, surveys shouldn't halt. To gather evidence scientifically about locations where train hits are reported more often, the police have started using software that captures coordinates. They have petitioned the railways to affix cameras on the external side of the motorman’s cabin so that the time and cause of an accident are accurately captured. “We have also suggested to the railways that an insurance cover be offered to every commuter who purchases a season ticket so that his dependents can claim compensation in the unfortunate event of a fatality,” Khalid added. Among road crashes, the NCRB report showed that more fatalities were reported in rural areas of Maharashtra (8,121) than in urban areas (3,897) last year. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said crashes occurred typically at the entry and exit points of villages. “Crashes in Maharashtra were witnessed more in tier-two and tier-three cities and their peripheries where there was an expansion of roads, but no adherence to safe speeds. There has been a spurt in the sale of cars and bikes across the state, but the road network is not designed for safe movement. We need to map all fatalities on GIS and find areas with concentration of crashes which need road safety audits and design interventions,” said Amit Bhatt from the non-profit WRI India. A majority of offenders as well as victims of road crashes last year were motorcyclists, according to the NCRB report. Dhakne said there was a need to create a robust emergency care system and emphasis on use of helmets to reduce fatalities. The report also showed maximum road crashes were reported during 6 pm to 9 pm. “When public transport came to a halt in the lockdown, people used more private transport. These vehicles were involved more in crashes, speeding being the leading cause,” said addl DG (state traffic) Bhushan Upadhyaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-train-mishaps-halve-in-state-but-maha-is-still-first-on-list/articleshow/87443152.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hubballi||Onion growers, consumers in tears as middlemen make merry||Dharwad: The onion growers in Dharwad district who were expecting some good income this year after suffering losses for the previous two years are in for disappointment again. The rise in onion prices had raised the hopes of the farmers but their hopes have been dashed with middlemen and traders playing foul. The consumer is shelling out Rs 50-60 per kg of onion in the market while the middlemen and traders are paying farmers Rs 10-20 per kg. The traders cite low quality of the onion as the reason for the low price they are offering farmers. The onion growers in Dharwad district have been suffering losses for one or the other reason. While it was low yield last year, this time it is low price. Onion is one of the major agricultural produce in the district. According to officials, onion is cultivated in 21000 hectares in the district and the expected yield was 3.5 lakh tonnes this year. Navalgund, Annigeri and parts of Dharwad taluk which have black soil are the areas where onion is prominently grown. Due to heavy rains, onion had rotten in some areas and in some other places the farmers had voluntarily removed the onion crop after heavy rains in a bid to use the land for some other crop. Following the crash in the price of onion paid to farmers, the growers in some areas are reluctant to bring the produce to the market as it involves transport cost. They are expecting the government to bail them out by allowing the purchase of onion under minimum support price scheme. “The middlemen and traders are fleecing farmers. They are threatening farmers that they would not even be able to sell the produce if onion from Pune and other places arrives. The only solution to our problem in government’s market intervention,” said Shrishailgouda Kamatar, a farmer leader. Responding to the plea, district minister Shankar Patil Munenakopp said the government will come to the rescue of onion growers and a decision of setting up purchase centres will be taken soon at a meeting of officials and farmer leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/onion-growers-consumers-in-tears-as-middlemen-make-merry/articleshow/87439843.cms||---

Seventy-five per cent of the money recovered as fine from the two convicted, Fariyad and Imtiaz Ahmad, will be given to the victim’s family as compensation. The murder was reported in 2017 in Bukhara village, under the jurisdiction of the Cantt police station. Six people were booked in this case, but the chargesheet was only filed against Faritad and Imtiaz. Additional district government counsel Santosh Srivastava told TOI, “The victim was sleeping when the accused barged into his house and poured kerosene on him and set him ablaze. He was grievously injured and died during treatment. His dying declaration played an important role in the judgment. The victim’s mother had lodged a rape complaint against Fariyad, and he was arrested and sent to jail. But after getting bail, he took this step to take revenge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-get-life-imprisonment-for-setting-ablaze-man/articleshow/87438391.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The office of the President issued a verbal communication conveying its acceptance of the invitation of the PEC administration. The campus is now abuzz with preparations for the President’s visit, during which he will inagugurate three projects. The President, who will be accompanied by governors of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal as well as chief ministers of the three states, will visit PEC for about an hour. However, the PEC administration has not finalised a programme yet. UT advisor and PEC alumnus Dharampal will give final clearance for the programme by Monday. Apart from officials of the UT administration, invitations will also be sent to vice-chancellors and directors of several universities in the Northern region and other major institutes, including Panjab University. Only around 400 selected guests will participate in the PEC centennial year event. PEC alumni who received their degrees in 1943 will be honoured on the occasion. A special hall will be prepared for the event at the PEC football ground. The President will inaugurate the semi-conductor research lab, the community center and the “Century Gate”. He is also likely to lay the foundation stone of a boys hostel. Director, PEC, Chandigarh Prof Baldev Setia said, “The schedule will be finalised in the next few days in consultation with officials of the UT administration.” Box 2: PEC down the years PEC was established in 1921 at Mughalpura, Lahore, Punjab as Mughalpura Technical College. In 1923, the name was changed to Maclagan Engineering College in honour of Sir Edward Maclagan, then governor of Punjab, who laid the foundation stone of the building. After partition in 1947, the college was relocated to Roorkee in India and was renamed East Punjab College of Engineering. In 1950, the word East was dropped. Towards the end of December 1953, the college shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh as an affiliated campus of Panjab University. In 1966, with the formation of the Union Territory of Chandigarh, the college came under the control of Government of India through the Chandigarh administration. In October 2003, Government of India recognised the college as a deemed university, after which it became known as Punjab Engineering College (deemed university).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/president-to-be-part-centennial-celebrations-at-pec-on-nov-16/articleshow/87441756.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Haryana bans crackers in 14 NCR districts with ‘immediate effect’||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Sunday imposed a ban “with immediate effect” on firecrackers in its 14 districts that come under the National Capital Region (NCR). In other towns and cities where the air quality is moderate or below, it allowed the bursting of green crackers for only two hours from 8pm on Diwali. “There will be a total ban against the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in all the 14 NCR districts, namely Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mahendergarh, Nuh, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat,” the order by state disaster management authority read. The directive comes almost a month after the state pollution control board banned firecrackers in the 14 NCR districts of Haryana. Officials in the pollution board said they would soon issue on its website a list of towns and cities where green crackers could be allowed not only on Diwali, but Chhath and Christmas too. The Sunday directive also listed the timings for bursting green crackers for the upcoming festivals. “The cities/town/areas in which air quality is moderate or below, the timings for use and bursting of crackers, on Diwali days or any other festivals like Gurupurab, etc will strictly be from 8pm till 10pm only. For Chatth, the same will be from 6am to 8am. On Christmas and New Year Eve, when such fireworks start around midnight, i.e. from 12am, it will be from 11.55pm till 12.30am only,” it said. Sources said the pollution control board would carry out a short-term monitoring of the air quality in various cities for the past 14 days and look for parameters such as aluminum, barium and iron content. It will then create a database, which will help it issue the list of cities and towns where green crackers could be allowed.  “To reduce episodic increase of air pollution effectively and substantially in NCR, it is felt appropriate to reiterate the measures, for strict compliance by the governments of NCR States, for the control and regulation of sale, use and bursting of firecrackers in NCR and adjoining areas,” the order said. According to the officials, the government would promote community bursting of crackers in areas where they are allowed. The local authorities would have to identify spots and inform the local residents about them. Explaining the need for such a ban, officials said whenever firecrackers are burst in large numbers, pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter like PM10 are released in the air. “There is a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers for winter in the NCR districts of Haryana,” said S. Narayana, the pollution secretary. Last year too, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the use of firecrackers in Delhi and adjoining areas from November 9 to 30. But given the deteriorating air quality, the ban was extended up to Christmas and New Year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-bans-crackers-in-14-ncr-districts-with-immediate-effect/articleshow/87443141.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Delhi||Delhi: More beds cleared for dengue fight||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has directed hospitals that a third of their beds reserved for Covid-19 patients can now be used for patients suffering from dengue, malaria and Chikungunya. The government had recently reduced the number of beds reserved for Covid patients in private hospitals from 30% to 10%, apart from some big hospitals of its own. “The number of Covid patients in Delhi has remained very less. In view of this, the Delhi government has decided that a third of the reserved beds for Covid patients will now be used for dengue, malaria and chikungunya,” health minister Satyendar Jain said. He said these beds would be completely separated from those of the Covid patients and the staff there would also be separate so that there was no possibility of transmission of infection. The Delhi government had taken this decision so that the number of beds in the hospital for treating dengue patients were sufficient, he said. The health department has issued instructions to the medical directors and medical superintendents of hospitals run by the Delhi government to use one-third of the beds reserved for Covid patients, if necessary, for the treatment of people suffering from dengue, malaria and chikungunya, including ICU beds. Jain said that Delhiites didn’t need to be afraid of dengue, but could fight and defeat it. He said that the state government’s '10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute' campaign had been effective in preventing dengue and people should actively participate in it so that mosquitoes didn’t breed. He requested all Delhiites to support the government and follow all the guidelines. Jain said that to fight dengue, the Delhi government was working ahead on every front, including spreading awareness, preventing the spread of dengue and increasing the number of beds in hospitals. On October 21, Jain had said that during the peak of Covid, 30,000 beds were arranged in Delhi and thanks to this infrastructure, there was no shortage of beds in the hospitals of Delhi. Apart from reducing the number of beds reserved for Covid patients in private hospitals, the Delhi government had reduced Covid beds in its own hospitals like LNJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-beds-cleared-for-dengue-fight/articleshow/87441768.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The farm fire count rose to 1,734 in the northwest region, but the contribution of stubble burning was around 8% due to a change in wind direction. The air quality is likely to remain in the lower end of ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category in the next two days. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to officials, the impact of stubble burning to Delhi’s air has been reduced as the wind direction is not favourable for transportation of pollutants of farm fires to the capital. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was 20% on Friday and 12% on Saturday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is likely to be in upper end of ‘poor’ category for the next two days due to an expected change in wind direction to westerly/southwesterly, reducing transport of emissions from stubble burning. Isolated rainfall is likely in upwind region that would improve air quality. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is about 8% (effective fire count 1,734). Prevailing shallow mixing layer height reduces dispersion of pollutants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wind-direction-brings-farm-fire-share-down-to-8/articleshow/87443155.cms||---

The organic bazar at Kowdiar is organising the fest in collaboration with the Thanal trust. The mela includes more than 120 varieties of rice. The main attraction of the mela is the traditional Indian varieties. This is the fifth mela conducted by the organic bazar and Thanal. This fest is being organised to create awareness about the desi rice varieties and make the present generation aware about the history of rice. India had a history of producing more than one lakh of rice varieties. There were about 3,000 varieties in Kerala, but now only around 200 varieties are available, according to the organisers. Other varieties got extinct as the farmers stopped cultivation. Kattiyanamn, a rice variety, has a history that dates back to 400 BC. This rice variety is used for temple offerings in Thanjavur. A few people from Gujarat and Delhi also enquired about the courier services. The rice varieties were collected predominantly from different parts of the country, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Two non-desi varieties have also been included as the demand for those varieties are really high, which are Jyothi and Uma. “I heard a few people saying that their children only wish to eat noodles, I would say that it is because they did not get an opportunity to taste desi rice varieties. Nowadays, we can see a trend in people asking for traditional rice varieties. We are also planning for an exhibition in Ernakulam too which will display more than 300 varieties of rice,” said Jayakumar C, the executive director of thanal trust and director.  The festival will conclude on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-festival-to-celebrate-rice-heritage-of-india/articleshow/87407789.cms||---

The photograph was of two kids — aged 9 and 11 — seated on the pavement, completely immersed in studies and oblivious to the shuffling feet, grime and cacophony on the road. Their mother — a widow — runs a paan shop on the pavement. Impressed by their eagerness to learn, people stepped forward to help. A family has taken the mother and two children — Sonia and Azmira Khatun — in to provide them a decent shelter. Another helped them with new clothes and a third got them admitted to a boarding school. “I still feel elated at the fact that all this started from a stupid picture which I had casually clicked during one of my random street photography sessions. I thank the good Samaritans who have come forward to help these children and transform a family’s destiny,” said Mudar Patherya, a social worker, who had shot and shared the photograph. Patherya had clicked the photograph in August 2021, while walking down Bentinck Street in central Kolkata when he spotted the children studying on the pavement. While editing the photo later, he noticed the hunched posture of one of the children that touched him. Patherya, with the help of one of his colleagues tracked down the kids and provided them with school stationery and also shared the photos with some of his acquaintances and on Instagram. Garments retailer Karan Goenka got them new clothes from his factory, while Zahra Patel, a class XII student, mentored the children by inviting the two girls (along with the mother and brother) to her home and got them prepared for better schooling. Social entrepreneur Vinayak Lohani came forward to admit them to his residential boarding school — Parivaar in Thakurpukur which has more than 1,500 students — for free. “Sonia studied till Class III at a local school before the pandemic. The younger sister, Azmira has recently come from Bihar and never had a formal education. She is a victim of child abuse but shows great knack in studies. Since they have trouble understanding Bengali and English, they will be provided a bridge year at school before they are allotted classes,” said Zahra Patel, who will be appearing for her Class XII boards examination. “These people were a godsend and now my little girls are off the footpath and headed for a better life. I don’t have words to thank them,” said kid’s mother Rubina Begum||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/casual-photograph-clicked-by-social-worker-transforms-lives-of-two-street-children/articleshow/87441769.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Hubballi||Research papers reinforce presence of Kannada words in Brahui||Hubballi: Research conducted recently at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation in Pakistan has reaffirmed the linguistic affinity Kannada shares with the tongues spoken by the people in that ancient period. The book ‘Brahui Language: Past, Present and Future’ published by the Brahui Academy in Pakistan has identified Kannada words such as ‘kallu (khal in Brahui)’ that remain in currency in far-off Balochistan. A research paper has shed light on many words in Dravidian languages that were used during the heyday of the Indus Valley Civilisation.Sikander Brohi, who edited the book in 2018, pointed out that Brahui was the language spoken by the majority of the populace of the peoples of Balochistan even in 1911, but was declared ‘threatened’ by Unesco in 2014. “Brahui Academy in Pakistan conducted an international conference in 2014, and many scholars from across the globe, including from India, presented papers at the event. Indian scholars travelled to Pakistan despite struggling to get funds to travel, and the hurdles that lay in the way of getting a visa to the country given the tensions prevailing between the two nations. We have compiled all those papers, and published a book on Brahui language, which reinforces the linguistic ties between Brahui and South Indian languages, including Kannada,” Brohi told TOI.In his paper published in the book, Brohi writes, “Brahui belongs to the Northwestern group of Dravidian languages, and apparently closely related to languages categorised under the Northeastern group. The latter includes Malto, Kurukh among others. Brahui is more distantly related to the Gondwana group of languages, which includes Kui, Krvi, Monda, Penga, Konda and Gondi, and even more distantly related to the central group of languages, among which are counted Pargi, Gadaba, Kolami and Naiki. Languages spoken in the Southwestern region of India – Telugu, for instance – and those classified under the Southern group, which includes Kuruba, Kannada, Kodava, Kota, Tamil and Malayalam, are all distantly related to Brahui.”Brohi has cited extensively from Ferdinand Bork’s German-Brahui dictionary, which contains the meaning of Brahui words in, besides German, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. This book highlights the similarity between words for the eye (‘kannu’ in Kannada is ‘khan’ in Brahui), leg (‘kaalu’ in Kannada; kaal in Brahui) and mouth (‘baayi’ in Kannada, for which the Brahui equivalent is ‘baa’).In another paper titled ‘Ancestral Dravidian Languages in Indus Civilisation: Ultra Conserved Dravidian Tooth-Word Reveals Deep Linguistic Ancestry and Supports Genetics’ by Bahata Ansumali Mukhopadhyay, an independent researcher and published in the Nature Group journal under the ‘Humanities and Social Communication’ category. In this paper, it has been posited that Dravidian languages, including Kannada, although spoken predominantly in South India, these had scattered representation in Northwestern, Northeastern and Central parts of the Indian Sub-Continent.Delhi-based Kannada scholar Purushottama Bilimale said that both the papers supported the hypothesis that speakers of the Dravidian languages were once spread across Northwest India. “Thus, a form of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-North Dravidian would have been spoken extensively in North India, before the advent of the Aryans.

The bank’s chairman is BJP leader Pravin Darekar, who is opposition leader in the state legislative council. Justice Girish Kulkarni’s verdict came on the bank’s petition against the September 22 order of the divisional joint registrar (DJR), cooperative societies (Mumbai division) directing an inquiry under Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, into 10 irregularities. The inquiry is based on an August 10 test audit report from 2015-20. The irregularities include expenditures on repairs and renovation of immovable property/property on rental basis, unrecovered corporate loans, gold mortgage loans and loans to cooperative housing societies on bogus documents. The bank assailed the DJR’s September 1 letter giving it 15 days to submit a rectification report on deficiencies mentioned in the report. It sought time till December 31. Defending the DJR’s order, senior advocate S U Kamdar, for the state, informed that the inquiry has commenced. Senior advocate Vineet Naik, for the bank, argued that 15 days to submit a rectification report was contrary to Section 82 which provides 3 months to rectify defects. He also said it was “premature” to order inquiry under section 83, especially without giving an opportunity to rectify defects under section 82. Justice Kulkarni disagreed saying both sections are independent. He explained that section 82 casts an obligation on the bank to remove the defects and also confers power on the registrar to direct the bank and its officers to remedy the defects within specified time. He noted that consequences of non-compliance of the registrar’s order are “quite serious” and offences are liable to be tried by a magistrate. The judge also said section 83 confers “substantive powers” on the registrar to order inquiry on the basis of such a special report. Justice Kulkarni said the bank had 3 months time till November 10 to comply with the August 10 test audit report. Also, no fault can be found with DJR ordering an inquiry when substantial material was available based on the test report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-nixes-plea-against-probe-into-bank-led-by-bjps-darekar/articleshow/87443163.cms||---

A few days ago, we submitted a detailed reply to the 10 queries raised by the divisional joint registrar,” said Darekar. D S Kadam, managing director of the bank, said queries have been raised with regard to purchase of banking software without inviting tenders. “We have explained that the software is a monopoly and so we could not have invited tenders. Then queries have been raised about sanctioning advance loan to which we have given our explanation,” he said. The single judge bench of Justice Girish S Kulkarni noted that the department notice was not violative of the law and the petitioner’s plea for an opportunity to rectify defects before the inquiry is initiated could not be accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-am-being-harassed-weve-got-clean-chit-in-the-past-too/articleshow/87443170.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Solar power can help Jharkhand save Rs 12,000 crore in 15 years: Experts||RANCHI: The state agriculture department expressed its eagerness to shift the energy load of agricultural activities to renewable resources, particularly solar energy, after an expert committee projected an estimated savings of Rs 12,465 crore to the state exchequer in the next 15 years, if done so. The state government gives huge amounts of subsidy to farmers on power bills for their consumption in agricultural activities. As per the roadmap on energy transition in agriculture sector, prepared by the Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) in consultation with the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) and Centre for Excellence in Green Energy & Efficient Technology, Central University of Jharkhand, switching to renewable resources would bring down the cost of power substantially and result in savings for the state, which it otherwise gives as subsidy. It would also help the farmers in augmenting their income. Unveiling the report here on Friday, state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh advocated for converting grid power to solar power in a phased manner for its use in the agriculture sector. “This is an important document as it chalks out a strategic path for increasing agro-productivity and promoting enterprising activities through sustainable means. The government is committed to uplift the financial condition of the farmers. We look forward to the key recommendations of the report and will try to incorporate them in our programs,” he said. While the roadmap elaborates a slew of measures which can initially reduce the cost of power and save subsidy, it goes on to suggest the development of solarised cold stores and warehouses which can further prove to be sites of entrepreneurship and activity favouring installation of rooftop grid connected solar plants. Highlighting the key aspects of the study conducted for preparing the roadmap, CEED’s Ashwini Ashok said agriculture’s contribution to the state’s GDP is as low as 13% and the sector consumes merely 3% of the power from conventional sources. “There is a huge scope to incorporate power usage and augment its share to the state GDP. The government will be able to save around Rs 12,465 crore while adding a solar capacity of 4250MW. Solarisation can be instrumental in avoiding CO2 emissions of more than 36.4 million tonnes in the next 15 years” he added. The CEO of CEED, Rampati Kumar, said, “The state must initiate a sustainable solar mission. Solarisation of 2,34,000 grid connected pumps and installation of 4,05,447 standalone off-grid solar pumps can generate around 700MW of power. For augmenting the logistics infrastructure in the rural regions, installation of 8343 micro cold storages can create a cumulative storage capacity of 3.64 lakh metric tonne from 2021-22 to 2037-38.” He added, “The report also states that development of 81,000 warehouses facilities in villages can lead to a solar rooftop potential of 160 MWp in the state.” JREDA director K K Verma said solarisation is an exciting opportunity which can be materialised through separate agriculture solar feeders, solar irrigation pumps, solar rooftop-based cold storage infrastructure and various rural enterprising activities catalysed through decentralised renewable energy-based solutions. “JREDA will take the lead in facilitating the technical know-how, capacity-building and training support to the farmers and rural entrepreneurs to bring noticeable change in farming practices,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/solar-power-can-help-state-save-rs-12k-cr-in-15-years-experts/articleshow/87440913.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

But her statements on social media have dampened the image of the party. It is an irresponsible act and an act of indiscipline on her part,” a senior party leader on Sunday said preferring anonymity. Sita, the widow of Shibu’s deceased elder son Durga Soren, had last week posted a series of tweets on her verified account and alleged that JMM has been held at ransom by a group of touts and dishonest people and had urged Shibu’s intervention. Her tweets came hours after JMM expelled 12 of its office-bearers - all of whom are loyalists of Sita - in Chatra district for six years after finding them involved in anti-party activities (raising slogans against state youth affairs minister Hafizul Hassan on September 23). Vinod Kumar Pandey, JMM general secretary and party’s spokesperson, however, backed the decision to expel 12 members from its Chatra unit. “The decision was taken at the directives of the party president based on the complaints of minister Hafizul Hassan, a report submitted by the Chatra district’s JMM president, Kumar Prajapati, and reports and audio-visual clippings which were published and aired in newspapers and electronic media. The party’s stand, as mandated by our president, is very clear on acts of indiscipline, irrespective of the person and his or her post within the party.” When asked whether Sita will be asked to explain her stand, Pandey said: “It is for the party president and the working president to decide.” Sita did not respond to TOI’s calls when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-silent-on-sita-but-backs-decision-to-expel-her-loyalists/articleshow/87441918.cms||Dhritiman Ray

When chief minister Hemant Soren had inaugurated the machine a few weeks ago, he had said the machine will prove to be a boon for early detection of Covid-19 and help prevent a spurt in Covid cases in Dumka and the adjoining districts of Santhal-Pargana. As a result, the hospital is forced to send Covid samples for an RT-PCR test to Patliputra Medical College and Hospital, Dhanbad and Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi. “We have sent 5,000 and 8,000 samples to PMCH and Rims, respectively, the results of which are awaited,” Dr Singh said. After Rims, this was the second Cobas machine to be installed in Jharkhand. The government had incurred cost of Rs 8.73 crore for procuring those machines for Dumka and Ranchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cobas-machine-in-dumka-develops-snags-covid-results-hit/articleshow/87442006.cms||---

When TOI contacted a few leading sweet shops in the city they said that no one has visited them after September 20 this year and said that they too were surprised when they didn’t had any inspection team come over this year during the festive season. “By this time, when Diwali is just four days away, I was expecting at least two visits by district administration team for sample collection of sweets from my shop but no one has turned yup yet and that was a bit surprising for me,” said the owner of a sweet shop in Kutchery chowk. Upon contact, the state food laboratory confirmed that they have been only receiving surveillance samples and no legal samples have been collected this year. The head of state food laboratory, Dr Chaturbhuj Meena, said: “We do not get any legal samples for testing and all the legal samples are sent to national food testing laboratory in Kolkata.” On being asked whether they are receiving samples from Ranchi for testing, Dr Meena said that the number of samples have gone down as there is a manpower crisis. “We have a manpower crunch and as per my information, the food safety officer from Ranchi has left his job. So it has affected sample collection.” Sources in the Ranchi t administration confirmed that the food safety cell had collected around 15 samples in the month of September but after the food safety officer left his job, nobody has collected samples since then. The SDO is the nodal officer for collection and testing of samples for adulteration and since the food safety officer of Ranchi left his job, no one has gone for sample collection. Ranchi SDO Deepak Kumar Dubey didn’t answer multiple calls from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admin-fails-to-put-sweet-shops-to-test/articleshow/87440820.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Hemant Soren government is similar to Lalu Raj during Bihar days: BJP chief||Sindri: State BJP president Deepak Prakash on Sunday likened the Hemant Soren-led government to RJD president Lalu Prasad’s regime in Bihar prior to 2000 and alleged that the only industry flourishing in Jharkhand is ‘transfer-posting’ and government officials are being transferred at the whims and fancies of the CM. Addressing a press conference at Dhanbad circuit house, Prakash alleged that the state government has utterly failed on all fronts of governance and the government officials are being made to collect “slush money” and pay to the masters sitting in the echelons of power or face transfer, a practice rampant in Bihar earlier. According to him, nearly 7,500 transfer-postings have been made in Jharkhand in the last 22 months. Lalu ruled the undivided state of Bihar till 2000 when Jharkhand was formed. Prakash said that the law and order situation in the state has worsened as instances of rape, human trafficking and organized crime have increased manifold. He added that JMM leaders are patronizing the illegal trade of coal and other minerals. “In a state where judges can be killed and business class are being subjected to extortion, how can new industries come to the state,” Prakash said. He claimed that the government has not been able to provide basic amenities like electricity, water and even proper roads to the people. “The government has totally lost control of the state’s administrative machinery,” he said. According to him, the central government schemes are not being implemented properly in Jharkhand. “The state government did not utilise the funds allocated under the Centre’s ‘Nal Se Jal’ scheme and only 12% work of the Jharia water supply system has been completed so far, although it is supposed to be completed by 2022,” he added. He further said, “Our party will contest the municipal as well as panchayat elections with full might and the government is yet to notify if those elections will be held on a party basis because it is scared that if held on party lines, the BJP will win.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-soren-government-is-similar-to-lalu-raj-during-bihar-days-bjp-chief/articleshow/87441950.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||In a first, Birsa jail rolls out sales outlet on wheels||Ranchi: Here’s a little way to shine a little light. Candles made by inmates of Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Central Prison can light up your homes this Diwali as the jail authority for the first time has rolled out a mobile vehicle outlet on pilot basis for door-to-door sale of different kinds of articles made by the prisoners. Since last two days, the vehicle was rolled at Albert Ekka chowk and has started doing brisk business, said the officials, adding that gradually they will expand the business to different localities, namely Morhabadi, HEC area, ATI, Kanke Road among other high-footfall pockets. Talking to TOI on Sunday, jail superintendent Hamid Akthar said they decided to begin the sale-on-wheels drive keeping Diwali in mind. “For Diwali, our inmates have prepared candles which are priced between Rs 10 and Rs 50 per piece. Other moderate gifting items include registers, diaries, copies among others,” he said. Utility items like towels, blankets, bedsheets exclusively made of cotton are also among the items on sale. “Their prices vary from Rs 40 to over Rs 600. For example, a basic small-sized towel is priced at Rs 40 while the maximum price of a bedsheet is Rs 650,” he said, adding that in coming days, they will focus on product diversity. Akthar said since mulakati (meeting of inmates with visitors) is stopped due to Covid-19, the existing sale counter drew poor sales since the outbreak of the pandemic. “Hence, we decided to utilise the lone prisoner van which was lying unused since 2007 as a sales outlet on wheels as a pilot project,” he said. Jail authorities are upbeat with the initial response. “On Saturday, we did business of over Rs 9,000. This will increase as we add more products. All are made by inmates. Hence, the revenue will end up as an additional income for them,” said Akthar. The jail has also begun organic farming on about 3 acres of land inside the prison campus with the help of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU). “The produces too will soon be floated in open markets as in the long run we plan to package all our products under one brand name,” he said. The jail currently has 3,700 inmates, much higher than its accommodating capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-a-first-birsa-jail-rolls-out-sales-outlet-on-wheels/articleshow/87440767.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Man given third Covid vaccine in Palamu instead of anti-rabies shot||DALTONGANJ: In a first in Jharkhand, a 51-year-old man identified as Raju Singh was administered the Covid-19 vaccine for the third time on Saturday by mistake at a health centre where he had gone to get the anti-rabies injection for a dog bite. The incident happened in Palamu district and the civil surgeon on Sunday ordered an investigation into the incident. Singh is a tractor driver and resident of Naudeeha village under Paton block, said Dr Ameet Azad, the medical officer in charge of the community health centre at Paton. He conceded that Singh had already received both doses of the Covid vaccine but was given the third dose in place of an anti-rabies vaccine. Singh has now received three doses of Covishield. Reacting to the incident, district civil surgeon Anil Kumar said, “I have asked the medical officer-in-charge of the community health centre at Paton to probe how and why it had happened.” The civil surgeon also said Singh’s OPD paper clearly said his prime complaint is a dog bite. He, however, wondered why the personal vaccination data of Singh did not show up in the centralised portal. “Had his jab history reflected on the computer, this man would have not have been given the third shot,” he said. Sources said Singh used the phone number of a villager, Mithilesh Singh of Golna village, on Saturday while taking the OPD ticket and he had used another phone number for his previous two Covid jabs due to which his vaccine history did not show up on the portal. Kumar said Singh is fine and has not reported any adverse effects as of now. “I have directed Dr Azad to keep a close tab on Singh in case he develops any problems.” On adverse effects or benefits of the third jab, the district health department is yet to give any comment, saying that it is monitoring the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-given-third-cov-vax-in-palamu-instead-of-anti-rabies-shot/articleshow/87441938.cms||---

In a detailed order, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) said the order to ban firecrackers in NCR districts is part of precautions in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and considering the approaching winter season during which the elderly, children, persons with co-morbidities and others may develop respiratory problems. An official spokesperson said during the approaching festive season of Diwali, Gurpurb and Kartik Purnima, Christmas eve, New Year eve, people usually burst crackers which can adversely affect the respiratory health of vulnerable groups, besides aggravating health condition of Covid-19 patients in home isolation. Accordingly, in compliance with the various directions of NGT and Supreme Court, the State Executive Committee while exercising the powers under Section 24 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 has issued the guidelines for strict implementation in the state, he added. He said there will be a total ban against the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in all the 14 NCR districts — Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mahendergarh, Nuh, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat. The above direction will also apply to all cities/towns in the state where the average ambient air quality during November (as per available data of last year) falls in ‘poor’ and above category, he added. The cities/towns in which air quality is “moderate or below”, only green crackers shall be sold and the cities/ towns/ areas in which air quality is “moderate or below”, the timings for use and bursting of crackers on Diwali days or on any other festivals like Gurpurb will strictly be from 8pm till 10pm only. The timing will be from 6am to 8am on Chatth and 11.55pm till 12.30am on Christmas and New Year eve, he added. He said Haryana State Pollution Control Board will issue the list of the above mentioned cities and towns separately and make the same available online on their website and also publicize the same to inform the public. In the areas where use and bursting of crackers is allowed, community fire cracking shall be promoted. Particular area/fields would be pre-identified and pre-designated by the authorities concerned immediately and the same shall be publicized for information of the public. Even for marriages and other occasions, only green crackers are permitted, he added. He said the sale of crackers shall only be through licensed traders. No e-commerce websites, including Flipkart, Amazon, shall accept any online orders and effect online sales. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board shall carry out short-term monitoring in the cities for 14 days (coming immediately) for the parameters namely, aluminum, barium, iron apart from the regulatory parameters against the short-term ambient air quality criteria values ( AAQCVs) proposed by CPCB with regard to bursting of firecrackers. This will help in generation of data on pollution caused by the bursting of firecrackers and would be helpful for regulation and control of quality of aluminum, barium and iron used in the manufacture of firecrackers, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-bans-firecrackers-in-14-ncr-districts/articleshow/87445778.cms||---

Of the total 12,86,382 registered voters of the constituency, spread across 17 assembly segments, only 7,35,401 voters turned out at polling stations on Saturday, while 5,50,981 voters abstained from the polling process. Compared to the 2019 parliamentary election, 16% less polling was recorded. The total voter turnout in the Mandi constituency was 57.17%, less than the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections. In the 2013 bypoll, the parliamentary constituency had recorded 51.80% voter turnout. Mandi parliamentary seat in 2019 had recorded an overall polling percentage of 73.60%, while in the 2014 elections total polling percentage recorded was 63.12%. This time there were 6,47,620 male voters and 6,38,757 female voters registered in the entire parliamentary constituency, and in the byelection, 3,83,618 male voters and 3,51,780 female voters exercised their electoral franchise on Saturday. Assembly segment-wise breakup of polling shows that Seraj assembly constituency of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur witnessed the highest polling percentage of 69.75%, while Sarkaghat assembly constituency recorded the lowest polling percentage of 46.72%. The other two assembly constituencies, Nachan 63.99% and Balh 60.59% of Mandi district recorded over 60% voter turnout. In the rest of the assembly segments, the polling percentage remained below 60%. The campaign for the byelection on Mandi parliamentary constituency failed to touch specific real issues confronting the people residing in the 17 assembly segments under this parliamentary constituency. While the BJP focussed on targeting the Congress party and its candidate for speaking against the army, especially after Congress candidate Pratibha Singh gave a controversial statement on the Kargil War during her election campaign. Congress too focussed more on the failure of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur-led government in ensuring the development of the state in the last four years. Many felt that real issues confronting the entire parliamentary constituency remained untouched during the poll campaign. While interacting with media persons in Shimla on Sunday, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that issues arise after four years of any government, but no major issue was raised against the state government. He said that the opposition Congress tried to make inflation an issue during the election campaign, but people of the state have ignored the issues being raised by Congress leaders. He said that inflation was very high even during Congress rule, the LPG cylinder was worth Rs 1,360, and onion was sold at Rs 120 per kg while sugar had disappeared from the market. He said it is a bitter truth that the era of inflation has returned, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to bring down inflation and will surely succeed in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-bypoll-parties-worried-over-low-turnout-in-mandi/articleshow/87445780.cms||Anand Bodh

The farmers would observe second consecutive Diwali while protesting in Punjab. These protests have continued at over 100 locations, including toll plazas, business establishments of select corporates, jurisdiction of railway stations and outside residences of BJP leaders. While the protests in Punjab have completed 13 months, the protests at the borders of Delhi will complete a year in the next four weeks on November 26. During these months, the echo of protests had been felt in many countries especially where Indian diaspora is settled. Many lawmakers from various countries and noted personalities have raised voice in support of protesting farmers. On October 1, 2020, the farmers had started the indefinite protests after the presidential assent to farm laws on September 27, 2020. Since then, farmers have never looked back. During these 13 months, while the corporates had to suffer loses in business, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) too has lost nearly Rs 1,200 crore as toll collection. It is Walmart’s Best Price which faced a lot of heartburn as its outlet at Bhucho near Bathinda had to be closed. The company had to approach the high court even to get perishable items removed and had to take back the employees fired after closing of the big outlet. “The counting of months into protest is now only customary as we are ready for a big fight and don’t want to get limited to weeks, months or even years. Our fight will continue till Narendra Modi government agrees to repeal farm laws and enact a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) to every farmer on every commodity. But surely the BJP-led central government is taking our protest as a fight against its own people and not ready to listen to the miseries of aggrieved farmers. Such a government could never be called as a democratic which cares for everyone,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan. “The farmers are being treated indifferently in their own country and it is being projected that the fight, howsoever long it might be, for the demands which are not liked by the government have got no response. It is time to give another political blow to BJP in UP after West Bengal,” said BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/13-months-into-protests-punjab-farmers-vow-to-continue-fight/articleshow/87445792.cms||Neel Kamal

A sense of uncertainty is prevailing among the farmers over the recent developments. Senior leader of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), Rakesh Tikait, speaking to TOI over phone said, “We have the experience of selling the sugarcane at the deputy commissioner office at Muzzafarnagar in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 when it was not being purchased. If the government takes any step to make farmers vacate the borders, then they may occupy the offices to raise their voice from there or even head towards any other direction.” SKM leader from Haryana, Gurnam Singh Charuni said if the government vacated the borders, the farmers will celebrate the Diwali at the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said rumours are doing the rounds that the government is trying to vacate the borders of Delhi and this may be done by Diwali. “But the government must not make this grave mistake. If government tried this, then farmers will head towards Delhi and reach at PM’s residence,” he added. Charuni also issued a video message asking farmers to be ready for action, even in the nights. Punjab-based farmer outfit BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill and Kirti kisan union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said if such situation arises the SKM will take the decision and we are bound to follow that decision but government must think hundred times before taking any such step, as farmers will not sit back and accept it meekly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/tikait-says-may-go-to-occupy-govt-offices/articleshow/87445800.cms||Neel Kamal

Moved by a similar appeal that was made two days ago, many groups of farmers from Punjab have started for the protest sites. They were earlier called to Delhi’s Tikri border to remove the barricades in breach of an agreement with the authorities. The SKM claims there is a shortage of fertilisers, diammonium phosphate (DAP) especially, and they must gather to protest to counter “black-marketing”. The SKM claims to have found that the speciali investigation team (SIT) looking into the crushing of four rarmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, has recorded 75 statements and provided 60 eyewitnesses with security, with another 16 likely to get the cover. The local farmers have received legal aid from seven advocates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-calls-farmers-back-to-delhi-border/articleshow/87445807.cms||---

---||India||Fresh cheating case against Gosavi, aides||PUNE: The Pune police on Saturday lodged a third criminal case against Kiran Gosavi, the NCB’s witness in the cruise drug case, and his two associates after a man (48) lodged a complaint accusing the trio of cheating him and two others of Rs 1.4 lakh over a job promise in Malaysia and threatening them with a pistol when they sought a refund in November 2018. As of now, Gosavi is in the custodial remand of the Faraskhana police till November 5. Police had registered the first case of Rs 3 lakh cheating of a similar nature in 2018. This was after the Pune police claimed to have arrested Gosavi in the early hours of October 28 from a lodge in Katraj, after more than three years of his evading the arrest. Police swung into action after Gosavi’s selfie with Aryan Khan during the cruise drug bust went viral on social media. On the night of October 29, the Cantonment police registered a second case against Gosavi after three men accused him and his woman aide of cheating them of Rs 4 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fresh-cheating-case-against-gosavi-aides/articleshow/87446436.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Chandigarh||Relief for cotton farmers meagre: AAP||Chandigarh: The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has rejected the “meagre” amount of compensation announced by the state government for cotton farmers affected by pink bollworm infestation. The AAP has questioned the state government’s parameters used to assess damage to cotton crop. Party’s kisan wing state president and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the dreadful attack of the pink bollworm in Malwa region had inflicted heavy economic losses on cotton growers and farm labourers. If the government does not change their attitude towards “annadatas”, the cotton belt will not emerge from the economic crisis for many years to come, he added. As a result, the trend of suicides among farmers and farm labourers will increase, for which the state Congress and the BJP-led central government will be directly responsible, said Sandhwan. The AAP leader also raised questions on the parameters for assessing crop damage and asked which thermometer proves that the crop loss is not 33% but 32%. He also asked why does the government not consider the loss less than 26% as a loss? Sandhwan wanted the government to finalise a formula to assess the loss of crops in favour of the farmers and demanded a compensation amount of Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 per acre and relief of Rs 15,000 per labourer to compensate for the loss caused due to pink bollworm infestation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/relief-for-cotton-farmers-meagre-aap/articleshow/87445903.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Review ‘meagre’ relief promised to cotton growers: Sukhbir to CM||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to “review the meagre compensation offered to cotton growers whose entire crop has been destroyed by the recent pink bollworm attack”. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal also condemned the chief minister for failing “to even register a protest against the appointment of 1984 genocide alleged perpetrator Jagdish Tytler to Delhi Congress panel”. Sukhbir said it was shocking that the Congress government had “cheated” farmers and was offering most of them only partial compensation even though their cotton crop had been completely destroyed by pest attack. “Farmers have been demanding compensation at the rate of Rs 50,000 per acre but the Congress government is offering a measly compensation of only Rs 2,000 for up to 35% crop damage and Rs 5,400 for up to 75% crop damage,” he said, adding that the government sources are also trying to limit all farmers in this bracket by stating that there was only partial damage to the cotton crop. This effectively means that even the meagre compensation of Rs 12,000 per acre for 100% crop damage will not be available to farmers, said the Akali leader. He alleged the Congress government had not only back-stabbed cotton farmers but also the farm labourers whose livelihood had been affected by the destruction of the cotton crop. “The government has played fraud on the farm labourers by offering them 10% of the total compensation award,” said Sukhbir, demanding a flat compensation of Rs 15,000 per acre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/review-meagre-relief-promised-to-cotton-growers-sukhbir-to-cm/articleshow/87445916.cms||---
---||India||Recipients, employers have footed Rs 5,000 crore of vaccine bill||While free vaccination is available to everyone aged 18 and above who chooses to avail of it, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that about a fifth of the cost of vaccination or about Rs 5,000 crore has been borne by people out of their own pockets or by their employers. This estimate has been calculated by assuming a 7% share for the private sector in the total vaccination so far and taking into account the changes in the pricing mechanism since January 16, when Covid vaccination was launched. But what is the basis for the assumption that 7% of vaccines have been delivered by the private sector? While comprehensive data on this is not available in the public domain, according to the junior health minister’s response in Parliament, a little over 7% of vaccinations were administered by the private sector from May 1 to July 15. Subsequent reports quoting government sources, including in this newspaper, indicate that the proportion hasn’t changed much. Out of 100 crore vaccines, 15.2 crore had been administered till April-end, before the liberalised vaccine policy kicked in. Assuming the private sector did 7% of vaccinations in this period too, that would account for just over one crore doses. At Rs 250 per dose, the rate for private vaccination at that time, individuals and employers would have paid roughly Rs 266 crore. On May 1, the government’s new Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy kicked in. From May 1 to June 20, the time the liberalised strategy was in place, 12.3 crore doses were administered. Since the private sector’s share was actually only 7%, it would have accounted for around 86 lakh doses that cost households and employers about Rs 690 crore (at a very conservative Rs 800 per dose). Starting June 21, the government capped what private hospitals could charge for providing vaccines. Effectively, the caps were Rs 780 for each dose of Covishield and Rs 1,410 for Covaxin. Since Covishield accounts for the bulk of vaccination, we have very conservatively assumed an average of Rs 800 per dose. Assuming the same share of private vaccination, of the 74.8 crore doses administered between June 21 and October 24, about 5.2 crore doses would have been done in the private sector costing just under Rs 4,200 crore to get the doses. Put all these figures together and households and employers spent close to Rs 5,150 crore for private vaccines in the journey to the 100-crore figure. How much did governments spend in buying the vaccines they administered? The Centre’s June 26 affidavit in the Supreme Court reveals that it had paid Rs 5,803 crore for the first 35 crore doses it had ordered and received till July. That leaves about 58 crore doses from its share of 93 crore in the 100 crore doses. The government had announced that it would pay Bharat Biotech Rs 225 for each dose of Covaxin and Serum Institute Rs 215 for each dose of Covishield. Even if we take the higher figure of Rs 225 as the average, the 59 crore doses would have cost Rs 13,275 crore. Thus, the total cost of procurement to the government for its share of 93 crore in the 100 crore would be a little over Rs 19,000 crore. Not all of the government doses were bought by the Centre. Between May 1 and June 20, state governments also had to buy doses from manufacturers at higher rates (Rs 300 for Covishield and Rs 600 for Covaxin). Let’s add another Rs 1,000 crore to cover for this additional cost. That takes total government spending on vaccine procurement for the first 100 crore doses to around Rs 20,000 crore and total spending by governments and households to about 25,150 crore. Of course, this includes only procurement costs for governments. Even if we were to add Rs 150 (the amount allowed as administration charges for the private sector) for each dose administered by government, that would amount to Rs 14,000 crore more. Many ministers have justified the high taxes on petroleum as a means to fund the free vaccination programme. However, the cost of vaccination is just a fraction of the total money collected as tax on fuel. In 2020-21, the year for which tax data is available for the entire year, the Centre collected Rs 4.5 lakh crore as taxes on petroleum products while state governments another Rs 2.2 lakh crore. In the first quarter of 2021-22 alone, the Centre collected Rs 90,750 crore from fuel and the states Rs 61,613 crore. Even the tax collected in one quarter seems much higher than the estimated cost of the entire Covid vaccination programme. Free vaccinations have been the norm in most countries. In fact, India is among a handful of countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand and Lebanon that have allowed the sale of Covid vaccines in the private market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/recipients-employers-have-footed-rs-5000-crore-of-vaccine-bill/articleshow/87446809.cms||Atul Thakur
---||Kolkata||Some schools in Kolkata may call both IX & XI students, some only Class XI||KOLKATA: Facing the dual challenge of starting physical classes for high-schoolers from November 16 and conducting the offline board examinations for classes X and XII in semester format, city schools are weighing options of either calling in all students of classes IX and XI back to school or calling only Class-XI students for now. Some schools are only mulling practical classes for now. Schools are devising plans keeping in mind that all students of classes X and XII will have to come to school for their offline examinations beginning November 22 (for ICSE and ISC) and November 29 (for CBSE). These students, along with those of classes IX and XI, may lead to a higher student load on examination days. Principal of St Xavier’s Collegiate School M Thamacin Arulappan said, “We are not in a hurry to start physical classes for all students on November 16. We may call Class-XI students for practical classes since we have board exams too. Right now, students are doing online classes and they prefer to continue in this mode.” Devi Kar, director, Modern High School, said, “We are not going to call all senior classes at the moment. We have board exams from November 22. Classes IX and XI may not be called for physical classes immediately. But we are still discussing this and will inform students after Diwali.” Anjana Saha, principal, Mahadevi Birla World Academy, said, “Our priority is to conduct offline board exams smoothly. So, from November 16, we are not asking Class-IX students to join physical classes. Class XI will be called on days between board exams — from 9 am to 11.30 am.” Heritage School will call students from November 16 and staggered timing will be there. There will be 15-20 minutes of buffer timing amid entry of two groups. Principal Seema Sapru said, “Internal exams of classes IX and XI will be on at the end of November when students of classes X and XII will take board exams. Students writing board exams will be sitting in separate building and use a separate gate. Classes IX and XI students will write internal exams at another building”. Krishna Damani, trustee, South Point School, said, “We are still firming up details of number of students to be called in and the modalities.” Shri Shikshayatan School authority has planned staggered timing for entry and exit of students who will attend physical classes and those who will take board exams. Supriyo Dhar, secretary, La Martiniere, said, “The reopening plans are complete. We will follow government notification for entry and exit. Our classes usually start at 8 am. Very small number of students will come to attend physical classes, so we are not expecting a huge gathering at the main gates.” DPS Ruby Park has specified two shifts from November 16. The first will be from 7.15 am to 11.05 am and the second will be from 12.05 pm to 3.55 pm, said principal Joyoti Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-schools-may-call-both-ix-xi-students-some-only-class-xi/articleshow/87442350.cms||---

---||World||Biden talks F-16s, raises human rights in meeting with Turkey's Erdogan||ROME: US President Joe Biden told Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan his request for F-16 fighter jets had to go through a process in the United States and expressed a desire to handle disagreements between the two countries effectively. Biden also raised the issue of human rights during their meeting on the sidelines of the G20 in Rome, a US senior administration official told reporters. The leaders met amid tensions between the two countries over defense and human rights issues. A different US administration official said on Saturday that Biden would warn his Turkish counterpart that any "precipitous" actions would not benefit US-Turkish relations and that crises should be avoided after Erdogan threatened to throw out the US ambassador to Turkey and other foreign envoys for seeking the release of jailed philanthropist Osman Kavala. Erdogan later withdrew his threat to expel the envoys. "President Biden reaffirmed our defense partnership and Turkey's importance as a NATO Ally, but noted US concerns over Turkey’s possession of the Russian S-400 missile system," the White House said in a statement after the meeting. "He also emphasized the importance of strong democratic institutions, respect for human rights, and the rule of law for peace and prosperity," it said. The two men discussed Turkey's request to purchase F-16 fighter jets, which US lawmakers have opposed on the grounds that Turkey purchased Russian missile defence systems. "The president took on board his ... desire to have them but made very clear that there is a process that we have to go through in the US and committed to continuing to ... work through that process," the senior administration official said. Biden and Erdogan posed for photos before their talks on Sunday. Asked if he planned to give Turkey F-16s, Biden said they were "planning to have a good conversation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-talks-f-16s-raises-human-rights-in-meeting-with-turkeys-erdogan/articleshow/87446801.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fake police gang busted||Yavatmal: Sleuths of the local crime branch led by its chief Pradeep Pardeshi have nabbed three members of an inter-state fake police gang from the neighbouring Adilabad district of Telangana on Saturday. A car worth Rs 5 lakh and Rs 30,000 in cash was seized from the trio. According to SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal, one Achutarama Tammy Reddy (21), a resident of Mata Nagar, Thodge Layout, in Ralegaon tehsil of Yavatmal, lodged a complaint at Ralegaon police station on Friday, alleging that a gang of five unknown persons came to his house in police uniform. They accused Reddy and his associates of drug peddling and stocking Marijuana. The fake cops wanted to examine the rooms. They found Rs 2 lakh kept in different boxes which was collected against the loan instalments on behalf of Reddy’s employer who runs a finance company. The fake cops seized seven mobile phones worth Rs.74,000/ from the complainant and his colleagues. The fake cops then said they would submit the cash and mobiles at the Ralegaon police station and left with the booty. However, the complainant and his friends suspected foul play. On making enquiries, with the Ralegaon police, Reddy and his friends were taken aback on leraning that no such raid and seizure was conducted. A criminal case has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC. After going through the CCTV footage, LCB sleuths launched a manhunt. They reached the neighbouring Adilabad district and nabbed three members of the gang. The cops seized a car and Rs.30000 cash from the trio who confessed to have committed the crime. Two of the gangsters are absconding. An identitification check will be made on Monday before the magistrate, the SP said in a press conference held at the police headquarters on Sunday afternoon.

---||Goa||Caritas creating migrant database from three areas||Panaji: Caritas Goa has begun preparing a database of migrant workers in the state and has set up a migrant resource centre to assist them with opening of bank accounts, filling forms, updating their Aadhaar information and getting information about government schemes. Caritas Goa is focusing on daily wage labourers at Gandhi Circle, Mapusa, at Pilerne industrial estate and fisheries in Vasco. “The centre acts as a link between beneficiaries and departments,” project coordinator Feliza Goes said. The project is undertaken under Caritas India’s Pravasi Bandhu and works to promote safe migration and prevent exploitation. It is being implemented in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa. The team has begun registering the daily wage workers at Mapusa under the central government’s e-shram portal and has conducted awareness camps for them. “We keep a track of those who have made a health card (vector borne disease check up card) and will be conducting a health camp for them in November,” Goes said. In Vasco, the project has ensured vector-borne disease checks, through the health centre, for migrant workers engaged on trawlers. The Salgaocar Law College has set up a legal cell for the migrants at Mapusa. The need for such a programme was felt when the pandemic hit and the repercussions of the lockdown were felt on a wide scale among the migrants. “While providing them with basic medical facilities, we are focusing on improving their living conditions, creating awareness of hygiene and ensuring safety at their living spaces and at their work sites, and empowering women to be independent by creating self-help groups,” the Caritas project coordinator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/caritas-creating-migrant-database-from-three-areas/articleshow/87442587.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||World||Taliban chief makes public appearance, belying death talks||KABUL: Taliban’s reclusive supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, made a rare public appearance in the southern city of Kandahar, Taliban sources said on Sunday, belying widespread rumours of his death. Akhundzada, known as the leader of the faithful or Amir ul Momineen, had not been seen in public even after the Taliban’s August takeover of the country, giving rise to the speculation. A senior Taliban leader who was present with Akhundzada during the appearance said the supreme leader had visited Jamia Darul Aloom Hakimia, a religious school in Kandahar on Saturday. He visited the madrassa to “speak to his brave soldiers and disciples”, according to the introduction to an audio recording circulated by Taliban social media accounts. In the 10-minute recording, he prays for the Taliban martyrs, wounded fighters and the success of officials involved in the “big test” of rebuilding what they call the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. “Let’s pray that we come out of this big test successfully. May Allah help us stay strong,” he said. There was tight security at the event and no photographs or video have emerged. As the Islamist movement unveiled its interim government in September after US-led forces withdrew, the mysterious Akhundzada retained the role he has held since 2016 of supreme leader, the ultimate authority over the group’s political, religious and military affairs. Though some officials say that Akhundzada has made unpublicised public appearances before, this was the first confirmed appearance of a man who has long kept a low public profile. The only photo Reuters has been able to verify of him was an undated image posted on a Taliban Twitter feed in May 2016. This shadowy existence has led to constant speculation about his whereabouts and health. Previously, the Taliban had not confirmed the death of their founder, and original supreme leader, Mullah Omar, for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-chief-makes-public-appearance-belying-death-talks/articleshow/87446977.cms||---
---||Goa||Open to alliance with any party that will give us 12 seats: MGP||Ponda/Margao: MGP Madkai MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Sunday renewed his party’s offer for an alliance with any political party for the 2022 assembly polls with a caveat that the prospective alliance partner should leave 12 constituencies to Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) in which its candidates have already started work. “We are ready to have an alliance with any political party that is ready to give the 12 constituencies where MGP has been campaigning,” Dhavalikar told reporters on the sidelines of an event at Dhavli. Though Dhavalikar didn’t disclose his preference for an alliance partner, as his statement came in reply to a question whether his party would forge an alliance with BJP, it left political observers guessing about MGP’s next moves. Asked if this meant BJP-MGP could still be possible, Dhavalikar pointed to the recent statement made by his younger brother, Deepak, the party’s president, to the effect that MGP would have no truck with BJP. “Deepak has already made a statement that having any form of alliance with BJP would mean committing suicide. The president is the final authority in MGP and has the highest powers. So there is no question of me commenting on an alliance with BJP,” Dhavalikar told TOI. He said that as several new parties including Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were trying to contest the polls, he was being invited to meet them. “MGP has an eminent position in Goa’s politics. Several state governments in the recent past have been formed with its active participation,” he said. Asked if he would meet Union minister Nitin Gadkari during his Goa visit on Monday, Dhavalikar said, “If I am invited, I will pay a courtesy visit. I have friendly ties with Gadkari. During my tenure as minister, Gadkari had granted funds of Rs 12,000 crore for development in Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/open-to-alliance-with-any-party-that-will-give-us-12-seats-mgp/articleshow/87442703.cms||---

This October also witnessed the first 'good air' day of the year and didn't have any 'very poor' or 'severe' air quality day, unlike this month in the past six years. Experts say intense rainfall and lesser number of farm fires were mainly behind the clean air. Track the pollution level in your cityAn analysis of CPCB's October data reveals the highest number of 'very poor' air quality days at 14 were recorded in 2017, while no such day was seen in October this year. First October In 6 Yrs To Have At Least One 'Good-Air' Day The lone 'good' air day this October 18 was also the first to be recorded in the month since 2015. The average AQI this October was 173, the lowest ever measured in October in the capital. According to India Meteorological Department's data, the city saw seven rainy days in October this time and logged 122.5mm rainfall, which is the highest since 1960. However, except October 2018, which recorded no rain activity, only one rainy day each was seen in the same month in 2020, 2019, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB's air laboratory said, "October 2021 was historically good month as it recorded the first 'good' air day of the year and no 'very poor' or 'severe' air quality day. The analysis of past data of October shows the air quality in the month usually start deteriorating in the second week of October but it didn't happen this time. Though AQI reached higher-end of 'poor' category on October 16 and 17 with an AQI of 284 and 298, it drastically came down to 46 on October 18 due to heavy rain." Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, "This October has been the cleanest because of the intense and longer spell of rains, delayed withdrawal of monsoon, and farmers deferring burning of stubble which normally picks up in October. We may now see a spike in stubble burning incidents as the window for the sowing season is getting shorter. This is a matter of concern." While an AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as "good", readings between 51 and 100 fall in the "satisfactory" category and those between 101 and 200 are classified as "moderate". "Poor" air ranges from 201 to 300, "very poor" from 301 to 400 and "severe" from 401 to 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cleanest-october-air-in-delhi-since-start-of-aqi-in-2015/articleshow/87447109.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Modi selling assets built by Indira: Cong||Panaji: The Narendra Modi government is selling off India’s national assets built by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to his capitalist friends, Congress said on Sunday as it recalled the contribution of Gandhi and former home minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel. State party president Girish Chodankar also recalled the role and contribution played by former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri, besides Gandhi and Patel. “Indira Gandhi sought to connect with the masses,” Chodankar said at an event to mark Gandhi’s death anniversary and pay floral tributes to Patel on his birth anniversary. Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram was present for the event but did not speak. Chodankar used the occasion to criticise the NDA-government’s four-year national monetisation pipeline, which is worth an estimated Rs 6 lakh crore. “Indira Gandhi has built the assets of the country and the nationalisation she did of private companies was in the larger interest of the country. But today we have a Prime Minister who is selling the assets of the nation and giving them in the hands of the private companies, to his crony club,” said Chodankar.  Congress said that while Gandhi worked for the interest of the common man and the poor, Modi is working for the interests of a select few private companies. “Looking at this, it is clear that Congress is the friend of the public while BJP is the friend of a select few,” said Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/modi-selling-assets-built-by-indira-cong/articleshow/87442797.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It may be recalled that two senior citizen sisters were murdered at a Ponda residential flat on October 16. Police said that the man was found lying unconscious below the bridge at Kumbharjua-Gawandali. A passerby called an EMRI ambulance which took him to the Betki primary health centre. Prasad was staying in a rented room at Ameyawada, police said. South Goa senior superintendent of police (SSP) Pankaj Kumar Singh said Ponda police received a call from the health center informing that a person was brought dead to the centre. Singh said that it could be a murder as the man has some injuries to his head and other parts of his body. Ponda police have registered an offence of murder against unknown persons under Section 302 of the IPC. Ponda PI Mohan Gaude is investigating the case. The body has been preserved at the Goa Medical College morgue and an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. It may be recalled that two elderly sisters, Mangala Tulshidas Kamat, 76, Jeevan Venkatesh Kamat, 68, were found with their heads smashed and throats slit on October 16 in their flat which is located in the busiest area of Ponda town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/migrant-found-dead-third-murder-in-ponda-in-15-days/articleshow/87442815.cms||---
---||India||Dad bod, FTW, amirite: Merriam-Webster adds 455 new words||SPRINGFIELD: Dad bod, amirite, TBH and FTW are now dictionary-appropriate. Merriam-Webster has added 455 new words to its venerable dictionary, including a number of abbreviations and slang terms that have become ubiquitous on social media. ``Just as the language never stops evolving, the dictionary never stops expanding,'' the nearly 200-year-old Springfield, Massachusetts-based company said on its website. ``New terms and new uses for existing terms are the constant in a living language.`` The dictionary company said the quick and informal nature of messaging, texting, and tweeting, which has only increased during the pandemic, has ``contributed to a vocabulary newly rich in efficient and abbreviated expression.'' Among them: ``TBH'', an abbreviation for ``to be honest'' and ``FTW,'' an abbreviation for ``for the win.'' Merriam-Webster explains that FTW is used ``especially to express approval or support. In social media, FTW is often used to acknowledge a clever or funny response to a question or meme.'' And it says ``amirite'' is a quick way to write ``am I right,'' as in, ``English spelling is consistently inconsistent, amirite?'' The coronavirus pandemic also looms large in the collection of new entrants as ``super-spreader,'' ``long COVID'' and ``vaccine passport'' made the list. Partisan politics contributed more slang to the lexicon, such as ``whataboutism,`` which Merriam-Webster defines as ``the act or practice of responding to an accusation of wrongdoing by claiming that an offense committed by another is similar or worse.'' For Britons, the dictionary notes that ``whataboutery'' is more commonly used. The dreaded ``vote-a-ramas'' that have become a fixture in the U.S. Congress is explained this way: ``an unusually large number of debates and votes that happen in one day on a single piece of legislation to which an unlimited number of amendments can be introduced, debated, and voted on.'' And still other new terms come from the culinary world, such as ``fluffernutter,'' the homey sandwich of peanut butter, marshmallow creme and white bread. Horchata, the cold sweetened beverage made from ground rice or almonds and usually flavored with cinnamon or vanilla, also made the cut, as did chicharron, the popular fried pork belly or pig skin snack. As for ``dad bod''? The dictionary defines that as a ``physique regarded as typical of an average father; especially: one that is slightly overweight and not extremely muscular.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dad-bod-ftw-amirite-merriam-webster-adds-455-new-words/articleshow/87447089.cms||---

---||Goa||Catholics can seek plenary indulgence entire November||Panaji: Catholics will be able to seek plenary indulgence for the souls in purgatory throughout November after the Vatican extended the period for it. Plenary indulgence is a remission of the entire temporal punishment for sin. Traditionally, the faithful could receive a full indulgence each day between November 1 and 8 when they visited a cemetery to pray for the dead and fulfil other conditions and especially if they went to a church to pray on November 2, All Souls Day. Parish priest of Immaculate Conception Church, Panaji, Fr Walter De Sa said, “Now, on any day in November, one can visit a cemetery or pray mentally for the dead. However, on All Souls’ Day, one can visit a church or chapel and pray the Our Father and recite the Creed to be granted an indulgence on behalf of a loved one who died or for an unknown soul in purgatory. A priest may celebrate three Masses, one of which must be for the intentions of the Pope.” Catholics believe purgatory is a place or state of suffering inhabited by the souls of sinners who are atoning their sins before going to heaven. Many parishes have planned to celebrate additional Masses for All Souls’ Day on Tuesday in churches, chapels and cemeteries to accommodate as many faithful as possible, while maintaining social distancing norms. Across the state, cemeteries are being spruced up and cemetery walls whitewashed. In Vasco, several Masses are being organised in St Andrew’s Church and at six chapels with no Mass in the cemetery. At Calangute, a special rosary will be recited with prayers offered for each of those who died last year, reading out each of the names after Mass on November 1. The parish has lost around 40 persons to Covid-19 alone during the past year. On November 2 extra Masses will be celebrated in the church, chapels and cemetery for everyone to take part while maintaining social distancing. The parish at Benaulim is also taking measures to ensure Covid protocol. Traditionally held inside the chapel at the cemetery of St John the Baptist church, the Mass is being moved outdoors for better ventilation. At Siolim, the Mass on All Souls’ Day is being reintroduced in the cemetery at 6.15am when traffic is not expected to cause a hindrance, besides Masses in the church and chapels. This includes a Mass at 7pm for working people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/catholics-can-seek-plenary-indulgence-entire-november/articleshow/87442869.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Realty business in Mumbai picks up thanks to lower premiums||MUMBAI: Beating the pandemic blues, construction activity in the city is seeing a remarkable uptick with builders rushing to BMC offices to get their project files approved before December 31. The reason—early this year, the BMC slashed by half the hefty premiums developers pay to the corporation and state government for additional construction rights. The deadline is December 31. The one-year window seems to have stirred Mumbai’s real estate industry, which was hit badly due to the lockdown. Building industry sources said that in the BandraKhar-Santacruz belt alone, as many as 70 redevelopment proposals have been approved by the BMC’s development plan department. Redevpt market also on the rebound as pandemic blues begin to waneAlthough the department could not confirm the numbers, its chief, Vinod Chitore, said the premium collected from builders because of the 50% concession has been "phenomenal". "Between April and September, we collected a record Rs 4,800 crore as premium fees and expect this amount to further increase to Rs 8,500 crore-plus by December," said Chitore. In comparison, the BMC could manage barely Rs 2,500 crore between April 2020 and March 2021. In 2019-2020, the collection was Rs 3,800 crore. The redevelopment market too is on the rebound. Till last year, builders were cancelling agreements and surrendering rights to redevelop housing societies in prime localities because of financial unviability. Premiums were high even as property prices fell, forcing builders to step back. However, things have changed now. In Bandra's plush Pali Hill, the Daffodils Cooperative Housing Society has been taken over by the Prestige Estates Project for redevelopment. The one-acre plot with 42 apartments built over four decades ago has a development potential of roughly one lakh sq ft. According to Indextap.com, the developer recently bought over 12 apartments in this society for Rs 98 crore. "On the busy Turner Road (Bandra West), as many as seven buildings have been demolished for redevelopment," said property consultant Kishore Narang. Among them is the Cassias society being redeveloped by builder Amit Thakker and Moti Mahal, whose owner is redeveloping the strategically located plot. According to Narang, several of the plots are also being redeveloped into commercial towers because of the high floor space index (FSI) offered by the BMC for office buildings. "On Linking Road and S V Road, between Bandra and Santa Cruz, another four to five properties are being redeveloped as office blocks," he said. Thakker said the semi-luxury market has opened up in Mumbai for apartments priced between Rs 5-10 crore. "We see a lot of traction in this market, especially in the Bandra-Khar area," he said. Experts said the booming stock market is one of the reasons people are buying properties. "They are booking profits and buying larger homes post-pandemic," said Narang. Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, said while the premium concessions have been a "big motivation", the dilution of coastal regulation zone norms in Mumbai too will be an added incentive for developers. "Their profit margins have increased because of these concessions, hike in FSI and relaxed CRZ rules," said Kapoor. "But when supply increases, there will be a glut and pressure on the prices," he warned. According to Liases Foras data, Greater Mumbai (area under BMC jurisdiction) has an inventory of 1.10 lakh apartments with quarterly sales of 5,600 units. "The total inventory is 58 months," said Kapoor. This means it will take almost five years to sell this stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/realty-business-in-mumbai-picks-up-thanks-to-lower-premiums/articleshow/87447242.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||World||G20 offers on climate ahead of COP26||ROME: Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies agreed on a final statement on Sunday that urged “meaningful and effective” action to limit global warming but offered few concrete commitments and disappointed climate activists. The result of days of tough negotiation among diplomats leaves huge work to be done at a broader UN COP26 climate summit in Scotland, to where most of the G20 leaders will fly directly from Rome. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who warned on Friday that the world was rushing headlong towards climate disaster, said the Rome summit neither fulfilled his hopes nor buried them. “While I welcome the #G20’s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled — but at least they are not buried,” he said in a tweet. “Onwards to #COP26 in Glasgow to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive and to implement promises on finance and adaptation for people & planet.” The 1.5C threshold is what UN experts say must be met to avoid a dramatic acceleration of extreme climate events like droughts, storms and floods, and to reach it they recommend net zero emissions should be achieved by 2050. The stakes are huge — among them the very survival of low-lying countries, the impact on economic livelihoods the world over and the stability of the global financial system. “This was a moment for the G20 to act with the responsibility they have as the biggest emitters, yet we only see half-measures rather than concrete urgent action,” said Friederike Roder, vice president of sustainable development advocacy group Global Citizen. The G20 bloc, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the US, accounts for an estimated 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The final document says current national plans on how to curb emissions will have to be strengthened “if necessary” and makes no specific reference to 2050 as a date to achieve net zero carbon emissions. “We recognise that the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C are much lower than at 2°C. Keeping 1.5°C within reach will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries,” the communique said. The leaders only recognised “the key relevance” of halting net emissions “by or around mid-century”, a phrase that removed the 2050 date seen in previous versions of the final statement so as to make the target less specific. China, the world’s biggest CO2 emitter, has set a target date of 2060, and other large polluters such as India and Russia have also not committed to the 2050 target date. UN experts say that even if current national plans are fully implemented, the world is headed for global warming of 2.7C, with catastrophic consequences. The final G20 statement includes a pledge to halt financing of overseas coal-fired power generation by the end of this year, but set no date for phasing out coal power, promising only to do so “as soon as possible”. This replaced a goal set in a previous draft of the final statement to achieve this by the end of the 2030s, showing how strong the push-back from some coal-dependent countries is. The G20 also set no date for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, saying they will aim to do so “over the medium term”. On methane, which has a more potent but less lasting impact than carbon dioxide on global warming, they watered down their wording from a previous draft that pledged to "strive to reduce our collective methane emissions significantly". The final statement merely recognises that reducing methane emissions is "one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost-effective ways to limit climate change". G20 sources said negotiations were tough over so-called "climate financing", which refers to a 2009 pledge by rich nations to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle climate change. They have failed to meet the pledge, generating mistrust and a reluctance among some developing nations to accelerate their emissions reductions. "We recall and reaffirm the commitment made by developed countries, to the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and annually through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries," the G20 statement says. The leaders "stress the importance of meeting that goal fully as soon as possible". Italy will triple its climate finance contribution to $1.4 billion per year for the next five years, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said. But the amount is considerably less than what some think tanks estimate the country's fair contribution should be. The United Nations said last week greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record in 2020 and the world is "way off track" in capping rising temperatures. World leaders will kick start COP26 on Monday with two days of speeches that could include some new emissions-cutting pledges, before technical negotiators lock horns over the rules of the 2015 Paris climate accord.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/g20-offers-on-climate-ahead-of-cop26/articleshow/87447244.cms||---

During a recent meeting with chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is also the chairman of the Goa State Wildlife Board, they had asked him to up the limit to 400 trips per day. While a total of 431 jeeps have been registered with the wildlife board, it has restricted the number of jeeps to only 240 per day by considering the carrying capacity of the deep forest area of Dudhsagar. Chairman of the Dudhsagar Tour Operators’ Association (DTOA) Dilip Mairekar said thousands of tourists come to Collem to visit the falls, but have to return disappointed as they don’t get jeeps. “The number of tourists rises many fold during major festivals like Diwali and Christmas and on New Year’s eve. The government should enhance the limit at least during these periods,” Mairekar said. He recalled that the limit was relaxed to 300 trips per day between December 2018 and January 2019 to adjust to the higher number of tourists. Citing this, jeep operators demanded that the number of trips be hiked. “Our demand is on similar lines. We want the limit to be capped at 300 trips per day and number of passengers to seven instead of existing five per jeep,” Mairekar said. Additional principal chief conservator of forest Santosh Kumar, who is also the chief wildlife warden, said that the report on carrying capacity of Dudhsagar has clearly mentioned that a maximum 240 jeeps per day could be allowed to ferry tourists to the falls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dudhsagar-jeep-operators-want-daily-trips-increased-to-300/articleshow/87442881.cms||---

---||Nagpur||HC clears way for eviction of Sonarwahi village in Gosi project||Nagpur: Though 14 families from Sonarwahi village in Kuhi town of Nagpur district had received compensation for vacating their properties for Gosikhurd project back in 2001, they are continuing to stay there till date. It led to inordinate delay in increasing water levels for the project as it would have led to complete submergence of the village and threat to lives of those families. On Friday, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court cleared the path by modifying its status quo and asking the petitioner Bala Dahake to vacate his land and shift to the temporary facility created by the Maharashtra government at Veltur village. HC had already refused any relief to 13 other families from their eviction. Only Dahake was granted a status quo on October 26 after he cited the emergency. The HC’s move has cleared the path for eviction of one of last few remaining villages since 2001 that had become obstruction in completion of the project, which is expected to irrigate over 2.5 lakh hectares in Nagpur and Bhandara. For over four decades, the project has been waiting for its completion and its cost has jumped manifold. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare directed the respondents to provide all basic amenities to the project affected persons (PAPs) at houses constructed at Chirvha village within six months. “We are of the view that in a case like this, it is necessary that larger interests of the public and of individuals like the petitioner are required to be balanced, so that no prejudice is caused to any of them. If this is to be done, instead of vacating the interim relief, this court would have to consider modification of the interim order,” the judges said while disposing of Dahake’s plea. During TOI team’s visit to Sonarwahi village in September 2018, it was partially submerged from three sides and the only way out was through a treacherous walkway that was marshy in patches. The villagers used to park their vehicles at the nearest angandwadi which is about 3km at Bhiwapur and then walk for 3km to reach their homes. That time also, the villagers refused to rehabilitate at Bothli village citing lack of facilities. The HC’s directives came after the government moved an application for lifting status quo of Dahake’s petition. The orders came after strong arguments were put forward by additional government pleader (AGP) Deepak Thakare contending that it is necessary that the reservoir stores water in full capacity in larger public interest. “Because of them, the storage capacity has been reduced by 205.865 cubic mm from 1146.075 cubic mm.” The AGP added that a big number of farmers were getting adversely affected for no fault on the part of the government in rehabilitating the PAPs. “The administrators have provided constructed houses equipped with all basic amenities for their temporary stay at the irrigation colony in Veltur village. Once the basic amenities are completed at Chirvha village, these PAPs can be rehabilitated there. The petitioner must not cause any obstruction, especially after all PAPs have lost the right to occupy the land/house after receiving compensation in 2001.” While modifying its status quo, the HC directed the petitioner to accept a temporary relocation offer and vacate his land and house. THE CONUNDRUM Sonarwahi village land came under Gosikhurd project Govt reached settlement with villagers & provided compensation in 2001 Due to delay in dam construction, govt didn’t evict them till last few years After project was accorded national status, its work was expedited Villagers refused to evict land citing lack of facilities at resettlement site Some challenged govt’s move in civil courts & HC that led to further delay HC grants status quo after Dahake approached it citing emergency It was lifted on Friday after govt said larger public interest was being affected||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-clears-way-for-eviction-of-sonarwahi-village-in-gosi-project/articleshow/87441514.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Classes I to VII, X and XII will begin in the first phase with strict Covid protocols in place, the government said on Sunday. The general education department has made arrangements to conduct 'pravesanotsavam' - celebration of the new academic year - in all schools to welcome the students. Ministers will inaugurate these celebrations in select schools at the district level and collectors, deputy directors of education, MPs, MLAs and civic body members, among others, will attend. Though attendance is not mandatory, teachers said over 95% of students have expressed willingness to attend school. Various departments have worked to ensure the safe conduct of classes while the preparations included cleaning and disinfecting the school premises and implementing a bio-bubble system. Special teams of police and motor vehicles department have been deployed to ensure implementation of protocols outside schools and in school buses. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a Facebook post that the absence of regular classes had created serious challenges in the education sector. The state is recovering from the challenges caused by the pandemic and reopening of educational institutions is a major step in this regard, he said. "Kerala is recovering from the crises; we all should stand and work together for the progress of the state. It is very important to ensure safe conduct of classes. I am seeking the people's support to ensure that the school reopening goes well as planned," he said. A P M Mohammad Hanish, principal secretary, general education, said the schools, teachers and parents should follow the guidelines released by the health and education departments after discussion with other departments. 'Plan to resume mid-day meals scheme at the earliest'The district administration is working for the smooth reopening of schools and extra support will be given to schools in tribal and coastal areas. Special attention will be given to schools with students belonging to linguistic minorities and migrant labour families," he said. The government is planning to resume the mid-day meal scheme at the earliest. "We want to provide mid-day meals to students as early as possible. It might take a few more days," Hanish said, adding that only a few schools in Idukki had relief camps functioning in their buildings. "Though the schools are reopening to restart physical classes, we will ensure a triple-medium of learning. i.e. offline, online and digital classes. The online classes by schools and digital classes via KITE Victers, which has two channels now, will continue," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-begins-a-new-chapter/articleshow/87447417.cms||---
---||World||Taiwan scrambles jets as Chinese air force enters air defence zone||TAIPEI: Taiwan's air force scrambled on Sunday to warn off eight Chinese aircraft including fighter jets that entered its air defence zone, its defence ministry said, at a time of heightened tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has complained for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the self-ruled island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. The Chinese aircraft included six J-16 fighters, one anti-submarine aircraft and one surveillance aircraft, the defence ministry said in a statement late on Sunday. Taiwan, which China claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force, says Chinese military activities near the island jeopardize regional stability and repeatedly vows to defend its freedom and democracy. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Chinese counterpart on Sunday that the United States opposed actions by China that have increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait, a senior State Department official said. The official said that during an hour-long meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Rome, Blinken made "crystal clear" that Washington opposes any unilateral changes by Beijing to the status quo there. Wang told Blinken that tensions over Taiwan were caused by U.S. support for pro-independence forces on the island, China's foreign ministry said in a statement. A recent increase in Chinese military exercises in Taiwan's air defence identification zone is part of what Taipei views as stepped-up military harassment by Beijing. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is an independent country and has made modernizing the armed forces, which is well-armed but dwarfed by China's, a top priority. Earlier this month, Taiwan reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern theatre of the zone over a four-day period, marking a dramatic escalation of tension between Taipei and Beijing. Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but rather its air defence identification zone or ADIZ, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/taiwan-scrambles-jets-as-chinese-air-force-enters-air-defence-zone/articleshow/87447347.cms||---

If Trinamool is voted to office in Tripura in 2023, the Lakshmir Bhandar monthly income benefit scheme for women, Duare Sarkar and all Bengal government schemes will be implemented there in three months, Abhishek said. He added TMC will not adopt the “defection model” in Tripura but would “respect the people’s mandate”. Abhishek was addressing a rally near Rabindra Satabarshiki Bhawan after the Tripura High Court late on Saturday allowed Trinamool to hold the event but capped attendees at 500. Calling chief minister Biplab Deb “Big Flop Deb” , Abhishek said: “Biplab Deb had tried to shift this venue elsewhere. We will respect this wish. CM Mamata Banerjee will hold a rally at Vivekananda stadium.” The Tripura government, the Trinamool MP alleged, was inconveniencing people in its attempt to stop him from visiting the state. “The Section 144 imposed earlier, the Covid test norms announced now are all an attempt to stop me. If they have a problem with me, then they can take me on. Why are they putting so many people in trouble,” he said. Addressing CM Deb, the MP said: “If you think we are CPM or Congress, you are mistaken. I have more tenacity than them. Once people get a chance to vote, they will not allow BJP to rule Tripura. Abhishek said he would stay in Tripura in the run-up to the 2023 assembly polls. “I got many calls from here. We will not give any free space to BJP,” he added. “Duare goonda (goons on your doorstep) will end, Duare Sarkar (government on your doorstep) will start.” Bike gangs and goons that were intimidating people had shifted from CPM to BJP, Abhishek continued. “When we come to office, they will come to us too. We will take them in. But I assure you that for the next five years, these same people will be on your doorstep pleading to accompany you to the Duare Sarkar camps,” he said. At the rally, Abhishek said: “My memories go back to 2016 when I had come here. There were 5,000 people then; today, there are 500. But entire Tripura is watching this today, and I want to assure you that TMC will fight along with you.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-promises-didi-visit-bengal-schemes-for-tripura/articleshow/87442834.cms||---

Think of schools as laboratories where students will use offline classrooms to do hands-on experiments and learn through that,” he said at ‘Innovation Amidst Adversity’, an event organised by Science City and Birla Industrial and Technological Museum.. Speaking about challenges during a pandemic, Wanghcuk said online learning threw up more opportunities. “Many teachers who were not focused on education through online classes are well-conversant now,” he said. Citing the example of his own non-traditional school in Ladakh, Wangchuk said merely studying its structure would provide students the concepts of physics. Pinning hopes on the New Education Policy, he said: “New Education Policy looks good to me. We are yet to see how much of that reaches the last-mile student.” Wangchuk now plans to set up a university, Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, over 200 acres in Phyang Valley.

The forensics team led by SFSL assistant director Chitrakar Das said, “We have examined the vehicles involved in the crash.” He refused to comment on queries about their findings. Police have registered an unnatural death case and recorded the statement of Tista’s husband Gourab, who survived the crash and is being treated. The probe comes in wake of demands by BJP’s Tamluk organisational district president Nabarun Naik, who said a detailed probe was required to find out whether it was indeed an accident. Naik has claimed the account that an oil tanker hit a breakdown van and then the car in which Tista was travelling at such speed didn’t add up. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has termed this an “unfortunate accident”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/forensic-experts-examine-vehicles-involved-in-bjp-kmc-ward-86-reps-car-crash/articleshow/87442849.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Campuses face tough questions over unvaccinated freshers in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities in Kolkata have discovered that around 25% to 30% of their new batch of first-year students — who are 17-going-on-18 — are unvaccinated, because of the country’s vaccine mandate. Under the circumstances, the authorities may adopt a wait-and-watch policy with this group before allowing them for offline classes when campuses reopen across the state on November 16. Last week, the state government notified that schools, colleges and universities — most of which have stayed shut since March 2020 — would reopen for on-campus classes. The reopening order had neither placed any restriction on the number of students allowed on higher education campuses, nor had the guidelines mentioned the vaccination status of students. This has made the job of college and university authorities complicated. Calling unvaccinated students to campus might expose them to the virus and, consequently, increase their chances of getting ill. CoWin lets those who were born up to December 2003 register for vaccination, but the minimum official vaccination age is 18. Just after the government announced the reopening, college and university authorities started collecting copies of vaccination certificates of students, when they discovered almost 25% to 30% new students were not yet 18 and, thus, were unvaccinated. Most of them will turn 18 in the next few months, though. At St Xavier’s College, almost 80% of students have received both doses, whereas the rest have received at least the first dose and would be eligible for the second in the coming weeks. “All our teaching and non-teaching staff are fully vaccinated. Close to 200 students who have just taken admission in first year are yet to turn 18, but they will be eligible for vaccination in the next couple of months,” said Father Dominic Savio, the principal. In Maulana Azad College, almost 150 students are yet to turn 18. “Close to 40% students have taken both doses, while 55% have received one dose,” said Subhasis Dutta, principal. In Lady Brabourne College, too, there are new students yet to turn 18. “There are a few students who are below 18 years of age,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of the college. In colleges like Jaipuria, Goenka, Jadavpur University and others, too, several students are below the age of 18. “Almost 30% of students who have taken admission in UG first-semester have not turned 18. They will be turning 18 by the end of this year or early next year. Now, the government guidelines about reopening do not mention about the vaccination status of the students. We are confused about what to do. If we call unvaccinated students, it could pose a risk to them as well as others,” said the principal of a reputable college in Kolkata. “We have not yet drawn up the final plan, but when we do it, the fact that some students are waiting for vaccination will definitely play a part. Since they are in the first year, we might call them for on-campus classes after a few weeks,” said the principal of a college in north Kolkata. Another principal said meetings had been held with the governing body, where it had been decided to “give priority to students who are in the outgoing batches, and need to use the labs. So, first-semester students might have to wait for some weeks before they come to the campus.” Experts said the risk to unvaccinated youngsters would be far lower than that to the middle-aged or the elderly. “First, most have developed antibodies through exposure to Covid, so they will be relatively safe even without a vaccine. Also, those below 20 are more resilient and have been fighting Covid better than the rest. So, they are likely to get a mild infection,” said Rahul Jain, internal medicine consultant, Belle Vue Clinic. He, however, added that every student should stick to Covid protocol and wear masks in class. In some states where campuses had reopened in September, some private colleges made vaccination mandatory but faced problems with those students who are yet to turn 18. “We plan to draw up the roaster after Diwali on which students would come to college. If there is no clear instruction from the government about vaccination status, we will make seniors come to campus first. This way, the unvaccinated students will turn 18 and get their first jab at least,” said the principal of another college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campuses-face-tough-questions-over-unvaccinated-freshers/articleshow/87444045.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||‘Repentant’ Rajib Banerjee returns to Trinamool at Agartala rally||KOLKATA: Less than a month after he was made a special invitee to the BJP national executive, former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee on Sunday returned to Trinamool Congress with “repentance” on his lips.  “I was wrong. We were wrong,” he said in Agartala, adding, “I failed to appreciate chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s worth. She isn’t only Bengal’s mother, but the country’s too. BJP thrives only on votes and power.” Rajib was handed over the TMC flag by party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee at Sunday’s Tripura rally. “I have long ties with Tripura, my relatives and friends stay here. And it is from them I learnt how hollow these double-engine claims are. Tripura has a double engine, yet they do not have a single social scheme like single-engine Bengal. I was wrong. When I understood that, it was too late,” he said. Rajib had met Abhishek on August 7, over two months after his poll drubbing in Howrah’s Domjur where he lost by over 33,000 votes. In TMC, he had won the same seat twice, in 2011 and 2016. “I didn’t agree with the personal attacks, had spoken out against it. Given our culture and mentality, I also couldn’t agree to this politics of religion, race, division and hatred,” he said. “I demanded that the fuel price hike be rolled back. I also asked that the ailing Dunlop be taken over (by the Centre).” TMC workers who fought a vitriolic campaign against Rajib in the polls were openly opposed to his ghar-wapsi. For BJP, it was his repeated criticism on social media of the party’s “inability to accept people’s mandate” and “repeated personal attacks on CM Mamata Banerjee”. His induction as a special invitee to the BJP national executive gave an indication that he had finally buried the hatchet. But he didn’t. The ‘homecoming’ rumblings were immediate. TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee, who led the charge against Rajib in Domjur, said: “The leadership had said anyone who had hurt party workers will not find a place again. I feel hurt.” Rajib said: “Kalyanda is a respected guardian. He has spoken about his personal feelings. The party’s highest leadership has decided to take me back.” TMC in a statement said they “wholeheartedly welcomed” Rajib back. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh disagreed. “That he will return was known to all. They had a non-entry board till now, he went the day they removed it.” BJP Bengal president Sukanta Majumdar said: “He had come to BJP from another party, and he left.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/repentant-rajib-returns-to-trinamool-at-agartala-rally/articleshow/87442761.cms||---

The Tokyo fire department said 17 passengers were injured, including three seriously. Not all of them were stabbed and most of the other injuries were not serious, the agency said. The attacker, identified as a 24-year-old man, was arrested on the spot and was being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, NHK said. His motive was not immediately known. Nippon Television reported that the suspect told police that he wanted to kill and get a death penalty, and that he used an earlier train stabbing case as an example. TV footage showed a number of firefighters, police officials and paramedics rescuing the passengers, many of whom escaped through train windows. In one video, passengers were running from another car, where flames were gushing. NHK said the suspect, after stabbing passengers, poured a liquid resembling oil from a plastic bottle and set fire, which partially burned seats. Shunsuke Kimura, who filmed the video, told NHK that he saw passengers desperately running and while he was trying to figure out what happened, he heard an explosive noise and saw smoke wafting. He also jumped from a window but fell on the platform and hurt his shoulder. “Train doors were closed and we had no idea what was happening, and we jumped from the windows,” Kimura said. “It was horrifying.” The attack was the second involving a knife on a Tokyo train in two months. In August, a 36-yearold man stabbed 10 passengers on a commuter train in Tokyo in a random burst of violence. The suspect later told police that he wanted to attack women who looked happy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/man-dressed-as-joker-stabs-many-on-tokyo-train-starts-fire-17-hurt/articleshow/87447579.cms||---

Wary of security breaches, the government, with consent from Puneeth’s family, advanced the burial to 7.30am. Dawn was just breaking when the final last journey commenced from Kanteerava Stadium, where Puneeth’s mortal remains were kept for public viewing since Friday evening. The funeral procession left the stadium at 5.30am, almost immediately after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai planted a final farewell kiss on Puneeth’s forehead, and the cortège reached Sree Kanteerava Studios at 6.30am. Vinay Rajkumar, Puneeth’s nephew and son of brother Raghavendra Rajkumar, performed the rituals in accordance with Idiga community customs and a guard of honour and gun salute were performed. The Power Star’s daughters, Drithi and Vanditha flanked their mother Ashwini, as they witnessed the rituals. He was buried near the memorials of his parents, thespian Rajkumar and Parvathamma Rajkumar. “While we still cannot believe that Appu [as the actor was fondly called] is gone, we are deeply pained by his passing,” said Shivarajkumar, Puneeth’s eldest brother. In the wake of a spate of suicides by grieving fans across the state, he appealed to them against taking the extreme step. “Appu was 13 years younger to me and like a kid. I feel like I have lost my child, but then we should swallow the pain and move on in life,” Shivarajkumar said. Bommai handed over the national flag that was draped over Puneeth to Ashwini before the body was buried with state honours. “I have a personal bond with Rajkumar’s family and more so with Appu since his childhood. I was so emotional as I bid farewell to him,” said Bommai. Other dignitaries present included revenue minister R Ashoka, home minister Araga Jnanendra, health minister K Sudhakar and horticulture minister N Muniratna, KPCC president DK Shivakumar and Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah. Film actors including V Ravichandran, Upendra, Ganesh and Duniya Vijay joined the bereaved family in bidding adieu to the actor. Prohibitory orders will remain in force in and around Kanteerava Studios till Tuesday when the family will perform the fifth day rituals (haalu thuppa) at the grave. Authorities said the public will be allowed only after that. “We will make arrangements such as barricades before allowing people to visit the grave,” said J Manjunath Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner. Jnanendra appreciated the work rendered by police and officials of other departments. “I would like to thank all of them. They worked day and night for three days. We deployed around 20,000 personnel from 50 platoons of the state police and two companies of central police forces. I am happy that we could maintain order and there were no untoward incidents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-in-early-morning-event-puneeth-rajkumar-laid-to-rest-next-to-parents/articleshow/87447714.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Mid-day meal providers Adamya Chetana and not-for-profit start-up Step One are among 10 organisations presented Amrita Mahotsava State awards to mark the 75th year of independence. The Rajyotsava award, to be presented today, carries Rs 1 lakh cash, a 10gm gold medal and citation. I wasn't chosen earlier, award came after 14 yrs: Rohit Kateel  Actor Devaraj said he was happy that the government recognised his service, but it was "disheartening" that only one person was selected from the industry. "They should have honoured 2-3 more persons," he said. Belawadi is the third in the family - after his parents and stage legends BN Nani and Bhargavi Narayan - to receive the award. He told TOI that he was glad he has been chosen for contribution to theatre, although he has worked in cinema as well. In St Petersburg, Russia, to play in an ATP event, Bopanna said he was "truly honoured" to receive one of the highest civilian awards. Another athlete who has received the award is Dakshina Kannada's Rohit Kumar Kateel, an international high jumper. From Karkala, Kateel told TOI that he represented India as its first high jumper in 1986 at an event in Greece. "The award has come to me after 14 years. I'm disappointed that I was not chosen earlier. This time, international athletes and Olympians recommended my name. Also, the fact that minister V Sunil Kumar hails from Karkala, my hometown, helped me in getting the award," he added. Sources said health minister K Sudhakar personally recommended the name of Dr MK Sudarshan, who is the chairman of Covid-19 technical advisory committee, for his service during the pandemic. "I'm grateful to the government for bestowing this honour on me ," he added. Another Covid warrior, start-up Step One, founded in April 2020 has been picked for the award. It was started after sensing the need for people to access doctors during the pandemic and started pooling volunteers. The start-up is closely working with 21 state governments and has 30,000 volunteers now. A majority of them are doctors. Its founder Raghavendra Prasad TS said, "More than half of our volunteers are from Karnataka. They carry out a number of work, including tele-counselling, diet counselling, home isolation monitoring. This award is for all our volunteers and the government officials." Adamya Chetana is an organization run by the late Union minister HN Ananth Kumar and his wife and BJP state vice-president Tejaswini. His daughter Aishwarya tweeted: "24 years of service, 47 crore hot meals served... I thank the volunteers who have under the guidance of Tejaswini Ananth Kumar made this possible."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/devaraj-prakash-belawadi-and-dr-mk-sudarshan-among-kannada-rajyotsava-award-winners/articleshow/87447858.cms||---

The term of office of six MLCs expired on June 3 and the elections were to be held in May but were postponed due to the second wave of pandemic.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Three-month extension for real estate rebate window||KOLKATA: The state finance department has issued a notification extending the limited period budgetary sops to real estate sector — 2% cut in stamp duty and 10% reduction in circle rate — by three months till January 31, 2022. The rebate window was originally slated to end on October 30 but CM Mamata Banerjee had indicated that it would be extended following an appeal by builders affiliated to state chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India (Credai). According to the twin notifications, a 10% reduction in circle rate and revised stamp duty of 4% for units that cost up to Rs 1 crore and 5% for units that cost over Rs 1 crore announced in state budget and effective till October 30 was being extended till January 31, 2022. The industry had requested the government to extend the rebate by two months till December 31, 2021, but has not got an additional month. “This is huge for the industry. It will generate demand for the next three months and sustain the growth that we have witnessed since July-end,” Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani said. Over 60% of home sales in Kolkata happen in five months — September to January. With the sops covering this period, the industry is eyeing the highest ever sales clocked in second half of the year (July-December). Between July and September this year, 15,160 apartments were sold, up from 6,842 apartments sold during the corresponding period last year. The spike in demand has also led to an increase in launches. While only 756 units were launched in April-June 2021, developers launched 3,128 in the following three months. Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta said it would offer a huge relief to home buyers and bring more revenue to state coffers. Shishir Baijal, chairman and MD of international real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank India, said the extension had come at an important cusp of time as the country headed towards Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-mth-extension-for-real-estate-rebate-window/articleshow/87442405.cms||Subhro Niyogi

With medical professionals finishing their immunisation about eight months ago and the virus still widely present, many doctors TOI spoke with said they had no option, but to take a booster dose. "This is a trend among educated individuals of taking the third dose even though government centres are not providing booster dose. Some are able to manage, but they will not be awarded any certificates," a senior doctor said. Vax apprehension is an issue: Official While top health department officials said they were aware of what's happening in hospitals, but in the absence of any guideline either in favour or against using boosters, the trend could continue. "Vaccine apprehension among many people is an issue for us, but no complaints have been lodged by anyone on booster dose," a top official told TOI on the condition of anonymity. Doctors have been evaluating their antibodies after taking the vaccine and if the levels come down, they are looking for a booster dose. "Not just among health experts, but individuals are asking us about booster doses since people are anxious about their elderly parents," said Dr Kishan Rao, head of the Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA). There is also an inclination in the city of discussing booster doses in webinars. "I attended a webinar on vaccines by a health expert team to have a better understanding of everything, including booster dose. There I came to know that WHO is focusing on vaccine equality," said RV Kanaka Reddy, a private employee. WHO has been pressing countries to increase their vaccine cooperation, highlighting that 80 countries do not have a 10% vaccination (both doses) coverage rate. During a WHO webinar, companies said that it was preferable to take a booster dose after 6 to 8 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-no-govt-nod-but-many-health-staff-in-telangana-taking-booster-dose/articleshow/87447870.cms||---

With this, all one crore students studying from Class I to XII in Tamil Nadu are being allowed to return to schools for the first time since March 2020. The elementary education department has asked the schools to conduct storytelling, drawing and other creative sessions for the first two weeks to ease children back into the academic environment. Schools have devised their own ways to split students' strength into two and conduct physical classes on alternate days. Parents whom TOI spoke to said their kids are excited to return to school after 19 months from Monday. Leeba, a parent from Tambaram, said her son Andrew Thomas, a class VIII student, was excited to return to school and had kept his school bag and shoes ready a day in advance. Sripriya Raj, another parent from Kolathur, said her daughter is looking forward to her friends and teachers after a long gap. "Though our daughter is excited to return to school, I still have doubts about sending her to physical classes as she may get the infection," she said. Some teachers are planning to welcome students with sweets, chocolates and balloons to physical classes. "Our teachers will greet students with flowers, sweets, biscuits and pencil pouches," said MM Ramalakshmi, headmistress of Presidency Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Egmore.

The accused, Radhakrishnan, 34 of Villivakkam was married to Lavanya, 30, a nurse and the couple have two children. The couple had a love marriage, police said. Radhakrishnan grew suspicious of his wife ans suspected that she was having an extra-marital affair. This led to frequent arguments and fights between the couple. Unable to put up with this, she deserted him and began to live on her own with her two children for the past three months. Police said Radhakrishnan approached his wife for a reconciliation but she refused. On Saturday night, she left her children and went to the hospital for a night shift. A couple of minutes after she left, Radhakrishnan came to meet her at her house, but found the children alone. He began to ask inappropriate questions to his eight-year-old daughter, but the child was clueless. He kept forcing the girl to tell him if someone visited her mother's home in his absence. Since the child failed to react to any of this, he went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and allegedly stabbed her on her shoulder and arms, police said. Unable to bear the pain, the child began to cry loudly. Radhakrishnan asked her to keep quiet but she was in pain. Withing seconds, he slit her throat. Her neighbours rushed to the house after hearing the girl's cries. Noticing the neighbours, Radhakrishnan made good his escape. Neighbours informed Lavanya about her daughter's condition. The girl was rushed to a nearby government hospital where she was declared dead. Radhakrishnan surrendered before the Villivakkam police after confessing to the murder. He told cops that he was unhappy with his wife's behaviour in recent days. He was frustrated as the child failed to respond to any of his queries. "He was restless to know if someone was visiting the house in his absence and the child could not give him a clue," said an investigating officer. The girl was studying in Class IV at a private school. Radhakrishnan was booked on charges of murder and has been remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-man-kills-daughter-over-wifes-affair/articleshow/87448187.cms||---

---||Lucknow||To target UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra invokes Gorakhnath||GORAKHPUR: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday targeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath in his backyard, alleging that his government has been working against the teachings of Gorakhnath, “who professed love, harmony and acceptance of all sections of society, including poor and impoverished”. “In Yogi’s regime, weavers, backwards, minorities and Brahmins are being exploited and harassed,” she said at the Pratigya rally in Gorakhpur. Urging the people to bring a change, she said it is time they question their faith in leaders who have “played with their feelings in the name of religion and caste”. The Congress general secretary also reached out to farmers and members of the fishing community. “If the Congress is voted to power, then fisheries will be given the status of agriculture, and it will get all the facilities like agriculture. The rights of people of the Nishad community will be restored in sand mining and fisheries. Apart from this, a university named after Guru Machchendranath will also be set up,” she said. “I want to tell my sisters, I will fight for you, Congress will empower you. When 40% women enter politics, they will change the face of politics,” she said. Priyanka remembered her grandmother, Indira Gandhi, on her death anniversary, saying: “She knew she could be killed, but never bowed down. It is because of her that I am standing in front of you ”. Responding to Samajwadi Party’s jibe that she was hand in glove with BJP, she said, “Why don't they stand by you in your tough times? I will die, but I will never have any relationship with BJP. You know who shut down sugarcane mills established during Congress governments here. SP and BSP regimes shut mills and they are saying Congress is working in collusion with BJP,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/to-target-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-invokes-gorakhnath/articleshow/87448192.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Gurgaon||Waterlogging woes to be sorted by next monsoon||Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is set to reconstruct a damaged 1,500-metre stretch of the master stormwater drain near Basai Chowk that may resolve the recurrent waterlogging woes of the city’s low-lying Sectors 9 and 9A by the next monsoon. The GMDA’s core planning cell, senior officials said, has approved Rs 13 crore for the work. The master drain between Umang Bhardwaj Chowk and the railway culvert was damaged by a private agency during the construction of a flyover at Basai Chowk and a railway overbridge near Basai village. Water from all of Old Gurgaon, including Sectors 9 and 9A, drains out into the damaged stretch, GMDA officials said. Pardeep Kumar, the chief engineer of GMDA (Infra-2), told TOI that the drain on the service road near Basai Chowk would be reconstructed. “We will reconstruct 1,500 metres of the master drain and Rs 13 crore has already been approved at the GMDA’s core planning cell meeting. We are trying to complete the tendering process within the next two months. We are hopeful that the work will be completed before the monsoon season next year,” he said. For the past 18 months, residents of Sectors 9 and 9A have been demanding that the damaged master drain be fixed to address the waterlogging issue. They also raised the matter at a meeting of the CM grievance committee. In response, Khattar had directed the GMDA to come up with a proposal to solve the issue. “Sector 9 is the lowest-lying portion of Old Gurgaon and does not have any internal drainage of its own, which exacerbates the waterlogging issue. However, GMDA can only undertake the master drainage work. The internal drainage has to be handled by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon,” said Kumar. Residents have welcomed the decision. “It is good that the authority is finally paying heed to our concern and fixing the master drain line that was damaged a year and a half ago during the construction of the flyover adjacent to our sector. Ideally, there should have been a plan in place before the flyover construction work commenced,” Lalit Suraj Bhola, general secretary of Sector 9A residents’ welfare association, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/waterlogging-woes-to-be-sorted-by-next-monsoon/articleshow/87443061.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Chennai||Chennai: Five years on, 1,200m flyover at Velachery to open today||CHENNAI: The long-delayed flyover at Vijayanagar junction connecting the road from Taramani with the Velacherry by-pass will be opened to the public by chief minister M K Stalin on Monday. Work on the 1,200m flyover began in 2016 and it took five years and cost 186 crore to complete. State highways department officials said various factors contributed to the delay. To begin with the project got stuck over land acquisition. A section of people moved court and only in June last year, during the lockdown period, did the highways department get the go-ahead from the court, said an official. The flyover has a two-lane carriage way with a width of 7.5 metres. This means only one-way traffic can be allowed. Similar is the size of the second arm, connecting Velacherry with Pallikaranai. This is also planned as flyover with one way traffic, said the official. A local resident S Kumara Raja said about 11,500 sqft of land was needed to take up the flyover construction. With the court issuing a stay on the work, the original plan to complete it by within 24 months fell through. Then the giant sewer line from the nearby residential areas to the Perungudi treatment plant became another hurdle, which needed to be realigned. This work took nearly a year. When these works were completed, the lockdown halted work.  The second arm of the flyover, connecting Velacherry to Pallikaranai, measuring 640 metres is expected to be ready by this year-end. Kumara Raja said both arms could only handle one-way traffic and rued that they had not been better planned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-five-years-on-1200m-flyover-at-velachery-to-open-today/articleshow/87448303.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||AQI ‘poor’ for 3 days, health dept says stay indoors||Gurgaon: First Covid, now bad air. The health department has asked Gurgaon residents to avoid stepping out of homes unless absolutely necessary as the city’s air quality has remained in the “poor” category for three days on the trot. Should people have to step out urgently, they should wear masks all the time and consult a doctor in case of breathing problems, giddiness, chest discomfort, cough and irritation in the eyes. The department has also asked people to avoid areas that witness heavy traffic On Sunday, Gurgaon recorded an AQI of 262. An AQI in the 201 to 300 range is considered “poor” while that between 301 and 400 is “very poor”. Officials fear the air quality may turn worse in the coming week. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, air quality in the “poor” range can cause breathing discomfort in case of prolonged exposure and even respiratory illnesses. Officials said children should be made to wear air filter masks in case they step out of homes. “People with airway, lungs or heart illnesses should have medicines available with them. They should avoid going for morning and evening walks. Doors and windows should be kept closed in the mornings and evenings,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. He also stressed that people should not burst crackers, even in areas where they would be allowed during the festivals. “Harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide are emitted when you burn crackers. These gases affect the ozone layer. Since the particulate matter’s size is 2.5, they easily enter our body through the nasal vessels and settle into our lungs. At times, PM 2.5 gets absorbed into our blood vessels as well. These have an effect on the respiratory system. This is why people should avoid outdoor activities during peak pollution hours,” Yadav added. Doctors backed the health department advisory. “As the winter settles, the air quality is slowly becoming poor. There is a rise in the number of respiratory cases such as viral pneumonia, asthma and COPD. Such patients have difficulty breathing, cough, fever, increased sputum and sleep disturbances. Such people should wear masks, continue preventive therapies and consider vaccinations for flu and pneumonia after consulting a doctor,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/aqi-poor-for-3-days-health-dept-says-stay-indoors/articleshow/87443164.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Lucknow||Will you apologise for firing at Ram bhakts: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to SP||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday mounted a fresh attack on Samajwadi Party, asking if it would apologise to Hindus for firing at hundreds of kar sevaks in Ayodhya on November 2, 1990, reports Pankaj Shah. Terming the Opposition, particularly Samajwadi Party leaders as “Ram Drohis and poshak of aatankwad (betrayers of Ram who nurture terror)”, Yogi said, “kabhi kabhi to inke kritya dekh ke girgit bhi sharma jayega (even chameleons will be ashamed by their acts).” ‘Current leadership strives for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ Now, they are in the dock. What we would say about Ramjanmabhoomi was upheld by the Supreme Court. The same people will soon disguise themselves as followers of Ram. They will peddle lies and raise misleading slogans to woo people,” he said, while speaking at ‘Samijik Pratinidhi Sammelan’ hosted by BJP. Yogi said, people should have “faith” in the current national leadership which strives for “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India)”. Emphasising that the nation’s image improved dramatically after 2014 when BJP came to power at the Centre, Yogi hit out at previous UPA over multiple scams and leaving the country in “anarchy”. “Except during tenures of former PM and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, no one wanted to discuss ‘Bharat’ and ‘Bharatiyata’ between 1947 and 2014,” he said, asserting even the poor, farmers, traders, youth and women were never the priority of previous governments. “It was only the notion of ‘My Family’ which assumed prominence at the national and state level,” he said in a veiled attack on Congress. “These people constructed big ‘havelis’ (mansions) for themselves, but did not bother about the poor,” Yogi said. “It is only under PM Modi that 3crore poor got houses and 8 crore people received free gas connection,” he said, accusing Congress of indulging in LPG black marketing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-you-apologise-for-firing-at-ram-bhakts-uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath-to-sp/articleshow/87448336.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Business||Finmin issues uniform bank staff norms for accountability||NEW DELHI: In an attempt to protect the people taking bona fide business decisions, the finance ministry has issued a uniform staff accountability framework for non-performing asset (NPA) accounts up to Rs 50 crore. These guidelines shall be implemented with effect from April 1, for accounts turning NPAs beginning next financial year. Banks have been advised to revise their staff accountability policies based on these broad guidelines and frame the procedures with approval of respective boards, it said. The IBA, being a key stakeholder of the framework, was involved in the process. These guidelines will help quell apprehension that bankers could be hauled up if their bona fide commercial decision go wrong. It will also help bankers to take credit decisions faster. Stressing that the new guidelines will surely boost the morale of PSBs employees, it said banks will have to complete staff accountability exercise within six months from the date of classification of the account as NPA. Further, it said that depending on the business size of the banks, threshold limits have been advised for scrutiny of the accountability by the chief vigilance officer (CVO). Track record of officials in appraisal or sanctionwill also be given due weightage, it added. “At present, banks are following different procedures for staff accountability exercise. Also, staff accountability exercise is being carried out in respect of all accounts that turn into NPA. “This approach not only adversely affects staff morale but also puts a huge strain on the bank’s resources,” it said. While punitive action needs to be taken against the officers having malafide intent, it is essential to ensure that bona fide mistakes are dealt with compassion, IBA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finmin-issues-uniform-bank-staff-norms-for-accountability/articleshow/87447440.cms||---

Palicha said quick-commerce or Q-commerce is a big opportunity. China has a number of players in the segment, as does Europe, including UK-based Dija, founded by former Deliveroo employees, Germany's Gorillas and Flink, and France's Cajoo. Zepto is expanding across Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi-NCR and will be launching in Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata over the next month. It has its tech office in Bengaluru and operations in Mumbai. Zepto has hired senior leaders from Flipkart, Uber, Dream11, Pharmeasy, and Pepperfry. Zepto is also hiring for roles across engineering, operations, marketing, and finance. Palicha said they are seeing a 200% growth month-on-month, with a monthly retention rate of 78%. “We want to provide a frictionless delivery experience. Our median delivery time is 8 mins 47 seconds. The magic of the model is how we pack and dispatch goods in under 60 seconds. The last mile is like any other delivery model,” he said. The venture operates on a hub-and-spoke model through a network of dark stores or retail distribution centres that caters exclusively to online shopping. Vohra, who is CTO, said, “The data speaks for itself – once we started delivering in 10 minutes, our NPS (net promoter score) shot up and has constantly remained at around 85, with a 50% week-on-week user retention rate, which shows the incredibly strong customer love for our product.” "Quick e-commerce is poised to transform how many shop around the world. Zepto has emerged as a leader in India, with exponential growth and best-in-class execution," said Paul Hudson, CIO at Glade Brook Capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/10-min-delivery-startup-zepto-raises-60-million/articleshow/87448546.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
