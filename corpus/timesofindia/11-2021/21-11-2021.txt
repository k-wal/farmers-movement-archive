Union home minister Amit Shah was present at the meet too. The PM arrived at 9.35 am and addressed the state police chiefs and heads of central armed paramilitary forces for over 90 minutes. Thereafter, presentations were made on counter-insurgency operations, Darknet and drugs trafficking. Other key issues, including the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and its ramifications for India, were discussed too. Modi interacted with police chiefs from across India during high tea and lunch, which insiders say was the longest time spent by him at any police establishment. The PM was shown in a presentation of UP Police's achievements since 2017 when BJP came to office in the state. On Sunday, Modi will take part in deliberations on the final day of the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-spends-12-hours-at-dgp-ig-conference/articleshow/87823635.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Russia has not yet decided what it intends to do with the troops it has amassed near Ukraine, US officials said, but the buildup is being taken seriously and the United States is not assuming it is a bluff. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, traveled to Brussels this week to brief NATO ambassadors about US intelligence on the situation and a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Haines’ trip was long planned and covered a variety of issues, but the growing concerns over Russia were among the short-term threats discussed, according to officials briefed on them. The United States has also been sharing intelligence with Ukraine. And on Friday, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with Lt Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s military, to discuss Russia’s “concerning activity in the area,” the Joint Staff said in a statement. US and British intelligence are increasingly convinced that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is considering military action to take control of a larger swath of Ukraine or to destabilise the country enough to usher in a more pro-Russia government. US and allied officials sounded an alarm in April, as Russia built up forces near its border with Ukraine. But the current buildup, which appears to involve more troops and sophisticated weaponry, has engendered more concerns — particularly as Russia has moved to jam Ukrainian surveillance drones. Hostilities have also spiked since Ukraine used one of its drones to attack a separatist howitzer, prompting Russia to scramble jets. “It’s not inevitable that there’s going to be an increase of kinetic conflict, but all the pieces are in place,” said Ben Hodges, the former top US Army commander in Europe now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. “If we, the West, look like we are not cohesive and ready to work together, then the risk of the Kremlin making a terrible miscalculation goes up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-warns-allies-of-possible-russian-incursion-as-troops-amass-near-ukraine/articleshow/87823772.cms||---
---||India||In Pakistan, Sidhu calls Imran 'bada bhai', draws flak||NEW DELHI: Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was embroiled in a controversy over his purported remarks about Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan after he crossed the Kartarpur Corridor to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur Sahib town on Saturday afternoon. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians, who also tweeted a video, fiercely objected to Sidhu apparently describing the Pakistani cricketer-politician as his ‘elder brother’ while talking to the chief executive officer of the Kartarpur Corridor Project Management Unit Muhammad Latif. The party targeted Sidhu and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and also raised the issue of Sidhu hugging Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa during his visit to Pakistan for Imran’s swearing-in ceremony in August 2018. During an interaction with the media later, Sidhu was very clear that he had nothing to say. “Let BJP say whatever it wants,” the Punjab PCC president said. Sidhu’s short visit via the 4.5-km visa-free corridor had already led to speculation of a rift between Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi as the PCC chief was not included in the delegation that accompanied the Punjab CM to Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara on November 18. Highlighting the immense trade potential between Indian and Pakistan during his interaction with the media, Sidhu said this could guarantee economic prosperity for both the countries. Sidhu recalls Vajpayee bus visit to Pakistan“I request that if you want to change lives in Punjab, we should open the borders (for cross-border trade). Why should we go through Mundra Port, a total of 2,100 km? Why not from here, where it's only 21 km (between Amritsar and Lahore),” he said. “When Karachi-Mumbai route can be opened for the rich, why can’t the Lahore-Amritsar route be opened for common Punjabis? Why shouldn’t the whole of Punjab not visit Nankana Sahib? Why should tourism not be promoted?” Sidhu questioned as he promoted religious and medical tourism between the two neighbours. He recalled the visit of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Pakistan on a bus and said that it had opened a passage of love and peace between two nations. He said spiritual, religious, and medical tourism had the capacity to change the destinies of nations. Sidhu also talked about the opening Hindu temples in Pakistan. “If the life of Punjab has to change then trade and medical tourism has to begin,” he said and praised Imran as “an intellectual that would think about these issues”. Once both Punjabs start trading, they would achieve prosperity in no time, he said. “If this happens, both Punjabs, and both nations will progress within six months as much as they should have in 60 years. It’s a golden opportunity to change the lives of people. I request Modi Sahab & Khan Sahab to open the doors. Trade has a $275,000 crore potential,” Sidhu explained. Accompanied by senior Congress leaders and ministers, including Pargat Singh, Aruna Chaudhary, Mohinder Singh KP, Kulbir Singh Zira, and Amit Vij, Sidhu also gave an example of the European Union as he advised people to take lessons from history. Innumerable lives, he said during his press meet at Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, a video of which he uploaded on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, were lost during war between European countries. “But when war ended, these countries not only opened their borders on single visa but also introduced a single currency Euro which is one of the strongest now,” he said.

The CBI said that there is sufficient evidence against the trio of committing the offence of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy in connection with the alleged suicide of the Mahant, who was found hanging in his ashram in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj in September. Apart from Anand, Adya Prasad Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari were also named in the chargesheet. All three had been named in the suicide note, who accused them of mentally harassing him. Chief judicial magistrate Harendra Nath took cognizance of the chargesheet, saying that sufficient ground for taking cognizance are available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cbi-chargesheet-against-three-in-giri-death-case/articleshow/87824904.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Arrested in March, Naresh Gaur (31), is the first among the ten accused to be granted bail in the case. The NIA had accused him of providing SIM cards to a co-accused and was alleged to be a part of the conspiracy. The court, however, stayed the bail order for 25 days after the prosecution moved a plea, saying it wanted to challenge the order before the high court. Gaur will not be released just yet.

The dirt track has been riddled with potholes and puddles for weeks now, forcing walkers to hop around them and motorists to drive haphazardly. It is the only major approach road, not only to the apartment complex with over 1,000 flats but also Gangammana Gudi police station and several other residential pockets such as Kuvempunagar, Jalahalli East and Naidu Layout. The residents have tried everything from approaching the former corporator and BBMP chief commissioner to flooding the civic body’s Sahaaya app with complaints. Some have used social media to highlight their woes, but nothing has worked. Shreejit Nair, a resident of the apartment complex, said, “Thousands of vehicles use this road daily. How hard is it to fix a stretch of 100m? Why have they taken over three years? At this point, we don’t even expect BBMP to asphalt the stretch. All we request them is to even it out.” Many residents pointed out that the number of people skidding on the stretch has gone up since monsoon set in, especially at night as there is no streetlight. “Its condition has worsened over the last three years. The corporator had seen the stretch and even promised to have it fixed at the earliest,” Nair said. The road connects Gangammana Gudi police station to Kuvempunagar. If people take a detour to avoid it, they have to travel more than 1.5km. Unni Krishnan Menon, another resident, said, “The state of the road is so bad that auto and cab drivers refuse to come all the way to our apartment. Now that schools have started offline, even their bus drivers refuse to come to the gate.” Meanwhile, maids who often set out to work early in the day are complaining to their employers about how they are finding it difficult to cross the stretch, especially when it rains.  Swayam Prabha Nair, who has had more than one mishap on the road, said, “As recently as Tuesday evening, I lost balance on this stretch and a passer-by had to help me. Many such incidents have happened.” Ward-level executive engineer Mohan Das said the road is the responsibility of the major roads department. However, Shivakumar, executive engineer of major roads, doubted this and said he would check and revert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-yrs-on-jalahalli-residents-wait-to-get-100m-pothole-riddled-rd-fixed/articleshow/87825006.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||CCTV footage helps Bengaluru cops crack theft cases||BENGALURU: “Have full knowledge of suspects with criminal antecedents living in your jurisdiction and monitor them.” This is what senior police officers tell cops on the field every now and then. Though such suggestions sometimes fall on deaf ears, they seem to have worked in two cases. Three mobile phone thieves were caught within eight hours of case registration while another thief was nabbed less than a day after a complaint was filed. Police patrol staff and CCTV footage played vital roles in both cases. The first case was reported in the morning of November 19 when a youth filed a complaint saying his mobile phone, kept on the wall of an under-construction building in RR Nagar, was stolen on November 16. Inspector M Shivanna and his staff started studying CCTV footage and scanning old-time offenders living in and around RR Nagar. By 6pm, prime suspect, Kiran Kumar from Channasandra, was detained. He confessed to the crime and also led cops to two aides — Chetan Kumar of Talaghattapura and Darshan of Sunkadakatte. From them, cops recovered 21 mobile phones stolen in the past couple of months. The trio, all in their early 20s, allegedly stole mobile phones from labourers living in makeshift sheds, truck drivers sleeping in their vehicles and people working at construction sites. Sources said Kiran was earlier arrested for burglary and CCTV footage showed him and two others roaming near the under-construction building. In the second incident, a woman forgot her bag in the car that was parked outside her Chandra Layout residence on Thursday. The bag had 103g of gold ornaments worth Rs 4.6 lakh. Late at night, she remembered and checked her car, only to find the bag missing. She lodged a police complaint on Friday. Close examination of CCTV footage by inspector Manoj Hoovale and team threw up a vague picture of the suspect — a lean middle-aged man. The team then studied the list of suspects living in that jurisdiction. On Saturday morning, cops arrived at the doorstep of Nayaz Pasha, 50, a resident of Chandra Layout. “Pasha is an old-time offender facing theft charges. CCTV footage showed a man walking near the car a couple of times on Thursday night and then fleeing with the bag,” an officer said. ‘Instal cameras’ DCP (west) Saneev M Patil urged citizens to instal “as many CCTV cameras as possible” in their neighbourhoods. “CCTV footage helped crack these two cases swiftly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cctv-footage-helps-cops-crack-theft-cases/articleshow/87825007.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Rain effect: Power demand hits all-time low in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Karnataka has posted its steepest-ever decline in power consumption during winter, thanks to untimely rains this year. Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (KPTCL) data show demand for power on Wednesday morning (November 17) was 4,558MW. Officials from KPTCL’s load dispatch centre say this is an all-time low. The demand rose to 6,428MW on Saturday at 4.30 pm. Normally, in mid-November when dry weather prevails, the state’s average daily power consumption is 9,500MW. “The low demand is mainly because of low consumption by irrigation pumpsets. Industries are also consuming relatively less power, while domestic and commercial consumption remains normal,” said BR Chandrashekhar, KPTCL director (transmission). But domain experts say low power consumption is not good news since it reflects sluggishness of the farm sector and slow recovery by the industrial sector from pandemic-induced lockdowns. With 30.6 lakh irrigation pumpsets installed in the state, the agricultural sector consumes about 4,000MW in November as farmers harvest crops grown in the kharif season (June-September) and start sowing for the rabi season (October-January). However, daily power consumption barely crossed 300MW between November 1 and 19. “It clearly shows agricultural activities have come to a standstill because of unseasonal rain. Framers could neither harvest nor sow, and this will lead to an unprecedented crisis this year. If the rains continue for another fortnight or so, the impact will be more severe than that of the harshest drought situation,” said GC Bayya Reddy, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha. As for industries, the sector normally consumes 5,000MW at its peak. Actual consumption on Friday was around 3,000MW. “Industries cumulatively are estimated to have resumed 60% of their normal productivity. It takes time for them to consume power at normal levels,” said S Sampatharaman, chairman, All-India Manufacturers’ Organisation, Karnataka board. Only domestic consumption (around 1,500MW) and commercial consumption (around 1,000MW) are at their normal level, KPTCL officials say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rain-effect-power-demand-hits-all-time-low/articleshow/87825008.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||One more app-based cab operator in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Another app-based taxi operator — DRIFE — was launched in the city on Saturday. Said to be the first blockchain-based ride-hailing platform, DRIFE started a pilot project. “With DRIFE, there are no surge prices, no commission fees taken from drivers. It is a true marketplace where fare is dictated by the community of riders and drivers,” said a release. Firdosh Sheikh, CEO and co-founder of DRIFE, said, “It is built to end low wages and high demand for drivers. When 100% of profits go to drivers, costs can be slashed and riders also stand to pay less for a high-quality experience.” “For years, blockchain and crypto have been inaccessible to a majority, but now people can take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology with market-dictated pricing, allowing for cryptocurrency to pay for everyday service. This will ensure transparency that the traditional ride-hailing industry doesn’t have,” Sheikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/one-more-app-based-cab-operator-in-city/articleshow/87825009.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No proof of conspiracy: Bombay HC in Aryan Khan's bail order||MUMBAI: WhatsApp chats extracted from the mobile phone of Aryan Khan disclose "nothing objectionable" nor is there any evidence to show he and his friend Arbaaz Merchant or Munmun Dhamecha and other co-accused had hatched any conspiracy to commit drug offences, and they had already been behind bars for 25 days, said the Bombay high court in its reasoned order, made available on Saturday, while granting them bail on October 28. "Applicants were not even subjected to medical examination so as to determine whether at the relevant time, they had consumed drugs," said Justice Nitin Sambre, whose reasons for giving bail came a month after special NDPS judge V V Patil at the sessions court had found the same chats showing "reference to bulk quantity and hard drugs". It is not in dispute that Khan (23), son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, was not found in possession of any drug, said the HC's reasoned order. Nor is it in dispute that the quantity of drugs allegedly seized from Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, to whom too the HC granted bail, “is small quantity,” the order said. NCB had arrested the trio on October 3 following its October 2 raid. They were sent to judicial custody on October 7. The NCB had said it seized 6 grams of charas from Merchant at the terminal gate. Merchant, the NCB said, planned to smoke it on the cruise and he was travelling with Khan, hence it was in Khan’s conscious possession, while 5 grams of hashish was seized from Dhamecha’s cabin on the ship. Khan was invited as a guest on the cruise by the event organiser. The HC said, “Even if it is appreciated, the maximum punishment prescribed is not more than one year for such offence. Applicants have already suffered incarceration for almost 25 days.” The HC issued the bail conditions and set the bond amount on October 29. The HC said it is “required to be sensitive to the fact that there has to be presence of basic material in the form of evidence so as to substantiate the case of conspiracy against the applicants”. Merely because the applicants were travelling on the cruise, “that by itself can’t be termed satisfying foundation for invoking provisions of Section 29 (conspiracy) against the trio,” the HC reasoned. It rejected the NCB’s submissions made through additional solicitor general Anil Singh that there was conspiracy and since “cumulatively commercial quantity of drugs was seized from the accused persons”, the “intention” of the trio to commit offences under NDPS Act should be considered and bail denied. Khan’s counsel — Mukul Rohatgi, Amit Desai and Satish Maneshinde — and Merchant’s counsel, Desai and Taraq Sayed, had argued that for an offence of conspiracy, there has to first be a consensus via “meeting of minds” before the act is committed, and here there was none. The ASG had said conspiracies are difficult to prove at the bail stage. None of them have any criminal antecedents, the order said. Dhamecha’s lawyer Ali Kaashif Khan argued she too was invited as a guest. Justice Sambre said to infer an act of conspiracy on part of the trio with other coaccused in the case, “There has to be positive evidence about such an agreement to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means and such agreement must precede with meeting of minds.” His order noted, “There is absence of material on record of them having such meeting of minds with other accused who were named in the offence in question.” There is “hardly any positive evidence to convince this court that all accused with common intention agreed to commit unlawful act”, said the order, “Rather the probe carried out till this date suggests that (Aryan and Arbaaz) were travelling independent of (Dhamecha) and there was no meeting of minds.” “There is no material on record to infer that applicants have hatched conspiracy” to commit a drug offence, hence it is difficult to infer at this stage that they are involved in an offence of commercial quantity, hence a stringent provision like Section 37 which places greater checks on courts before granting bail “would prima facie not be attracted to the case at hand”. “It is difficult to infer that applicants are involved in an offence of commercial quantity,” said Justice Sambre. He said “confessional statements” recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act can be considered only for probe purpose and “can’t be used as a tool for drawing inference that the applicants have committed an offence under the Act”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-proof-of-conspiracy-hc-in-aryan-bail-order/articleshow/87825010.cms||Swati Deshpande

On the sidelines of Jan Swaraj rally in Kalaburagi, Jnanendra said Sriki was first arrested and released in 2018 when the Congress was in power. “We (BJP government) arrested him again in a drug case and exposed his other crimes. Instead of giving credit to us, the Congress is making wild allegations to save their skin,’’ the home minister claimed, adding probe has been progressing impartially. Taking a dig at KPCC spokesperson Priyank Kharge, he said: “He was the IT/BT minister in the Congress government then and he would have had all information about the hacker. Why did he (Kharge) not get him arrested then?” Countering the criticism made by former CM HD Kumaraswamy on the Janaswaraj convention, Jnanendra quipped: “No politician can stand before the camera (media) twice a day like him (Kumaraswamy).” BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel blamed the Congress for making baseless charges against Jnanendra, who is “working hard to ensure law and order in the state”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sriki-supplied-drugs-to-sons-of-congress-leaders-hm/articleshow/87825011.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka’s health helpline averted 2,062 suicides in eight years||BENGALURU: Arogya Sahayavani 104, the state government’s health helpline, handled 42.6 lakh calls pertaining to mental health issues since its inception in 2013, preventing 2,062 suicides and providing counselling in nearly 7,000 cases of depression. Mental health issues accounted for 1.8% of 2.3 crore calls received by the toll-free helpline. “Out of 100 valid calls, at least two will be related to mental health issues, including suicide,” said health department officials. The number of calls seeking help for depression and suicidal thoughts have gradually reduced. Per week, the helpline gets around three genuine calls pertaining to suicidal thoughts. In 2013, 13 suicides were averted, which increased to 491 in 2019 but dipped to 173 in 2020. In 2021, there have been 120 such cases. The experience is not the same at Bengaluru’s other suicide-prevention helplines. SAHAI suicide prevention helpline run by the Medico-Pastoral Association (MPA), receives 10-15 genuine calls every day and the number crossed 20 on a few days at the height of the pandemic. Sa-mudra Yuva helpline gets nearly 25 calls a day. While not all are from those taking the extreme step, depressed callers admit to having suicidal thoughts, say counsellors. What ails the helplines most are nuisance calls and high attrition rate of staffers. According to data with Arogya Sahayavani, a majority of the callers are aged 15-24. The helpline has prevented 1,156 persons of this age group from taking the extreme step, officers said. Though psychiatrists say no specific reason can be attributed to suicide, the helpline has categorised the top four reasons as love failure, family problems, career guidance and emotional issues. Bharathi Singh, founder and managing trustee of Sa-mudra Yuva helpline that began in 2008, says her objective was to provide free counselling to youngsters to guide them in career, emotional and anxiety issues. “The callers are given love and comfort and a patient hearing. We try to find out what their support system is, and if they have parents, friends, colleagues or elders around and what has been their coping system. We do not judge the callers and don’t necessarily sympathise with them,” says Dr Singh. The helpline has got calls from as far as Dubai and Australia too. Calls to the helplines increased during the pandemic. “A majority were related to job loss, youngsters struggling within the confines of home during the lockdown, stress due to virus fear and lack of joy,” says Aneesh Thomas, co-ordinator and counsellor at SAHAI helpline. While most callers are those who seek help when they feel depressed, the helpline has also got calls from those who were just a step away from self harm. Each genuine call takes 30-45 minutes and there are follow-ups too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/states-health-helpline-averted-2062-suicides-in-eight-years/articleshow/87825012.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||MLC elections: Gaining majority a tough task for BJP in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The upcoming MLC elections from local bodies provide an opportunity to the ruling BJP to secure a complete majority in the upper house. However, some party functionaries admit it’s a daunting task given the serious challenges on the ground. Of the 25 seats going to polls on December 30, BJP has to win at least 13 to get the magic number of 38 in the 75-member house. Though it has a strength of 32, six legislators will be retiring (in January 2022) and reducing it to 26. While BJP has allegedly had an understanding with Congress, leaving five seats to opposition party candidates in five constituencies with dual membership — Dharwad, Belagavi, Mysuru-Chamarajanagar, Udupi-Dakshina Kananada, and Vijayapura-Bagalkot — it won’t be a cakewalk for the party in the remaining 20 seats from where it plans to contest. “We are sure of gaining a simple majority in the upper house this time, with the situation clearly in favour of BJP. That said, we can’t afford to be complacent, especially considering the complexities of the electorate,” said BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath, who is retiring and likely to get the party ticket to seek re-election in Belagavi. It is crucial for BJP to achieve a majority in the legislative council for the passage of significant legislation, as it can’t always rely on the outside support of JD(S). For example, JD(S) helped the ruling party in passing land reform bills and farm laws but did not back the legislations such as anti-cow slaughter bill. With the elected members of urban and rural local bodies, barring those of zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat for which elections are yet to be conducted, from across 31 districts being voters in these elections, BJP is sweating it out to woo them. The Jan Swaraj Yatra launched on Thursday is also aimed at preparing the party for the MLC polls. Each district has about 3,500 voters, of which members of gram panchayats, who technically have no party affiliation, form a major chunk. For instance, there are 6,697 members across 498 GPs in Dharwad constituency, which has two MLC seats covering Haveri and Gadag districts as well, and only 858 from other local bodies, including city corporation, city municipal council, town municipal council and town panchayats. “Gram panchayat members’ votes are going to be crucial. Since there are a majority of Congress-backed GP members in almost all districts, it won’t be easy for BJP to get the required number of seats,” said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed, who is the likely candidate for the second seat from Dharwad. Congress had sprung a surprise by defeating BJP in 2015 MLC polls in its bastion Shivamogga. Similarly, JD(S) suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Congress in Hassan the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gaining-majority-a-tough-task-for-bjp/articleshow/87825013.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 56% BMTC bus stops have no shelters, commuters left out||BENGALURU: While BBMP builds shelters and BMTC runs buses, poor coordination between the two agencies has taken a toll on public transport users in the city. Statistics show around 56% of bus stops in the city have no shelters. BMTC records reveal there are 2,212 bus stops in BBMP jurisdiction. However, only 962 have shelters. Passengers waiting for buses at the remaining 1,250 bus stops, which lack roofs or seats, have to brave the scorching sun or rain. BMTC’s ridership was 33 lakh before Covid-19 which has reduced to 22 lakh now. The number of buses operated is only 5,300 compared to 5,600 earlier. Several proposals to set up bus shelters have remained on paper. Five years ago, BBMP had a proposal to construct shelters equipped with route maps, signage and street furniture but it was largely restricted to CBD areas. In many places, unofficial bus stops are under trees or turn out to be a parking place for cabs and autorickshaws. There are more than 8,000 such stops across the city. There are also complaints of BMTC buses stopping in the middle of the road, and not at designated stops. Shaheen Shasa, member of Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, said: “BBMP is responsible for shelters and BMTC is focusing only on bus operations, so there is no accountability. It’s a discomfort for a passenger to wait for buses at stops with umbrellas. Some buses leak during rain. In some places, there are too many bus shelters and passengers are confused about where exactly the bus stops.” BBMP officials said most shelters proposed to be constructed are under Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis but advertisers are keen on the ones in CBD areas where they get high visibility. BMTC officials said they sent to BBMP a list of places where shelters are required. Basavaraj Kabade, superintendent engineer (road infrastructure) and Srinivas ST, AEE (traffic engineering cell), were unavailable for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/56-bmtc-bus-stops-have-no-shelters-commuters-left-out/articleshow/87825014.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Book BBMP for bad roads: Bengaluru citizens to cops||BENGALURU: Innumerable potholes that cause accidents and waterlogging followed by traffic jams have pushed citizens to seek police action against BBMP for its “apathy and negligence”. The matter was discussed during an online police-public interaction on Saturday using Twitter hashtag #AskCPBlr. The hour-long interaction was led by police commissioner Kamal Pant. “When BBMP has failed to provide good roads, what action do police take to file cases against non-performing and corrupt officials? Isn’t road safety a concern for police?” asked a Bengalurean. In response, Pant said, “There are different authorities to act on this matter. Therefore, please take up this issue with any of those agencies. City traffic police are doing their best to keep roads safe under these circumstances.” Many others raised questions about increasing garbage heaps, muddy roads and junk vehicles found on pavements. Drawing the top cop’s attention to bus shelters located near traffic signals affecting vehicular movement, a Twitter user requested they be shifted. Pant said the matter will be taken up with BBMP officials and others concerned. Another citizen suggested that police pay more attention to manning and clearing traffic on busy roads instead of catching offenders and penalising them. Pant said, “We are doing everything to regulate traffic. However, for deliberate violation of traffic rules, police have no option but to impose fines. Otherwise, people won’t abide by the rules.” Don’t pay bribes: Top cop As in all police-public interactions, Pant faced the question on police seeking bribes from the public. His response: People shouldn’t pay bribes and report such instances immediately to senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-to-cops-book-bbmp-for-bad-roads/articleshow/87825015.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: ACB pegs fraud in BDA at Rs 100 crore||BENGALURU: The Anti-Corruption Bureau, which on Friday raided the BDA head office at Kumara Park, said it unearthed largescale irregularities and corruption by officials during acquisition and allotment of land in residential layouts. On the second day of raids, preliminary estimates pegged the fraud at over Rs 100 crore. A massive team of ACB sleuths swooped down on the BDA office after receiving information about the officials and touts indulging in corruption and forgery. “The seized documents show a BDA official and his staff fabricated papers to help a private person illegally acquire six sites in Kempegowda Layout, Arkavathy Layout and Vishweshwaraiah Layout. The sites are worth Rs 75 crore. This is just one of the many irregularities we stumbled upon,” an ACB official said. BDA commissioner Rajesh Gowda is yet to issue any statement on the raids and initial ACB findings. The sleuths alleged BDA officials allotted land measuring 1,800sqft, worth Rs 1.5 crore near Kengeri, to an individual on the basis of fake acquisition documents. Similarly, documents of another fake acquisition show 1,000sqft of land worth Rs 80 lakh at Kengeri Satellite Town was allotted to a private person. Further, 2,400sqft of land in Chandra Layout, worth around Rs 5 crore, was allotted using fake papers. Land worth around Rs 30 lakh, belonging to a beneficiary at Kempegowda Layout, was sold allegedly by BDA officials and others by producing fake documents. A similar allotment was made to a beneficiary at Vishweshwaraiah Layout. The land value was Rs 52 lakh. One beneficiary, who was allotted land in Arkavathy Layout, was given a plot in Kempegowda Layout without any reason, ACB officials said. In another case, land was allotted to a beneficiary in Anjanapura. It was encroached on and BDA officials, instead of acting against the encroacher, allotted a plot in another layout to the beneficiary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/acb-pegs-fraud-in-bda-at-100cr/articleshow/87825016.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Guard and wife flee with Rs 54 lakh from employer’s house||BENGALURU: A 47-year-old accountant from Kammanahalli, east Bengaluru, filed a complaint against a security guard and wife, who worked as domestic helps in his house, accusing them of fleeing with Rs 47 lakh and 170 grams of gold worth Rs 7 lakh on November 15. Krishna and Janaki had been working in Sridhar’s house for two months and were provided with accommodation on the premises. Last month, Sridhar had got the guard released from the custody of Gangammanagudi police, who suspected he was involved in a theft. He said the guard was innocent. Sridhar said Monday’s theft happened when he left home around 9am to attend a wedding ceremony at Palace Grounds. His wife, along with their two children, had gone to Whitefield to attend an engagement ceremony. Janaki asked Sridhar’s wife not to lock the house as there was work to be finished. The family thus left home without locking the door. The theft came to light at 1.45pm when Sridhar returned to his house. He found the bedroom’s doorlock broken and cash and gold stolen. Krishna and Janaki were missing. Police warning ignoredSources said Gangammanagui police from north Bengaluru had picked up Krishna a month ago in connection with a theft case. However, Sridhar insisted Krishna was innocent and cops released him. Police, however, asked Sridhar to be careful because Krishna, they said, was in the company of thieves who’d committed offences in Bengaluru. They suggested Sridhar hire someone else as his security guard. “But Sridhar ignored our warning and lost money and valuables,” an officer said. Banaswadi police have formed three teams to trace the couple and sent them to Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/guard-and-wife-flee-with-54l-from-employers-house/articleshow/87825017.cms||---

Before Savita could enter, Manjunath drove away. Savita fell on the road and sustained injuries to her hands, legs and elsewhere,” police said. Savita was boarding the bus from the front door, which is close to the driver’s seat. “Manjunath could directly see passengers boarding and deboarding.

---||India||Farm unions may write to govt for talks on MSP||NEW DELHI: Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the joint platform of farm unions spearheading the protests, may write to the government seeking resumption of talks on pending demands, mainly a legal guarantee for procurement of all crops at minimum support price (MSP), even as planned protests, including a daily tractor march to Parliament from November 29, are scheduled to go on. "We discussed the issue of writing to the government to resume talks. There is more or less consensus among farmer unions' coordination committee as we want to press for our pending demands," said a farmer leader after the meeting. A final call on this will, however, be taken in a larger meeting of all unions’ representatives on Sunday,” said the leader. He added let the SKM formally announce it at an appropriate time, possibly on Sunday. The tractor journey to Parliament is to go on till the new farm laws are repealed as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Asked about the rationale behind talks when the PM has already announced the decision to repeal the contentious farm laws and to form a committee to look into issues relating to MSP, another farmer leader said any such panel without representation of farmers’ unions, which have been agitating, would be meaningless and that’s why the SKM would like to resume talks with the government to press for its point of views on the critical issue. “Our programmes for November 22 (Lucknow Mahapanchayat), November 26 (observing one year of agitation along Delhi borders) and November 29 (start of daily tractor march to Parliament during winter session) will continue as usual. Our other issues, especially legal guarantee to MSP, withdrawal of cases against us, rollback of Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 and certain provisions of the air quality law (mainly provision of fines for stubble burning), and allotment of a site for setting up a memorial for our friends who died, are pending,” said Darshan Pal, SKM leader. “We hope the government calls a meeting to resolve the issues,” he said after the meeting of the SKM's coordination committee that also demanded compensation for the kin of 670 farmers who died during the stirs. It is learnt that the SKM will on Sunday decide on the next course of action, including formats of protests in different states over the issue of MSP. The SKM had earlier this month announced that 500 farmers would participate in the peaceful tractor march to Parliament every day during the winter session, beginning November 29. The session will continue till December 23. “The tractor march will be organised as scheduled and therefore there is no point in leaving protest sites along Delhi borders till then...,” said P Krishnaprasad of All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS). The SKM demanded that junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra be arrested over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farm-unions-may-write-to-govt-for-talks-on-msp/articleshow/87825059.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It has expanded its list of WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccines that will be accepted for travel to and within Canada from the moth-end by adding Sinopharm (also referred to as Covilo), Sinovac (also referred to as Coronavac) and the made-in-India Covaxin. Travellers will qualify as fully vaccinated if they have received at least two doses of a government of Canada-accepted Covid-19 vaccine or a mix of two accepted vaccines, or at least one dose of Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine, at least 14 full days prior to entering Canada. A leading travel agent said given the vastly improved Covid situation in India, all eyes are now on when Canada allows direct flights from more Indian cities. Currently only fully-vaccinated travellers who get a test done at Delhi Airport lab are allowed to board direct flights from IGI Airport. Travellers also keenly await for Canada to remove the requirement of a person flying from India to Canada via a third country requiring a negative report from a Covid test done in that transit country. "Once these two restrictions are removed, we can expect travel - and fares - to resume to near normalcy. Today any person eligible to travel from India to Canada has to do so via Delhi," the travel agent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/canada-set-to-recognise-covaxin-from-nov-30/articleshow/87825093.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Talking to reporters, BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha also urged the central government to accord the status of martyrs to the farmers who died during the agitation. He claimed that around 700 farmers died during the agitation. Jha said the process to repeal the farm bills should start immediately, otherwise it would prove another ‘jumla’ like “promises to provide jobs to youths and Rs15 lakh in every citizen's bank account”. He alleged that the central government under PM Modi has lost people’s faith due to hollow promises. “That’s why the agitating farmers have not returned home despite the PM’s announcement to repeal the bills,” he said. Jha, however, credited former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for forcing the PM to make the announcement. The opposition and the farmers' groups kept the issue alive under the able leadership of Rahul Gandhi, he claimed. He further said the Congress held ‘kisan satyagrah’ in 36 districts in the state as a mark of protest over the controversial farm bills. The Congress leaders present at the press conference said the people who had described the farmers as ‘terrorists’ and ‘anti-nationals’ should publicly apologise for their remarks. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra was also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/withdraw-cases-lodged-against-farmers-during-agitation-congress/articleshow/87822623.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Retired ASI booked for possessing 62 case files||PATNA: Many criminals cases are pending for disposal because the investigation officer superannuated without handing over the files to any officer. An assistant sub-inspector of state police, Shrivansh Jha, has been booked in one such case related to SC/ST Act in which the victim could not be provided compensation because he superannuated in December 2019 without handing over the file to any other officer. In fact, Jha has been in physical possession of the files related to at least 62 criminal cases for almost two years. Jha was booked in an FIR registered with Mithanpura police station in Muzaffarpur on Friday. All the 62 criminal cases are of Mithapura police station where he was posted for a brief period before getting transferred to the Town police station of Muzaffarpur from where he superannuated. The FIR was lodged against Jha on the directions of ADG, CID (weaker section), Anil Kishore Yadav, after he found during case reviews that an SC/ST Act case was pending for disposal for a long time as Jha had not handed over its charge to any other officer. Then it was revealed that Jha was in possession of files related to more than 62 cases. Town police station SHO Om Prakash said he had heard about Jha’s reputation of not giving charge or case files. “It is due to this reason that I didn’t make him investigating officer of even a single case during his posting here. I knew his retirement was within two months that time,” Prakash said. Muzaffarpur Town SDPO Ram Naresh Paswan said Jha was sent messages through official channels on several occasions after his retirement for handing over the files and charge of cases. “All these case documents are government property. Thus, if a government servant doesn’t hand over such papers, it amounts to criminal act attracting Section 409 of IPC. Such an act has imprisonment provision. Jha still has possession of files of all such cases,” he said. The SDPO said a special messenger was sent to his residence at Falka in Katihar asking him to hand over the files. “But he asked his son to tell the messenger that he was not present at home,” Paswan said. Mithanpura police station SHO Bhagirath Prasad said he had called Jha from his official cellphone, too. “Falka police station was also contacted to communicate Jha for returning the case files immediately, but nothing happened,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/retired-asi-booked-for-possessing-62-case-files/articleshow/87822538.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the blast was triggered around 12.50am on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday between Richughutta and Demu stations on the Barkakana-Garhwa route. Railway tracks on both Up and Dn lines were badly damaged, paralysing traffic movements. A relief train immediately reached the site from Barkakana while senior railway officials from Dhanbad rushed there with technical experts and safety staff to repair the damages, he said. Railways cancelled Dehri-on-Sone-Barwadih passenger train (03364) and Barwadih-Gomoh passenger train (03362) soon after the blast from safety point of view.

The arrested youths have been identified as Rahul Kumar (20) of NMCH IDH Colony and Vishal Kumar (20), who lives near Shitala Mata temple, both under Alamganj police station area in Patna City. Police said both are undergraduates. Patrakar Nagar police station SHO Manoranjan Bharti said Rahul was arrested near Maurya Hospital on Monday while his associate Vishal was nabbed after being lured to the same location on Monday morning. Bharti said police recovered from Rahul’s possession four cellphones looted near Dr Sarika Rai’s clinic, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Maurya Hospital and Patliputra Sports Complex in the last couple of days. “Police took Rahul’s help to arrest Vishal. It was Rahul who confessed that Vishal was his associate in cellphone snatching incidents,” he said. The SHO said their fathers are in private jobs. “Both confessed that they got addicted to brown sugar at least six months back. Their addiction increased to such a point that they started snatching cellphones to purchase brown sugar from the money realised from selling them,” he said. Bharti said the duo told the police that they used to sell looted cellphones worth around Rs40,000-50,000 each for just Rs 4,000-5,000 to different gangs. “They spent all money within a day or two on drug purchasing and fast food,” SHO said. He said police were now working to arrest the kingpin of drug supply as well as the gang involved in purchasing the looted cellphones from the duo. He said Rahul was forwarded to judicial custody after production before a court on Tuesday while Vishal would be produced on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-youths-arrested-in-phone-snatching-cases/articleshow/87143080.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Ghoghardiha police station SHO Gopal Krishna and SI Abhimanyu Sharma had allegedly assaulted the ADJ inside his chamber on Thursday. Later, the lawyers and court staff thrashed and kept them confined there till they were arrested in the night on the basis of an FIR lodged by the ADJ. However, both the policemen were sent to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment instead of forwarding them to jail. BJSA secretary Ajit Kumar Singh said the ADJ had apprehended this situation after knowing about the then Jhanjharpur SHO Chandra Mani’s threat to bash him up inside the chamber. “The ADJ had written to the SP on the matter in August this year. A committee was formed and prima facia the allegations were found to be true. The SHO was removed and attached to the police lines. The ADJ had sent a copy of his complaint to the DGP, too,” he said. “The police were biased against him,” he said and added: “The matter requires in-depth inquiry so that the other people behind the incident are also punished,” Singh said. Earlier, Bihar Police Association (BPA) president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh told the media that the ADJ had first abused and assaulted the two policemen and they reacted in self-defence. He also demanded that an FIR should be lodged against the judge and others on the SIs statements. The BPA and Bihar Police Men’s Association issued a joint press statement alleging that the ADJ, one Deepak Raj and others had assaulted the two SIs. The BJSA secretary said they were silent as the Patna high court had taken suo motu cognizance of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-nursed-grudge-against-adj-bjsa/articleshow/87822748.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Inaugurating a daylong workshop on ‘Implementation of New Procedures under Public Financial Management System’ organized by the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) at A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, the minister said, “Colleges should be encouraged to upload self-study reports to the designated websites to get themselves assessed and accredited by the NAAC. They will be entitled for development grants under the RUSA only when they get accredited.” Choudhary also claimed that the government was making efforts to improve the existing infrastructural facilities in colleges and universities, but “students are still not getting quality education”. “If the institutions are facing scarcity of teachers, they are free to appoint guest faculty members to ensure regular academic activities. The Bihar State University Service Commission has started making regular appointment of teachers in different universities and colleges,” he added. The minister called upon the teachers to do self-introspection and find whether they are giving their best. He said, “The education system is meant for the benefit of students. Hence, the entire exercise will be meaningless if their academic interests are ignored.” The additional chief secretary of the education department, Sanjay Kumar, and the vice-chairman of the BSHEC, Kameshwar Jha, also addressed the workshop that was attended by the registrars of different universities and principals of more than 60 colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-education-minister-urges-universities-to-get-naac-tag/articleshow/87822603.cms||B K Mishra

---||Chandigarh||No heed paid to demands, HP farm body warn of state-wide agitation||Shimla: Claiming that it played a key role in the defeat of BJP in the recently held byelections of Mandi parliamentary seat and Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seats, Himachal Pradesh-based Sanyukt Kisan Manch has warned of prolonged agitation if chief minister Jai Ram Thakur failed to invite them to discuss 15-point charter of demands submitted in August. Sanyukt Kisan Manch convener Harish Chauhan said farmers would devise their future strategy in coming days as important issues like minimum support price (MSP) and market intervention scheme (MIS) for apple on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir were still not addressed. While addressing mediapersons in Shimla on Saturday, Chauhan said the Manch, consisted of 24 organisations of Himachal, and was collectively taking up the burning issues confronting farmers but ironically the charter of demand had failed to attract any attention of the state government. He said it seemed that the state government wanted them to launch an agitation like one going on in Delhi. He said under MIS, support price of Rs 60-70 per kg for A grade apple, Rs 44 per kg for B grade apple and Rs 24 per kg for C grade apple should be provided. Despite facing defeat in the byelections, the BJP government was not ready to address the problems of farmers, he claimed. It had come to light that apple purchased from farmers at the rate of Rs 12 per kg was sold at Rs 196 to Rs 250 per kg in Bangalore, he alleged. People whose land was being acquired for the national highway projects in Mandi district were going to hold protest at Dharamshala during the winter session on December 14 and Manch would also join them, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-heed-paid-to-demands-hp-farm-body-warn-of-state-wide-agitation/articleshow/87823926.cms||---

The six engineers working with multinational firms were to attend their friend’s marriage function in the night. They were staying in Fortune hotel on RN Singh Road under the Kankarbagh police station area in Patna at around 8.30pm. The doctor, Shailendra Shekhar, was also arrested from Ginger hotel on Dak Bungalow roundabout. He was here for a job interview in AIIMS-Patna. These random raids in hotels are part of the drive to enforce prohibition after CM Nitish Kumar asked the state police not to spare those violating liquor ban. Kankarbagh police station SHO Ravishankar Kumar said the arrested engineers were identified as Rohit Kumar, working in Hyderabad, Kanchan Kumar and Anil Kumar working in New Delhi, Vinit Jaiswal and Anand Kumar in Kolkata and Vikash Kumar employed in Mumbai. Kumar said they were preparing their drinks to consume when the police raided their room. “None of them were in an inebriated state. Their breathalyser test was also negative,” he said. Kumar said one full bottle of smuggled IMFL of a costly brand and six disposable glasses were seized from their possession. “They would have been part of the baraat before their arrest in random checking of hotels,” he said. Kotwali police station SHO Sunil Kumar Singh said Shekhar is from Bhagalpur. “He had reached Patna on Friday,” he said. Singh said Shekhar was not in an inebriated state but an IMFL bottle with 10ml liquor in it was recovered from his possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-engineers-a-doctor-arrested-with-liquor/articleshow/87822934.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC notice to Centre over withdrawal of SEIS benefits||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to the central government in response to a petition filed by port operators, aggrieved by the authority’s decision to withdraw benefits extended on export of services for maritime transport for the year 2019-20 with retrospective effect. Gujarat Port Association, which is made up of minor port operators, has approached the high court challenging the director general of foreign trade’s (DGFT) notification issued on September 23, changing the foreign trade policy that has continued since 2015, with regard to the Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS). The scheme was aimed at encouraging and maximizing the export of notified services from India. In the 2015 foreign trade policy, the list of services, rates and conditions for rewards under SEIS was notified. The benefits were given since 2016. The petitioner’s advocate, Paritosh Gupta, submitted that members of the association provide various support services for maritime transport at multiple ports. They were eligible for benefits under SEIS under the trade policy. Even in a circular issued on March 31, 2020, the DGFT had extended the foreign trade policy till March 31, 2021. Since the rates were not revised, benefits were to flow according to those of the previous year, 2018-2019. Even after deciding to continue the policy till 2022 by way of notification in September 2021, the authority denied the benefits of SEIS with retrospective effect for 2019-2020. The new notification contained a list of eligible services but deleted support services for maritime transport. Moreover, the facility recognized in the scheme in respect of INR payment for services has been nullified, which has resulted in total denial of accrued SEIS benefits for services rendered and realised during 2019-20 and that too after more than a year. It was submitted that this curtailment in benefits is in violation of orders passed by the Supreme Court and various high courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-centre-over-withdrawal-of-seis-benefits/articleshow/87823446.cms||---

---||Delhi||With mercury, dengue cases in Delhi also go down||NEW DELHI: The worst of the dengue outbreak in Delhi may be over. The latest data from leading city hospitals, both public and private, suggests a nearly 50% reduction in new cases of the mosquito-borne disease over the past week. With the temperature falling, the numbers are likely to reduce further in the coming days. “Mosquitoes don’t survive in very low temperatures. That’s a big reason for the sharp reduction in new cases of dengue,” explained Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine, AIIMS. He, however, warned against any complacency and said emptying and drying water tanks, containers, coolers and plant pots on a regular basis and keeping all water containers covered was essential. At Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital, doctors reported seeing 80-90 patients daily in the OPD with dengue symptoms till a week ago. “Now, the number has reduced to less than 40 per day,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director. He added that the demand for dengue admissions had also reduced. Private hospitals like Apollo Indraprastha, Sir Ganga Ram and Max also said there was a significant reduction in dengue admissions. “Earlier, our medicine ward was full of dengue patients. There were 30-40 such patients admitted at any given time. Now, we have only eight to nine patients,” said Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram. This year, according to municipal corporations data, there were 5,277 dengue cases as on November 16, the highest incidence in the past five years. The number of confirmed deaths due to dengue was nine till last week. Recently, a resident doctor working at Lady Hardinge Medical College succumbed to the disease. According to health experts, the proportion of dengue patients reporting with severe symptoms was higher this year possibly due to the predominance of type II strain of the virus. Dengue virus strains are of four types. Type I causes classic dengue fever, type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, dengue III causes fever without shock and dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. A doctor at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences reported treating seven-eight patients suffering from acute liver failure after contracting dengue. A Lok Nayak doctor added, “We have a patient who has suffered serious brain damage due to dengue. He is currently on ventilator support.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-mercury-dengue-cases-also-go-down/articleshow/87824647.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Vijayawada||AP: Rains subside but flood misery endures in submerged Tirupati||TIRUPATI: Most areas in the temple city of Tirupati remained inundated with flood waters on Saturday though the intensity of the rains have come down in the last 24 hours. Continuous flow of water from the Seshachalam hill ranges into the water bodies and lakes in Tirupati led to flooding in several low-lying areas. With breaches reported at Peruru and Perumallapalli cheruvus, flood waters entered the colonies abutting Sri Padmavathi mahila viswa vidyalayam, MR Palli, Ullipatteda, Gayatri Nagar and other localities. The failure of the district administration in coming to the rescue of the people of Tirupati and other affected villages and towns in the district can be gauged by the fact that only 6,128 people have been moved to shelter zones across the district so far, when around one lakh people have been affected by the rains and subsequent floods in Chittoor alone. Around 40,000 locals remain confined to their homes in the temple city itself. Meanwhile, pilgrim footfall at the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala has dipped, with only 7,000 odd people visiting the temple for darshan on Saturday. Several devotees who booked their darshan and stay at Tirumala in advance have cancelled their trips due to the inclement weather. Nearly 15,000 devotees were stranded at Tirumala after the TTD sealed off the pedestrian routes and twin ghat roads leading and exiting Tirumala due to landslides and damage to the roads at several places. One of the ghat roads was reopened on Friday, helping most of those stranded to head back to their native towns. The ghat roads were reopened on Saturday and vehicular traffic resumed along both the routes. While the Srivari mettu pedestrian route has been severely damaged, some portions of an ancient mandapam at the Kapila Teertham temple caved in on Saturday. TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy said the estimated loss on account of damages to the temple body’s properties would be around Rs 4 crore. As per a preliminary government estimate, about 1,316 villages spread over 172 mandals in four districts have been affected by the rains and floods, out of which at least 21 villages were inundated. Officials estimate the damage to be around Rs 231 crore, which included damage to houses, cattle, poultry and crops. One helicopter each has been deployed in Anantapur and Kadapa districts to meet any eventuality. A total of nine SDRF and eight NDRF teams have also been positioned in the four districts to handle the crisis. The teams have so far rescued 64 persons and 15 buffaloes from the flood waters, and will stay there till the situation returns to normalcy. Meanwhile, the Somasila reservoir in Nellore district is receiving 3.6 lakh cusecs of flood water of which 3.32 lakh cusecs is being discharged. Mylavaram reservoir in Kadapa district is also receiving 1.6 lakh cusecs, and discharging 1.28 lakh cusecs. All five reservoirs in Nellore, six in Kadapa and four reservoirs in Chittoor are receiving heavy flood water and have reached full level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rains-subside-but-flood-misery-endures-in-submerged-tirupati/articleshow/87823362.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The deceased was identified as Ravi Kant Singh (28), a resident of Manausa village under the Sanjhauli police station area in the district. Sasaram DSP Vinod Rawat has confirmed the death. SHO of Sanjhauli police station, S A Ansari, said the Nokha police came to know about the incident on Saturday morning and sent the body for post-mortem to a local hospital. Police said some youths resorted to celebratory firing in an inebriated state at the function, killing Singh and injuring three more people, including a close relative of the groom. Singh, father of a six-month-old baby, succumbed to his injury on way to the hospital. Rakesh Kumar Singh, elder brother of the deceased, alleged that instead of taking legal action, police asked them to dispose of the body clandestinely. “We brought the body to our home, about 20km from the spot, and informed the local police,” he alleged. Nokha SHO Rajesh Kumar, however, denied the charge and said police were trying to identify the culprits and arrest them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-killed-three-injured-in-rohtas-celebratory-firing/articleshow/87822460.cms||Alok Chamaria

While the Class XII (Intermediate) examinations in arts, science and commerce streams will start on February 1, the Class X examinations shall commence on February 17. Releasing the datesheets of both the examinations on Saturday, BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said the Intermediate examinations will be held from February 1 to 14 and the matriculation examinations from February 17 to 24. The examinations shall be held in two shifts daily, from 9.30am to 12.45pm and from 1.45pm to 5.00pm. BSEB sources said writers would be provided to spastic, visually impaired and other physically disabled candidates who can’t write answers on their own. They will get additional 20 minutes per hour for writing the answers. While the actual examination will be of three hours in each shift, students will get a ‘cool off’ time of additional 15 minutes to read and analyse the questions and also to plan the answers accordingly. Examinees are not supposed to write answers of any question during the ‘cool off’ time, said the chairman. The practical examinations of Intermediate examinees shall be held between January 10 and 20. For matriculation examinees, the practical examinations will be held between January 20 and 22. The standard marks foil and award sheets of internal assessment in science subjects, and literacy activities and project works based on the course content of social science subjects will have to be submitted by the schools to the respective district education office latest by January 25, the sources said. The BSEB has already released the dummy admit cards for Class 10 board at biharboardonline.bihar.gov.in or biharboardonline.com. More than 16.5 lakh students had registered for the matriculation examination last year. The number is likely to increase marginally this year owing to ease in the pandemic situation. The BSEB has reportedly reduced the syllabus by 30% this year and half of the exam will feature multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To pass BSEB examinations (both Class 10 and 12), students need at least 33% marks in each subject and also in the overall examination. Those who fail to obtain the minimum passing marks in one or two subjects can improve their score by taking the compartmental exam. However, those who failed in more than two papers will have to repeat the year, according to the existing regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-board-intermediate-and-matric-exams-in-february/articleshow/87822503.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar last among 13 states in Swachh Survekshan ’21||PATNA: Bihar continued its “poor” performance in terms of urban sanitation in Swachh Survekshan 2021, the results of which were announced by the ministry of housing and urban affairs on Saturday. While Bihar was at the bottom of the list of 13 states with more than 100 urban local bodies (ULBs), the neighbouring Jharkhand was awarded for being at the top of 14 states having less than 100 ULBs. The performance of Patna also continued to remain “poor” as it was ranked 44 out of 48 cities with population of above 10 lakh. The overall rank of Patna out of 4,320 cities in the country was 945. The only saving grace for the state is that Munger and Patna are among the top five cities under the Ganga town category. Munger stood second out of total 97 cities in the country and Patna third in the Ganga town category. Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh topped in this category. However, Patna has made some improvements in the survey as its rank has gone up from bottom of the 47 cities in Swachh Survekshan, 2020 to 44 out of 48 cities this time. Even in Ganga town category, the state capital’s ranking has improved from 32 last year to third this time. Patna scored 2739.92 of 6,000 marks in the survey, which is 1187 points higher than the previous year’s score of 1,552. Though the total marks under Swachh Survekshan has remained the same, the number of evaluation categories been reduced from four last year to three this time. The cities were evaluated under four categories — direct observation, citizen feedback, service level progress and certification — last year. Each category had carried 1,500 marks. This year it was changed to three categories — citizens voice (1,800 marks), certification (1,800 marks) and service level progress (2,400 marks). As per a statement issued by Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), Patna secured the highest mark in the citizens voice category. The state capital got 1,341 out of 1,800 marks and secured 174th rank among 4,320 cities in this category. Altogether 4,77,849 people in the state had participated in the survey on sanitation in their respective ULBs, including 2,01,662 in Patna. In the category of ‘service level progress’, Patna’s marks increased from 105.16 in 2020 to 1,098 this time. Patna, in fact, got the highest mark in this category. The performance of Patna also improved in the ‘certification’ category. From nil last year, it got 300 marks this year in this category as it has been granted ODF (open defecation free)- plus certificate. Patna mayor Sita Sahu said the civic body has shown improvement by introducing various new sanitation activities, including removal of waste from all 75 wards, construction of compost pits and mass awareness drives. “While the PMC is working on developing the necessary infrastructure for improving the sanitation scenario in the city, residents too should inculcate clean habits in their day-to-day lives,” she said. Patna municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma also sought cooperation from all residents of the state capital for making the city cleaner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-last-among-13-states-in-swachh-survekshan-21/articleshow/87822672.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Patna||Sharp drop in temperature unlikely in Bihar before December: Met||PATNA: People will have to wait for the crisp weather till the end of this month as any significant drop in temperature is unlikely over the next 10 days, according to the weathermen. A nip in the air is being felt from the past couple of weeks with minimum temperature in the state capital hovering in the range of 14-16 degrees C. However, according to the weathermen, any sharp plunge in the mercury column is unlikely owing to absence of western disturbances, which aggravate winter conditions in north India. Partly cloudy or hazy skies were witnessed over Patna and many other places in the state on Saturday, but weathermen said skies would turn clear by Sunday. The clouds have been attributed to a depression over Andhra Pradesh coast, which reduced to a well-marked low-pressure area. According to a bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday, a cyclonic circulation – remnant of Friday’s depression which weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area and then further into a low-pressure area – lies over south interior Karnataka and neighbourhood. “The partly cloudy skies over Bihar on Saturday were due to peripheral impact of the low-pressure area. It is unlikely to cause any rainfall and is most likely to subside by Sunday. The clear skies are likely to lead to plunge in minimum temperature by a couple of notches,” said Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre. He added minimum temperature would hover in the range of 13-15 degrees C and maximum in the range of 26-28 degrees C over the next few days. “Though there has been a gradual drop in temperature, no western disturbance has hit the region, which could have had led to sharp plunge in temperature. Nonetheless, arrival of any western disturbance is unlikely by this month-end,” he said. The western disturbances are low-pressure area or extratropical storms originating from Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfalls in north-western Indian subcontinent. Private weather agency Skymet reported on Saturday that there has not been a single strong western disturbance in the hill states in north India after October 24, due to which there is no heavy snowfall. “During the next one week, we do not expect any good western disturbance which can give heavy snowfall. Hence, there will be a gradual decline in the temperature over north India,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sharp-drop-in-temp-unlikely-in-bihar-before-december-met/articleshow/87822576.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Kolkata||La Nina forecast adds to Kolkata pollution fear this winter||KOLKATA: The pollution level in the city may turn worse this winter than that in other years owing to the effects of La Nina, which is forecast to blow over east and north India between December 2021 and February 2022. La Nina, an oceanic and atmospheric phenomenon, the colder counterpart of El Niño, will make dispersal of suspended particulate matters in the air that much more difficult, leading to prolonged urban smog. Track the pollution level in your cityThere is an intricate relationship between La Nina and air pollution. With the second consecutive La Nina, the entire north India is going to face intense chilly weather this season. Meteorologists have forecast record low temperatures across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), with December expected to be colder than usual. A recent report by Bloomberg predicted temperatures in India may fall to as low as 3°C in some northern areas in January and February. With the temperature dropping — and other factors, like wind speed slowing down and haze setting in — the pollution level in Kolkata is bound to rise. “A sustained cloud cover and wind movement falling below 2m/second make a recipe for steady rise in pollution. Moreover, the transboundary movement of pollution is a great worry. We need to have mitigation measures for the entire region rather than just the city,” said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board. There is a prediction that La Nina is expected around December 2021-February 2022. This second consecutive La Nina event after 2020 may last till early spring of 2022. It transports cold air over the Indian subcontinent from Siberia and South China. A strong easterly current during La Nina pushes the water towards the west and cools the ocean surface, said climatologist Nairwita Bandyopadhyay.. Climate Trends, a strategic communications initiative with an overarching climate ambition and low carbon development, quoted experts on the long-term impact of La Nina on the ambient air quality of cities like Delhi, Lucknow and Kolkata. “There is a large probability of a second back-to-back La Nina that may result in extreme cold from December 2021-February 2022. The oceanic phenomenon is expected to peak during this period. Although there is no rule book, with El Niño-Southern Oscillation getting colder than earlier estimates, the confidence in this forecast has grown off late. But it should be noted the winter forecast is affected by other factors from other parts of the globe too,” said G P Sharma, president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather. Wintertime temperature inversions contribute to the build up of haze. Inversions occur when cold air gets trapped under a layer of warm air. Since the cold air cannot rise above the warm air, pollution builds in the cold air as long as the temperature inversion lasts. Warmer air near the surface rises, allowing pollutants to disperse in the atmosphere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/la-nina-forecast-adds-to-city-pollution-fear-this-winter/articleshow/87823302.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Patna||Continue transportation subsidy to Sitamarhi sugar cane farmers: Bihar CM||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Saturday said the transportation subsidy provided to the farmers of Sitamarhi district for carrying their sugar cane to other sugar mills than the closed Riga mill would continue for the current 2021-22 marketing year (October-September). Chairing a review meeting of the sugar cane industries department, Nitish asked the officials to continue the transportation subsidy like the previous year, so that the farmers of Sitamarhi do not face any inconvenience in transporting their canes to other sugar mills. “Last year, the state government decided to provide transportation subsidy to the sugar cane farmers of Sitamarhi after the management of their nearest Riga sugar mill announced that it would not be operating the mill due to some disputes with its workers. Consequently, the state government decided to compensate the extra transportation charges the farmers would bear in carrying their canes to the sugar mills in the neighbouring districts,” sugar cane industries minister Pramod Kumar told TOI over phone. “Three mills in neighbouring Gopalganj and East Champaran have been asked to purchase the sugar cane of Sitamarhi farmers,” a department official said. Nitish said his government has been consistently working for the betterment of sugar cane farmers and taken several steps for the their welfare since the financial year 2006-07. Nitish came to power in November 2005. The CM also said the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugar cane was increased several times in the previous years. The government also provided sugar cane price grants. The sugar cane industries were promoted to increase production in the state, he said. “Around four months back, the state cabinet approved a proposal to reduce the zonal development council commission from 1.80% to 0.20% as part of an economic package for the sugar mills and to be paid by the sugar mills on the purchase of sugar cane during the 2021-22 cane crushing season,” the official said. The minister said of the total 11 sugar mills in Bihar, the two in Riga and Sasmusa are closed. Earlier, the department secretary, N Sarvana Kumar, made a detailed presentation before the CM on the works being executed by the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/continue-transportation-subsidy-to-sitamarhi-sugar-cane-farmers-nitish/articleshow/87822889.cms||Madan Kumar

Significantly, the notification by the health & family welfare department clearly stated that cases Covid-19 is established as cause of death either through death certificate or positive RT-PCR or other tests before 30 days of death would be termed death due to Covid. If there are any discrepancies, the Covid-19 Death Ascertaining Committee (CDAC) would approach the respective hospital to expedite the process to obtain required documents. Another notification by the revenue department stated that the Rs 50,000 compensation would be disbursed from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). As per the notification, district collectors are appointed as nodal officers for the process who are mandated to complete the process within 30 days of receipt of the application. On Thursday, the bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice B V Nagarathna ordered the Gujarat government to simplify its procedure for disbursal of compensation among the Covid-affected families. The bench had sought response from the state authorities by November 22. The directive had asked the government ‘to take remedial steps and come out with a clear and simplified formula/notification so that the amount of compensation as ordered by this court is paid to the victim at the earliest and without any further harassment.’ The SC had frowned upon the state government's October 29 notification to form a Covid-19 death ascertaining committee (CDAC) at municipal corporation and district levels. The powers to ascertain whether a person died due to Covid-19 infection were given to the registrar of birth and death at respective units (municipal corporation/municipality/village panchayat). The committee’s certificate was a prerequisite to proceed further for the compensation even as the state government had not clarified the amount or modalities. The SC had asked the state authorities to adhere to its directives on October 4 and had warned that any deviation would be viewed very seriously. The court was upset with the state government forming a scrutiny committee for issuing death certificates, which has made the affected families run from pillar to post. According to official figures, the state has so far recorded the death of 10,091 persons during the pandemic, whereas some quarters of public health experts believe that the number could be much more. “The number is less due to the one condition followed by the state to ascertain Covid deaths – the person should not have any other comorbid health conditions. The elder patients and many young patients also had several comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes,” said a public health expert. “It would be interesting to see how many applications are made and scrutinized under the compensation scheme. Some had not bothered to obtain a death certificate with ‘Covid’ mentioned in it due to stigma attached to it. Also, there was no benefit announced then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-eases-rs50k-covid-ex-gratia-disbursal-after-rap-by-apex-court/articleshow/87823689.cms||---

Police on Saturday arrested a Trinamool activist, Abdul Ajij Siddique, for leading the mob that allegedly lynched the boy on suspicion of stealing fish from a bheri at Falti-Beliaghata. Trinamool anchal president Mehetab Hossain said, “The law will take its own course. If he is found guilty, he should be strictly punished.” The boy, Sahadmani Mondal, a resident of Uttar Falti, was playing with others near the bheri. “They were playing with a magnet that they dropped in the bheri. The accused who used to guard the bheri caught Sahadmani on mere suspicion of stealing fish. He started beating him along with others,” said Arjina Bibi, the boy’s aunt. Locals alleged Abdul took the boy to a club and put him inside a jute sack and later, released him. “On returning home, my son fell unconscious. Later, he told us what happened and we came to know about the torture,” said Piyar Ali, the boy’s father. The boy was taken to Barasat District Hospital and later shifted to RG Kar, where he died on Friday evening. “Abdul has been arrested and booked for murder,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/boy-beaten-to-death-on-suspicion-of-theft/articleshow/87823441.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

He said the lab would not only facilitate teaching and training of ENT, head and neck surgery but also be useful in treatment of many diseases related to these vital organs. Dr Karanti Bhawana, head of ENT, said ear, nose and throat are closely related to the brain and many of the diseases which penetrated deep into them required surgeries with precision. This lab would also be of much significance for teaching and training on cadavers under medical studies. “The ENT department of AIIMS-P has many latest technologies and beginning of this new lab would add to their utilities for treatment. On an average, 270 patients visit the OPD of ENT department of the hospital per day while about 25 surgeries are performed a week,” Dr Bhawana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/advance-lab-for-ent-comes-up-at-aiims-patna/articleshow/87822469.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||‘Congress will not attend meetings called by RJD in Bihar’||PATNA: The RJD legislature party might have to walk an extra mile for an effective floor coordination among the opposition parties in the state legislative assembly and council during the winter session, as the Congress is no longer a part of the grand alliance. The five-day winter session of the state legislature is to begin on November 29 and end on December 3. Asked if his party would participate in the meeting of the grand alliance MLAs before the start or on the first day of the winter session, Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajeet Sharma said, “It has been a long tradition of the Congress to hold its own legislature party meeting to discuss and decide the strategy that has to be adopted during the session of the Houses.” With the Congress out of the alliance as a fallout of the failed seat-sharing formula during the recently held byelections to the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats, the precipitate grand alliance comprises RJD and CPI(ML), CPI and CPM – together having 91 MLAs in the 243-member assembly. The Congress has 19 MLAs. “The Congress is neither a registered member of the grand alliance nor in any agreement to remain in it,” Sharma said, adding: “However, to the extent that we are opposed to the BJP, we in the opposition are together.” Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra also said, “Where is the grand alliance for us? The Congress contested the recently held byelections separately. We wanted one of the two assembly seats to contest, but the RJD did not appreciate it.” Both Sharma and Mishra said the Congress will act on its own on the questions in the listed business of the two Houses. “However, if there is any issue where the state government needs to be pressured to do the follow-up action, or if the government replies are to be sought on the floor with regard to any burning issue, the Congress will be with the opposition. People have elected us to take up their causes,” Sharma said. Mishra said if no-confidence motion is moved against the state government, the Congress will definitely be united with the other opposition parties. Asked for his comment on the Congress stand, senior RJD MLA Bhai Birendra said, “There will be complete floor coordination among the opposition parties in the House.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-not-to-attend-any-meeting-called-by-rjd-during-winter-session-of-house/articleshow/87822634.cms||Abhay Singh

The participants, majority of them being women from economically backward sections of the society, hailed the initiative and assured cooperation to make the programme a success. Sheohar SP Sanjay Bharti told this newspaper over phone on Saturday that the people’s response was enthusiastic. “The campaign will be intensified in the district after the panchayat polls. We will ensure to attend at least one such programme every week,” he said. Initially, the campaign will be launched in the villages identified as the hubs of liquor brewing and consumption. “Our idea is to discourage consumption. The supply will automatically reduce if there is no consumption (read demand),” he said. “The family has to suffer a lot after the arrest of a member for violating the prohibition law,” the police team tells the people. The initiative assumed significance in the wake of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s directive on November 16 to intensify awareness among people about prohibition following the recent hooch deaths. “We have decided to rope in newly elected panchayat representatives to make the campaign a grand success,” the SP said. Cong supports review of prohibition in state: Congress state chief Madan Mohan Jha said his party would considerably think over if CM Nitish Kumar offered to abolish prohibition in the state. “We were part of the government when prohibition was introduced in the state,” he admitted. “Humlog punah vichar karenge agar sarkar prohibition kanoon wapas lena chahti hai (we will consider if the state government wants to withdraw prohibition law),” he added. He, however, hastened to add that the Congress wanted the prohibition law to be implemented in letter and spirit. Earlier, Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma had said if the state government was finding it tough to implement the prohibition law, it should allow sale of liquor through licensed shops and at higher rates. However, Congress MLA Shakil Ahmad Khan said he didn’t agree with Sharma on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-hold-chaupal-in-sheohar-against-liquor/articleshow/87822807.cms||Ramashankar

A railway track was blown up by the Maoists at Latehar in neighbouring Jharkhand in the wee hours of Saturday as part of the protest. A light engine got derailed following the blast. The railways has reduced speed of trains in sensitive railway sections in Bihar. Several passenger trains pass through Maoist-affected areas in the state. A senior IPS officer said alertness and combining operations were increased from Friday as Maoists are protesting against the arrest of one of their colleagues, Prashant Bose, and killing of 26 other rebels in Gadchiroli. “Their protest will continue till November 25. We are maintaining vigil,” he added. Security has been especially tightened in Maoist-hit districts like Gaya, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Aurangabad and Munger. Other left-wing extremism (LWE)-affected districts in the state are Banka, Kaimur, Nawada, Rohtas and West Champaran. Vigilance is also maintained in Arwal, East Champaran, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda and Vaishali district as a precautionary measure. These districts were removed from the list of LWE-affected districts of Bihar released by the Centre in June this year. East Central Railway (ECR) CPRO Rajesh Kumar told TOI over phone that speed of trains in sensitive areas has been brought down to 75kmph from normal 110-130kmph after Latehar incident. “Day and night patrolling has been intensified and security beefed up in these areas. All necessary precautions are being taken to run passenger and goods trains safely,” Kumar added. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said combining operations had been intensified in the district to avoid any untoward incident. “The alertness is at the highest level,” he added. CRPF’s Bihar sector commandant M K Singh, who is authorised to speak to media, said security personnel especially in Bhimbandh and Chhakarbandha areas are in offensive position to counter any Maoist attack. “The Maoists have fallen weak in Bihar. However, we are not complacent. After the Latehar incident, we have intensified combing operations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/security-tightened-in-bihar-after-track-blast-at-latehar/articleshow/87822843.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB objects to ‘mischievous parallels drawn to Aryan Khan case’||MUMBAI: Denying allegations levelled against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede by a 20-year-old accused in a drugs case, the NCB in its reply on Saturday told the special NDPS court that he had mischievously drawn parallels with the Aryan Khan case. It said the plea was filed with malafide intent to defame and malign the agency and its officers, who are performing their duties in a manner prescribed under the NDPS Act. “There is not a single case where any observations have been made against the zonal director as alleged or the investigation... This applicant has taken liberty to make bald, frivolous and false allegations without any material to substantiate the same,” the NCB said. It said it was beyond imagination and defies logic, prudence and common sense that officers would plant documents. Attributing reasons for making the allegations now, the bail plea of accused Zaid Rana, who was arrested in April, said, “Recently in the case of Aryan Khan, it has come to the light of all the courts concerned, the manner in which the zonal director of NCB is capable of manufacturing and manipulating the records. Even the present case is one where due to personal enmity, he has registered the case by way of creating false and fabricated evidences.”  NCB called the allegations baseless. “Such proceedings tend to send a wrong message to the society, ought to be admonished and dismissed with strictures and costs,” the NCB said. Rana also alleged Wankhede was present in his building during the raid and had planted the contraband. His plea said that in chargesheet, Wankhede’s presence has been ignored. The NCB said Wankhede was present for a short time during the raid in a supervisory capacity. “It is shocking that the applicant (Rana) is after over seven months... alleging that Mr Sameer Wankhede has allegedly planted some contraband. Such allegations are not only bereft of material but also smacked with malifides, with an intent to mislead the court and portray a false picture against responsible officers,” the NCB said. It submitted that such personal allegations against officers without any basis should be condemned in the strongest terms by the court. Rana’s plea claimed Wankhede’s family owned a flat next door to his parents at Oshiwara, which was given out on rent. Rana alleged that following a “minor tiff” between his parents and Wankhede’s tenant, the NCB officer created the case against him. NCB said allegations about such a dispute are false.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-objects-to-mischievous-parallels-drawn-to-aryan-case/articleshow/87824634.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh and mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi received the prestigious award from President Ram Nath Kovind at a ceremony in New Delhi on Saturday. Vijayawada, which secured an all-India fourth rank in 2020, improved its ranking this time. The city got 5,368.37 points out of 6,000 and secured a five-star rating for its cleanliness-related initiatives in the garbage-free city category. Vijayawada is the only south Indian city to secure a place in the top five. In 2019, Vijayawada secured rank 19 and in 2018, the city stood at 5th place. Prasanna Venkatesh thanked and congratulated the people of the city for the award. “This award was not possible without the support of citizens and sanitation staff. People of Vijayawada always stood in the front line to support the calls given by the VMC. Initiatives like door-to-door segregated garbage collection, biomethanation plants, solid waste management, garbage recycling and on-site composting helped us achieve this feat. We will focus on achieving first rank next year,” Venkatesh told STOI. Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi said they would work collectively to improve the drainage system and garbage disposal to achieve first rank. “Awareness camps on ‘swachh’ initiatives helped us to achieve this award. Even people residing in slums are using separate bins to store garbage. Our ground level sanitation workers should be specially appreciated for this success. Municipal council will play a responsible role in the future to make the city clean and green,” the mayor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/public-involvement-garbage-mgmt-give-vij-top-3-finish/articleshow/87823400.cms||Venu Lanka

The indicators of the 2021 survey focused on parameters pertaining to wastewater treatment and reuse. Legacy waste management and remediation of landfills were also crucial components under the ‘service level progress’ category. From 73 major cities in 2016, 4,320 cities participated in 2021. SS-2021 did not just shed light on the importance of maintaining sanitation and hygiene but also brought to the forefront the contribution made by sanitation workers. For instance, the ‘Prerak Daaur Samman’, a new performance category introduced under Swachh Survekshan 2021, is aimed at making cities focus on developing infrastructure that may provide end-to-end solutions for sanitation. The star rating protocol, introduced as part of SS-2019, has been designed in a way to enable cities to gradually evolve into a model (seven-star) city. With a nearly 20 per cent weightage in the 6000-mark survey, the star rating indicator of the survey assesses the city based on its star rating certification. A total of nine cities – Indore, Surat, New Delhi municipal council, Navi Mumbai, Ambikapur, Mysuru, Noida, Vijayawada and Patna — have been certified as 5-star cities in Swachh Survekshan-2021. As many as 143 cities have been certified as 3-star cities, including Visakhapatnam. The lower star rating of Vizag may have negatively impacted its overall ranking in the SS-2021. According to officials, the major objective of the survey is to stimulate large-scale citizen participation and induce a competitive spirit among urban local bodies. The ministry of housing and urban affairs adopted an ‘integrated approach’ for SS- 2021 with a key focus on processed and unprocessed waste management capabilities, wastewater treatment and reuse, along with faecal sludge management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/from-physical-progress-to-integrated-approach-surveys-driving-philosophy-evolves-over-years/articleshow/87823410.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: CM Ashok Gehlot accuses PM Modi of mocking agitating farmers in Parliament||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “mocked” the farmers in an animated manner and called names like “andolanjeevi”, but those theatrics were missing when he announced the repeal of three farm laws. Gehlot claimed that the Modi dispensation decided to repeal the farm laws under pressure of the assembly elections in five states, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, and that the government was “scared”. “The prime minister was speaking in Parliament with ‘latke-jhatke’ (gestures), which he usually does. On Friday, those ‘latke-jhatke’ were missing,” Gehlot said. He also asked why Modi chose to make the announcement on odd hours at 9am when people are busy in household chores and gearing up for work. "Around 15-20 of their leaders (BJP and allies) made fun of the farmers. They referred to the farmers as Khalistanis and Naxals. Imagine the plight of the 'annadatas' (farmers) when such remarks were made against them," Gehlot said at the Kisan Vijay Diwas programme in Jaipur. Modi and parliamentarians from the ruling party made fun and laughed at the farmers. However, they all got "exposed" on Friday when an apology was tendered, the chief minister alleged. Gehlot claimed that the BJP was afraid of the elections and therefore, its national president JP Nadda, defence minister and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh, and home minister Amit Shah were looking after booth management. “Democracy and the Constitution are under threat. Fascist people, who have nothing to do with the farmers, are in power,” he alleged. Raking up the Lakhimpur Kheri issue, Gehlot said it was unfortunate that Union Minister of State Ajay Mishra had not been sacked. AICC general secretary in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken cautioned the farmers and Congress leaders to be alert as the intention of the government is not genuine. “The government brought in an ordinance to extend the tenure of the Enforcement Directorate and CBI heads five days before the announcement. A similar thing should have been done to repeal the farm laws. The farm laws were also brought in through ordinance route, then why an ordinance was not promulgated on repealing the farm laws, he asked while cautioning the farmers to be vigilant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-accuses-modi-of-mocking-agitating-farmers-in-parliament/articleshow/87824624.cms||---

He assured that he would raise the issue with the mayor. JJP Panchkula urban president O P Sihag and rural president Bhag Singh Damdama took up the issue of residents before the deputy CM at his residence in Chandigarh. Sihag said that the issue is of concern for Panchkula residents and such forced paid parking lots would not be tolerated. The JJP unit of the the BJP-JJP government is upset over implementation of paid parking without discussion. The agenda was passed in the house meeting without discussion and implemented a day later. Sector 20 is a developing area and such decisions must not be implemented in the developing sectors said councillor Shushil Garg. On the first day of implementation of paid parking, residents registered their opposition by raising slogans against the mayor and MC officials. Barricades were removed and the parking contractor was asked to leave. Residents and market welfare association members claim that they can manage the parking lot better. Councillors appealed to the deputy CM to look into the matter. After hearing the complaint, the deputy CM assured residents as well as JJP workers that he would talk to senior MC and Urban Local Bodies department officials. On their part, Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta and mayor Kulbhushan Goyal remained adamant on the paid parking lot in sectors 14 and 20, saying that funds are needed for development and the MC would earn revenue from this process. Incidentally, residents also opposed the paid parking system in sectors 8, 9 and 10 when it started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wont-pay-for-parking-say-irate-pkl-residents/articleshow/87823436.cms||---

UIET is the only team from North India from among 131 teams across the country to receive the funding. Panjab University put together a multi-disciplinary BE student team comprising team leader Ishank Bansal, Shubham Rattra, Tanya Aggarwal, Sachin Singh, Navudhay Pratap Singh, Vivek Mishra and Sakshi Gandhi. They worked under the guidance of faculty members Dr Prashant Jindal, Dr Mamta Juneja and Dr Rakesh Tuli to develop the innovative product. The machine has been going through various design upgradations over the past one year in the medical devices and restorative technologies lab at DIC, UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh. More than 9,000 teams were scouted from over 900 IIC institutions across India and 1,400 best prototype nominations from institutes were identified for further evaluation and support. After multiple rounds of evaluation and mentoring rounds and training, 410 reached the level of development of a business plan for their innovations. Students cleared competitive rounds of evaluation involving extensive knowledge of business plan, clinical trials and commercialisation aspects. Finally, 131 teams from the programme, NIC 2020 and YUKTI 2l.0 were selected for finals.

A multi-storey building with a floor area of 83,390sqft is being constructed for this project, at a cost of Rs 28.95 crore, according to panchayat president M R Ranjit. He pointed out that many firms have launched ‘work from home’ programmes in the backdrop of Covid, and there are possibilities that several units are likely to continue this, considering the savings they can make on the infrastructure front. Numerous women workers are finding it tough to work from home because of the constraints of infrastructure and absence of an ambience conducive to undertaking work which demand high levels of concentration, pointed out panchayat secretary Ajay Ghosh. “Through this project, we are trying to execute the concept of ‘work near home’ for the benefit of such women who are not able to ‘work from home’. Space will also be provided to budding women entrepreneurs to launch startup firms too. One floor will be dedicated to provide accommodation to women who get isolated due to various reasons. Another floor will be for training mothers of differently abled children,” the secretary said. The project will be partly funded by the three-tier local bodies together.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai's Nepean Sea road to get bus bays, footpaths: BMC||MUMBAI: In a treat for pedestrians the BMC along with local residents, via CSR funds, plan to begin the improvisation of the upmarket Nepean Sea Road starting next week wherein footpaths, important junctions as well as bus bays will be made pedestrian friendly in a bid to give them priority over vehicles. Locals who have been pushing for the initiative said that the idea is such that any senior citizen should be able to walk smoothly without any hindrances coming their way. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC D ward Prashant Gaikwad said, currently the width of the road starting from St. Stephen’s Church till Malabar Hill is not uniform and therefore vehicles and pedestrians are not able to smoothly pass through. “While the effective road width is 6.5 meters, the same is not maintained at all junctions. At some places the road width is more and at others less. We want to make it uniform apart from creating traffic islands that will have pedestrian space and also signal free junctions. Bus bays that would be 30 metres in length will also be made for easy access for buses to move in and out,” said Gaikwad. Mukul Mehra, secretary of the Nepean Sea Road Citizens Forum (NRCF) said that while improvisation of the street was a part of the ‘Mumbai Street Lab’ competition of the BMC launched in the year 2019 where they had invited urban designers and architects to provide innovative and creative street design solutions, but they realized that there was a need for local perceptive to be brought into the plans. “From making bus bays to creating unobstructed walkways for pedestrians, we want to ensure the commute for everyone in the area is smooth. So in areas where the footpath height increases owing to a ramp created for entry and exit in a building we want to bring it at the same level,” said Mehra. Rahul Kadri, architect and chairperson of NRCF, JSW foundation is sponsoring the one kilometre improvisation works. “We are hoping to make the footpath along the stretch 4.5 metres wide and wish it becomes a standard for the entire city,” said Kadri, adding that the improvisation work will begin very soon. Pranav Naik, architect --Studio Pomegranate which had won the competition for the street said that its only due to the persistence of citizens that the improvisation and streamlining of the road has taken off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nepean-sea-road-to-get-bus-bays-footpaths-in-mumbai-bmc/articleshow/87824900.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Aurangabad||3-day dedicated camp to register offences||Aurangabad: Considering the scale of the 30-30 ponzi scheme, which is feared of cheating tens of hundreds of farmers to the tune of several crores of rupees, the Aurangabad rural police have decided to hold a three-day dedicated camp to record offences against the suspects. On Monday, the camp will be held at the Chikalthana police station, followed by at the economic offences wing (EOW) office situated at Aurangabad rural police headquarters on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the camp will be held at the Bidkin police station. Police said the suspects have targeted farmers who received crores as compensation against acquisition of farmlands for the Samruddhi Super Expressway connecting Mumbai and Nagpur. After several months of pondering, the first offence against the suspected perpetrators of the ponzi scheme was finally registered at the Bidkin police station on November 15. In the maiden FIR, a woman has named two suspects for allegedly duping her husband of Rs 10 lakh on the pretext of returning Rs 15 lakh in two months. Accordingly, the police booked the suspects on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation. In addition, sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act, have also been slapped. Aurangabad (rural) superintendent of police Nimit Goyal, in a recent statement, termed the alleged cheating to be serious and assured the farmers of taking all steps to bring the suspects to book. He appealed to the victims to come forward to lodge complaints and record statements, so that a proper probe can be initiated. A senior police officers said that Goyal is thinking about establishing a special investigation team to carry out an in-depth probe of the scam, which according to some farmers, is running into hundreds of crores of rupees. Those privy to the probe said the biggest limitation in these cheating incidents is that very few transactions are on record. As a result, some of the complainants, despite willing to lodge a complaint, are not able to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-day-dedicated-camp-to-register-offences/articleshow/87822322.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Students write 1st CBSE major paper in schools||KOLKATA: Hundreds of students of CBSE X, wrote their Bengali term one paper on Saturday, the first big turnout board exam since 2019. Many CBSE XII candidates wrote their fashion studies paper. Almost in every school some candidates reported with symptoms of flu and wrote their exams from isolation rooms. Some candidates were absent because they have contracted Covid. Many students complained that questions in Bengali came from sections that had been deleted. Schools have raised the issue with the Board. South Point High School by far had the biggest turnout with 705 students writing the paper. There were nine students who wrote in the isolation room because they had symptoms of cold and cough. Observers in PPE gear manned the isolation room with a nurse in attendance. “We used 58 rooms to spread out the examinees because the number were big. The exam went off well, the evaluation and uploading of marks were done on time too,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson for the school. The exam started at 11 am and got over at 12:30pm, after which the OMR sheets were collected and evaluation started at the stipulated time, under the watchful eyes of the CBSE appointed observers. Three students at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy were absent since they are down with Covid. A total of 156 wrote the test. According to a decision taken by the Board earlier, those wilth Covid need not write the term one exam and will be tested for the board exam on the basis of their performance in term two. There was a seven- minute power cut at LSA around 9 am, much before the exams started but the teachers panicked. “Though we have a generator we were upset and called the CESC. Thankfully power was restored soon,” said director of the school, Meena Kak. One student wrote the exam in the isolation room of Sushila Birla Girls School because she has a throat infection, informed principal Koeli Dey. Some candidates here complained that portions deleted from the Bengali syllabus had been part of the question paper. “There was a question marked as “mandatory” which was from Dondo-Somas. This was out of our syllabus,” said Ryona Aditree Ghosh. Another student Sanya Samdarshi a CBSE XII student who wrote her fashion studies paper said that some questions from the omitted portions had been asked. “We have written to the Board about this,” Dey said. At DPS Ruby Park, the exam for 188 students was uneventful. At Asian International School however, one candidate met with an accident and is not writing the exam. “I am requesting the Board to consider her case so that her result can be declared on the basis of the term two exam like it is being done for Covid patients,” said principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar. Afreen Hossain, a CBSE X student thanked the online classes that made Saturday’s paper look easy to her. “I think we have achieved the near-impossible in the virtual mode,” she said. Vox There were questions outside the syllabus. These had been omitted. I hope the Board considers this. Ryona Aditree Ghosh, CBSE X, Sushila Birla Girls School The entire board syllabus was covered through online classes. It was a great feat that teachers achieved along with us.

---||Mumbai||Merely 10-20 per cent students return to Mumbai colleges||MUMBAI: A week after city colleges reopened post the Diwali vacation, attendance is yet to gather pace. Most are seeing around 10-20 per cent physical attendance and some are still conducting only science practical sessions offline. At several colleges, even the fully vaccinated who have given consent for attendance are not showing up. With no attendance policy and the option of attending online classes, it could be difficult to get all students back to classrooms, say principals. Teachers, on the other hand, are finding it difficult to manage classes in the hybrid mode with the majority attending lectures online. Wilson College in Chowpatty is only conducting science practicals offline as of now. “Many of our students are from outside the state. Since there is no directive yet to open hostels, we are unable to call them. Among the ones who are from Mumbai, many are not yet fully vaccinated. So, our teachers are conducting online theory classes from their homes or college library and classrooms,” said principal Anna Pratima Nikalje. At K C College, attendance is yet to pick up. “We have around 20% students attending offline lectures now in most classes,” said S Padhi, vice-principal, adding attendance may pick up in December. Hemlata Bagla, vice-chancellor, HSNC University, said: “Many students are yet to get their second dose. Secondly, outstation candidates are unable to return as there are no hostel facilities. Also, with colleges offering a hybrid mode of lectures, many are finding it convenient to attend lectures from home,” said Bagla. Anushree Lokur, principal, Ramnarain Ruia College, said several BSc students are attending lectures. Though attendance for arts is yet to pick up, close to 50% vaccinated students have been coming in, she added. Lokur said teachers are finding it difficult to manage the hybrid mode of teaching. “Using the blackboard to explain problems or diagrams to students in class and the ones attending online becomes difficult in hybrid mode.” At N M College, attendance has started picking up. Principal Parag Ajgaonkar said with smartboards, teachers have managed to slip into the hybrid mode with ease. Ancy Jose, director, Nagindas Khandwala College, said they have slightly better attendance in self-financed courses, but in the aided courses, the numbers are less than 10%. A principal said till the hybrid mode of teaching continues, many will opt for online classes. “There is also no compulsion on physical attendance currently. Many attempting competitive entrance exams would want to save time in commute,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-merely-10-20-students-return-to-city-colleges/articleshow/87824642.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Eat streets that tempt Amdavadi taste buds||For Amdavadis, food is love and they indulge in it with complete passion. With the civic body’s recent flip-flop over its decision to ban roadside food stalls selling non-vegetarian food, the spotlight has once again fallen on the changing food habits of people in the city and how it has given rise to new ‘khau gallis’. For years, Manek Chowk and the Khau Galli in Law Garden satiated Amdavadis’ vegetarian cravings for pav bhaji, panipuri, sandwiches and idli-dosas. For a taste of non-vegetarian fare, they would head to Bhatiyar Galli in the old city. Today, as the city swells with well-travelled Gujaratis and migrant population arriving for work in multi-national companies or looking for entrepreneurial opportunities, there’s a visible change in the food choices of people. This is also reflected in the rise in food trucks and roadside joints offering a variety of vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian dishes from cuisines ranging from Punjabi to South Indian, from Chinese to Lebanese. During the day, most of these new hangouts wear a deserted look. But as evening falls, these spots come alive with the smell of food sending people’s taste buds into overdrive. The food offered at reasonable rates is a bonus. For Aparjita Verma, a former banker who runs Nawabi Zaika, says this is her third attempt at running an eatery. She finally found success at Ahmedabad Food Truck Park opposite Karnavati Club. "We had tried our hand at running a restaurant that offered only vegetarian fare, but it wasn’t successful. I started Nawabi Zaika four years ago and it has been a hit ever since. We get a lot of repeat customers," says Verma who runs two stalls at the park. Vishal Mewada, who envisioned the food park, says the idea came to him when he saw a person selling noodles on the roadside. He invited the vendor and a few others to set up their stalls on an open plot opposite Karnavati Club. Initially, the outlets were run from trucks. Over time, the trucks have been replaced by shipping containers. "The place provides employment to more than 200 people, including some who lost their jobs during the pandemic," says Mewada. Shakeel Aalam, 20, initially worked at a food outlet here before deciding to take over from his employer who wanted to quit. He and three friends run the food joint offering non-vegetarian food. Dr Ranjith Singh, a well-known cardiologist from Chandigarh, says he has been a regular visitor to the food park. "The variety of food items and its authentic taste brings me back again and again. The food is prepared live and the prices are very affordable," says Singh. A little away lies Urban Chowk — a chic, open and all-inclusive courtyard — which came up in August 2020 soon after the lockdown was lifted. Located on the road from Rajpath Club to Bopal, the seemingly upmarket place hosts over 30 food brands. It offers both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. It thrives on the city’s deep-rooted social culture and focuses on creating a ‘chowk’ instead of a food park, a place where people can mingle, chat, eat food and relax. The chowk also offers a platform for people to showcase their talent and host events regularly. These courts not only serve food at competitive rates but are also a launchpad for foodpreneurs. Mohit Sharma, an entrepreneur who has a wholesale sanitaryware business, says, his love for good and authentic food made him foray into this business. Though Sharma started ‘Gully Punjab’ at the chowk on Dhanteras, its variety of authentic-tasting kulchas already has a fan following. Prithviraj Kapil, Diya Patel and Alfina Galaria — college-going friends in their early twenties — are regular visitors to Urban Chowk. "We love the milkshakes, brownies and nachos here. We find this place safe, healthy and suitable for our pockets. The place is designed and built in such a way that we can easily spend two hours here," says Kapil. Some other food courts that have come up in the city over past few years include Nukkad Food Court in Bodakdev, Bhukkad Gali near CEPT University in Navrangpura, and New Manek Chowk, with more than 50 joints, near Gota flyover on Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway. Closer to SG Highway and Sindhu Bhavan Road, these are the latest hangouts spots for young, urban Amdavadis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eat-streets-that-tempt-amdavadi-taste-buds/articleshow/87823952.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The money recovered from him should be deposited in the Prime Minister’s Covid-19 fund, the bench said. The petitioner was opposing the emergence of new HPCL petrol pumps in Pragnapur, Kuknoorpally, Prashantha Nagar, Doulatabad, Mittapally and Markook villages of Siddipet. He went to the extent of charging the HPCL officials with creating fake NOCs and running them unofficially without any safety clearances. When notices were served on the officers, they filed a counter refuting the allegations levelled by the petitioner. Counsel for HPCL B Mayur Reddy brought to the notice of the court about NOC, permission and the statutory clearances they obtained before commencing the functioning of these petrol pumps in the rural areas of Siddipet district. “These outlets were set up for the convenience of the rural people,” he said. “This will save a lot of time for the people as they were coming to far-off places to get petrol,” Mayur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slaps-rs-1-l-fine-on-frivolous-petitioner/articleshow/87823459.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The centre seeks to enhance the holistic care and rehabilitation of the disabled community. The well-equipped CRCS has been designed as a facility for higher learning and research by coalescing the laryngeal and articulatory sciences and vestibular science labs to bring about a qualitative change in the lives of people with communication disorders. The research programmes of CRCS will focus on empowering persons with communication disorders by helping them actively participate in the society, besides developing treatment methods and leading extensive and in- depth research for evaluating treatment results. “CRCS is the first state-of-the art research unit that fills the void in communication sciences research in Kerala. NISH is eminently equipped to have this centre, considering the institution’s experience, facilities and highly qualified professionals at its disposal,” said NISH executive director M Anjana. The centre will leverage cutting-edge technologies to measure the voice characteristics, speech clarity and directly monitor the vocal cords through high-precision tests conducted at the laryngeal and articulatory sciences lab, which makes use of stroboscopy with advanced analytical features and software like ling waves and Vaghmi. The technology available in the field will help examine erroneous pronunciation, voice variations and the difference in vocal cord structure. Also, the structural and functional changes in the organs that lead to difficulties in feeding and speech clarity can be identified through stroboscopy; that can be carried out for children and adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/communication-sciences-centre-to-be-set-up-at-nish/articleshow/87823474.cms||---

This means, every year on average there is a loss of Rs 9,846 crore in the state due to accidents. However, owing to fewer deaths and injuries because of the pandemic, the figure decreased to approximately Rs 8,000 crore in 2020. According to the data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of India and National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 51,044 people have been killed in road accidents from 2016 to 2020, which means that daily there are 29 deaths every day in Rajasthan indicating that at least one person dies in a road accident every hour. Madhu Sudan Sharma, senior program official, road safety, CUTS- International, said, "Cost of accidents includes the sum of medical, production, human, property damage and admin costs." He said, "Rajasthan can avoid the unwanted burden of around Rs 10, 000 crore per annum on to road accidents, injuries, and deaths, on the poor economy if proper enforcement mechanism is developed. The state needs to focus on five risk factors, which include not wearing seatbelt and helmet, drunken driving, high speed, and child safety, to reduce accidents." Experts claimed that the burden is in addition to the immense social trauma faced by the victims of road accidents. They opined that reduction of traffic speeds can prevent many deaths and serious injuries, which is also the theme for World Remembrance Day 2021. "In Rajasthan, the transport sector, in general, cannot be made profitable unless road accidents and deaths are reduced drastically. The cost of each fatality is Rs 91.16 lakh, the cost of each fatal and grievous injury is Rs 3.64 lakh and the minor injury cost is Rs 77,938 as per the World Bank report on traffic crash injuries and disabilities," added Sharma. The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is celebrated on the third Sunday of every November. The international observance of this day is dedicated to remembering many millions of road traffic victims throughout the world. It was started by the European Federation of Road Traffic Victims (FEVR) in 1995 and adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution on October 26, 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-sees-rs-49kcr-loss-due-to-mishaps-in-5-yrs-report/articleshow/87824637.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS to take call on Kalvakuntla Kavitha’s future in 2 days||HYDERABAD: Will Kalvakuntla Kavitha make it to upper House, either council (state) or Rajya Sabha (Parliament)? TRS circles have been agog with this question for the past few days. The term of Kavitha ends on January 4, 2022 and the Election Commission has issued a notification for filling up the vacancy along with 11 other seats on December 10. TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take a decision on her future in the next two days as November 23 is the last date for filing nomination for 12 MLC seats under Local Authority Constituencies. There has been speculation on her nomination to the upper House soon after TRS’ Rajya Sabha MP Banda Prakash was nominated as MLC under MLA quota though he has two and half year’s term left. Even if she is sent to Rajya Sabha (RS) replacing Prakash, her term would be only till April, 2024. The party leadership is reportedly in a dilemma over her ‘future’ as she developed good rapport with elected representatives in united Nizamabad since her nomination to the council, one and half years ago. This would also help the party in the next general elections and herself in the upcoming Lok Sabha election if the party decides to field her from Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency. “Going by this, the CM may rethink on her candidature to Rajya Sabha and likely keep her in the council,” a TRS leader said. Kavitha, who won from Nizamabad LS in 2014, lost to BJP candidate Arvind Dharmapuri in the 2019 LS elections. Later in 2020, KCR decided to send her to the council in place of Bhupathi Reddy from Nizamabad Local Authority Constituencies, who got disqualified after shifting loyalties to Congress before the 2018 elections. If TRS wants to retain her as MLC, the party might have to accommodate ex-MLC Akula Lalitha in a nominated post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-to-take-call-on-kavithas-future-in-2-days/articleshow/87823470.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Farmers’ union welcomes state move to drop 3 bills||MUMBAI: Farmers groups have welcomed the state’s move not to proceed with its three farm law amendment bills that had been drafted to counter the Centre’s farm laws since the latter have been repealed. The state had tabled the amendments in the assembly in July. It planned to discuss and pass them in the winter session of the state assembly. “There is no need to proceed with the bills since they were based on the Central laws and were an attempt to correct these laws. This issue will be brought before the cabinet sub-committee on the farm bills,” said state cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil. The farmers union Kisan Sabha, which had opposed the state’s amendment bills, has welcomed the move. “The amendments were not very different from the Centre’s farm laws. What the state should do instead, is to implement the existing laws,” said Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha. Meanwhile, the MVA government has decided to provide higher subsidy for drip irrigation schemes for small and marginal farmers. It has given approval for a budgetary provision of Rs 589 crore for 2021-22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farmers-union-welcomes-state-move-to-drop-3-bills/articleshow/87824903.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

By the roads of Adajan, one will find Burmese items like khow suey and Rangooni parathas selling like hot cakes. In fact, when late architect Charles Correa visited Surat, he thoroughly relished the cuisine at Teen Batti Crossroads, recommending it to other visitors from South Bombay to visit Surat for its food and culture. Eggs are prepared in exotic versions — from Australian to Italian — teamed with local ingredients like green garlic at kiosks in Surat. Little wonder that the preparations are so popular that one can find an egg cart in almost every suburban bylane. Surat’s street food is popular because it imbibes flavours of homemade dishes – recipes of which have been handed down generations. Community-specific delicacies like Khatri tapelu and mamna at Piplod, Muslim exclusives like haleem and paya at Chowk, Jhampa Bazaar’s barah handi and biryani which are sold out daily are proof of their popularity. Surat’s unique produce, which includes ponk (a snack made from tender roasted sorghum grains), is freshly husked and sold by the streets during winter. It’s a treat for the palate with its savoury and sweet flavours. Bombay’s bhelpuri, vada pav, and Delhi’s chaat share space with Amritsari kulche choley, fish and Amdavadi tawa fry, and pahadi chicken. For vegetarians, the fare includes Dadima nu khichu and Dhrujela ni dabeli, Chennai idlis, Mysore dosas , Punjab’s paranthas, vegetarian Chinese food and Jain eggs (without onion-garlic, served with khakhra instead of bread). Surat Nu Jaman is renowned across the world for its undhiyu, ghari , bhusu, khaja and other goodies. However, it is Surat’s street food that locals thrive on.

Here, dal pakwan, which is Rajkot’s special snack, along with ragda, bhel and South Indian dishes are served during the day. At night, the place transforms into a spot for egg lovers. It is near Yagnik Road due to which this market is always crowded. The other khau galli is behind Virani school. It is equally crowded due to its proximity to Tagore Road, Bhaktinagar and Laxminagar main roads.

---||Chandigarh||Schools of Chandigarh- sowing the seeds of good citizenship||Even though Chandigarh was created as the administrative head of East Punjab, its far-sighted creators realised early on that quality education was an important amenity a modern city should provide to flourish culturally and intellectually. Since the city was envisioned as a regional center of education, provision was made in the earliest budget itself for an adequate number and array of educational buildings, right from sector-level primary schools to multi-disciplinary colleges. In an article discussing early schools of Chandigarh, architect B P Mathur rightly observed that when a child attains school going age, it is important for schools to provide a pleasant and healthy atmosphere because, “it is in this educational institute that the best part of life is spent, the mind is apprenticed and the seeds of good citizenship are sown.” Chandigarh had the advantage of being a new city free of traditional models, where new provision for educational buildings could be made. Educationists and architects could work closely to ensure that the schools made at the time could cater to the needs of tomorrow. And so, from the earliest years, the hierarchy of educational buildings from primary to higher secondary stage was planned on the basis of the number of people living in that particular area, with more schools provided in high density areas. As an important component of the self-contained sector and to spare mothers the drudgery of escorting children to and from school on foot, most educational buildings were located near or within the central green belt of the sector, which also ensured a green and pleasant setting of the institutions. At the basic level, children in the age group of three to five years had nursery schools with a multi-purpose room, a small pantry and room for teachers. Primary schools had five to six classrooms for 40 students, besides supporting spaces while junior and higher secondary schools were lesser in number but catered to a larger number of students with laboratories, library and activity areas. As with everything in Chandigarh, dedicated architects went beyond the brief, paying as much attention to space and ambience as to the functional brief. We thus have some outstanding examples of institutional architecture addressing the changing teaching methodologies besides concerns of climate and technology, all within a tight budget. Pierre Jeanneret was ably supported by Indian architects like Jeet Malhotra, B P Mathur and S K Dutta to design schools characterised by a scale suitable for users with well-lit and ventilated spaces. The modern way of teaching merged with Indian pedagogy as multi-purpose teaching halls for tiny tots flowed into outdoor spaces gently enclosed by curvilinear low height walls. Junior and higher secondary schools were typically double-storey blocks of singly loaded corridors, ensuring good light and ventilation. Sterile and dark corridors were thus avoided while innovative brick screens and concrete louvers ensured shade during the harsh summers. Jeanneret firmly believed that lack of money and technology was no excuse for compromising on aesthetics. This philosophy is apparent in the simple, linear buildings, enlivened by a play of forms and textures with clean white plastered surfaces tempered by stone walls and exposed brick used in screens in parapets, overhangs and walls. Every challenge became an opportunity to experiment, whether it was brick screens and precast louvers in Junior Secondary School, Sector 10 or the distinctive triangular openings along the corridors of the Primary School in Sector 15. Many playful elements like a mural of the Pythagoras theorem or a globe on a wall or even a sculpture in the nursery school of Sector 16 and the gently sloping ramps leading to the terrace or upper floors show the sensitivity of architects. No wonder then that these schools, where the seeds of good citizenship were sown, helping it flourish into a vibrant city, have been recommended for Heritage status as an inseparable part of our legacy.

The parents have also written an open letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, highlighting the problems related to online learning and the impact the pandemic has had on their children. The petition has been signed by more than 1,800 individuals. The group is also running a campaign called #OpenMumbaiSchools across social media platforms. “Sir, our children have fallen behind in learning due to online school. They are not retaining information, finding it difficult to focus and are suffering acutely. It is affecting their mental health. Depression and anxiety are on the rise. Children in formative years are barely reading and their math skills have fallen behind,” reads the open letter. Gayatri Sabharwal, a parent of two, said regular schools have resumed in most countries across the world. “In the state, everything is open. Children are going to the malls, playgrounds and birthday parties but are not allowed to go to school. Also, we parents want the best for our children and we are urging the government to allow physical schools to reopen for all,” said Sabharwal. She said the standard operating procedure should be left to schools and the parents for better implementation of safety precautions. “We have spoken to many pediatricians and they have said it is safe for children to go to school. Also, children have natural immunity. Even if they contract the virus, they have a mild infection,” said Sabharwal. Chef-restaurateur Nikhil Chib who is supporting the petition said children have reported a de-growth and now that cases have dipped, schools should be opened again. “For those who are not willing to send their children to school, there is an option of online learning. But it cannot be the case for all the kids for such a long time,” said Chib. At the moment, the state has allowed physical school from classes 8 to 12 in urban areas and classes 5 to 12 in rural areas. The state government is considering allowing younger classes 5 to 7 to attend physical school in cities and primary classes may be allowed in rural areas. Tanya Dere, mother to six-year-old, said children are suffering silently, their mental health, physical health and even intellectual health is affected. “Online education is half as effective, the pace of learning is slow and not focused. Apart from not learning, children are socially awkward today due to limited physical interaction. Now with most parents and grandparents fully vaccinated, the risk of contracting the virus from children too has reduced,” said Dere. The petition says we have to learn to live as normally as possible as the pandemic may not end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1-8k-parents-plea-to-govt-if-kids-can-go-to-malls-party-in-mumbai-why-not-schools-/articleshow/87824664.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Amravati curfew relaxed but cops not letting guard down||AMRAVATI: After allowing relaxation in the day curfew on Saturday, Amravati police kept a close eye on movements in different parts of the city. On Saturday, 2,727 cops were on duty and five more persons were arrested in connection with the November 12-13 violence. Now, cops have arrested 303 persons so far and the number of offences have gone up to 54. Commissioner of police Aarti Singh on Saturday issued fresh orders permitting loading and unloading activities between 5am and 8.30am from Sunday while keeping the relaxation in the day curfew intact. Special relief has been granted to Sakkarsath, cotton market and transport lane where the wholesale market operates. The old and new cotton markets have been granted permission to open from Monday, facilitating opening of wholesale vegetable and fruit markets besides the grain market. Labourers on loading and unloading duty will have to carry ID cards. Even though the city appeared to have returned to normalcy, cops summoned from other districts and SRPF haven’t been sent back and were deployed at 86 points. Besides SRPF, extra police force was summoned from Wardha, Akola, Nagpur, Buldhana, Hingoli and Jalna after the November 12-13 violence. The team from Wardha team was sent back on Saturday while others are keeping vigil at 13 points under Rajapeth police station (PS), 12 points under Kolhapuri Gate PS, 17 points under Gadge Nagar PS, 21 points under Nagpuri Gate PS, 14 points under Frezerpura PS, three points under Bhatkuli and Badnera PS each, two points under Badnera PS and one under Nandgaon Peth police station. Besides CP Aarti Singh and SP (Rural) Avinash Bargal, four DCPs, five ACPs, 30 PIs, 121 APIs and PSIs are keeping close watch on the situation along with 1,835 cops, 437 SRPF jawans, 200 cops from Nagpur and 93 from Hingoli. People are still apprehensive to venture out. The violence and subsequent curfew are estimated to have cost a loss of Rs1,000 crore to the business community as markets remained closed for over a week despite it being a marriage season. Fadnavis visiting Amravati todayLeader of the opposition in assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadanvis is visiting Amravati city on Sunday to review the situation. BJP city president Kiran Paturkar told TOI that Fadanvis will reach city around 9.30am and visit Masanganj and Hanumannagar localities. He would also hold dicussions with district and police administrations before addressing media at 12.30pm. CP Arti Singh told TOI that Fadanvis has informed the divisional commissioner’s office about his visit. “His visit is planned when there is no restriction on any movement,” she said. Ahead of his Anravati visit, Fadnavis told TOI that there was no logic behind blaming BJP for the violence. “Why are these so-called secular people quiet about how a rally was taken out to protest a fictional event at Tripura. In that rally shops of Hindus were targetted, but nobody is talking about that,” he said. Reacting to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s statement that central agencies are regularly receiving list of people in Maharashtra against whom action is to be taken, Fadnavis said, “Considering the current condition of his party, Pawar has to take that stand. From what I have heard, he’s even supporting Anil Deshmukh. So it’s natural the way he reacted but still I did not expect this from a senior leader like Pawar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amravati-curfew-relaxed-but-cops-not-letting-guard-down/articleshow/87824009.cms||---

Police have found that the suspect was using a micro earphone, which was inserted in his ear. Further probe has revealed that he was appearing on behalf of another person. Pimpri Chinchwad commissionerate had received a total of 21,000 applications to fill up the posts of 720 constables. There were 80 examination centres in Aurangabad district. The accused has been identified as Akash Jarwal of Jalna, while a police team has rushed to round up the original candidate for allegedly hiring a dummy candidate to appear on his behalf for the exams. Karmad police station inspector Rajendra Bokde said the bluetooth earpiece inserted in Jarwal’s ear was so small that despite several attempts, police failed to remove it and the suspect had to be taken to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist to get it removed. Police said the incident took place at Karmad-based New High School. The accused appeared for the exams claiming to be another person. He was caught after a policeman deployed for invigilation asked Jarwal to remove his mask and checked it. He found a microchip in the middle of the mask’s layers. Jarwal was soon taken to a side and thoroughly screened, only to find that he was wearing hi-tech devices to cheat in the exam. Soon all the records were checked to verify his credentials, only to find that he was a dummy candidate. Police said an offence of cheating has been registered against both the suspects at Karmad police station. An officer said that the police are now checking for more dummy candidates, who appeared for the exam held on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-recruitment-exam-1-held-for-cheating/articleshow/87822348.cms||---

For the past month and a half, the team has been meeting vendors at Mapusa market, the bus stand and around the city, educating them on the importance of acting when they find a child in difficult circumstances. They have been handing the vendors posters to stick up and making test calls to the helpline number to familiarise them on its working. “We ask them to report cases of child labour, child trafficking, runaway children, missing children, child beggary, neglect, those facing problems in education, health issues, abuse and child marriage on our toll-free helpline 1098 which is 24 by 7 and assure them that their identity will not be revealed,” coordinator of the programme told TOI. The team has also reached out to a few bus conductors. The centre will soon have a dedicated child help desk at the Mapusa bus stand. The need for the centre was felt as the Mapusa bus terminus has turned into a hub for locals and tourists visiting the famous Mapusa market, daily commuters as well as inter-state buses. “The constant movement of buses, both local and inter-state, will perhaps lead to an increase in child trafficking. Several children take a bus from here to go to the coastal belt,” team member Anleah Alvares said. “We take rounds every day to identify any children in difficult circumstances,” she added. The team is also taking steps towards mapping hotspots which could give rise to vulnerable areas for children. They have seen slums mushrooming in surrounding areas and are receiving calls for ration for children and their families. “These slums are bound to house children who may lack basic healthcare and educational facilities,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vendors-in-mapusa-mkt-apprised-of-child-rights/articleshow/87824078.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||2 booked for forging cooperation minister’s stamps||AURANGABAD: The city police have booked two office bearers of a housing society after they allegedly forged rubber stamps of the state cooperation minister to change the membership title of some of the housing society members. Based on the complaint lodged by Piyush Sethi (36) of Kanchan Nagar cooperative housing society, Satara area police have booked the duo on charges of cheating, forgery, forgery for cheating among others. Police said the alleged cheating took place sometime in January and July this year, following which the members of the housing society objected to the move and demanded things to be rectified. Police sub-inspector Shankar Shirsath told TOI, “As per the preliminary report, the duo, including a 66-year old office bearer of the housing society, forged rubber stamps of the state cooperation minister to delegate certain powers to nominal members of the society.” The officer said the preliminary probe has revealed that for the formation of a housing society, the members had contributed Rs 1 lakh each. The housing society was formed and divided into three sections - A, B and C. It has been alleged that in the C division of the society, there were about 70 members, who did not have the right to vote. The suspected office bearers allegedly used forged rubber stamps, prepared documents and letters, eventually giving these members the right to vote and have a say in the parent body of the housing society. It has been alleged that the duo with the help of other members was eyeing the prime plots and the large sum that has been received as a deposit from the housing society members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-booked-for-forging-cooperation-mins-stamps/articleshow/87822349.cms||---

Within the state, Nashik city’s is ranked 4th — after Navi Mumbai, Pune and Thane. Last year, the city was ranked 11th in the country. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials said they are not satisfied with this year’s results, but pledge to do better during the next Swachh Survekshan. More than 4,000 cities with a population of at least 10 lakh had participated in the Swachh Survekshan 2021. Nashik city has scored 4,248 out of 6,000 marks to become the 17th clean city in India this year. It received 2,080 out of 2,400 marks in the service level programme (SLP), which is the documentation of the projects. It scored 700 out of 1,800 in the garbage-free city (GFC) rating, and 1,467 out of 1,800 marks in citizens’ feedback category. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said that during the 2021 SS, the city could not do well in areas of garbage-free city rating and citizens’ feedback that led the city to a fall in its ranking from 11th to 17th this year. “But we will improve in these two areas during Swachh Survekshan 2022 and improve our ranking to make it among the top 10 cleanes cities in the country,” said Jadhav. Avesh Palod, the director of NMC’s solid waste department, said he is not satisfied with the city’s performance in SS 2021. The city lagged behind in the areas of construction and demolition (C&D) waste management. “But the project for recycling and management of C&D waste is already in the tender process and we are confident of rolling out this project,” said Palod. “Another area we could not do well is citizens’ feedback. Efforts are to be made to improve these areas,” added Palod. In 2019 and 2020, the city was ranked 63 and 67 in categories of the clean cities. But the cleanliness ranking of the city had improved in 2020 as the city had ranked 11th in the country and 2nd in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-17th-cleanest-in-india-4th-in-state/articleshow/87822361.cms||Tushar Pawar

When his death left a huge void in their lives, as a tribute, inmates at Hindalga central jail built a memorial in his memory. Maxxy touched everyone’s hearts with his unconditional love. A rottweiler, Maxxy was the pet of chief superintendent of police of the prison, Krishna Kumar. The dog was brought from Punjab when it was a puppy. When Kumar was posted at Hindalga, he brought Maxxy with him to office. Rottweilers are generally considered aggressive but in no time Maxxy began making friends with the prison inmates. The dog was a favourite with the prisoners. The inmates even took turns to bathe it every week. Maxxy even joined the prisoners when they worked in the fields and entertained them with his pranks. In July, the dog fell ill and died. Krishna Kumar was in shock and so were the inmates in the jail. For weeks, everyone mourned. After a month or so they decided to build a memorial at the burial site, beside the SP bungalow. The memorial was built using unused material used in renovation of the prison. A marble was cut out in the shape of a semi-circle on which the dog’s picture was etched. “The inmates did everything and all the material was sourced from the unused material lying around the prison premises,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/maxxy-gets-a-memorial-in-hindalga-prison-campus/articleshow/87823119.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Jaipur||Structures falling on Jhotwara elevated corridor will be razed||Jaipur: The Jhotwara elevated road project proposed to ease vehicular movement between Panipech and Kalwar Road area has finally gained momentum. JDA has started removing structures which were a hindrance in the construction work. For the 2,450-metre long elevated road project, work over 1,250-metre stretch was initiated due to land availability. An official said, "The civic body has started work to remove 650 structures from the proposed corridor. So far, 150m stretch has been cleared for construction". The scheme for the affected owners will be developed on 26,051 sq m land at a cost of Rs 6.5 crore. "JDA is also organizing camps to complete the allotment process of the affected house owners. The rehabilitation work will be completed soon," he added. With this, the work of the entire project can be completed by December 2022. In the 2016-2017 budget, BJP government had announced construction of elevated road to give relief to commuters travelling to Phalna’s Jhotwara. The road is proposed to ease traffic in one of the most congested areas of the city and provide relief to more than 6 lakh residents. The project is crucial as the narrow flyover has become a major bottleneck. As no land is available on either side, JDA is left with no option but to construct an elevated road. For the project, JDA has also taken a loan of Rs 119 crore. In July 2018, the then chief minister Vasundhara Raje laid the foundation stone for the project which was expected to be completed within 30 months. "If the project is not completed on time, the installments of an incomplete project might pinch JDA," said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/structures-falling-on-jhotwara-elevated-corridor-will-be-razed/articleshow/87823521.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Thespian Vikram Gokhale’s remarks sign of Marathi theatre’s shift in Mumbai?||MUMBAI: Thespian Vikram Gokhale has been earning more brickbats than bouquets for wading into the controversy sparked by actor Kangana Ranaut's recent statement that India won its real Independence not in 1947 but in 2014. Gokhale on Friday riled “pseudo-secularism” and heaped praise on PM Modi. Gokhale seemed unfazed by the avalanche of criticism on social media as also a statement by prominent theatre persons such as Shanta Gokhale, Arun Naik, Achyut Vaze and cultural chronicler Amarendra Nandu Dhaneshwar, among others, rebuking him for his "erratic" views. Naik wondered if Gokhale’s statement was a grim reminder that the Marathi theatre was set to shift from robust nationalism of the past to radical Hindutva. "Earlier, playwrights Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, V W Shirwadkar, the Jnanpith laureate, and Vasant Kanetkar, for instance, would dip into Maratha history to sharpen public consciousness on national issues—especially, the British imperialism. Plays depicting the life and times of Chhatrapati Shivaji, his son and successor Sambhaji, Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi and Maharani Padmini tugged at the heartstrings of the Marathi ‘manoos’ for decades. However, Mumbai's cultural environment was inclusive," said Naik on Saturday. Dhaneshwar recalled the 1970s when avante garde Marathi theatre, enriched by the plays of Ionesco and Sophocles, Vijay Tendulkar, Mahesh Elkunchwar and Satish Alekar co-existed with its commercial counterpart and the former ensured a steady supply of talented actors and writers to the latter. “Today, Marathi theatre seems bereft of ideas which will shape modern sensibilities of theatre aficionados,” said Dhaneshwar. Added noted director Pratima Kulkarni: “The bigotry which may have been lurking in the wings has now taken centre stage with a certain brazenness, thanks to efforts by a section to engineer caste and communal divide. This explains politicians’ growing interference in the entertainment sector." Kulkarni emphasizes the need to go beyond the Gokhale row and address basic issues that beset the glamour world. Many think political patronage is the key issue. “The politician-proscenium ties are almost incestuous. The line of distinction is blurred. Artists secretly wish to join politics, while politicians want to be actors. Both feed on each other,” said a senior actor. Insiders claimed befriending a ‘mantri’ has several benefits for artists. For instance, prompt payment from production houses. In return, actors have to perform at a politician's birthday bash or at a poll rally, it is learnt. On the other hand, politicians, unsure of their popularity, feel compelled to tap the glamour quotient to consolidate their vote-bank, the actor said. While small-time actors keep fawning on politicians for survival, the smart Alecs, with several big-ticket television serials and hit plays under their belt, cast the net wider -- a Padma award, a Sangeet Natak Academy fellowship, a top slot in the National School of Drama, a foreign trip, a seat in the Rajya Sabha, it is said. Dhaneshwar said the state should not get involved in finalizing the Padma list of awardees. Veterans recalled that political patronage was marked by sobriety in the past when Marathi theatre was led by giants such as PL Deshpande, Vijaya Mehta and Shreeram Lagoo, among others. Congress stalwarts YB Chavan, Vasantrao Naik, Sharad Pawar and Vilasrao Deshmukh had excellent ties with writers and actors. Said actor-director Vishwas Sohoni: “To remember the world of Mumbai theatre--whether Marathi, Gujarati or English—which oozed home-spun charm is not merely an exercise in nostalgia. It's a fact which we sorely miss today. Actors worked as clerks in banks or BMC during the day and wore the grease paint in the evening, and the transformation was incredible. An artiste would keep a politician at an arm's length and the latter too behaved with dignity. Chavan was an ardent admirer of PL Deshpande and VW Shirwadkar; but neither of them ever angled for a seat in the Rajya Sabha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/thespians-remarks-sign-of-marathi-theatres-shift-in-mumbai/articleshow/87824666.cms||Ambarish Mishra

The meet aimed to finalise steps to control the mosquito menace at the border through the cooperation of the state programme control officers. It was chaired by EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Anand said that the mosquitoes menace at the border area could only be resolved with mutual cooperation. “The joint efforts in this regard will reduce the morbidity and mortality due to vector-borne diseases. Officers from both sides said that they have received complaints from the public about irregular/incomplete coverage in many areas as there is no clear-cut distinction of the Delhi-UP border and EDMC employees often get confused with the area jurisdiction,” said the official. The official further added that in the meeting, the matter of proper notification of cross-border dengue cases who have treatment in the other state was also discussed. After hearing problems from both sides, the EDMC commissioner was directed to make a common portal for all such cases with access to both state programme officers. “If a patient of a state gets treatment from the other state, their details can be filled in the portal. The details, specially the patients’ addresses, will be available to officers of both states. Accordingly, insecticides can be sprayed by the authorities concerned near the patient’s house to control the breeding of mosquitoes,” stated the EDMC official. Officials from the National Institute of Malaria Research and Delhi government also attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-on-guard-for-mosquito-menace-in-border-areas/articleshow/87824665.cms||---

Cut to November, and you can consider yourself lucky to find a table on weekends. Regardless of the cuisine being served, many of the restaurants find themselves packed to capacity on weekends apart from the long queue of orders through food delivery apps. Dilip Kamdar, a city businessman who owns a chain of restaurants, hotels and banquet halls, said, “It’s almost like revenge eating because people have been literally locked up inside for a long time. They went through phases of cooking different recipes by watching YouTube videos, but that too has passed now. So, people are flocking back to their favourite restaurants, to try their favourite dishes. That familiarity of taste, environment becomes a comfort zone.” But in Nagpur, at least, this unprecedented rush is being witnessed mostly at popular food outlets with the excess then spilling over to others. For Aditya Bhaiya, an interior designer, the fun of eating out can never be compared with that of home delivery. “For months we all stayed indoors due to the pandemic, but now with vaccination and proper precaution, it’s safe to eat outside. The ambience, the smell of different flavours coming from the kitchen, seeing other people in good mood has a positive effect on everyone. So, I have definitely started eating out more as compared to last year,” said Bhaiya. Dining out is about wholesome experience for Yugal Rayalu, a senior academic. “Think of a place like Indian Coffee House. People don’t go there only for food, it’s an intellectual experience because of the interaction with others. After being forced to stay inside our houses for a long time, it is only natural that as social animals we will seek out such places,” said Rayalu. It’s now a common practice for many restaurants to stop accepting orders on food delivery apps because of the growing rush. Be it south Indian outlets in the morning or any other restaurant during dinner time, “not accepting orders” is being flashed more now on consumers mobile apps. Arpit Gota, a university student is trying new restaurants over the old ones. “The lockdown has forced me to try new things while I can. Home delivery is a safe option, but dining outside is more relaxing and restaurants have their own feel,” said Arpit. Another student Niral Gaikwad goes out to eat once every week with his family. “At first we were hesitant but since the cases are under control, we are not that worried. We usually go to the restaurants we know, but I do like to try new places sometimes. Some people prefer home delivery. For me, it’s fun to dress up and dine out as it uplifts my moods,” said Niral. Academic Santosh Asia said, “Post Covid lockdown, people prefer dine-in so that they can spend some good time with their family/friends.” Ashwini Lanjewar, an HR professional said, “Going out gives an escape from the monotonous routine and you get to see your friends and loved ones. I feel people are choosing to eat out more than before as there are more options and they feel safer than before because of the reducing cases.” According to Karan Tuli, a city-based businessman who owns restaurants in Mumbai and Delhi, the peak rush is yet to come. “As the days go by, we will see more and more people back in restaurants. Currently, dining is expensive because of high fuel prices and overall inflation. But as things start to settle down, we expect more people to flock back in,” said Tuli. Prerna Singh, a housewife, said dining out is better because of many reasons. “The taste of freshly-cooked food is much different. Rotis don’t turn into rubber and many times the badly packed food creates a mess. Then it’s a task to shift everything in containers, layout the plates etc which is almost like cooking at home. So, for housewives, going out is a much-needed change,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-stopping-foodies-now-popular-restaurants-packed-to-full-capacity/articleshow/87824083.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In a letter to MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes, Goacan has pointed out that during the fortnight, its volunteers have been making special checks of pay toilets at bus stands, markets and other public places to check for cleanliness, safety, display of rates, mandatory signage and facilities for senior citizens, women, and persons with disabilities. Goacan coordinator Roland Martins, in the letter, said that the public pay toilet in the municipal garden is not accessible as the gate of the garden is locked. On checking with the staff present there, Martins said, Goacan volunteers were informed that the garden is closed to the public due to Covid restrictions. The letter has stated that as the state government has now relaxed many conditions for movement of the public and since the municipal garden is a space for recreation it would be appropriate for the MMC to take proactive steps in that matter. The letter also pointed out that the charges for a single use of the urinal at the public pay toilet opposite Fatima Convent has been raised to Rs 3 and the signage for the same is so small that it is not readable by the user. Goacan has requested MMC to prepare a list of the public toilets in its jurisdiction with their serial numbers and locations and display it on signboards at prominent places in the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-body-urged-to-maintain-public-toilets/articleshow/87824102.cms||---

Villagers are now scared to go to their farmlands for daily agricultural work. Uttam Desai, a resident of the Uchangi village in Ajara tehsil, said, “On Thursday night, a tusker damaged the power tiller kept in the field of a farmer named Yashoda Kalekar. The animal trampled on sugar cane and paddy fields and has also destroyed he rice stored after removing the husk. Rice winnowing is being carried out on a large scale in the Ajara region now. Already the unseasonal showers have created problems and that the tusker menace has compounded our problems.” The farmers are scared of going to their fields as the tuskers are taking shelter in the sugar cane farms. Meanwhile, the forest department officials have advised the villagers to take precautions while going out at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tusker-menace-in-kolhapurs-ajara-region-continues/articleshow/87822387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was inaugurating the socio-economic survey being conducted by the Kerala state commission for economically-backward classes among forward communities. “When 10% reservation is newly introduced, it won’t affect the reservation enjoyed by others. There are deliberate attempts from quarters to create a wrong notion in society about this. They claim that the new reservation would torpedo the existing reservation. Those who try to divide society by blowing it up as an emotional issue are only trying to divert the attention from the real issue,” he said. “People belonging to SC/ ST categories and those educationally and socially backward get reservation in government service. That would continue. Each community would get their due reservation,” he added. The chief minister also criticised the arguments that reservation should be given only on caste basis. “The decision to introduce reservation for the economically-weaker sections in forward communities has been taken in view of social reality. It’s wrong to say that reservation given to a particular section would affect the prospects of other communities already enjoying the fruits of reservation. Everybody has the right for better living conditions,” he said. A section in the non-reservation category is in abject poverty, the CM said. The central government too has issued orders that permit the state government to make changes in reservation norms, based on the ground realities in each state. The survey intends to collect information on the socioeconomical condition of 164 categories among non-reservation communities. “The information sought in the survey will be collected only from those willing to associate with the process. None would be forced to participate in the survey. It’s not mandatory at all. Only those willing to share their information may participate in the survey,” he said. The survey would be conducted at the local body ward level by identifying five families that fit into the category. Information on around one lakh families would thus be collected, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/quota-for-forward-castes-not-at-the-cost-of-others-pinarayi/articleshow/87823538.cms||---

The strike by the MSRTC staffers from Kolhapur district is expected to escalate as the state government has adopted stringent measures against the agitating employees. Amid the strike, the fares of the private transport vehicles have gone up by three to four times. Aniket Jadhav, a passenger at Dabholkar corner, said, “The cost of travelling from Kolhapur to Pune is almost the same as the flight ticket between Kolhapur and Mumbai. The private buses are demanding Rs 2,000 for the travel. Private cab operators are also overcharging.” On Friday, some employees were detained by the police and its repercussions were felt on Saturday. The employees gathered at the bus stand were vocal about their demands. In the meantime, the buses between Chandgad and Shinoli started plying and completed two rounds on Saturday. Avinash Chopade, member of MSRTC workers union, said, “We continued with our protest at the MSRTC bus stand premises for our long-pending demand to merge the transport utility into state government. The strike has now completed 13 days in Kolhapur and still the state government is not showing any positive approach towards our demands.” He added that the state government should keep its politics aside and try to meet their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/travel-costs-pinch-pockets-as-msrtc-stir-enters-day-14/articleshow/87822377.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Zipping vehicles wreck human lives! Today, time to mull over it||MUMBAI: Teertha Patel would have turned 12 this month. The days in the run up to her birthday were always spent by the family together. But this year, her father, Nitin, spent the time doing rounds of a police station instead. Nitin has been on a crusade to get justice for his daughter who was killed in a road crash on February 1. The father-daughter duo had stepped out to feed birds at Kandivali East when a speeding motorcyclist rammed into them. Like Teertha, 21-year-old Dikshant Mhashelkar was also a victim of speeding. An employee of a five-star hotel and the sole earning member in his family, Dikshant was riding home from work when a truck hit his motorcycle at Goregaon East on April 15. The truck driver later admitted to the Mhashelkar family that he wasn't able to control the speed of his vehicle in time. Seven months since the crash, the truck driver has been released on bail but the Mhashelkars are still struggling to come to terms with their loss. On World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims observed on November 21, both families want the authorities to promote action to curb speeding and eventually stop further crash deaths. "Redesigning streets to prioritize vulnerable road users and lower speeds is the most effective tool to reduce traffic fatalities on our streets," said Abhimanyu Prakash, senior program manager with US-based National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), a partner of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety. Globally, cities are lowering their urban speed limits through a combination of policy frameworks, enforcement, street design and communication. "There is ample data representing their success in reducing traffic crashes. Street design and infrastructural changes act as a self-enforcing tool, reducing room for error and creating space for managing crashes that might still happen due to human error," Prakash said. A report released in 2020 by International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP), a registered charity, shows that 819 lives are lost in India per day and the financial cost to the health system, economy and families could run up to 101 million USD daily. The report also shows that on 96% of Indian roads, that are used by pedestrians and where traffic flows at 40kmph or more, there are no formal footpaths. "We have been campaigning for greater focus on prevention of injuries and disabilities caused by road crashes. If scoop stretchers (an ideal device for carrying casualties with possible spinal injuries) can be placed at crash-prone locations and basic training is given to citizens on how to carry crash victims correctly and move them to hospitals within the golden hour, we could prevent permanent disabilities," said Dr Ketna Mehta, whose non-profit group, Nina Foundation, works for individuals with spinal cord injuries. Mehta adds that a majority of people that her non-profit helped rehabilitate over the years, had suffered spinal cord injuries as a result of road crashes. The annual cost of fatalities and serious injuries is 5.6 per cent of India's GDP, according to the iRAP report. By investing 0.26% of the GDP annually from 2020 to 2030, fatalities and serious injuries can be reduced, the report suggests. For some of the survivors of road crashes, getting through their daily routine has become an uphill task. Rahil Shaikh, who was rendered paraplegic after a vehicular collision in 2005, had to drop out of college and could barely find any employment opportunities thereafter. Shaikh, 38, is wheelchair-bound and does not venture out of his house at Dockyard Road on his own as "Mumbai streets not being universally accessible are dangerous for the disabled." For the same reason, he cannot take a train or bus, which severely limits his work options. "One of the objectives of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is also to advocate for better support for survivors of traffic crashes. Losing control over bodily functions among individuals with spinal cord injuries could have an impact on their mental health as well," added Dr Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaizipping-vehicles-wreck-human-lives-today-time-to-mull-over-it/articleshow/87824680.cms||Nitasha Natu

These facilities are leased out once every three years. Upon successful bidding, the lessees have to pay the lease amount to the civic body. The amount would be increased by 5% every year.With the previous three-year tenure ending, the corporation had thrice initiated steps to lease the facilities in the past three years. However, it could not complete the bidding process because of lack of interest among the bidders. “One of the reasons the bidders cited was the high deposit amount. Hence, we have brought it down,” an official told TOI.As per the revised charges, the official said, the deposit amount for the air-conditioned waiting hall at Mettupalayam bus terminal would be Rs 2.5 lakh, against Rs 5 lakh earlier. “Similarly, the deposit amount for Singanallur weekly shanty has come down to Rs 1.37 lakh from Rs 2.75 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-cuts-deposit-for-facilities-to-be-leased-out-by-half/articleshow/87824101.cms||---

The dissident leaders had served an ultimatum on Wednesday demanding state president Shreyams Kumar’s resignation from the post before November 20. Attending a press conference after the meeting, Kumar said the party has taken a serious view of the anti-party activities of the rebel leaders. “For such a violation of discipline, show-cause notices would be issued to the office bearers, including the three district presidents and the state committee members who attended the meeting. However, the party is not shutting the doors at them, and they can come back by rectifying their mistakes,” said Kumar. He said the state committee has rejected their demand for the resignation of the state president. “As many as 11 district committees, and office bearers, except the four dissidents, party MLA KP Mohanan and national secretary Varghese Geroge attended the meeting,” said Kumar. Even as the official side claimed that it had the support of 11 district committees, as many as seven district committee members did not turn up for the meeting. The leaders, however, claimed in the press conference that some of them had offered formal explanations. Kumar said that the party was giving the dissident leaders a chance to explain themselves and if their explanations were not satisfactory, they would face action. Harris, at a press meet in Alappuzha, dismissed the party’s claims. “Only those who have committed a mistake can rectify it. We have not committed any mistakes…as per the constitution of the party such a meeting has no power to make those decisions. Such decisions should be made at the state council or state executive meeting,” said Harris. Although the dissidents had claimed the support of its lone MLA KP Mohanan and national leader Varghese George, both attended the press conference and offered support to the official side. The dissidents had blamed Kumar for the party missing out on getting a cabinet berth when all the other LDF constituents were given due consideration. The dissidents were also unhappy over the corporation and board president posts given to the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rift-deepens-within-ljd-dissidents-served-notice/articleshow/87823551.cms||---

College girls will be asked to wear dupatta and teachers have to ensure their compliance with the dress code.” From Monday, she said, the students wouldn’t be allowed on the college campus before and after the college hours. “Teachers must avoid calling the students to staff rooms and all the academic matters should be conveyed in the classroom itself. In the case of unavoidable circumstances, a student must accompany another while going to the staff room to meet a teacher.”Kalaiselvi said many department heads had stressed on the importance of making the students wear ‘decent’ dress. “Girls should not come to the college wearing leggings, jeans and tight outfits. Boys too should not wear jeans on the college campus.” When asked if the dress code would demoralise the girl students, who are already victimised, Kalaiselvi said there was nothing new and all the guidelines were already in place for the government college students. “We are just enforcing them now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-college-to-enforce-dress-code/articleshow/87824099.cms||---

And after one-and-a-half years of struggle, the Union government understood that it could not go ahead and, therefore, decided to repeal the Acta,” Raut said while addressing the reporters during his tour of Nashik. Raut said the three laws were more in the favour of the corporates who could get the control over land, than the farmers who own the land. “The farmers braved the sun, wind and water during their agitation and forced the government to withdraw th laws, thus earning freedom for themselves from the ‘clutches’ of the corporate ‘jamindari’,” Raut said. Raut pointed out that farmers from across the country (not just two states) were supporting the agitators. “The government claimed that only the farmers from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh were agitating. However, farmers from across the country were supporting them,” he said. On the agitation by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, Raut said transport minister Anil Parab is looking into the situation and hoped that the problems of each employee would be attended to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/raut-repeal-of-farm-laws-is-freedom-for-farmers/articleshow/87822402.cms||Abhilash Botekar

I am ready to contribute to the same even in future,” Fadnavis told reporters during his visit to Nashik on Saturday. Fadnavis said during his earlier interactions, he had pointed out the issues that the government had to focus on to resolve the strike. He added that the opposition was ready to discuss the situation whenever the government wanted, and it had no vested interest in the strike. “The merger is a difficult task and the current situation is also not very good. We have, therefore, provided a mean solution to the government. It is for the government to act on,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis added that he has held a discussion with the government on the financial implications of the solutions provided, and if the government required anything more for the resolution of issues, he was ready to help.

He said that the farmers braved all odds to continue their agitation for protecting the farm sector and it was a non-political agitation and the Congress did not want to politicize the agitation though some people are claiming that their support to the agitation led to the victory. The AICC general secretary criticized the LDF government in Kerala for not bringing down the tax on petroleum products thus supporting the BJP government at the Centre who are hiking the price almost every day. The meeting was presided over by DCC president A Thankappan and addressed by KPCC working president and MP Kodikunnil Suresh and MPs V K Sreekandan and Ramya Haridas, KPCC vice-president V T Balram, Youth Congress state president and MLA Shafi Parambil, among others. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/farmers-defeated-centres-hidden-agenda/articleshow/87823559.cms||---

Presently, he said, students from 24 colleges have registered with the club.“We have more than 1,200 students who are trained to assist the traffic police in regulating traffic at major junctions. We have also created a team of 25 students to take out road safety awareness campaigns in the city,” he said.Rajasekaran said a section of students from three colleges were actively participating in regulating traffic and monitoring no-parking violations on Cross Cut Road, Town Hall and Oppanakkara Street, to name a few. While attributing the traffic snarls during the peak hours to the ongoing construction work of flyover on Trichy Road and elevated corridor on Avinashi Road, S R Senthilkumar, city deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said it was not easy for a traffic cop alone to regulate the traffic on Avinashi Road. “We are planning to rope in college students from the Uyir Club in the next week and deploy them at various junctions on Avinashi Road and other stretches during the peak hours in the evening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/college-students-to-be-roped-in-to-man-traffic/articleshow/87824107.cms||A Subburaj

Dakshina Kannada district health officer (DHO) Dr Kishore Kumar M cited several instances of people, initially fearful of the vaccine’s purported side-effects, being persuaded to take the jab by the Lasika Mitras. “In fact, a clerk who was reluctant to get herself jabbed agreed to take the vaccine after Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) health officer Dr Annayya Kulal convinced her. The clerk was reportedly hesitant to take the jab since she was allergic to medicines. There are several such cases wherein government doctors have gone the extra mile, allayed fears among the people, and got them to take the vaccine. During their visit to the residents’ homes, our staff have come across elderly citizens on medication for other disorders expressing reservations about taking the vaccine fearing adverse effects,” Dr Kishore Kumar said. Lasika Mitra campaign was launched on November 10 by the department of health and family welfare, which is being assisted in its endeavour by the MCC and the Mangalore University’s National Service Scheme. Nearly 3,000 volunteers from 35 colleges have been calling on people at their homes, and convincing people to take the vaccine, and protect themselves against Covid. “The results are encouraging, and we hope that the NSS volunteers remain a part of this campaign till the end of November. While we vaccinated around 5,000 to 7,000 people per day earlier, the number has risen to ten thousand since the launch of this initiative,” Dr Kishore Kumar said. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar, meanwhile, said that the services of NSS volunteers had also been enlisted for the ‘Har Ghar Dastak (door-to-door vaccination)’ campaign, launched on November 3 and slated to end on November 30. “They have been tasked with answering the helpline at our Covid War Room, among other duties,” he said. As on Friday, administration of 24.9 lakh doses of Covid vaccine have been recorded in Dakshina Kannada, of which 9.4 lakh were for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/lasika-mitra-campaign-helps-combat-vaccine-hesitancy-among-dk-people/articleshow/87822974.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

As late as April 2021, well into the second wave, the state's share of the national toll was just 1.4%. In September, the state's share of Covid casualties suddenly shot up to 45.2%, soaring further to 64.7% the next month. For the first time, Kerala's share of deaths had surpassed its contribution to new cases - 56% - to the country's Covid count. More than 80% of the October data, however, was backlog - deaths that had occurred much earlier but were not reported as Covid-induced, partly because of insufficient documentation and more due to the state's alleged unwillingness to acknowledge co-morbidities as an inevitable factor in fatalities caused by the virus. Official data for 21 days from October 22 till November 11 shows that "reconciled deaths" comprised 84% of the state's daily toll. Of the 7,838 deaths reported in these three weeks, only 1,257 were new cases, while 6,581 deaths were from the past months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-backlog-deaths-kerala-makes-up-65-of-oct-covid-toll/articleshow/87825151.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Coimbatore||GST cut on man-made fibre will help reduce cost of finished goods: SIMA||Coimbatore: Welcoming the Union government’s move to reduce the goods and services tax (GST) rate on man-made fibre (MMF) to 12% from 18%, the Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) said it would help bring the cost of finished goods down.There was a demand from the industrial players to bring the entire synthetic textile value chain under the 5% GST slab, as in the case of cotton textile value chain.In a notification on Thursday, the Union finance ministry had brought all the textile goods, except cotton and cotton yarn that would continue to attract 5% GST rate, under 12% GST rate. Ravi Sam, chairman, SIMA, thanked the Centre for production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for certain man-made fibre, garments and technical textiles, extending the incentives ranging from 7% to 15%.With this, he said, the government had fulfilled both the prerequisites for removing anti-dumping duty on MMF raw material and fibres, while addressing the inverted duty issues. When GST was introduced in 2017, he said, the Centre had brought the entire cotton textile value chain and job work services under 5% GST rate. The synthetic value chain, however, had inverted duty structure issues, as the fibre attracted 18% GST, yarn 12% GST, fabric 5% GST and garments below Rs 1,000 per piece 5% GST and garment above Rs 1,000 12% GST.“This resulted in huge accumulation of input tax. The PLI scheme has addressed the anti-dumping duty and inverted duty issues. The reform will help MMF value chain become globally competitive,” Sam said.He said while the global consumption of cotton and MMF fibre was in the ratio of 35:65, the same was 65:35 in India, as the MMF raw material and fibre was expensive. “Retaining 5% GST for cotton and cotton yarn will benefit the cotton farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/gst-cut-on-man-made-fibre-will-help-reduce-cost-of-finished-goods-sima/articleshow/87824110.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune is 5th cleanest city in India: Survey||PUNE: In a huge improvement over its 15th rank last year, Pune secured fifth position among the cities with more than 10 lakh population in the Union government’s cleanliness survey this year. As a municipal corporation, with 1 lakh-plus population, Pune ranked eighth. Pimpri Chichwad too bettered its ranking, securing 19th spot this year as against 24th in 2020 in the 10 lakh-plus category. The survey was conducted the ‘Swachh Survekshan 2021’ by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Pune scored 4,900.94 points and also bagged an award of best self-sustainable big city, while Pimpri Chinchwad scored 3,874.20 points. A total of 48 cities were surveyed in the category of 10-40 lakh population on various parameters, including feedback from citizens. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol attributed the improvement in ranking to the collective efforts by the administration and citizens. Similar efforts should continue in future as well, Mohol said, adding, “The city managed to secure better ranking when the administration, as well as citizens, were facing the challenge of Covid-19 pandemic.” Over 25 indicators divided in three sections were considered for ranking of the cities. Some of the key indicators were segregation, processing and disposal of garbage, besides sustainable sanitation. The citizens’ voice was a combination of citizens’ feedback, engagement, their experience, innovation and practices. The city scored over 1,540 points out of 1,800 in citizens’ voice category, while it achieved 3-star rank in garbage-free initiative. City-based citizens’ groups, however, said though the city’s ranking has improved, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) faces a challenge of handling additional garbage from 23 merged villages. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “The rankings should reflect at the ground level. Else, it will just remain on paper. The PMC has still not been able to handle daily garbage. The garbage processing units are not working at full capacities. The PMC should conduct a detailed audit of every unit. Now, there is a challenge to treat garbage from 23 merged villages.” Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner at PMC, said, “The processing of waste has gone up and will see more improvement in the days to come. We are collecting garbage from 23 villages, which earlier used to be dumped at various locations. The bigger societies in the city are asked to treat the waste garbage within their premises. The segregation has also been improved.” Nashik trips on the chartNashik bagged the 17th spot in the nationwide cleanliness survey. The city was ranked 11th in the country in last year's survey. Nashik civic body commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the city could not do well in areas of garbage-free city rating and citizens’ feedback. “But we will improve in these two areas during Swachh Survekshan 2022 and improve our ranking to make it among the top 10 cleanest cities in the country,” he said. Aurangabad fares betterAurangabad improved its national ranking in the cleanliness survey to 22nd position among cities with more than 10 lakh population in India. Last year, the city was ranked 26th. It also received the ‘Gold nomination’, a new category introduced on the basis of six select indicator-wise performance criteria, including segregation of waste.

---||Navi-mumbai||Mumbai: Vegetable prices soar as unseasonal rain hits crop||NAVI MUMBAI: Vegetable prices have soared in both wholesale and retail markets due to short supply caused by unseasonal rain and damaged crops. Prices of a key kitchen staple, tomato, skyrocketed and were sold at Rs 50, the highest in the season at the APMC wholesale market yard, on Saturday, which pushed retail prices between Rs 70 and 100 a kg in the MMR. Other vegetables are being retailed at Rs 60-80 per kg due to sudden spurt of prices at the wholesale market. APMC wholesale traders attributed the sharp spike in the prices of key kitchen staples, like tomatoes, to unseasonal downpour in major producing areas besides recent rain in the South. With scanty supply and an increase in demand these days , prices have gone through the roof. The wholesale price of tomato at Vashi market was hovering between Rs 30-40 kg a week ago. A Vashi resident Nilesh Patil said, “Kitchen budget has been disturbed with the rise in vegetable prices.” Prices of other vegetables like beans, capsicum, brinjal, lady’s fingers are in the range of Rs 60-80. Mumbai APMC director Shankar Pingle said that “Rain has been the sole reason for soaring vegetable prices. Majority of crops have been damaged. We heavily depend on local produce from various parts of the state now since a very few truckloads arrive from Bangalore and parts of South India. The price will further go up until the fresh crops hit the market in the next fortnight.” Harvesting of fresh crops has been delayed which is one of the major reasons for the price hike besides substantial damages to the buffer stock. We have to wait for a few more days to get some relief from price rise,” said APMC trader Balasaheb Badade. A retailer from Mulund Shirish Pawar said, “Most of the vegetable prices have increased by 30-40 percent in the last one week. Our regular consumers have expressed resentment over the price trend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-vegetable-prices-soar-as-unseasonal-rain-hits-crop/articleshow/87824692.cms||B B Nayak

According to the government directive, the tehsildar of the respective talukas have disbursed the amount to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries,” said resident deputy collector Himmat Kharade. According to officials, the relief amount is for farmers to be rebuild their homes that were damaged during the cyclone. Regarding the delay in disbursing the compensation, Kharade refused to comment. A senior administration official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The government had already paid the compensation of Rs 29 crore for crop damage in October 2020. However, a separate proposal on house damages was sent later. This compensation has been sanctioned now.” Meanwhile, farmers said the district administration should have inspected the damaged properties and sent the proposal early to the government. “How can they release the compensation after almost 17 months? No farmer could wait for so long. The government should have prioritised this matter to help distressed farmers. Now, many of them have taken loans and rebuilt their houses,” said a beneficiary from Khed who did not wish to be named. Another farmer from Junnar said the compensation amount will not cover their expenses. “The cost of building construction material is high. The disbursed amount is not sufficient to cover the expenses,” said Dada Rokade, an activist from Junnar.

The rise in Covid-19 cases among school students has created panic among parents and students. Officials at the School Directorate in Bikaner said the alternate-day classes formula in place since October didn’t cause any problem for the schools and the parents. "The overcrowding is a major problem in schools, which was understood after the Covid-19 outbreak. The normal strength of students ranges between 40-60 students in a room, where they end up sitting almost next to each other," said an official, based on the feedback they were receiving from schools. In this situation, social distancing is not possible for any school except for those whose strength is under 30 in every class, the official said. The official hinted that they are likely to take a call to put the onus of deciding the strength of students on school as per their class sizes. "Every person is fully aware of Covid protocols. The state can give the broad guidelines, but schools and parents have to evaluate the situation as per the infrastructure," said an official, adding that they were monitoring the Covid cases among students on daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/edu-dept-mulls-allowing-schools-to-fix-student-strength/articleshow/87823568.cms||---

Our only concern is about Hindu girls being misused in the name of interfaith marriages. The girl has told us that even if she marries, she will not change her religion. We have tried our best to convince her, by presenting before her several examples,” he said. Meanwhile, sources close to the family said that all the necessary preparations for the wedding have been made.

With the rollout of this facility, a person can book an appointment for any specific medical department at the hospital’s official website -- https://www.gdmcuk.com/. The move is a part of the hospital management information system initiative -- mooted by the Uttarakhand health ministry. Under the initiative, government hospitals are encouraged to roll out online facilities for the ease of patients. “We have initially started the online appointment facility on a trial basis. It will be fully implemented from December. Patients can book appointments and register for other facilities through our website,” said Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent, GDMCH. The rollout of this facility is expected to ease the burden at physical counters where patients, sometimes, have to wait for their turn in long queues. According to officials, the hospital, on an average, witnesses a footfall of nearly 4,000 people every day. “The rollout of the online facility is a big relief as there have been times when people have waited for 40 minutes or so just to receive the doctor’s appointment. I would also save a lot of time in getting appointments for my father, who is suffering from arthritis,” said Manoj Bisht, who had come to the hospital for his father’s treatment. Meanwhile, GDMCH is also about to receive its first MRI machine next month. Currently, any patient in need of an MRI scan is referred to a higher centre.

The civic body earned only 2308.41 points out of 6,000. Cities are ranked on three parameters - service-level progress (efficiency in solid waste management), certifications (garbage-free city and open defecation-free) and citizen’s voice. Coimbatore secured 1,079.98 out of 2,400 points in the service-level progress, 928.43 in citizen’s voice and 300 in certification. “While the city earned good marks in the citizen’s voice category, it was found deficient in certifications,” corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said. “Issues in door-to-door garbage collection and streamlining waste collection failed the civic body.” The civic body needs to improve solid waste collection, said G S Kalidoss, a resident of Gandhi Managar. “Garbage has been piling up on streets as they are not frequently cleaned. Residents should behave responsibly to improve garbage disposal,” he told TOI. Expressing reservations about the new ranking, activist K Kathirmathiyon said he did not experience any significant degradation in cleanliness. “I am not a big fan of Swachh rankings as I don’t believe they are carried out in a transparent manner. However, the garbage problem should be sorted out,” he said. Among other cities in Tamil Nadu, Chennai secured the 43rd rank with a score of 2,781. Madurai was at 47th with a score of 2,207. The corporation has received guidelines for the next year’s ranking, Sunkara said. “Neutral teams will inspect city neighbourhoods between January and March next year and chart out plans to improve the next ranking. We want residents to support us in waste segregation and disposal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-fares-poorly-in-swachh-survey/articleshow/87824118.cms||---

On the eve of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on Saturday, Singh highlighted the importance of how to deal with an accident victim. “There is so much apprehension among people about helping accident victims, though the first few hours after the accident are crucial. The basics of assisting a road-accident victim should be a part of the school curriculum,” said Singh. Singh worked hard to overcome his physical liabilities. He now works with an MNC and also runs his own business. When his motorcycle skidded and hit the kerb, he broke his ribs and injured his spine, leaving his lower limbs paralysed. “I started to feel useless, but resisted that despair. As a sportsperson, I kept at it. Hospital visits for many months for physiotherapy enabled me to move with a walker,” said Singh. “I think the one thing we need to focus on is how to handle accident victims, from lifting them to shifting them to hospital. Even the caregivers in hospitals should be trained on how to deal with a critical case.” Singh also said the concept of being paralysed, therefore, disabled had to be challenged. “We need empathy. People celebrate medals won by Paralympic athletes. In the same way they should empathise with us, not pity us,” declared Singh. Behind every fatal road crash is a story of human beings whose dreams and hopes are crushed, pointed out Piyush Tewari, founder & CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, which works with accident victims and also instructs people on how to take care of accident victims.  “The worst affected are children, who rely on us adults to keep them safe. On the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, I want to remind our policymakers that the million deaths in road accidents in the past decade are not a number, but a monumental collection of human stories that were abruptly cut short,” said Tewari. Do-gooders at the accident site are crucial in saving lives. One such person is 36-year old Naveen Mittal, associate professor at Shri Ram College of Commerce. Since 2009, he has saved five lives, after earlier ignoring the pleas of an accident victim. “I was 22 when a pillion rider fell at the Nangloi and Peeragarhi traffic junction and was hit by a truck. The rider kept pleading for help, but I was reluctant. The guilt wracked me,” said Mittal.  “After googling about organisations that helped accident victims. I trained at SaveLIFE Foundation and have been help a number of accident hit since then.” Mittal also carries essential medications and medical equipment in his car for any emergency use. “Everyone must save lives. Today it may be someone else, but tomorrow it could be me or a family member,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-to-help-an-accident-victim-teach-kids-at-school-urges-one/articleshow/87823592.cms||Sakshi Chand

The surveillance staff of Sayajigunj police station had received information that the couple was to come to Fatehgunj to sell the jewellery. Based on the information, police kept a watch and nabbed the two when they arrived. Cops recovered the stolen jewellery, Rs 5,000 cash and two mobile phones from the couple. The jewellery was stolen from a woman from Surendranagar, Rashida Dawoodi, while she was boarding a bus at GSRTC (Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation) bus station in the city. Dawoodi was boarding a bus for her home in Limbdi taluka of Surendranagar district when the couple took advantage of the crowd and stole a box containing the gold jewellery from her handbag. The jewellery belonged to Dawoodi’s daughter Arwa, who was also with her. The incident took place on November 11, but as Dawoodi had to reach home, she left then. She came back to Vadodara on Friday and lodged a complaint of theft at Sayajigunj police station. Dawoodi had gone to Madhya Pradesh to spend some days at her daughter’s home. To reach Surendranagar, the mother-daughter duo came to Vadodara by train and had planned to take a bus for Surendranagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couple-held-for-stealing-gold-jewellery-from-bus-station/articleshow/87823040.cms||---

The mood was celebratory in Kakarla village in Julurupadu mandal when the bus service resumed. All it took was a tweet by local youth Chevulu Balaraju, who asked the authorities as to why his village should be deprived of bus services. TSRTC MD VC Sajjanar took note of the tweet and directed RTC to explore the possibility of resuming the bus services. The bus services were discontinued due to bad road conditions. In another instance, a new bus service was introduced in Namapuram village in Nalgonda district. Further, on Saturday, a school bus service was inaugurated in Palair in Khammam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bus-services-get-green-signal-in-kothagudem-village-after-12-yrs/articleshow/87823594.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The action would however only be announced after a leadership meeting scheduled on November 27 which would take a final call. According to sources, the party inquiry has found lack of coordination at the constituency level as the reason for the loss in constituencies like Azhikode, Kuttiadi and Kozhikode South constituencies. On the other hand, infighting within the party led to the defeat at Kalamassery constituency, the party inquiry report has found, sources said. The report was handed over by various committees appointed for studying the defeat of party candidates in 12 constituencies, including four sitting seats. Before the meeting on Sunday, state general secretary PMA Salam said that the reports of all 12 inquiry committees will be accepted by the leadership meeting. “We had sent three teams to all 14 districts to study the election results. The reports from these visits would also be submitted at the meeting and the required changes, corrections and actions would be discussed in the meeting,” Salam said. An MLA and a state-level office bearer was assigned to study each of the constituencies where IUML had faced defeat. The reports have specified the circumstances in each constituency that led to the defeat. The reports found that the cadres not actively participating in campaigning due to dissatisfaction over candidate selection resulted in the defeat. Sources said that there is a likelihood of re-organising constituency-level committees where the party faced setbacks due to infighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/lapses-by-party-machinery-led-to-losses-in-polls-iuml/articleshow/87823608.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Pune among worst five districts in vaccine wastage in Maharashtra||PUNE: As many as 23 districts in Maharashtra are reporting more vaccine wastage than the state average, with Pune appearing among the worst five performers, recent public health department data has revealed. Pune has shown one of the highest Covishield wastage rates (1.67%) with Yavatmal, Raigad, Washim, Nandurbar and Solapur the other districts with Covishield wastage of over 1%. All these districts are showing net wastage nearing 2%. Mumbai is showing the least net Covishield wastage in Maharashtra at -6.77%. The data showed that Maharashtra’s net Covaxin wastage has increased from 0.72% around November 1 to 0.98% around November 17. Similarly, Covishield net wastage in the state has risen from the negative wastage of -1.09 % to -0.89%. State officials said not only the shortage of auto-disabled (AD) syringes but also the reduction in footfalls have had a role to play in the current situation. A senior state health department official told TOI, “Earlier, only 0.5ml syringes were being used for vaccination, while now 1 or 2 or 3ml syringes are being used. Therefore, slightly higher quantities of the vaccine can inadvertently be extracted from the vials. Thus, the number of beneficiaries getting shots per vial tends to reduce.” The official said vaccination sites have been inoculating every beneficiary turning up at the centres, instead of waiting for 10 people at any point in time. “Vaccination sites are trying not to turn away any beneficiary for want of additional people to make up a total of 10 people per Covishield vial. No wastage occurs if 10 people turn up at a time per Covishield vial. However, when the numbers are lower than 10 once the last vial is opened, the remaining doses have to be discarded,” the official said. Since vaccines being used do not have an “open vial policy” and have to be used within a stipulated time period once the vial has been opened, fewer beneficiaries turning up at a session can cause dose wastage. However, officials said 10% wastage is allowed programmatically. One also has to take into account the human factor in the process of eking out doses from a vial. Therefore, a 5% wastage for a district is not a high percentage, another official said. Dr Sudhakar More, district health officer of Raigad, told TOI, “We have been recently instructed to show on CoWin 10 doses extracted per Covishield vial as the vial essentially contains 10 doses. One extra or 11th dose extracted from the same vial is shown as an additional dose on CoWin. It, thus, seems like it has been extracted from another vial, though it is not the case. It may, therefore, seem like wastage but it isn’t in the real sense. This is a technical issue which is being resolved.” Experts had earlier said the ministry of health and family welfare’s insistence in keeping vaccine wastage below 1% was unrealistic and undesirable. In its response, the ministry had said equitable access to safe and effective vaccines was critical in ending the Covid-19 pandemic. The ministry had also said vaccine development takes a lot of time, and demand for these vaccines exceeds the supply many times. Thus, it is important to monitor and ensure that this precious tool to address the pandemic should be used optimally and judiciously. Therefore, vaccine wastage must be reduced and kept to a minimum level which will further help vaccinate many people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-among-worst-five-dists-in-vaccine-wastage-in-maha/articleshow/87823597.cms||Neha Madaan

The acting civil surgeon of the hospital, Dr Bhusan Kumar Ramtakke, told TOI that the strike was called off on Friday evening after he assured the employees that their demands would be met. The employees had gone on a strike on November 10 following the arrest of a resident doctor of the hospital, Dr Vishaka Shinde, along with three staff nurses in connection with death of Covid patients after a fire broke out in ICU on November 6. All four of them were granted bail by a local court on Friday.Although the doctors and nurses of the hospital attended emergency cases, OPD services were completely paralysed due to the stir. On an average, the doctors examine around 150 patients on a daily basis at the OPD. Senior medical officer of the hospital, Dr Prasad Saigaonkar, said, “We have demanded that a second ICU to be set up as soon as possible to treat critical patients. Our other important demand includes having proper firefighting equipment so that any fire can be immediately tackled. We have also asked for proper electrical equipment should be there in the hospital,” said Dr Saigaonkar.The Ahmednagar district planning and development council, headed by the guardian minister, Hasan Mushrif, had recently approved Rs 2.5 crore for the civil hospital that would be spent on installation of proper firefighting equipment.  PWD has been directed to start working to establish another ICU and installation of the firefighting equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-civil-hosp-employees-call-off-stir/articleshow/87822422.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

At present, the flight service to Tirupati is on four days of the week — Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The flight service from Kolhapur to Tirupati began in 2019 under the Udaan initiative, where the 75-seater plane operated by Indigo airlines routinely got 50-plus passengers for arrival and departure. Both cities are religious centres. There is a belief that a person, who take darshan at the Sri Vekateswara Swamy temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh should take the darshan of his wife, Goddess Mahalaxmi, in Kolhapur to complete the process. A frequent flyer, Sourabh Kulkarni, said, “After visiting Sri Vekateswara Swamy temple at Andhra Pradesh, the devotees pay a visit to Goddess Mahalaxmi in Kolhapur, known to be wife of Lord Vishnu.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: NT Rama Rao clan slams YSRC, supports ex-CM N Chandrababu Naidu’s wife||HYDERABAD: The reclusive Nandamuri clan on Saturday came out in full support of TDP president and former CM N Chandrababu Naidu’s wife Bhuvaneshwari, taking umbrage to YSR Congress leaders’ objectionable comments made against a woman member of their family. Family members and grandchildren of TDP founder and former CM NT Rama Rao gave vent to their feelings and warned the YSRC leaders to not cross the limits. “Khabardar. Be warned. If such obscene remarks are made against the women members of our family, we will not tolerate it again,” actor Balakrishna said at his house in Jubilee Hills where some of the family members gathered. He said the family of NTR, his fans, TDP functionaries and people in general would teach the YSRC leaders in Andhra Pradesh a fitting lesson. Balakrishna’s brother Ramakrishna burst out in anger at the press conference that a woman of their household had been targeted. “We are hurt badly. But here’s a warning. We are not wearing bangles to put up with such intolerable talk. We will hit back,” Ramakrishna warned. The actor’s sister Lokeshwari said the family had always been away from public glare and led their own lives with discipline. “But here is a situation that has forced us to come in front of the media to express our anguish at how a woman of our household has been demeaned,” she said. “You will see a different avatar of us if your behaviour continues to be the same,” she said warning YSRC politicians. Suhasini, daughter of Balakrishna’s elder brother Harikrishna, who had unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections in 2018 from Kukatpally seat, said the remarks that were made were distasteful. “In politics, the agenda should be about discussing development. Political charges are also usually made but why drag a woman member of our household and make comments that hurt us,” she said. In a video that he released on social media, actor Junior JTR said the family was deeply hurt at the turn of events. “You (YSRC leaders) also have families. They will vouch for the fact that the statements are in a bad taste. Please put an end to such unpleasant talk,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ntr-clan-slams-ysrc-supports-naidus-wife/articleshow/87823581.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Actress Shalu Chourasiya identifies attacker after cops show 80 offenders’ photos||HYDERABAD: An offence committed by Kommu Babu two years ago helped the investigators nab him in the actress Shalu Chourasiya assault case. She was attacked while on a walk at KBR Park in Banjara Hills on November 14 night and her mobile phone was snatched. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said 21-year-old Babu was picked up from Kabir Nagar in Yousufguda where he took shelter. Cops recovered Shalu’s phone from the accused. Babu works as a helper in movie sets. Police said Babu was involved in four cases, including the latest offence. Police went through a list of previous offenders who committed similar robberies. Photographs of nearly 80 such offenders were shared with Shalu to identify the attacker. The actress zeroed in on Babu whose photograph was taken by police in 2019 after he was arrested for an assault and attempt to snatch a mobile phone of a person. Babu is a native of Mahbubnagar district and had shifted to Hyderabad three years ago to make ends meet. He gets work for 10 days a month and earns ₹500 per day. To increase his income, he first made a vain robbery bid at KBR Park on January 22 this year. The victim lodged a complaint then, but police could not trace him. In the latest case, police verified the CCTV footage at the park but could not deduce the route Babu had taken to escape after assaulting Shalu. At the scene of offence, there was no CCTV footage. After attacking Shalu, Babu pulled her and then stuffed clothes in her mouth. Before stealing her phone, he punched her face and kicked her before fleeing from the spot. She alerted the cops who rushed to the scene and shifted her to the hospital.

The state capital has improved its ranking from 124 last year to 82 this year. Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, Dehradun Municipal Corporation, told TOI, “We have significantly improved waste collection services in the city and improved related infrastructure like washrooms and garbage bins. The improvement in rankings will motivate us to improve further.” Besides Dehradun, Roorkee and Rudrapur were among the other two cities to record a significant improvement in their ranking. While Roorkee has moved up from the 131st to the 101st spot, Rudrapur’s ranking improved from 316 last year to 257 this year. In contrast, Haridwar, Haldwani and Kashipur slipped from their earlier positions in this year’s Swachh Survekshan index. According to the cleanliness index, Haridwar has come down to 285 this year from 246 last year. Similarly, Haldwani’s ranking slipped to 281 this year from 229 last year. However, it was Kashipur that recorded the worst drop -- from 139 last year to 342 this year. Anoop Nautiyal, founder, Social Development for Communities foundation, told TOI, “Kashipur, which has slipped to the 342nd spot this year, is among the dirtiest cities in the state. Not just the capital city, proper waste disposal should be ensured in the entire state, especially as we are a tourism-dependent state.” This year, 4,320 cities participated in the Swachh Survekshan index. For the fifth year in a row, Indore bagged the title of India’s cleanest city. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh was adjudged the cleanest state in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/swachh-survekshan-2021-doon-improves-its-ranking-haridwar-slips/articleshow/87823026.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Chandrasekhar said Kerala was not yet been able to break its non-investor friendly tag. “Those who come to investment in south India choose Tamil Nadu or Karnataka over Kerala. At the same time, Kerala has a better pool of engineering talents.

---||Dehradun||Under Centre’s pressure, U’khand CM surrendered before UP CM on asset distribution issue: Harish Rawat||Dehradun: Launching a sharp attack on incumbent chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, senior Congress leader said that the “weakest CM” of Uttarakhand, under the pressure of the central government, surrendered before Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath on the issue of asset distribution between the two states. The former chief minister claimed that the decisions taken in the recently-held meeting between Dhami and Yogi grossly violate the clauses of the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000. “By asking for permission to conduct adventure sports activities in the water bodies of Udham Singh Nagar and the Upper Ganga Canal, the Dhami government surrendered to the idea that the UP government has the ownership of these water resources. Besides, Dhami agreed to accept an amount of Rs 205 crore from the UP State Road Transport Corporation when the body is actually due to pay Rs 700 crore to the Uttarakhand Transport Corporation. Not to forget, Uttar Pradesh will get the ownership of several properties -- including the Tehri dam -- in the hill state after Dhami’s decision to withdraw pending legal cases concerning asset distribution,” said Rawat. He quickly added that Congress is exploring legal options to put an end to “one-sided distribution” of properties. On the question of the distribution of irrigation department properties, Rawat said, “Former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had claimed that he worked out a formula with the UP CM. Now, Dhami says that a joint survey of the properties would be conducted to take a call. If the Trivendra government had reached a formula, why do we need another survey?” Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal said, “Congress will observe the day as a “Black Day” as the rights of our people have been compromised. CM Dhami appeared to be under the Centre’s pressure to tilt the issue in UP’s favour. We will meet the governor over the issue and stage protests.” Echoing Rawat, he also said that Congress is constituting a legal committee to study the matter. “We have also called a meeting of our core committee to discuss the issue and decide the further course of action. This is a black day for Uttarakhand and its people,” said Godiyal. Similarly, the leader of Opposition, Pritam Singh, claimed that Congress will strongly raise these issues in the upcoming state assembly session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/under-centres-pressure-ukhand-cm-surrendered-before-up-cm-on-asset-distribution-issue-harish-rawat/articleshow/87823043.cms||Kautilya Singh

The sixth edition of the Swachh Survekshan, wherein a staggering 4,320 urban centres across the country were ranked on various parameters of the cleanliness index, were published in New Delhi on Saturday, and much to the dismay of residents and elected representatives of Mysuru alike, the city did not find a place on the top ten ranks.Adjudged seventh among cities with a population between three lakh and ten lakh, Mysuru also bagged the award for the Best Medium Self-Sustaining City, in addition to a five star rating for its success in management of garbage under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban 2.0) Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge.Karnataka minister for urban development Byrathi Basavaraj, Mysuru Mayor Sunanda Palanetra, Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) commissioner G Lakshmikantha Reddy and MCC health officer DG Nagaraj accepted the various prizes that Mysuru received at the ceremony organised by the Union ministry for housing and urban affairs at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi.After being adjudged the country’s cleanest city in the first two editions of Swachh Survekshan, Mysuru slipped to the fifth place on the rankings in 2017, dropping further to eighth the following year. In 2019, the city managed to leapfrog to third place, while in 2020, Mysuru was adjudged the cleanest city among urban centres with a population of three to ten lakh.Mayor Sunanda, while pleased with the five-star rating for garbage disposal, said that she would have been happier had the city fared better in the rankings. “We are not lagging behind other cities that have been ranked above us in any category. I would like to add that I received the award in Delhi on behalf of all the corporators of Mysuru,” Sunanda told STOI.Pointing out that most of the cities making up the top ten ranks of the rankings were from North India, Sunanda said, “I am slightly confused as to why Mysuru did not clinch the prize for the cleanest city, despite fulfilling all the criteria. It is unfortunate. I was happy to see the picture of the Mysore Palace being displayed on the screen at the start of the ceremony; it made me feel proud. I was also very happy to see the image of Puneeth Rajkumar being displayed when the Swachh Survekshan song was played. I cannot help but feel sad that we have lost a great actor and a human being.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/swachh-survekshan-mysuru-drops-to-12th-place/articleshow/87823029.cms||---

What prevented them to refer the issue for the past seven years. Did KCR stop them? If the Centre does not initiate action on the issue, we will take up agitation soon,” KCR said at a press conference. The CM said though Telangana assembly had forwarded its resolutions to Centre, no action has been taken. “The state government is demanding Centre to take up BC caste census along with regular census. There is nothing wrong in taking up caste census. Similarly, Telangana assembly sent resolutions on SC categorisation and enhancement of ST reservations. They should act immediately,” he said. KCR said BJP was exposed in the paddy procurement issue and asked it to apologise to people. “I appeal to the farmers not to bring their produce to the procurement centres. The government would buy every grain and there is no need to panic,” he said. During the tour to New Delhi on Sunday, the CM is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister for public distribution system on paddy procurement and Jal Shakti minister on water sharing issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/refer-water-sharing-row-to-new-tribunal/articleshow/87823611.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Booster policy soon but 2-shot adult vaccination now priority||PUNE: A policy on booster doses is likely to be announced by the end of this month, but the priority will be to complete the adult vaccination programme at the earliest, said a senior national task force member on Saturday. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), the government’s advisory body on immunisation, will finalise the policies. “A comprehensive policy is likely to come out based on Indian epidemiology and the pandemic situation in the country and not based on other nations. The meeting should be held in the next two weeks,” said the task force member on the developments. He said even as the policy is being readied, the thrust would, however, be on speeding up and completing the adult vaccination programme. The focus would be to ensure that at least all adult beneficiaries are administered the first dose by December 31. At present, over 80% of the adult population has received at least the first dose of the vaccine, and over 41% has got both the shots. In a recent meeting, most states had demanded booster shots for health workers. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had exerted on the same. Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases Division at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that in the discussion on booster doses or a third shot, it is essential that one does not get diverted from the public health programme of the two doses. “We should not divert the attention from the existing policy and programmatic action to ensure that all adult population get both doses of vaccine in the form of intramuscular injection,” he said. He also said that the policy and programme discussion around a third dose will draw upon scientific evidences. “These discussions should not take away our attention from the two-dose vaccination (programme), as currently we are yet to attain 80% coverage with both the doses of vaccination,” he said. The ICMR scientist reiterated that the two-dose vaccination programme that is ongoing in the country has shown efficacy in the form of reducing severity of diseases, and chances of deaths following acquisition of Sars-CoV-2 infection. “Discussions around the third dose pertain to those who, because of immunosuppressed conditions, are not able to mount immunity. In relation to the public health programme decisions in the country, while NTAGI serves as an advisory body, the relevant departments and ministry lead the formulation of policy,” he told TOI. Eminent virologist Dr T Jacob John said the science of vaccinology and Covid epidemiology (waning immunity and breakthrough infections) demand booster doses on priority for senior citizens, for those with comorbidities, and those who are on any immunosuppressant treatments - cancer, organ transplant, auto-immune disorders among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/booster-policy-soon-but-2-shot-adult-vaccination-now-priority/articleshow/87823614.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Vadodara||‘40% new nCov cases with travel history’||Vadodara: With Covid-19 restrictions eased and economic activity gathering pace, the number of persons travelling for work, leisure or other reasons has seen a surge. This has led to a steady increase in the ratio of travellers amongst the list of new Covid-19 infections in the Vadodara. One of the common and important questions that is asked to any suspected or confirmed Covid infected person is about his travel history in the recent past. At the beginning of the pandemic, this was done to ascertain if he had visited any affected area or state and it has become a practice since then. The question remains relevant again as the number of Covid-19 cases has risen marginally in the city and the number of cases with travel history is significant at nearly 40%. A Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) official said that there was a time since July when it was difficult to establish any epidemiological link and the source of infection remained a mystery. “We have such cases even today, but there is a steady rise in the number of positive cases with travel history,” said an official. Sources pointed out that in many instances, including a family in Subhanpura, several members of the same family or group travelling together had tested positive. “Travel has increased not only for leisure, but also for work,” said the official. VMC’s medical officer Dr Devesh Patel said that the possibility of getting infected during travel was high as often people tend to let down their guard. “They may not take sufficient precautions when travelling,” he said. Epidemiologists point out that travellers also get exposed to more people while on buses, trains or flights and at railway stations or airports. The case was the same when eating out, sightseeing or other situations. Sources, however, said that out of the 43 travellers who tested positive only two needed hospitalisation. They added that travelling should be done with necessary precautions. “Vaccination and the high number of cases in the second wave seem to have given good immunity,” said a VCM official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/40-new-ncov-cases-with-travel-history/articleshow/87823057.cms||Sachin Sharma

This is encouraging for the entire state.” This year, Kedarnath recorded the maximum footfall of 2.42 lakh pilgrims, followed by 1.97 lakh devotees at Badrinath, 33,166 at Gangotri, and 33,306 at Yamunotri shrine. Initially, the high court had fixed a daily cap on the number of pilgrims allowed to visit the four revered shrines. According to HC order, 1,200 pilgrims were allowed at Badrinath, 800 at Kedarnath, 600 at Gangotri and 400 at Yamunotri.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Let President decide on setting up SC regional benches, says B Vinod Kumar||HYDERABAD: Telangana State Planning Commission vicechairman and former MP B Vinod Kumar on Saturday demanded that Parliament amend Article 130 of the Constitution, giving full powers to the President to set up regional benches of the Supreme Court in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad to ensure access to justice for all. Addressing the gathering at South India conference on ‘Decentralisation of Judicial Institutions in India’ organised at MG Law College in LB Nagar, the former MP said that this would be a major step towards ensuring quick justice to the people, who are currently finding justice through the Supreme Court as ill affordable. Article 130 of the Constitution, as it stands today, gives power to the Chief Justice of India to decide the seat of the Supreme Court in consultation with the President. Vinod Kumar, who moved a private member bill in the Parliament when he was a member of the previous House to amend the Article to the effect that the power to set up regional benches of the apex court should be solely vested with the President, said that since the Supreme Court full court had decided in the past not to set up regional benches, the impasse could never be broken despite huge public interest involved. “The only solution, thus, is the amendment to the Article, making the President the sole authority so that the political executive would be in a position to respond to the aspirations of the people,” Vinod said. The former MP also spoke about the demographic imbalance with which the apex court has been suffering. Not even a person from the Scheduled Tribes could become a judge of the Supreme Court till now. “No (person of ) SC or ST from AP and Telangana could make it to the apex court,” he said. Vinod Kumar said that the pendency at trial courts was over three crore cases, and the figure was 44 lakh at HCs and 59,000 at the Supreme Court. “This is no way to deliver justice in a speedier manner,” he said, while releasing the book, ‘Need For SC Regional Benches In India’, written by OU professor Gali Vinod Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/let-prez-decide-on-setting-up-sc-regional-benches/articleshow/87823622.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The resident doctors across state medical colleges on Saturday were seen working wearing black ribbons on their arms, which signified that they had to work extra to compensate for the 33.3% of resident doctors (1st year), who are yet to join their duties. The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-PG), which was supposed to be conducted in March, had witnessed a delay this year due to the pandemic and even after the exam was held in September, there is now a stay on the process of counselling as some candidates have challenged the reservation policy adopted for admission to postgraduate seats. Six months ago, almost one-third of the resident doctors were released by medical colleges as their residentship got over. "Resident doctors have to work in hospitals attached to their medical colleges during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years of their postgraduation. Even as the third batch passed out six months ago, and the fresh batch (1styear) is yet to join. In such a case, only two batches are working in place of three," said Dr Amit Yadav, president of Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors. Dr Yadav said, "Number of dengue cases and other seasonal diseases has gone up and the fear of the third wave of Covid-19 is still there. In such a situation, only 66% resident doctors currently working, which is a cause of concern." Not only resident doctors from SMS Medical College, but also from other government medical colleges in Ajmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner, Kota, and Jhalawar had also worked wearing black ribbons on Saturday. "Across the state, in all three batches of PG, there should be around 3,000 resident doctors, but currently around 66% of them are working," said Dr Sunil Harsh, a resident doctor at Bikaner medical college and secretary of service doctors’ wing of the Indian Medical Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/delay-in-neet-pg-counselling-burdens-resident-docs-across-state-med-colleges/articleshow/87823628.cms||---

During the yatra, soil will be collected from the houses of 1,734 soldiers, hailing from all 13 districts of the Himalayan state, who laid down their lives for the country. The soil will be used in the building of the “Sainya Dham” memorial being built in Dehradun, he said. On the occasion, soil form 89 martyrs’ houses of Munakot and Bin Block was collected and the minister honoured the family members of the bravehearts. This soil will be stored at Solder Board and the yatra will continue to other blocks of Pithoragarh to collect more soil within two weeks before being sent to Dehradun. Addressing a gathering at Jhulkhet, Rajnath said that the name of every soldier who had died in the line of duty will be written on “Sainya Dham” so that people come to know about their sacrifice. Sending out a clear message to those levelling transgression allegation, the minister said India never grabbed an inch of any country’s land and won’t give up on her’s either. “Pakistan can make all efforts to destabilise India but we have made it clear that we will hit back,” Rajnath said. Citing an example, the defence minister said he had been to Rezang La, where 114 soldiers of the 13 Kumaon battalion died during the 1962 Indo-China war. "They had done something charismatic and deserved a grand memorial built in their honour. A symbolic memorial that stood for years in Rezang La has now been replaced by a grand one in a fitting tribute to the soldiers for their supreme sacrifice," he said. Union defense minister (state) Ajay Bhatt also addressed the gathering and talked of government policies of welfare schemes for Army personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/soil-from-each-bravehearts-house-to-be-collected-for-doon-memorial-rajnath/articleshow/87823059.cms||Prem Punetha

The All Karnataka United Christian Forum for Human Rights (AKUCFHR) appealed to the chief minister not to table the bill, and also to withdraw the orders on the survey of Christian missionaries and establishments. Fr J B Saldanha, PRO and spiritual director of Catholic Sabha, diocese of Mangalore, said, “The entire Christian community in Mangaluru oppose the proposal of anti-conversion bill and question the need for such an exercise when sufficient laws and court directives are in place to monitor any aberration of the existing laws.” Former MLA J R Lobo emphasising the constitutional right said, “The Indian Constitution Article 25 guarantees freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion subject to public order, morality and health. Further, Article 26 gives, freedom to manage religious affairs. Therefore, introducing such laws would infringe the rights of the citizens, especially of minority communities.” Stany Lobo, president, Catholic Sabha said, “The false allegation of conversions on Christian communities have disturbed the peace and unity among all Christians in Karnataka.” Bishop emeritus, Believers Church Rev Winfred Ammanna said, “Thousands of schools, colleges and hospitals are run and managed by the Christian community across the State. When lakhs of students are graduating from these institutions year after year and thousands of patients irrespective of caste, creed and colour receive the best medical attention from our hospitals and care centers, not one of them has ever been influenced, compelled or coerced to change his or her religion.” Roy Castelino, PRO, Mangalore Catholic diocese, was present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/christians-write-to-cm-to-oppose-anti-conversion-bill/articleshow/87823060.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Surgery suites busy once again after lull in Covid-19||MUMBAI: The lull in Covid-19 has turned city surgery suites into busy zones again as patients who ignored their heart murmur, thickening cataract, painful knees or growing fibroids over the last 18 months are making a beeline for hospitals. Gynecologist Dr Kiran Coelho spent Saturday morning removing multiple fibroids each over four cm in length from a 35-year-old woman. “She cancelled her surgery when lockdown was declared in March 2020 and returned with bigger fibroids,’’ said Dr Coelho. This young patient isn’t the only one. “Every day, apart from deliveries, there are two to three surgeries for women who due to Covid did not seek timely help for heavy bleeding issues or precancerous growth,’’ said Dr Coelho. Be it clinic consultations or surgeries, Dr S Narayani, regional head at Fortis Hospital in Mumbai, said ‘numbers’ are closer to pre-Covid levels. “Covid had gripped minds of people, but not anymore,’’ she said. Senior surgeons said Covid had left a mark on the non-Covid pool of patients too. Leading heart surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda of Asian Heart Hospital, Bandra, said patients were coming in with “worsened symptoms’’. “While delaying treatment or not being able to take proper treatment or check-up, some suffered silent heart attacks and have become unstable, with low heart pumping and other acute complexities that need urgent surgery,’’ said Dr Panda. Many heart patients developed multi-organ problems because of lack of treatment or inadequate treatment. “This includes those whose diabetes is not well-controlled, kidney functions have deteriorated or lung functions are poor, especially those who have recovered from Covid,” said Dr Panda. The ‘Covid effect’ is something that the head of ophthalmology at JJ Hospital, Dr Ragini Parekh, also picked up. “As we do a thorough pre-surgery workup on patients, we realized some have lung issues due to a previous Covid infection,’’ she said. At the moment though, Dr Parekh’s team is concentrating on having to go back to the pre-Covid level of performing 150 surgeries a day. “Due to Covid, numbers dropped to 20-30 a day, but people are now ready for surgery,’’ she said. JJ team performed around 70 eye procedures daily on an average last week, but expect the tally to rise to three digits in the coming week. “We completed an eye camp in Parbhani and have prepared a list of 800 patients who will travel to JJ Hospital (in Byculla) in daily batches of 70 over the next few days,’’ she said. Trauma surgeries involving broken bones never stopped during Covid due to their serious nature, corrective surgeries for many other orthopedic conditions were postponed due to Covid. But orthopedic surgeon Dr Kausal Malhan of Fortis said they nearly reached pre-Covid levels in patients coming in for knee and hip replacement surgeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-surgery-suites-busy-once-again-after-lull-in-covid-19/articleshow/87824724.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Pune||Average beneficiaries vaccinated per session fall below 100 in Maharashtra||PUNE: Average beneficiaries vaccinated per session has fallen to 98 in Maharashtra, health department data till November 17 showed. This means that the state has been vaccinating an average of less than 100 beneficiaries per session lately. At the beginning of November this average was 100. The data showed that average beneficiaries vaccinated per session in 23 districts is now less than 100 - being lowest in districts such as Washim, Bhandara and Nanded. In these districts, the average has come down to 45-50 people per session. Other districts where the average is less than 100 beneficiaries per session is Nashik (98.2), Buldhana (97.7), Raigad (96.4), Beed (93.4), Chandrapur (88.7), Jalna (83.3), Wardha (81.2), Satara (81.1), Dhule (81) among others. There are 11 districts where the average is more than 100 beneficiaries per session. Among them are Pune (104.4), Mumbai (166), Palghar (167), Solapur (142.8), Thane (129.9), Jalgaon (125.2). A public health department official said, “The data was arrived at by dividing the number of beneficiaries vaccinated so far by the total number of sessions conducted till November 17. The result is thus an indicator of how the state has performed so far per vaccination session.” Towards mid-September, at least 16 districts in the state were vaccinating above 100 beneficiaries per session. This had given a thrust to Maharashtra’s average. Pune’s average was 106 beneficiaries vaccinated per session around August 23, which increased to 112 by September 13. Mumbai’s average increased from 158 beneficiaries vaccinated per session to 172. These averages have dropped in November. An officer with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “Average beneficiaries have dropped per session owing to the festive season in November, and also because many people are fasting during the Navratra. Not to forget, of late many have taken the first dose and are waiting for the 84-day gap to get over to get their second shot. This could have been a reason behind the drop in the average number.” Another state official believes when the demand is high and supply of a commodity is lower, there is a rush for it. “As supplies ease, the eagerness to get the same commodity takes a backseat,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/average-beneficiaries-vaccinated-per-session-fall-below-100-in-state/articleshow/87823629.cms||Neha Madaan

Speaking at the opening of the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) in Goa, he said, “Our vision is not limited to the event of Iffi. What should Iffi be when India celebrates its 100th year of independence? We aim to make India a powerhouse of content creation, especially regional cinema, by scaling up regional festivals. We aim to make India the post-production hub for the world by leveraging the immense talent amongst our skilled youth”. He said that India will be groomed in the coming decades as the destination for films and festivals and as a favoured place for filmmakers and film lovers. “The film and entertainment industry has huge employment opportunities as we leapfrog into the era of digital content, filmmaking, and not to forget film archiving, for the future generations,” said Thakur, adding that to flourish as the epicenter of cinema for the world, India has all the three requirements — abundant and competent labour, ever-growing consumption expenditure and a diverse culture and linguistic heritage. Enhanced footprints of mobiles, internet and digitalisation is adding to create an ideal ecosystem in India, said Thakur. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, during his inaugural speech, recalled the vision of former Indian defense minister and ex-Goa CM Manohar Parrikar in getting Iffi to Goa in 2004. Sawant also asked Thakur for support to establish a film city and a film institute in Goa. “Goa is already known for Iffi, so make a film city in Goa, either on PPP mode or with the help of the government of India. The talent pool is available in Goa. In the coming days, we hope to get help from minister Anurag Thakur and PM Narendra Modi, and we will definitely have the film industry to guide our talent here permanently,” said Sawant. He said that Goa would soon achieve the target of being the first state in India to have covered 100% of its population with both doses of the vaccine. This should be an added motivation for filmmakers to shoot in Goa, Sawant said. Hollywood producer-director Martin Scorsese and Hungarian filmmaker Istvan Szabo were both honoured with the first Satyajit Ray lifetime achievement award at the Iffi opening ceremony. Accepting the award virtually, both the filmmakers said that Ray has been a major influence on their work. “Ray is one of my masters and one of the filmmakers that I turn to over and over again throughout my lifetime. Every time you watch his films, they become different somehow, they deepen. My love for his work began when I first watched Paather Panchali. It was a revelation for someone growing up in the West, seeing India through the eyes of the West. The faces in the background were suddenly in the foreground and then there was the filmmaking itself,” said Scorsese. Szabo thanked Iffi for naming its lifetime achievement award after Ray. “I met Mr Ray more than 50 years ago in Madras (now Chennai), and we had a fantastic discussion about our profession and filmmaking. It was a profound discussion and I can never forget his radiant, charismatic face,” he said. Indian film actress Hema Malini, who received the Indian film personality of the year award, said that she was really happy to accept the honour. Thakur felicitated 75 young creative minds who are youngsters with a keen interest in filmmaking, chosen from across India to participate in Iffi. Thakur said that the youngest selected candidate is just 16 years old. Goa governor P S Sreedharan Pillai said that artistes have an important role to play in keeping the sovereignty of the country intact. “Our writers and artistes can see that our country is more and more united, and work towards achieving this goal. I remember, in 1947, when partition happened, so many singers and artistes went to Pakistan, and within four or five years, all the artistes and singers returned to our country, our Bharat. What is the reason behind it, I need not explain it in this forum. For unity, integrity and sovereignty, you can contribute a lot,” Pillai. The King of all the World, directed by Carlos Saura, opened the nine-day festival. Apurva Chandra, secretary (I&B), said that though Iffi is being organised in the hybrid format, the festival is bigger than ever before, as it received 625 entries from 96 countries, as against films from only 70 countries last year. “Even films in languages like Dimasa, which are not in the eighth schedule, are being screened,” he said. Minister of state for I&B L Murugan said that for ease of doing business, a single-window has been created in the ministry for those who want to shoot their films in India. The opening ceremony was hosted by film director Karan Johar and television personality Manish Paul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ib-min-want-to-make-india-a-global-post-production-hub-for-films/articleshow/87824151.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

According to the officiating DCP (crime), Paris Deshmukh, the police had filed an FIR against the accused on their own because his victims were not willing to come forward due to the social stigma. The modus operandi was akin to other sextortion gangs, where the accused masqueraded as women on social media sites to befriend potential targets before they are cajoled into indulging in a sex act that is recorded. Blackmailing soon followed where many gave in for fear of being ousted on social media or some porn website. Deshmukh said the crime branch pored over the accused’s chat history and found that over 40 people were being blackmailed by the accused. Some of his targets even pondered suicide, but the accused remained relentless in demanding extortions. Police said the accused had been operating the racket for over a year now. "We have appealed to citizens on many occasions that they should not attend video calls from unknown numbers, especially with ones having display pictures of women," Deshmukh said. He also said most of the victims chose to suffer quietly instead of reporting the incident due to the social stigma. "People should come forward to file a complaint, there is no need get bogged down by blackmailing threats," he said. The menace of sextortion has been rising steadily in the state for the past several months across the state. The accused often brings sim cards on forged identity cards to evade surveillance. Deshmukh said that the crime branch is now examining the accused’s nexus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-held-for-blackmailing-over-40-men-in-sextortion-racket/articleshow/87823633.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Shivaliks are ‘natural sponges’; tree felling for road project will devastate Indo-Gangetic plains: Activists||Dehradun: Green activists feel that government should shelve the proposal to fell a large number of trees near the biodiversity-rich Shivalik range as it will not only disturb the habitat of tigers, elephants and leopards but also lead to massive flooding in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The Shivalik landscape is the most significant spot of northern India as it collects the sediments that flow down from the endless tributaries and rivers of the Himalayas. And, protects all the states from flooding. Speaking to TOI, Ajay S Rawat, former chairman of International Union of Forest Research Organisation (IUFRO), said, "The felling of trees and road construction are proposed in the Shivalik landscape, which is an extension of 'lesser Himalayas', is not a eco-friendly move. Shivaliks work as 'natural sponges' as they absorb the excess water that flows down from the Himalayas and release this water during scarcity in the plain regions. If the trees are felled in that landscape, the entire Indo-Gangetic plains are likely to record massive flooding due to the disturbed water regimen of the Shivalik landscape." He added that the Shivalik landscape should not be concretised. Concerned over the rich habitat of wildlife being destructed, secretary, CGFD, Himanshu Arora, said, “We can rehabilitate human beings but we cannot expect wild animals to find out another forest on the ground that their habitat is being concretised. This way, the chances of road accidents will increase in their own ‘newly-developed concrete’ habitat.” Following a pushback by activists and locals against state government's decision to fell thousands of trees for Delhi-Dehradun expressway and a petition by Doon-based NGO 'Citizen for Green Doon', the Supreme Court had recently stayed the felling of 11,000 trees till November 26.  Arora also raised a question about the carrying capacity of Dehradun vis-à-vis multiple entry points to the valley, “If a valley has four to six entry points, its doomsday is not far as it being stretched beyond its capacity. Unlike a plain district, Dehradun is a valley and Shivalik landscape is its core and we are hurting that by touching its ecosystem,” he said.  Another city-based activist, Aanchal Sharma, founder, The Earth and Climate Initiative, has recently started an online petition to garner support from netizens from all over the world to ‘Save 11,000 trees from being cut for Dehradun-Delhi expressway in Rajaji Tiger Reserve as they fear it will add to the climate change emergency, which has already got over 5,000 signatories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/shivaliks-are-natural-sponges-tree-felling-for-road-project-will-devastate-indo-gangetic-plains-activists/articleshow/87823062.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Pune||Maharashtra: 87% health staff, frontliners in 18 districts got two doses||PUNE: Nearly 18 districts in the state are below the state average for full vaccination coverage of healthcare and frontline workers. As per data shared by the public health department, the state’s average coverage (both doses) for these two groups is 87%. Of these 18 districts, three — Jalna, Osmanabad, and Gondia — are 71-78% coverage for both these groups. Vaccine hesitancy or technical errors, with some frontline workers registering in other categories, are being verified, said state public health officials. As of November 17, six districts achieved over 90% vaccination of healthworkers, with Palghar leading with 99.1% and Chandrapur second with 92.6%. In the case of frontline workers, seven districts have achieved above 90% coverage, with Palghar (97.8%) and Mumbai (92.3%) first and second. A senior health official told TOI that this was surprising, as healthcare workers and frontline workers were among the first to be vaccinated. “It has been eleven months since the start of the vaccination drive, and after two waves, these groups should have attained 100%,” the official said. The official said they were looking into the possible reasons, including vaccine hesitancy or technical errors. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said there could be three reasons for this. “At the start, there were issues with data collection wherein names were duplicated. Further, when the programme had started, some hospitals had got their staff registered through open or general categories and so, many names may not reflect under the healthworker category. Thirdly, there could be vaccine hesitancy; they need to be sensitised,” Patil said. A senior revenue official said many officials, or those with the “frontline” tag, had taken the vaccine in the 44+ group. “This needs to be double-checked and data needs to be streamlined. There could also be a few left out due to a delay in taking vaccination, and some may be waiting for their second dose,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/87-health-staff-frontliners-in-18-districts-got-two-doses/articleshow/87823636.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||GFP’s working president Kiran Kandolkar quits, joins TMC||PANAJI: In a major jolt for Goa Forward Party (GFP), its working president Kiran Kandolkar abruptly put in his papers and joined the All Indian Trinamool Congress (TMC) party on Saturday. Kandolkar, who joined TMC along with his wife Kavita, said he will contest the 2022 assembly elections from Aldona while his wife will contest from Tivim. Kandolkar told reporters that Congress’ indecisiveness and delay tactics compelled him to leave GFP and join the Mamata Banerjee-led party. The move by senior Congress election observer P Chidambaram to campaign door-to-door in Aldona constituency appears to have been the final straw for Kandolkar. “For the past few months, talks of an alliance with Congress have been on, but as per my information, Congress is not ready to let me contest the Aldona seat,” said Kandolkar. “It is not serious about defeating BJP, which is why it is not declaring its candidate or deciding on the alliance.” Shedding more light on the rationale behind his decision, the former Tivim MLA said the poll strategy prepared by Prashant Kishor’s Indian political action committee (IPAC) convinced him that TMC will form the next government in Goa. In October, Kandolkar had sparked a furore within BJP ranks after he said Goa needs to bring “Durga” from West Bengal to eliminate the “Bhasmasur” BJP government from the state. Kandolkar, who is a former BJP MLA, said at least two BJP MLAs and 40 GFP office-bearers are in touch with him. He also said that many former BJP lawmakers who are miffed with the functioning of the saffron party, could join TMC in the coming days. Kandolkar’s children also joined TMC along with the sarpanchs of Tivim, Assonora, Revora and Nadora. “I have decided to leave GFP, but I would like to say that I am not leaving because of Vijai Sardesai, but because I don’t trust Congress and their alliance promises. Congress loses because it declares its candidate very late and the person does not get time to campaign. My work experience with Vijai Sardesai is good, but I feel that Congress is going to betray him,” said Kandolkar. Earlier in the day, former Congress North Goa district general secretary Shankar Phadte joined TMC along with the block-level leadership of the party’s Porvorim unit, which includes 10 executive members. Kandolkar and Phadte were inducted into the party in the presence of AITC national vice-president Luizinho Faleiro and Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra. Both said that TMC is the only party that can take on BJP in Goa and at the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfps-working-prez-kandolkar-quits-joins-tmc/articleshow/87824157.cms||---

The train was stopped after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and never resumed. Kerala students studying at the educational hub of Karnataka are largely dependent on the train service, which is economical as well as convenient. Colleges have resumed, but not the train service, and hence students have to depend on buses by spending about Rs 150 per day. Since travelling in buses is expensive, many are only attending classes for only 2-3 days in a week. “This is a serious issue that needs to be looked into at the earliest,” said the protesting students. They urged the Railways to resume the services immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/resume-mluru-kannur-train-to-help-students-abvp/articleshow/87823071.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa falls short of afforestation goals, plants just 53% of target||PANAJI: Goa has earned the dubious distinction of being among four states that have fallen furthest short of its compensatory afforestation target. The state has only carried out 53.9% of what it set out to achieve, putting it in the league of Arunachal Pradesh (53.8%), Jharkhand (54.2%) and Mizoram (31%). The targets are set by the national compensatory afforestation fund management and planning authority (Campa), which carried out a review on the subject on October 29. Goa’s less-than-ideal achievement here puts it far behind the national average of 88%. In August, the Goa forest officials had sought approval from the Campa to carry out compensatory afforestation in Madhya Pradesh for forests lost in Goa. State officials said that Madhya Pradesh had already set aside land for the purpose on Goa’s request. Goa asked for the exception citing a shortage of land. But the national authority is yet to approve the proposal. Meanwhile, the national authority has now asked states, including Goa, to complete all its backlog of compensatory afforestation and penal compensatory afforestation by March 31, 2023. Goa has a backlog of 1,630 hectares, and plans to complete its target by carrying out afforestation on 500 hectares of land in 2021-22, followed by 565 hectares each in 2022-23 and 2023-24. The state has carried out afforestation to the extent of 3,541 hectares so far. In 2020-21, Goa spent Rs 23 crore of Campa funds for compensatory afforestation. The national authority noted that Goa carried out monitoring and evaluation of its afforestation activities under Campa through an independent body, the centre for environment education. The audit found that the survival rate of saplings planted for afforestation was 80% in Goa, which was far better than other states. To be able to achieve the target of zero balance of compensatory afforestation, states have been asked to start work immediately, including that of setting up of nurseries. States have also been asked by the national authority to submit their annual plan of operation for next financial year for Campa funds in advance, by December 31. For plans received in December, the national authority has said that it will grant approvals within a month, so work can take place at the earliest. The national authority is also preparing guidelines to standardise monitoring and evaluation of afforestation taken up under Campa funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-falls-short-of-afforestation-goals-plants-just-53-of-target/articleshow/87824175.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

At present the shops are allowed to open till 8pm. Trade association said, before drafting the excise policy for 2022-2023, a meeting headed by the finance secretary was called to take suggestions from the stakeholders. Nilesh Mewara, president of the Raj Liquor Welfare Society, said, “The shop owners are facing huge losses due to present timings and two hours (10am to 10pm) extension should be provided by the government. This will not only benefit traders and consumers, but also increase the revenue of the state government.” The shop owners also demanded a decrease in the number of shops. “After the number of shops increased, the margins have reduced. The shopkeepers are facing stiff competition as there are shops allotted in one locality,” added another trader. The society further demanded to abolish the basic licence fee, reduce the guarantee by at least 40% and not calculate the guarantee in bulk litres, but in the amount. An official said, the demand was raised from the liquor traders to remove the compulsion on purchasing Rajasthan Made Liquor (RML) as it has failed buyers. “As per the new policy, it is mandatory to purchase RML liquor stock. On the demand of the traders the government is mulling a proposal to remove the clause of mandatory purchasing of RML,” said an excise department official. To boost additional revenue, the traders highlighted at present, the margin of round off in the liquor bills and the margin of additional excise duty is being deposited in the government’s account. “It should deposit in the account of the contractor and the margin on the sale of liquor should also be increased,” said an association member The memorandum also reads, in future if there is any calamity or pandemic situation, the government should not levy any tax in the middle of the financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/liquor-traders-seek-to-keep-shops-open-till-10pm/articleshow/87955198.cms||---

While MBBS students (junior and senior residents) at government hospitals who have been working in rural and tribal areas for two years stand to benefit from move, they are demanding the quota be increased. As per the latest GO, 20 per cent reservation for clinical and 30 per cent for non-clinical seats has been announced. This is however a reduction from the earlier GO-27 — issued in 2017 — which had 30 per cent reservation for clinical and 50 per cent for non-clinical seats. Irked with the reduction, public health doctors demanded an increase in quota and said they will protest. On the other hand Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) demanded that the quota be done away with.“Public health doctors and contract doctors as well as all other government doctors will hand over mass leave papers on Monday to DMHOs in all districts and would fight in stages till the cancellation of GO-155 and revival of GO 27 is done,” said Dr Katti Janardhan, founding president Telangana Public Health Doctors Association. Meanwhile, TJUDA demanded that GO not be implemented. “Giving special reservation quota to these candidates will be a bias towards regular candidates who strive for years together to get a competitive seat,” TJUDA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/go-on-in-service-quota-for-govt-hosp-docs-sparks-row-among-med-students/articleshow/87823659.cms||---

The stepfather, Jesu Antony Raj, is under treatment at the same hospital for his injuries and hence is yet to be arrested. The accused is the second husband of Suja, who hails from Periyavilai in Kanyakumari and has two daughters and a son with her first husband. The two had got married after the death of Suja's first husband and was residing at Kavalkinaru in Tirunelveli. The incident happened on Wednesday when the girl, who had gone to the bakery where Antony Raj was working, allegedly made off with a biscuit packet. The bakery owner complained to him about the 'theft' and scolded him. Angered by this, Antony Raj came home that night and gathered all three children to enquire about the incident. In a fit of rage, he poured kerosene on the children and set them on fire. Alerted by the screams of the children, neighbours rushed in and tried to extinguish the fire. Of the three children, one boy and girl escaped unharmed but the 10-year-old girl suffered severe burn injuries. By then, Suja, who was not at home, arrived and saw the horrific scene. She rushed the girl to the Kanyakumari medical college hospital at Asaripalayam which was closer to their home. The medical college hospital authorities said the girl had suffered 95% burn injuries and had been in a critical condition till her death. The body was to be handed over to the family after postmortem examination. Panagudi police said that dying declaration from the victim was recorded before her death and the case registered has also been altered to murder.

Due to cloud cover, the night temperature is expected to remain slightly above normal or near normal for the next four days. However, the minimum temperature is likely to start dipping from November 24 and may touch a single digit number after four to five days. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature was recorded at 26.6 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station.  The visibility was around 800-1,500 metres at Safdarjung and Palam on Saturday. The formation of cloud cover caused a rise in minimum temperature. A Met official said, “Clouds started forming since Friday. When cloud cover is formed, it screens out the sunlight and decreases day temperature, but increases night temperature.” Due to cloud formation, the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 11-12 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature is predicted to remain around 26-27 degrees Celsius. “The minimum temperature is expected to witness a gradual dip over the next few days. The night temperature may drop to 8-9 degrees Celsius in the next five to seven days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD.

The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), the government’s advisory body on immunisation, will finalise the policies. “A comprehensive policy is likely to come out based on Indian epidemiology and the pandemic situation in the country and not based on other nations. The meeting should be held in the next two weeks,” said the task force member on the developments. He said even as the policy is being readied, the thrust would, however, be on speeding up and completing the adult vaccination programme. The focus would be to ensure that at least all adult beneficiaries are administered the first dose by December 31. At present, over 80% of the adult population has received at least the first dose of the vaccine, and over 41% has got both the shots. In a recent meeting, most states had demanded booster shots for health workers. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had exerted on the same.

In September, the state's share of Covid casualties suddenly shot“Discussions around the third dose pertain to those who, because of immunosuppressed conditions, are not able to mount enough immunity,” he told TOI. Meanwhile, experts said that health authorities should consider that early recipients —senior citizens, people with comorbidities or health and frontline workers — got their two shots within a six-week period as against the current ideal period of 84 days. As the early recipients got fully vaccinated within a short period, their antibody levels would have dipped by now and they need a booster shot soon, said experts. “I have a feeling that India will only roll out third doses for the clinically vulnerable and highly exposed once transmission starts to skyrocket again. That will be too late,’’ said public health specialist Dr Swapneil Parikh, adding that we need to start right away.

This time he has,” Karur collector Dr T Prabhushankar told TOI. The camp held at Karur government medical college also saw 20 more men attend including a person living with HIV /AIDS and a mediaperson. The department could manage to perform the simple male sterilization procedure on only eight people for the whole of 2020-2021. The good turnout was due to the sops announced by the collector to rope in the male heads of families with higher birth order (HBO). The usual incentive for male sterilization is Rs 1,100 but the collector made it Rs 5,000 for this camp. More than two children to a woman is described as higher birth order by the public health department. In Saturday’s camp, not only fathers of two, three and four children but two people having one child each also underwent the procedure. The collector announced that the beneficiaries will be given priority in availing eligible government schemes. They can opt for either Rs 5,000 or any government scheme. “It's true that a small incentive also played a part. Not everyone opted for money except two beneficiaries. Appreciating their response to the camp, we rewarded everyone with Rs 5,000 besides issuing provisional orders for the schemes they chose,” said the collector. Nine including the father of the eight children opted for bank loans with subsidy while the six others requested for free land title. One man sought old age pension for his family member while two others wanted free milch cows. The collector said it was the findings in the death audit in government hospitals in the district that led to the special camp. The maternal mortality rate was found increasing among mothers of HBO. “When men take up sterilization as part of birth control measure, the burden on women in the reproductive process can be reduced,” said the collector who is also a doctor specialized in public health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/incentives-work-as-more-men-undergo-vasectomy-in-karur/articleshow/87824743.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Hours before death, author saw her book released in ICU||NAGPUR: It was a unique book release function, and possibly first-of-its-kind held in the ICU of a multispecialty hospital. Author Subhashini Kukde, who was fond of writing Marathi short stories, was admitted in the ICU of New Dande Hospital for severe lung failure. Her short story collection ‘Mom you are great’ was released at 9.30pm on Friday, and she breathed her last hours later at 2.30am on Saturday. The book, which was awaiting a formal release for almost a year-and-half due to Covid-19, was released by state congress president Nana Patole, MLC Abhijit Wanjari and MLA Vikas Thakre. Subhashini’s husband Madhukar Kukde, a senior social and political activist associated with Sanyukta Maharashtra movement, said it was her wish for the last many months and “it proved to be her last wish too”. Kukde recalled how his wife penned down the 18 stories while fighting against poor eyesight and poor lung capacity due to old age. The book was ready for release in January 2020. “We had to postpone the event twice due to first and second wave of Covid-19. In the meanwhile, Subhashini’s health deteriorated. She was undergoing treatment at Dr Dande’s hospital for the last two months,” said Kukde. Dr Pinak Dande, who looked after the patient for months, said Subhashini used to talk about the book whenever she could. Subhashini was 79 and it was difficult for doctors to revive her damaged lungs. “When I told this to her husband, he asked me to wait for some time. In next two days, he contacted Nana Patole who agreed to release the book,” he said. Patole, despite being busy ahead of MLC elections and due to other political commitments, reached Dande hospital on Friday night. “I know Madhukar Kukde personally. I was willing to come early but a busy schedule prevented it. Finally, we got time at around 9.30pm and released the book in the ICU. This was unique but a fulfilling experience for me that I could do something for a senior colleague,” said Patole. There were no guests, no crowd but the function was held with all formalities. A welcome speech and a vote of thanks were also offered. Subhashini, who was on her ICU bed, witnessed the entire event. “She could not speak anything. But, we could see a feeling of fulfilment in her eyes,” said Dr Dande. Dr Dande said that at around 11.30pm, nearly two hours this function, her health started deteriorating fast. “Gradually, her organs started failing, and by 2.30am, she breathed her last,” he said. Kukde family performed the last rites on Saturday. The loss is irreparable for them, but the unique book release function will always make them feel content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/literally-her-last-wish-author-passes-away-hours-after-book-release-in-icu/articleshow/87823674.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In the previous survey, the city bagged the 102nd spot. Although Trichy has recorded its worst-ever performance in the cleanliness ranking so far, the city has retained the state’s cleanest city tag among towns and cities that participated from Tamil Nadu.The result published on Saturday under Swachh Bharat Mission (urban) by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) saw Trichy scoring 3,050.72 out of 6,000 marks. While the city has done well in the service level progress (project implementation and documentation) and citizen feedback (public perception on cleanliness) categories, in the certification category of the ranking that involves the status of garbage and open defecation free city status, Trichy lost 1,500 marks. The city had scored only 300 marks in the category out of the total 1,800 marks, taking a huge plunge in the national ranking. The certification category verifies a city’s garbage-free status, storm water drains infrastructure and facility to recycle construction debris. With Trichy lacking such facilities and sporting garbage mounds everywhere, the category played a spoilsport in Trichy’s potential of scoring better rank.While no other city from Tamil Nadu had scored 3,000 marks in both above 10 lakh and below 10 lakh population categories, Trichy was the only city from the state to cross 3,000 marks. “Unlike the previous cleanliness ranking exercise, we did not pursue dedicated efforts to score better marks this year. Yet, we have retained the cleanest city of the state rank,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-swachh-ranking-falls-to-121-from-102-last-yr/articleshow/87824748.cms||Deepak Karthik

Police said the victim had put on a helmet at the time of the accident, but did not strap it on.Police sources identified the victim as M Mangayarkarasi, hailing from Vayalur road locality in Trichy city. She was employed as a teacher in a school near Trichy railway junction. While approaching the MGR statue roundabout near the district court, the victim lost balance and fell over the road and a college bus ran over her. A few locals who witnessed the accident claimed that she was knocked down by the bus from behind, however, city traffic police sources said that the victim fell while attempting to overtake the bus. “The victim had a helmet, but it seems the gear was not strapped to the chin. We are constantly booking cases against speeding buses on city roads,” a senior official with city traffic police said. Police said that a majority of the commuters are not obeying the speed limit that was set at 30 km/h for city roads.Road safety activists said that buses of educational institutions during peak hours were driving rashly. “Traffic policemen are accumulated at one place, they should be spread out to display their presence on crucial roads,” C Balasubramanian, a former member of district road safety council said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/woman-run-over-while-overtaking-bus-in-trichy/articleshow/87824751.cms||---
---||Madurai||As rains bring snakes out, NGO launches drive to coexist with them||Madurai: Killing snakes could damage the environment badly and agriculture would also be affected as they control pests like rats. Relocating a snake after capturing it is also detrimental to it, just as a new environment is to any other animal, say members of Urvanam, an NGO engaged in animal rescue. “Knowing a snake you encounter and letting it go by taking precautions is the best thing that can be done,’’ says the NGO’s coordinator P R Vishwanath. The organisation has launched a campaign in Madurai about ‘coexisting’ with snakes so as to protect the people as well as these reptiles. The programme assumes significance in the wake of snakes posing a problem to people in villages and cities with the onset of monsoon. The programme was flagged off on Friday in Thanakkankulam panchayat of Thiruparankundram union where all 139 villages will be covered. “We focus on the 100-day work scheme workers who often encounter snakes and educate them,’’ said Chandran, a volunteer. The vehicle used for the campaign has banners on the “Big four’’, the venomous snakes that people are likely to encounter — Indian Cobra, common krait, russell’s viper and saw-scaled viper. “These are the only snakes that could inflict fatal bites, almost all other snake bites are harmless,’’ says Vishwanath.People including students are taught how to identify the snake and also how to manage if one is bitten. “Stay calm and reach the hospital, if possible Government Rajaji hospital which is well-equipped to treat snake bites, is what we tell the people,’’ he said. During their journeys, the number 8608700088 is shared with the people in case they want to get in touch with Urvanam on encountering a snake. People in the urban limits of Thiruparankundram have asked them to conduct a campaign. “We are ready to give our services free to any one who needs it,’’ say the volunteers.The volunteers also met many snake bite survivors like Kaluvan of Thiruparankundram during the campaign. They are made to fill up a form giving details of how they dealt with the bite, so as to help others, says Thangapandian, a volunteer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-rains-bring-snakes-out-ngo-launches-drive-to-coexist-with-them/articleshow/87823681.cms||---

The victim, Rohit Patel, who has an account in a private bank’s branch in Udalpur village of Desar taluka, lodged a complaint of cheating under the Information Technology Act on Friday at Desar police station. In his complaint Patel said that when he opened the mini-statement of his bank account on October 11, he was shocked to find that Rs 1.2 lakh had been withdrawn from his account. Patel checked his bank balance as he had to transfer money to someone in Gandhinagar. Between October 6 and October 11, some person transferred the amount from his bank account to different accounts in four different banks.Police said that usually Patel gets an SMS for every transaction of his bank account. But for these transactions, he did not get any communication. “Usually, the money gets transferred only after the account holder shares a one-time password (OTP). But in this case Patel never received any OTP. We are investigating how the money got transferred,” said circle police inspector P V Pargadu. Cops will be seeking details from the bank about the transactions and also about the accounts to which the money got transferred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-sms-or-otp-yet-over-rs-1l-vanishes-from-bank-account/articleshow/87823153.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, Varanasi emerged as the ‘Best Ganga Town’ in the Swachh Survekshan. According to the results of the swachh survekshan announced by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry on Saturday, Varanasi secured the 30th position in the national ranking of the cities having a population of more than 10 lakh. The city lagged behind other cities of Uttar Pradesh including Lucknow (12), Ghaziabad (18), Kanpur (21), Agra (24), Prayagraj (26) and Meerut (27). In this year’s survekshan, the city slipped three steps down from the previous survekshan in 2020, when it was ranked at 27th position. In the past, the city was placed at the 70th rank in 2019, 29th rank in 2018, 32nd rank in 2017 and 65th rank in the first survekshan in 2016. The city also lagged behind in the clean cantonment category, as Varanasi Cantonment Board got 20th ranking among the clean cantonment boards. In district ranking too, Varanasi was placed at the 105th position. The only thing of comfort for the citizens and the officials is that the city was adjudged the ‘best’ among Ganga towns. The President Ramnath Kovind gave the trophy and certificate to UP Minister Ashutosh Tandon, Varanasi mayor Mridula Jaiswal and municipal commissioner Pranay Singh at a function held at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. “It is a matter of pride that Varanasi was recognized as the best Ganga Town in the country. The prize received from the President will inspire use to do better,” said the mayor. The municipal commissioner said that being an important centre of pilgrimage and tourism Varanasi is visited by the pilgrims and tourists in large numbers. They visit the riverfront for bathing and boating in the Ganga. Proper arrangements have been made for the cleaning of ghats, he said. On the city’s performance in national ranking, he said that efforts will be made to improve the overall ranking. Swachh Survekshan is an annual survey of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation in cities and towns across India. It was launched as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which aimed to make India clean and free of open defecation. The first survey was undertaken in 2016 and covered 73 cities and by 2021 the survey grew to cover 4,320 cities. The objective of the survey is to encourage large scale citizen participation, ensure sustainability of initiatives taken towards garbage free and open defecation free cities, provide credible outcomes which would be validated by third party certification, institutionalize existing systems through online processes and create awareness amongst all sections of society about the importance of working together towards making towns and cities more habitable and sustainable. Additionally, the survey also intends to foster a spirit of healthy competition amongst towns and cities to improve their service delivery to citizens and move towards creating cleaner cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-emerges-as-best-ganga-town-in-swachh-survekshan/articleshow/87823694.cms||---

Owing to prolonged inundation by rainwater, commuters were unable to use the shelter.Situated opposite to the main office of Trichy corporation and All India Radio, the bus shelter on Bharathidasan Road, which serves as a boarding point for passengers from schools, hospitals and government offices, has been in a dilapidated state for months. The constant flow of run-off water from an adjacent stormwater drain had prevented the passengers from using the bus stop with people standing outside the bus stop even during the rain. As the buses were halting away from the shelter, movement of vehicles was hindered quite frequently, causing traffic bottlenecks on the arterial road that connects Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) and taluk office. “Buses skip the designated halting point and the trailing vehicles are forced to halt behind them, causing traffic congestion. We hired workers to clean the accumulated silt and repair it to make passengers take shelter at the bus stop,” A Murugesan, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), told TOI. On learning about the police’s efforts, Trichy corporation officials were quick to “pitch in” with the assurance that they will level the low-lying area near the bus shelter with concrete flooring. “Due to the rain, we had temporarily stopped the renovation work. We will soon level the area near the bus shelter to avoid inundation,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-cops-repair-corpn-bus-shelter/articleshow/87824752.cms||Deepak Karthik

With the 4th spot among cities with a population between 1 lakh and 10 lakh in the Swachh survey, Noida was Uttar Pradesh’s cleanest this year, up 21 spots from the last time. But it was a double feat for Noida on Saturday – it also bagged a 5-star garbage-free city status. An invite to the Swachh award event a few days ago had anyway triggered hopes for the Authority officials that the city might rank among the top 10 this year. With the 4th spot, Noida has obviously surpassed all expectations. More than 4,000 municipal corporations and civic bodies had participated in the survey, whose awards were handed over by the Union minister of housing and urban affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri. “I want to thank our sanitation workers and the public health department for the hard work they put in throughout the year. It’s because of their dedication that we were able to achieve the 4th spot. We also want to thank the residents for their participation. Without the support of all stakeholders, we may not have achieved the 5-star garbage-free city status this year,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of the Noida Authority. Among officials who were felicitated were additional CEO Praveen Mishra, officers on special duty Indu Prakash Singh and Avinash Tripathi and senior project engineer (public health) SC Mishra. A senior official listed some of the steps the Authority took in the past one year to keep the city clean. “It was a combination of efforts. The entire waste that would be collected every day was processed, we would regulate the use of plastic with regular crackdowns, keep watch on construction and demolition waste, address the complaints of residents and ensure the bulk waste generators complied with the rules,” the official said. For residents, the Authority’s battle against garbage was not yet over, but had just begun. “It’s now an uphill task for both the residents and the Authority. What they have done is commendable, but sustainability of the movement would be the true measure of success,” said Rajiva Singh, president of the Noida federation of apartment owners’ association. The Noida Authority, meanwhile, appointed Padma Bhushan awardee sculptor Ram V Sutar as the Swachh ambassador of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/noida-gurgaon-gzb-register-better-results/articleshow/87827310.cms||Shalabh

With the 4th spot among cities with a population between 1 lakh and 10 lakh in the Swachh survey, Noida was Uttar Pradesh’s cleanest this year, up 21 spots from the last time. But it was a double feat for Noida on Saturday – it also bagged a 5-star garbage-free city status. An invite to the Swachh award event a few days ago had anyway triggered hopes for the Authority officials that the city might rank among the top 10 this year. With the 4th spot, Noida has obviously surpassed all expectations. More than 4,000 municipal corporations and civic bodies had participated in the survey, whose awards were handed over by the Union minister of housing and urban affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri. “I want to thank our sanitation workers and the public health department for the hard work they put in throughout the year. It’s because of their dedication that we were able to achieve the 4th spot. We also want to thank the residents for their participation. Without the support of all stakeholders, we may not have achieved the 5-star garbage-free city status this year,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of the Noida Authority. Among officials who were felicitated were additional CEO Praveen Mishra, officers on special duty Indu Prakash Singh and Avinash Tripathi and senior project engineer (public health) SC Mishra.

He took the victim to his farm house, thrashed him, took away his smartphone and also threatened him against filing a complaint with the police.Police said P Murugan Perumal, 25, of Thirukazhukundram in Chengalpattu, is doing his senior internship at the medical college. He was in a relationship with a female senior intern and had started intimidating her with pictures of the two and their mobile phone chats. “The frightened girl informed her mother, who is a professor in a leading government aided arts and science college in Tuticorin. She had in turn sought help from Ilayaraja, who is her former student, to deal with the issue,” Tuticorin district SP S Jayakumar told TOI. On Thursday afternoon, Ilayaraja and two of his accomplices abducted Murugan from the medical college in a car.They took him to Ilayaraj’s farm house in Ottapidaram and beat him up with a rubber tube. Murugan suffered two small cuts on his head in the assault that lasted a few hours. The trio took away his smart phone worth Rs 70,000 and his wallet before dropping him at the hospital. They warned him to leave Tuticorin and they would kill his family if he reported the incident to the police.Murugan fled to his friend’s place in Madurai and informed his family. His family admitted him to Thoothukudi MCH on Friday night, from where Murugan lodged a complaint with the Thoothukudi South Police.

The heart was allotted to a patient in Chennai hospital, but the recipient was not in a condition to pay for the air ambulance to transport the organ. The pair of lungs was allotted to a hospital in Secunderabad, but it was rejected by the hospital, also due to logistics problem. TOI asked experts in the field of organ donation about how grievous is the logistics problem and what the probable solution is. “Chennai and Secunderabad centres could not utilize the organs for their registered recipients as the transportation cost was beyond their reach,” said Dr Vibhavari Dani, president of Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), Nagpur. The ZTCC maintains centralised waiting lists for various organ recipients, and ensures equitable allocation of organs. “The time has now come to mull over this logistical cost hindrance, especially at government level. Serious rethinking is necessary for lowering such costs to save lives of the needy from the underprivileged sections of the society,” said Dr Dani. ZTCC secretary and senior kidney transplant surgeon Dr Sanjay Kolte said heart and lung transplant facilities should start in cities like Nagpur. “Local experts must rise to the demand and brace up to enable transplantation of heart and lungs within city limits. Transportation of organs to distant destinations must also be made reasonably affordable and readily available,” he said. Cardiac surgeon Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital, which is leading in organ transplant surgeries in Central India, said a national-level policy of organ transplant ambulance should be framed. “We have performed 44 liver and 36 kidney transplants at New Era Hospital so far. At least half of the donors had heart in good condition, but we lost the opportunity due to logistics problems,” he said. According to Dr Sancheti, Air India, soon to be owned by the Tata group, can station one small plane at three or four metropolitan cities in India. “These flights should take off only for organ retrieval and transport activity. The recipient will pay fuel and operational cost of the flight. There would be no need to hire a costly chartered flight for them. It will curtail huge expenses and make organ transplant affordable,” Dr Sancheti added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spl-organ-air-ambulance-can-end-logistics-problems/articleshow/87823699.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The court accepted the plea and now police will interrogate PK for collecting details of the spread of the network of the gang and also the persons in his contact.” PK, the Patna-based mastermind of the solvers’ gang busted during NEET (UG)-2021 here on September 12, and his close aide Ritesh were arrested by Sarnath police on Thursday a few hours after the announcement of a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on him. Both were sent to jail after being produced before the court on Friday.

The residents allege that the corporation has been showing a step-motherly attitude towards them.CPM East taluk secretary Kalaiselvan says that they become cut-off from the rest of the city whenever it rains, and this year the condition is worse. Ulaganeri Main Road turns slushy and in front of the government bus depot it becomes unmotorable and even walkable, as buses continue to plough through the mud.The road was laid six months ago, and it only took one rain season to make it pothole ridden, say the residents. “Not even 10 feet of the road is left undamaged after the rain, and adding to the woes, the streetlights also not working,” he said, adding that people often met with accidents.The inner roads like the one at Telecom Nagar, which has no tar covering, became slushy stretches. “There is a private hospital at Telecom Nagar, and the road leading to it is so bad that shifting patients during emergencies could be actually dangerous to them,” said T Jayakumar, a resident of Ulaganeri.Kalaiselvan says that robbery has increased on the Ulaganeri Main Road. “Robbers know that vehicles move at a slow pace and they are indulging in robberies and we have made many representations for a permanent police outpost, though we have police patrolling in the area during daytime,” he said.S Selvam of Valar Nagar says that the area does not have a UGD system, and pipelines for corporation water supply are scarce. When it rains, water from the main road enters the area. People are forced to walk on these inundated roads. “Most of the streetlights in the ward do not work properly, and this adds to the problems,” he said.Corporation sources said that laying of inner roads would not be taken up immediately, but potholes would be repaired after the rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/potholes-water-logging-slush-plague-road-laid-6-months-ago-in-madurai-city/articleshow/87823693.cms||---

Sources said both local BJP worker and aspirant for party ticket for the UP polls, Prince Chaudhary, and district panchayat chairman Sakender Chaudhary claimed they had booked the copter and hence, wanted to take credit for the “pushpvarsha”. After the flight was cancelled, both contenders filed a complaint against the company offering the copter service. According to sources, petals were to be showered from the helicopter on the devotees who had gathered for the holy dip at the banks of the Ganga. This was to be the first time that a “pushpvarsha” was to be done. The private company chopper landed at the Police Line helipad but was not allowed to take off. Chairman of the district panchayat board Sakender Chaudhary filed a complaint against the aviation company, alleging that he had hired the chopper for “pushvarsha”. It was supposed to land in Police Line around 11am on Friday but came around 2pm. As the company did not abide by its agreement, the “pushpvarsha” did not take place. Besides, the company had rented the same chopper to another person illegally. On his part, Prince Chaudhary claimed to have the legal documents to show that he had booked the copter. He claimed, "I had booked the chopper from Dehradun and it was to fly over Vidurkuti, where I would shower flowers on the devotees. There was no plan to land in Bijnor. But the pilot landed it at Bijnor Police Line on the orders of the administration. Then, we were not allowed to take off.” Radheshyam (who goes by his first name), Bijnor city station house officer, confirmed receiving a complaint each from Prince Chaudhary and Sakendra Chaudhary against the chopper service company. A case has been registered and a probe is on. Meanwhile, the copter was allowed to take off on Saturday afternoon after being parked in the Police Line for 24 hours. Its company had to pay a fine to the police department equivalent to two days’ salary of the police personnel deployed at the helipad. Reserve instructor Shivbalak Verma said, "Our department suffered losses because of mismanagement by the chopper service company. It was allowed to take off after the company assured to compensate us for the loss.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bijnor-pushpvarsha-cancelled-after-spat-over-copter-between-2-bjp-members/articleshow/87823157.cms||Harveer Dabas

The Congress members raised slogans against BJP and TRS alleging that both the governments were equally responsible for the deaths of farmers. “How can the ruling TRS claim that the farm laws were repealed after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao sat on a dharna. If CM KCR was so influential, he should ensure that the centre steps down from its stand and agrees to procure paddy from Telangana,” he said. Stating that KCR’s outburst against PM Modi is nothing but drama, TPCC president A Revanth Reddy said that if KCR was sincere about his demand, he should have ensured that a resolution was passed against the three farm laws in the state assembly. The TPCC chief demanded that the state government purchase entire Vanakalam paddy in line with KCR’s promise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-holds-candle-rally-for-farmers/articleshow/87823732.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Kumar, an admin staff at a night club, had been hospitalised for over six months. This was the second time Kumar had been admitted with Covid-19. He was first diagnosed with Covid-19 and admitted to Gandhi-Hospital for 15 days in April. “After the 15 days treatment protocol was over and I had improved, I went home but within a week the symptoms were back and this time they were much stronger. At that point of time, I went to a private hospital but after two weeks my condition worsened and I was back at Gandhi Hospital. For the initial two months, I was hardly able to understand anything,” said Kumar. During his long stay at the hospital, he underwent many procedures and remained unconscious for nearly a month. “He (Kumar) had been in Gandhi for six months and was discharged today after a full recovery. During the hospital stay, his condition was very serious and had to be on CPAP along with ICD (intercostal drainage) tubes in both lungs for weeks,” said Gandhi Hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao.

Apart from a host of products from states across the country and even items displayed by the international participants, food stalls offering cuisines exclusive to the respective states and even the food court saw thousands thronging the kiosks. Inside the exhibition halls, one of the major crowd-pullers was at the Rajasthan arena. Onion kachoris, tikkis, chaats and various thaalis attracted several of the visitors who were present at IITF. For those with a sweet-tooth, a “mishti shop” set up near the West Bengal arena saw people queuing up in large numbers as well. Apart from the traditional sweets, samosas were also flying off the shelves. Groundnut chikki, gur chikki (peanut chikki) were also some of the major draws near the Maharashtra arena. Apart from performances taking place at a packed amphitheatre, folk performances near arenas set up by Jharkhand and Haryana also attracted eyeballs and drew loud cheers from bystanders. Even though regular announcements were being made to ensure implementation of Covid protocols, streams of visitors entering the respective arenas resulted in several of the kiosks getting overcrowded with hardly any space for social distancing left. At the food stalls also, groups of people ended up huddling together, sans masks. Sanjay Vashishtha, spokesperson of the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), said that the footfall on Saturday had breached the limit that authorities were trying to maintain. “Even though we are trying to keep the footfall within 25,000, on Saturday, the number of people who visited the fair went beyond that. We are trying our best to ensure that protocol is maintained. Announcements are also being made in that regard and those without masks are being advised to wear them. Extensive measures are being taken,” Vashishtha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/food-performances-major-hits-at-trade-fair/articleshow/87823725.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The accused, Afroz Ansari, hails from Gopalganj in Bihar. He had earlier been booked by West Bengal Police for kidnapping. He was arrested on Saturday in a joint effort of ChildLine Lucknow, Mukti Foundation and Indiranagar police. According to sources, Ansari was caught red-handed while abusing the minor when the team raided his hideout. “We suspect that the girl was sexually abused at least five times since she was brought to Lucknow. The accused has confessed to the act,” said ChildLine coordinator for Lucknow Sangeeta Sharma. “During counselling, the victim claimed that she had come into Ansari’s contact on Facebook. She had eloped with him after he promised to marry her and help her in achieving her dream to become a fashion designer. A student of class 9, she has three more siblings. Her father is a daily-wage labourer working in a godown,” said Sharma. “Ansari works in a factory in Bengaluru. We suspect he was trying to push the survivor into prostitution after sexually abusing her. He allegedly staged a fake marriage with her after offering namaz in front of a man who claimed to be a maulvi. Since her arrival in Lucknow, the girl was not even allowed to go to the bathroom without the escort of the accused,” added the activist. After the rescue on Friday evening, West Bengal Police took both her and the accused back to the state. The girl’s medical examination was conducted in Lucknow. Another one for sexual abuse will be conducted in West Bengal following which rape charges will be pressed under POCSO Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/minor-from-bengal-kidnapped-abused-on-pretext-of-marriage-rescued-in-city/articleshow/87824280.cms||---

Mistry, who hails from Vadodara, will be presented the medal by President Ram Nath Kovind at an investiture ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Monday. Before him, general Rajendrasinhji Jadeja, former commander-in-chief of the Indian Army and lieutenant general Mahipatsinh Jadeja are the only two other Gujarati officers to rise to the rank of lieutenant general. The senior officer, who retired from service last month, has joined Rashtriya Raksha University, Gandhinagar as director of School of Internal Security, Defence & Strategic Studies and will be settling down in Ahmedabad. While in service, his last role was as the commandant of National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla, which is known as the cradle of military leadership. At the NDA he oversaw training of nearly 2,000 young cadets. He has also been the colonel of the Maratha Light Infantry regiment. During his military career spanning nearly four decades, he has already bagged three other distinguished service awards — Ati Vishisht Seva Medal, Sena Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal — besides commendations of chief of the army staff and general officer commanding-in-chief. He was conferred the coveted PVSM on the eve of 72nd Republic Day. Born in Vadodara, Mistry, 60, did his initial schooling at Experimental School. From a very young age, he had set his sights on joining the army and joined the Sainik School at Balachadi in 1972. He was selected for NDA, Khadakwasla in 1978 and was commissioned in 12 Maratha Light Infantry in 1982. He was the first officer to be commissioned in the infantry which he later commanded. A graduate of Defence Services Staff College and higher command course, Mistry has a master’s degree in defence studies from Madras University and MPhil from Devi Ahilyabai Vishwavidyalaya, Indore. During his long military career, Mistry had varying and challenging assignments ranging from postings at the frozen heights of Drass and Siachen Glacier to active counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist operations in Assam as well as Jammu & Kashmir. As a young captain, he served as a team commander in National Security Guards, better known as the black cats. He has extensive experience of UN peacekeeping missions and was a UN military observer in Liberia in 1996-97 and deputy force commander of the UN Mission in South Sudan in 2012-14. Back home, he has led three Republic Day parades in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and two Independence Day parades in 2018 and 2019. The lieutenant general is married to Mira Mistry. Carrying forward the legacy, their only son, Major Shrey Mistry, too has joined the Indian Army as well as the same unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/barodas-asit-mistry-to-be-conferred-pvsm/articleshow/87823171.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Lucknow||Lack of monkey breeding facility had hit Covaxin trials at crucial time: ICMR DG||Lucknow: The development of Covaxin—India’s indigenously developed vaccine against Covid-19 made by Bharat Biotech Ltd—had faced an obstacle because there was no monkey breeding facility for clinical drug trials in India. The lab was not willing to take the help of China, which is the only country where monkey breeding for drug trials takes place. The story was narrated by Prof Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), who was chief guest at the annual research showcase of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) organized at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Convention Centre on Saturday. Addressing faculty members and students on ‘Going viral, the inside story of Covaxin’, Prof Bhargava, a KGMU alumnus, said, “After the trial of Covaxin on small animals such as rats, rabbits and mouse, we faced hindrance because there was no monkey breeding facility in the country to test the vaccine.” “Even countries like UK and US were taking monkeys from China for clinical trials, but we were unwilling to get them from there. Hence, ICMR immediately initiated a process to take permission from the environment and animal husbandry ministry and after getting approval, 20 monkeys were caught from the jungles of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana by various agencies and sent for Covaxin trials. After verifying through tests that these monkeys were healthy, trials could begin,” he said. “We introduced Covid virus to monkeys’ lungs through bronchoscopy and vaccinated them. Continued bronchoscopy of these monkeys was done for 14 days to check if the virus is replicating at a rapid pace. After no viral growth was found, Covaxin passed monkey trials,” he explained. The monkeys were monitored for 68 days and results were published in ‘Nature’, a prestigious science journal. Thereafter, India never looked back and found one success after another. Finally, it was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on November 3, he said. When TOI asked him why there was delay in WHO clearance of Covaxin, Prof Bhargava said that instead of going into technicalities about the delay, we should look forward to the bright future of Covaxin, which has been approved by 110 countries and effective against all kinds of variants of novel coronavirus that have emerged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lack-of-monkey-breeding-facility-had-hit-covaxin-trials-at-crucial-time-icmr-dg/articleshow/87824290.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

About 50 people, feared to be washed away in the flash floods, remained untraced. While six persons lost their lives in a house collapse incident in Anantapur, six other deaths were reported from Chittoor. Seventeen deaths were reported from the four affected districts of Rayalaseema on Friday. The toll is likely to rise as there is no clarity on the fate of those who were washed away in the flash floods, including about 30 persons from Pulapathuru village. Heavy rains triggered by a series of depressions in the Bay of Bengal led to the overflowing of rivers and water projects causing flash floods in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Nellore over the last 72 hours. Thousands remain marooned while roads to several villages have caved in due to the force of gushing water. The floods left behind a trail of destruction in Pulapathuru, Mandapalli, Seshamambapuram, Gundluru, Choppavaripalli and Kosarajupalli villages in Rajampet mandal, and Patooru, Isakapalli and six more villages in Nandavaram mandal. Most of the mud houses have been devoured by the gushing waters in these villages. A building collapsed at Kadiri town in Anantapur district on Saturday killing six people and damaging the adjoining houses. Kadiri additional SP Ramakrishna Prasad said the dead included three children. Police and revenue department staff managed to rescue nine others who were stuck beneath the debris. The condition of the injured is stated to be stable. Meanwhile, bodies of the deceased have been shifted to Kadiri government hospital for postmortem. Police, along with NDRF and SDRF teams, rescued several people who were stranded in the flood waters at Puttaparthi, Kadiri, Dharmavaram and other parts of the district. The situation in Kurnool was much better with rains subsiding. The bodies of the couple who were washed away in KC canal while performing Kartika Pournami rituals were found late on Friday night. With water still rushing down from Seshachalam forest ranges, several low-lying colonies in the temple city of Tirupati continue to remain inundated. The Srivari Mettu pedestrian route to Tirumala has been severely damaged and it could take at least a month for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to repair and reopen the route for devotees to trek up to the seven hills. In the morning, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy conducted an aerial survey of the flood impact in Chittoor, Kadapa and Nellore districts. Later, Jagan held a meeting with officials and asked them to step up rescue and relief measures in the affected areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-flood-toll-rises-to-29-50-still-missing/articleshow/87824295.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Pune||18 dists below avg on full vax cover for med, frontline staff in Mumbai||Pune: Nearly 18 districts in the state are below the state average for full vaccination coverage of healthcare and frontline workers. As per data shared by the public health department, the state’s average coverage (both doses) for these two groups is 87%. Of these 18 districts, three — Jalna, Osmanabad, and Gondia — are 71-78% coverage for both these groups. Vaccine hesitancy or technical errors, with some frontline workers registering in other categories, are being verified, said state public health officials. As of November 17, six districts achieved over 90% vaccination of health workers, with Palghar leading with 99.1% and Chandrapur second with 92.6%. In case of frontline workers, seven districts have above 90% coverage, with Palghar (97.8%) and Mumbai (92.3%) first and second. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said there could be three reasons for this. “At the start, there were issues with data collection wherein names were duplicated. Further, when the programme had started, some hospitals had got their staff registered through open or general categories and so, many names may not reflect under the health worker category. Thirdly, there could be vaccine hesitancy; they need to be sensitised,” Patil said. A senior revenue official said many officials, or those with the “frontline” tag, had taken the vaccine in the 44+ group. “This needs to be double-checked and data needs to be streamlined,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-dists-below-avg-on-full-vax-cover-for-med-frontline-staff-in-mumbai/articleshow/87824780.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The party’s Mahanagar unit aims to induct one lakh more members in the city by November 30. The membership drive was launched by the party on October 29. BJP’s Mahanagar spokesperson Rajesh Kesarwani told TOI, “Over 35,000 new members have been inducted into the party between October 29 and November 21. We have set a target of inducting one lakh more members by November 30.” Since it is a door-to-door membership drive, our leaders and party workers are knocking on the doors of city residents to induct new members, Kesarwani added. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener (media) Ashish Gupta said, “The party has launched a special membership drive in the state and set the target of adding at least 1.5 crore new members to our existing 2.5 crore party workers.” This special membership drive was planned in the state to strengthen the party, particularly by including youngsters from all sections of the society, Gupta added. “We are getting a good response and people of all age groups are eager to join BJP and the number of our new members is increasing with every passing day. Special camps are being organised across the district to induct new members, including people from slums. Not just men, many women have also taken membership of the party,” he said. A senior party leader said the last membership drive was held in 2020 after which we had 2.5 crore members in UP. While holding meetings with district presidents, Mandal presidents and Panna pramukhs of Kashi region recently, the state party leadership had set the target of adding another 1.5 crore members. Senior party leaders are hoping to cross the mark of four crore members before the 2022 state assembly elections. Party leaders said a door-to-door campaign is underway to reach out to masses with an appeal to join BJP. Currently, BJP leaders from various morchas, cells, and frontal units are holding membership camps, reaching out to the people, and asking them to give a missed call on a particular number from their phones to become BJP members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-inducts-over-35000-membersaims-to-add-1-lakh-more-by-nov-30/articleshow/87836579.cms||---

In a memorandum submitted to MSU registrar, the senate members demanded that the upcoming elections be postponed in view of the ongoing inquiry set up by the Gujarat government to probe the alleged irregularities in appointments and other matters. “We would like to bring to your notice that the committee was set up by the Gujarat government after the representation made to the education minister. We strongly request and demand that the ongoing process of senate election should be immediately postponed,” the memorandum states. Further, the group argued that even the Central Commission of Scheduled Castes have sought clarification from MSU vice-chancellor (VC) in matter of appointments. “In such circumstances, we have doubts regarding a free and fair election process. Also, we demand that the elections of all the categories of the senate should be done on a single day rather than making the election process spread over a month,” the memorandum further stated. The group has claimed that at a time when both VC and registrar are facing inquiry, the election process might get influenced especially in the professors and teachers category. “The term of the present senate body ends on March 31, 2022 but the process is being done in haste,” the senate members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/syndicate-demand-deferring-msu-senate-polls-over-probe/articleshow/87823189.cms||---
---||Kochi||Covid pandemic affects Kochi corporation’s property tax collection||KOCHI: The corporation is facing a severe financial crunch and the local body is finding it difficult even to mobilize funds for purchasing bitumen for road relaying and carrying out other unavoidable works. In the absence of a proper system for tax collection, revenue generation has been affected. Arrears to the contractors would come to around Rs 100 crore. “It is a fact that the corporation faces acute shortage of funds. Just like other local bodies in the state, the corporation has also been hit by the Covid-19 and its fall out. People are reluctant to pay tax as all the sectors are under the grip of recession,” said mayor M Anil Kumar. For completing various projects like construction of the new corporation office building at Marine Drive, biomining of legacy waste at Brahmapuram would require at least Rs 100 crore. “Initially, the cost of biomining has been pegged at Rs 54 crore. Now, they say that the garbage has further accumulated causing subsequent increase in the cost of biomining,” said opposition leader Antony Kureethra. At the same time, the system for collection of various taxes is improper. In the absence of an online facility to assess and collect tax, there are no proper records with the local body regarding tax defaulters. “In the absence of online facility for tax collection, our staff would go to places of defaulters. But, people are not even ready to listen to our staff, let alone letting them in. The pandemic has made the door-to-door collection of taxes difficult,” Kumar said. “We have decided to expedite the work on the property tax module as part of our egovernance project. The IKM is going ahead with the process. We expect that the property tax can be collected online from January 2022,” he said. In the first eight months of the fiscal, the corporation authorities could collect only around 40% of average amount of the property tax projected for the year. “Normally, we get around Rs 130 crore as property tax. We could collect around Rs 55 crore in the current fiscal so far. The pandemic has affected our tax collection as well,” an official with the finance department of the corporation said. “As per the government order, the local bodies can demand tax arrears for the three preceding years. Now, the corporation officials have sent notices to many building owners demanding tax arrears from 2016. This would lead to the building owners moving the court challenging the local body’s move. It will affect the entire tax collection process adversely,” Kureethra said. “The corporation authorities should conduct adalats to settle disputes over tax collection,” Kureethra said. The revenue collection of the corporation during the month till November 18 is around Rs 4.5 crore. But, the corporation’s salary bills alone would come to around Rs 2 crore!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pandemic-affects-corps-property-tax-collection/articleshow/87823185.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Coming from a humble background, Rathore says he was ‘atmanirbhar’ since childhood: he won debates and various scholarships that helped him complete his dream of education. “Other students can revise syllabus in just a few hours, but those like me need at least 24 hours as we don’t have the luxury to just turn pages. We have to hear the syllabus through audiobooks,” said Arvind, who aspires to become a teacher. He said a visually impaired teacher can best understand such challenges as he or she has gone through the same and will take care of teaching speed or preparation time, he added. “These medals will motivate me to work for the education of specially abled students. As a number of students are not aware of learning material, I will tell them about it,” he said. BTech student Arpita Kumar has bagged the topmost Chancellors’ Gold Medal.

---||Delhi||Rejig of core New Delhi railway station delinked from rest of project||NEW DELHI: Giving the final push to the redevelopment of the New Delhi station, Indian Railways has rejigged its plan by delinking station development from commercial development and real estate activities. It will first take up station infrastructure development including upgradation of passenger amenities, parking lots and core areas of the station building. In the second phase, it would take up commercial development involving real estate. The railway ministry has been toying with several ideas and plans for redevelopment of this busiest station for around a decade, but has made hardly any progress. The sources also said the railways would take up the redevelopment on a hybrid ‘build, operate and transfer (BOT)’ model where the national transporter will pay 40% of the project cost during construction. The private player will have to invest the remaining 60% and the railways will pay back this amount in instalments spread over 26 years. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has adopted this model of NH development known as ‘hybrid annuity model (HAM)’. Sources said the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) made a detailed presentation before Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday. Since the railways will pay back the entire investment in instalments and thereby minimizing the risk of private investors, the proposed user fee to be charged from passengers will come to the national transporter. According to the plan, a double dome architecture structure of 450-meter long and 80-meter high would come up over the station. The total cost is estimated at around Rs 4,470 crore and there would be 25 floors high twin domes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rejig-of-core-new-delhi-stn-delinked-from-rest-of-project/articleshow/87823750.cms||Dipak K Dash

He also demanded the Centre to withdraw all cases booked against farmers during protests and against people like Disha, a girl from Bangalore, who was booked under sedition charges. KCR said the NDA government should also withdraw new Electricity Act claiming it was another anti-farmer law. The TRS would fight against the Act both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the TRS president said. If the Act is passed in Parliament forcibly, there would be another movement in the country, he threatened. Holding an unprecedented third press conference in two weeks, KCR asked for an ex gratia of Rs 25 lakh to each of the 700-750 farmers’ families who lost their lives during the protests in the past one year. On behalf of the Telangana government, he announced Rs 3 lakh ex gratia to kin of each farmer’s family. While welcoming the decision of the Centre on repealing the new farm laws, KCR said just an apology was not enough. “The government should come to the rescue of the farmers’ families,” he said. “People are believing the PM’s announcement and thinking it is an election stunt in view of upcoming assembly elections in five states. That is why farmers are demanding MSP Act.” He said the NDA government branded agitating farmers as terrorists and Khalistanis. “In Telangana, the government has been providing free 24x7 quality power for the past few years. With new Electricity Act, the Centre is asking to install meters at borewells. We have the capacity to provide free power and we are opposing the Act,. Why is the Centre pressuring the states to implement this? If you (the Centre) want, you can implement it in BJP-ruled states,” the CM said. Paddy row: CM off to Delhi again:CM KCR will be leaving for Delhi on Sunday to prevail upon the Centre on the paddy procurement issue. “If the Centre specifies its target, the state government would convince farmers to go for alternative crops,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-centre-enact-msp-law-junk-electricity-act/articleshow/87824342.cms||Koride Mahesh

Sources informed that Maya (T-12), the most popular tigress of Tadoba, was responsible for the attack. Dhumane was on foot with three labourers for the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) 2022 exercise when the incident took place. There have been cases of foresters being attacked by carnivores while on duty but all had escaped with injuries. Following Saturday’s incident, Tadoba field director Jitendera Ramgaonkar has suspended the enumeration exercise as well as the movement of tourists in Gypsys in the area. Swati DhumaneAccording to Ramgaonkar, Dhumane and team had started walking around 7 am. After 4 km, they noticed Maya sitting on the road about 200 metres ahead of them. The team waited for around 30 minutes and when the tigress didn’t budge they decided to take a detour through the forest. The tigress then attacked Dhumane who was moving behind the labourers and dragged her into the forest. On being informed, senior forest officials reached and traced the body. It was later shifted to Chimur government hospital for postmortem. “Dhumane is survived by husband and daughter and all help is being provided to them. Moreover, steps are being taken to prevent repetition of such incidents,” said Ramgaonkar who added that a case has been registered and “further investigations are on”. Maya’s sudden aggressive behaviour has surprised those who have followed her life. The tigress is known to stroll few feet from a fleet of Gypsys teeming with tourists without turning to look at them even when she was with her litter. Currently, she has no cubs. Kawadu Lohkare, the president of NGO Paryawaran Sanwardhan, felt post-monsoon is not the right time for tiger estimation exercise. “The forest is thick and green and there is little chance of detecting the presence of predators during this period. This exercise should be carried out in February and March,” he said. He also suspected that growing disturbance due to rising tourism activities, including night tourism in buffer zones close to Kolara, could be the reason for the Maya’s aggressive behaviour. “Separation from her cubs could also be another reason,” said Lohkare. Maya’s attack is also a deviation as tigers normally do not attack people moving in a group. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhorte said a detailed investigation should be undertaken to know the cause of Maya’s behaviour. “There is a need of increasing the number of people involved in such official work. Forest authorities need to come up with a clear protocol for foresters in such situations,” he said. Dhotre also pointed out that Dumane had come from territorial forest and had little experience of dealing with wildlife. “There should be a training protocol for foresters coming into the wildlife wing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maya-kills-forest-guard-in-tadoba-core-zone/articleshow/87823756.cms||Mazhar Ali

The toddler, aged around two years, was found playing alone near a bench in the park by Roshan, a visitor at the park. He took the child to the nearest police station. “We got a call from the police after the initial search to find the parent or guardian of the child did not yield any results. I went to the police station and collected the child after CWC was informed,” said Mary Anitha, chairperson of the centre for empowerment and enrichment (CEFEE), Ernakulam, an NGO which works for the welfare of differently challenged children. Anitha later took the child for an RT-PCR test and medical check-up. “The CWC chairperson called the Ernakulam General Hospital but we were told that it would take two days for the results to come and hence we got the test done in a private laboratory. He was tested negative. It was around 2am in the early hours of Saturday that the child was formally handed over to the CWC custody,” she said. Though the initial medical check-up by the paediatrician showed no disabilities, the authorities will have to ascertain his age if no relatives come to claim him. “He will be in the home for the next two months waiting for his parents or guardians. I have asked the district child protection officer to give an advertisement in a national newspaper as well as a local Odiya/Assamese paper as he is speaking one of those languages,” said Ernakulam CWC chairperson Bitty Joseph. Anitha said that the boy was saying some words clearly and he seems to know what to ask and does it clearly. “After eating the biscuit that he had with him, he clearly indicated that he wanted ‘chawal’. Also, he was mingling easily with the inmates of the home,” she said. The authorities would be looking at why the boy was abandoned, and no parent/ guardian has reported him missing. Police have already started searching in its network and all departments in relation to migrants have also been notified. Authorities in Odisha and Assam will also be informed. In case there are no claimants for the child, he will be cleared for adoption via the state adoption resource agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-yet-to-trace-parents-of-child-found-at-park/articleshow/87823199.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Agra||In one year, Agra slips to fourth from second position in UP: Swachh Survekshan 2021||Agra: Agra was ranked 24th in the annual all-India cleanliness survey, Swachh Survekshan 2021, results of which were announced on Saturday by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. In the state, the City of Taj was ranked fourth. However, there was nothing much to cheer about as Agra saw a decline in performance at both state and national levels. In 2020, Agra had secured the 16th position nationally and second in UP. Municipal commissioner Nikhil Funde attributed the drop in the ranking to the lack of door-to-door garbage collection system in the city. As expected, for the fifth time in a row, Indore city, was adjudged the cleanest city in the country. Surat in Gujarat and Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh secured second and third positions respectively. A total of 4,320 cities of the country participated in the Swachh Survekshan, the world’s largest urban cleanliness survey. Ranked 12th in the country, Lucknow secured the top spot in the state, Ghaziabad was placed at 18th position and Kanpur at 21st position. Prayagraj secured 26th rank followed by Meerut at 27 and Varanasi 30. Within the state, Meerut was placed in the sixth position. However, of the 62 cantonments in the country, Meerut Cantt secured second position. Uttar Pradesh, among the 13 states in the country with more than 100 urban local bodies, secured sixth position. Cities were ranked based on three broad parameters — service level progress, citizens] voice and certification — and were judged on a total of 8,600 marks. While ranking the cities, maximum weightage, 40%, was given to segregated collection of garbage, processing, disposal and sustainable sanitation. Citizen feedback carried 30% weightage and certification under the star rating protocol for garbage-free cities carried another 30% weightage. In Agra, mayor Naveen Jain has set a target for securing a place among the country’s top 10 cities in the 2022 edition of the Swachh Survekshan . “Reasons for the decline in the ranking will be identified. To properly maintain sanitation and hygiene in the city, a detailed work plan will be made and implemented in a time-bound manner. Our target is to secure under 10 rank in the 2022 edition of the survey. For this, suggestions will be taken from the citizens,” said Jain. Municipal commissioner Nikhil Funde said, “We lagged other cities following lack of door-to-door garbage collection mechanism. Very soon, it will be implemented across the city. The mountain of municipal solid waste, which has accumulated at the landfill site, is being disposed of in a scientific way. We are working to establish an advanced plan for processing municipal solid waste into electricity.” Last year, a major scam took place in the door-to-door garbage collection in Agra. Private companies were paid Rs 22.65 crore for door-to-door garbage collection without verification of work done. The investigation order by the mayor revealed that the private firms did only 10.5% of the door-to-door collection as compared to the work claimed by them in 83 wards of the city. The companies produced fake bills to get payments. On a large scale, the address and details of residents reported by the company as “evidence of door-to-door garbage collection” were found to be fake. The contract of the five private companies tasked for door-to-door garbage collection was cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-one-year-agra-slips-to-fourth-from-second-position-in-up-swachh-survekshan-2021/articleshow/87823215.cms||Deepak Lavania

In order to reduce the adverse effect on our environment and provide cleaner and greener transit with state-of-the-art Zero-Emission, a first fleet of 13 Electric buses arrived in the city on Saturday. The testing of the electric buses is being carried out, which would be made ready for public operations for one month (trial run) by first week of December this year, informed official sources. On Saturday divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar, along with nagar ayukt, officers of smart city, officers of city buses services and officers of PMI Agency (which will manage the electric buses and charging station) visited charging station in Ahirwan to see the work progress and plan for early execution of the project on ground. The incharge officer of PMI told officials that a total of 100 electric buses have been allotted to Kanpur city by the government. Out of which, the first lot of 13 buses arrived in the city on Saturday. Another 47 buses will come by Dec 15 and the remaining 40 buses will come in January 2022. The PMI incharge officer said that there are a total 25 charging stations/points planned for the operation of 100 buses. Five charging stations will be fully ready by Nov 27 and the 13 buses can be charged at these five points from Nov 28 onwards. The rest 20 charging points would be completed by Dec 15 and then they would be tested for operations one week after that. Commissioner, nagar ayukt and team shared about the features of buses like, CCTV coverage, safety measures like panic button, alarm , wireless set, emergency stoppage function and touch panel for overall control of bus operations. All the features are under checking and they would all be checked and certified in the next one week. The commissioner ordered a committee of city bus officers, smart city officers, PMI representatives and one expert from IIT or HBTU for the final checking and certification of the buses before deploying them for general operations. Looking into the need for a large public toilet at the charging stations, commissione also asked the nagar ayukt to prepare an estimate for the same and get it done in the next two months. Nagar Ayukt also updated the commissioner that the road widening work and underground cabling work is in progress and would be completed by Dec 15, this year. Along with this, the proposal of 500 meters additional road connectivity would also be taken up by the end of next month and would be completed by January 2022. This will ease the problem of traffic congestion in the area and will ensure smooth movement of electric buses to and from the charging station at Ahirwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/first-fleet-of-13-electric-buses-arrives-in-the-city/articleshow/87823766.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Small in size, big on potential: Underrated Muniya, a fit case for sanctuary||Nagpur: For environmentalist Vijay Ghuge (58), the 20-year-old battle to declare Muniya Conservation Reserve (MCR), 40km from Nagpur on SH-6, is half won. His dream now is to see the pristine forest notified as a wildlife sanctuary. The 96 sq km Muniya was among 11 conservation reserves (CRs) given the green signal on December 4, 2020, by the State Wildlife Board (SWBL) headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Though its final notification was issued on May 17, considering its strategic location and scientific importance, an SWBL sub-committee of experts has been set up to see whether Muniya can be declared a wildlife sanctuary. To explore the area, TOI visited Muniya on November 7 with a team of experts led by Ghuge himself, who in 2001 had launched a ‘Jan Darshan-Van Darshan’ 40km cycle yatra to save pristine forests with the help of communities living on the fringes of Muniya. In September 2007, he was the first to move a formal proposal with the forest department to declare Muniya a conservation reserve. The dry deciduous evergreen miscellaneous forest with perennial streams and lakes around is a fit case to be declared a sanctuary, and notifying it as a CR is an aberration. The forest is mainly concentrated over hills with rare trees like panjra, kasvi, faas, dahivaras, palang, bartondi, katechu, kamarkas, kakad etc. The forest has the presence of gaur, chitals, chousinga, sambar, nilgai, sloth bear, chinkara, langur, wild boar, and carnivores like leopard, tiger, and wild dogs. The miscellaneous forest will be a good source of food all year round for herbivores with big lakes like Matkazari, Navramari, Mangrud, Junapani, Chargaon, and Nishanghat as drinking water sources. Several other perennial streams flow through the jungles with arjun trees along the watercourses, which are a good indicator of forests’ health. “Muniya will be a stepping stone for tigers in the future with connectivity to Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary, and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). There are already a couple of tigers there. A sub-adult tiger was found dead there on September 10, 2021,” says conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar. Ghuge, who is one of the invitees to the SWBL sub-committee, has been insisting since the beginning to keep Muniya’s status unchanged and reiterated his stand at the first meeting of the panel in September. However, Ghuge’s perceptions have changed now. “After a 68km tour of Muniya, I’m convinced that it is a fit case for a sanctuary. Considering serious threats like illicit felling, cattle and sheep grazing, fishing, trespassing, temple tourism, and poaching, I strongly feel it should be notified as a sanctuary as it will be better protected. Conservation reserve would not change the present status of the forest,” admits Ghuge. What Ghuge said was quite visible during the field visit. It was a free for all in Muniya. The pagoda (a big machan called pagoda by locals) at Sasahudki, 2km inside the forest on Thana Shani Mandir-Bela Road, has turned into a hotspot for revellers with people enjoying drinks and throwing bottles in the forest. The pagoda itself is a hidden treasure with the Rama dam and a full view of cloud on the waters. This is not the only threat. Adjacent to the pagoda on the other end of the road is a Mahadeo temple inside the dense forest on a perennial water stream. Many devotees visit the temple and also cook food using wind-fallen trees from the forest. The visitors play music and also litter the forest with plastic despite dustbins in place. The sensitive place has been officially declared a tourism spot by the department after ex-MLA from Umred Sudhir Parwe brought Rs62 lakh under Ecotourism Development Fund. Permanent van majoor Vasudeo Waghade confirmed that the Mahadeo temple road and surrounding forests in the Chargaon round have on and off presence of carnivores. Earlier, camera traps have recorded wild dogs and a sloth bear. On November 7, fresh leopard pugmarks were clearly visible near the temple road. A shepherd from Chargaon, Maruti Kodape, confirmed he saw a tiger eight days ago. “A tiger was also sighted in August in the forest near the temple,” he recalled. The scenario was worse in Muradpur beat under the Butibori range where revellers from Umred were cooking meat outside a concrete dargah (shrine) of Fatan Shah. A little ahead, a huge cattle herd of the Kathiyawadi tribe was engaged in grazing, and fishing is rampant in Nishanghat lake. A makeshift camp was also set up on the lake shore. “Considering past experience, you never know if poachers enter the forest under the garb of devotees. Cooking food inside the jungle and grazing are big threats. Otherwise, Muniya is an excellent place for water birds and arboreal animals. Huge lakes provide green meadows. Therefore, the ungulate population can increase rapidly if curbs on illegal grazing are imposed,” says Gadchiroli honorary warden Uday Patel. As the team moved from Pipaldol to Panjrepaar, shockingly there was a makeshift camp of sheep grazers deep inside the forest near a perennial water body known as Chikhaldhokda (locals call it Ambycha Ghat). Natthu Rabari from Kutch admitted he was paid Rs7,000 per month by the owner to graze the sheep in the forest. “The beautiful spot with a huge canopy of anjan trees looks nothing less than the core area of any tiger reserve. Perhaps due to sufficient water availability graziers have set up camp here,” said Ghuge. Locals TOI spoke to were not averse to declaring Muniya a sanctuary, provided it brings in employment to local youths. “Our village Chikhaldhokda has marginal farmers. It is surrounded by forests from all sides and crop depredation by wild animals is a big issue. If eco-tourism benefits are passed on to the locals, we have no problem,” said Hiraman Lamsoge and others. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE * SBWL committee needs to take call on sanctuary in next meeting. * Teak plantations reduce food availability hence need to single out teak before making it a sanctuary * Need to take up road development as only a four-wheel vehicle can enter the forest at present * Water conservation needs required by desilting perennial nullahs * Need to regulate temple tourism through EDCs * Impose a ban on Kathiawadi cattle, which is already prohibited as per GR * Strengthen corridor between Muniya-Karhandla-TATR-Bor||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/small-in-size-big-on-potential-underrated-muniya-a-fit-case-for-sanctuary/articleshow/87823777.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Though the bankers have been granting loans to the tenant farmers for long, it mostly remained a token measure as over 90 per cent of the tenant farmers were depending on the private moneylenders for aid during the crop season. With rules strictly prohibiting the bankers to issue loans either to the landlords or those certified by the local revenue authorities, the bankers have never been liberal in granting loans to the actual cultivators.  However, this situation is expected to be completely changed very soon as the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government has succeeded in making the bankers in the state to take e-crop record as evidence to grant loans to the actual cultivators. The state government which launched the innovative Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) to extend all services to the farmers, had also introduced e-crop methodology to record the details of actual cultivators. The state government has been utilising the data in e-crop for procurement of produce and to extend the crop insurance benefit to the farmers. The e-crop data is being readied in a fool-proof system as the officials from agriculture and revenue departments are physically visiting the fields to record the details of the existing crop. The government is also providing zero interest benefit to all those farmers who paid their crop loans on time only with the help of e-crop record.  Taking the positive outcome of the e-crop, the state government has now directed the bankers to take the same as record to grant the crop loans to the actual cultivators. The district collectors have also been directed to issue the Tenant Farmer Loan Eligibility Cards to all the tenant farmers based on the e-crop data. “We have requested the state government to extend support in synchronization of the c-crop data with loan charge record with the bankers and e-karshak portals in order to grant loans based on e-crop data,” said a senior banker. Agriculture commissioner H Arun Kumar has confirmed that the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) has agreed to issue loans based on e-crop data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/banks-to-grant-loans-on-e-crop-data-basis/articleshow/87823207.cms||Samdani MN

---||Goa||FC Goa have strongest and most balanced squad in five years: Edu Bedia||Panaji: Edu Bedia has been here long enough to know what works in Indian football. The Spanish midfielder joined FC Goa in 2017 and has since then been an integral part of the team. Last season, he led Juan Ferrando’s boys to a record 15-match unbeaten run but lost against eventual champions Mumbai City FC in the semifinals on penalties. It was a bitter pill to swallow for the Goans, but eight months later as they ready to face Mumbai in their opening, the captain is anticipating a much better campaign. “We are now a much more competitive team than last season,” Bedia told TOI on Sunday. “Last year, we made a lot of silly mistakes in terms of conceding soft goals, etc, but this year I think we have worked a lot to improve on that aspect.” During his five years here, Bedia has been part of some terrific FC Goa squads, including the 2018-19 team that dazzled its way to the final, before losing against Bengaluru FC in extra time. The Spaniard has had fantastic company too. With Ferran Corominas and Manuel Lanzarote in the team, Goa set the league on fire, and then there was Hugo Boumous, who was simply unstoppable. Bedia, though, believes this year’s squad is the best he has seen since moving from Real Zaragoza in the second-tier of Spanish football. “I feel we have perhaps one of the most balanced squads in the last couple of years. We have young players and some with lot of experience. We have got to know each other quite well and have advantage of playing a season together, not just the players, but the staff as well. I really believe we have one of the strongest squads in the last five years,” he said. Goa have been the most consistent team in ISL, qualifying for the playoffs for six of the seven seasons. The first team to qualify and play in the AFC Champions League, however, have never won the ISL trophy. Can the wait end this season? “We have to take this game by game,” said Bedia, who scored Goa’s first goal in the AFC Champions League. “We do have to believe a lot more in ourselves. I do believe we are one of the strongest teams in the ISL, and we have to carry that into our games and demonstrate that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-have-strongest-and-most-balanced-squad-in-five-years-edu-bedia/articleshow/87837245.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Allahabad||How Haryana bootleggers push high-end booze into Uttar Pradesh||PRAYAGRAJ: UP police remains bamboozled by the unbridled smuggling of Haryana-made liquor through inter-state borders and the innovative tactics adopted by bootleggers to dodge the law. Seizure of illegal liquor worth Rs 10lakh late Saturday from metal chambers hammered out in truck chasses has stunned police, who caught the consignment on the Prayagraj-Kaushambi border. Bootleggers also stash liquor bottles in mammoth fruit crates by tapping the wholesale fruit transport business and this escapes vigil as cops fail to open every crate at checkpoints. Talking to TOI, additional SP (Kaushambi) Samar Bahadur said, “Acting on a specific tip-off, cops intercepted a truck carrying oranges near Kokhraj highway and seized Haryana-made booze worth Rs 10 lakhs.” The driver and cleaner of the truck, however, wriggled out of the police net. The consignment was taken out from inside a metal chamber packed with oranges in the centre of the truck chassis. The dogged persistence of Haryana bootleggers despite daily seizures and raids is another cause of concern. Low prices of high-end brands and a differential tax structure has fuelled smuggling of liquor from Haryana to eastern UP districts and Bihar, said police. Despite round-the-clock patrolling, there has been no let-up in bootlegging, said police. A senior special task force official told TOI that illegal liquor worth more than Rs 5crore have been seized over past two years and the smuggling route remains Pratapgarh and adjoining districts of UP, where the liquor mafia has dug in heels. Several drums of rectified spirit were seized in the recent past. Senior cops, however, pointed out that distillation and smuggling of illicit arrack had reduced in eastern UP districts after police tightened the noose around liquor mafia in Pratapgarh and attached their properties. “We are constantly coordinating with police of other states and districts, exchanging information and keeping a vigil at borders, said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/haryana-bootleggers-pump-high-end-booze-with-lower-price-tag-in-secret-chambers-of-fruit-trucks/articleshow/87836604.cms||---

According to fire officials, the blaze started due to short-circuit and spread quickly across the manufacturing facility. No casualties were reported as six workers quickly ran out of the factory. Locals said that the fire was so huge that the thick smoke billowing out could be seen from several kilometers away. Initially, the fire brigade from Manjusar was pressed into action, but as the blaze got out of control, firemen from Vadodara city too were called in. Firemen said that besides dousing the fire, the priority was also to ensure that the neighbouring units do not catch fire. As a precautionary measure, gas cylinders of one of the neighbouring units involved in manufacturing industrial gases were moved away. Fire department sources said that the fire could be brought under control only by late evening. Four teams of firemen from the Emergency Response Centre at Darjipura, Chhani and Panigate fire stations were involved in fire-fighting operations besides the fire brigade from Manjusar GIDC. Another incident was reported from Bajwa Chhani Road where a saw mill caught fire in the wee hours of Saturday. Fire officials said that the saw mill, involved majorly in making wooden doors, was gutted in the fire that started around 3.30 am. The fire was brought under control in a couple of hours, however panic spread among the local residents as the saw mill is located in a residential area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/major-fire-breaks-out-at-plastic-sheet-unit-in-savli/articleshow/87823235.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Tryst with hardships motivated awardees||Lucknow: It was the time of Covid peak when vendors had to sell their stocks at throwaway prices and many lost jobs. A vegetable vendor and a spray painter, who saw their earnings plunge and struggled financially as the pandemic raged, were on cloud nine on Saturday, as their children have bagged Lucknow University’s prestigious Chancellor’s Bronze medal. LU declared names of the 15 students who will be conferred medals at its convocation ceremony on November 26. Mohd Aiyub Ahmad, son of a vegetable vendor, has bagged the bronze medal for being the best student in BSc final year while a spray painter’s daughter Iqra Rizwan Warsi of Karamat Husain Muslim Girls PG College bagged it for being the best student in BA final year. The families of both Aiyub and Iqra went through deep financial struggles during the pandemic. “My father Rasheed Ahmad is my biggest source of inspiration. Even after facing financial challenges during the two Covid waves, he made sure that I was never short of study material or internet pack. There was a time when no one was turning up at Chowk Mandi and he sold vegetables at throwaway prices,” said Aiyub. “The tough times we went through will continue to motivate me forever. I aim to pursue research in the field of electronics and make my parents proud one day,” he added. Sharing details of similar hardships, Iqra said, “My father Rizwan Warsi lost his work as a spray painter during the pandemic, but he didn’t give up. He started selling masks while my mother Tarannum began stitching masks and clothes to make sure the education of their four children continues. I aim to become an Urdu professor and will make my parents proud one day,” she said. Meanwhile, the two chancellors’ silver medals awarded in different categories were bagged by MSc student Labvi Shukla. “I want to work for financially weak students who are forced to drop out due to poverty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tryst-with-hardships-motivated-awardees/articleshow/87824354.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Both TDP and YSRC got equal number of votes and the vote of Nani will give edge to TDP. YSRC and TDP have taken Kondapalli municipality polls as a matter of prestige. Former minister Devineni Uma and Mylavaram MLA Vasanta Krishna Prasad had made all efforts to win maximum seats. Both the parties won 14 votes each out of 29 votes. One Independent candidate who won the polls joined TDP and the strength of TDP increased to 15. YSRC MLA Vasanta Krishna Prasad will vote as ex-officio member in favour of YSRC and then both the parties will have equal number of votes. At this point, Nani’s vote becomes crucial. He moved the high court seeking permission to enrol as ex-officio member. The municipal commissioner is yet to take a decision on this stating that he has not yet received the court orders. Vasanta Krishna Prasad expressed confidence in forming the council in the local body. TDP leader Devineni Uma told TOI that YSRC is trying to influence the officials and win polls through the back door.

---||Agra||No vaccine, no ration: Covid jab must for PDS beneficiaries in UP's Aligarh||AGRA: The Aligarh administration has made it mandatory for people to get vaccinated with at least one dose of the Covid-19 shot to receive subsidised ration under the Public Distribution System (PDS) scheme. The decision was taken on Friday after a man tested Covid positive in the city a day earlier. Authorities announced that families with even one unvaccinated person will be denied ration "until they get the dose administered". To help families access the ration, officials have, however, set up inoculation facilities at 196 such shops in urban areas. There are roughly 1,346 PDS centres in the region. “Shops will have an inoculation facility so that people don't have to go to hospitals. This step has been taken to motivate people to get vaccinated,” said Rajesh Soni, district supply officer. Posters have been put up outside PDS shops in Aligarh that say 'No vaccine, no ration for beneficiaries. Getting a vaccine certificate is mandatory to get subsidised wheat and rice'. Eligible beneficiaries of the PDS scheme who do not wish to get inoculated have been asked to provide a "satisfactory reply" explaining the reason for not doing so to the administration. Aligarh’s additional chief medical officer, Dr M K Mathur, said that the campaign response was "very good" and many turned up to get the jab. He said, “Over 52,000 people were vaccinated in the district today (Saturday), including those who were administered jabs at camps.” Authorities have not calculated the total number of people vaccinated at just the PDS shops yet. Mathur added that an on-spot registration facility is available and about 75 teams have been formed to assist in the campaign. Only Aadhar cards are needed for vaccination, he said. Nishad Mustaq, a beneficiary, said that ration was provided to him immediately after getting the jab. “I thought it would be a cumbersome process, but it wasn't,” he said, adding that the queue was getting longer as the day progressed. Notwithstanding the local administration’s claim of “success”, a senior UP official admitted, on condition of anonymity, that denying ration on these grounds will not be legally sustainable. “How can you deny food to people? There are better ways to motivate people than taking such steps,” he said, adding that “coercive” tactics will undermine the government's work. Incidentally, this is not the first time restrictions have been put on unvaccinated people in UP. Liquor sellers in UP’s Saifai put up posters outside their shops that said 'Alcohol will only be sold to those with Covid vaccination certificates'. Shop owners claimed that the area’s sub-divisional magistrate had instructed them to not sell liquor to those who hadn't received the jab. The Madhya Pradesh government this week also announced that subsidised ration would not be provided to those without proof of Covid vaccination. According to the order, beneficiaries will not get ration if they don't take both doses of the jab by the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-vax-no-ration-covid-jab-must-for-pds-beneficiaries-in-aligarh/articleshow/87823228.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi government working on policy for street vendors: AAP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday announced that the Delhi government would introduce a “highly progressive policy” for street vendors in the city to end all extortion and corruption. “The Delhi government is working on a highly progressive policy to address the situation and put a stop to this daily extortion by the municipal corporations and police,” claimed party MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj. “All street vendors are being identified through vending committees. Work is being done to estimate the number and types of vendors all over Delhi, and the stall charges,” he said. The government is looking for ideal locations so that vendors can continue their business without disrupting traffic or footpath movement, or encroaching upon anybody’s property, the MLA said. “This will benefit both vendors and customers.” Under the new policy, police will enable street vendors to conduct business without any disruption, Bharadwaj pointed out. AAP will ensure street vendors aren’t extorted, he said. The town vending committees will survey and identify street vendors by December 7 and all vendors can register themselves by then. As of September 30, 23,951 street vendors have been identified by South Delhi Municipal Corporation, 27,819 by the north corporation and 19,577 by the east corporation. The AAP functionary said the society needed street vendors, be it for fruits/vegetables, laundry and ironing services, and so on, while the vendors also relied on customers for their livelihood. If they aren’t placed in an ideal location, it causes problems in movement, he admitted, adding that there is an urgent need to find a balance. The deadline for the survey by the Delhi government’s town vending committees has been extended from September 30 to December 7 to include the vendors who had gone home due to Covid-19 and have returned now. “After surveying and registering all vendors, elections will be conducted among them and vending committees will be set up throughout Delhi. Following this, the procedure of allocating zones to street vendors will begin,” Bharadwaj said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed AAP’s concern for street vendors was politically motivated. “In the last five years, the AAP government extended no help in setting up street vendors committees. Now when civic elections are less than six months away, the party is floating schemes,” Kapoor said, adding that the corporations are already identifying street vendors and issuing them certificates. Delhi Police didn’t comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-working-on-policy-for-street-vendors-aap/articleshow/87823775.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Narendra Giri death: CBI fileschargesheet against 3 accused||Revised Prayagraj: Two months after the death of then Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief Mahant Narendra Giri, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday filed chargesheet against three people, including his disciple Anand Giri, on the charges of abetment to suicide of Narendra Giri. After taking cognizance of chargesheet, the CJM summoned the accused and fixed November 25 for the next hearing of the matter. The CBI stated that there is sufficient evidence against the trio of committing the offence of abetment to commit suicide and criminal conspiracy in connection with the alleged suicide of the Mahant, who was found hanging in his ashram in UP’s Prayagraj in September. Apart from Anand, Adya Prasad Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari were also named in the chargesheet. All three had been named in Narendra Giri's suicide note, who accused them of mentally harassing him, following which the police filed a FIR with charges of abetting suicide under Section 306 of IPC. In the chargesheet, three accused, including Anand Giri, had been charged under section 306 (abetment to commit suicide) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Harendra Nath, took cognizance of the chargesheet, saying that sufficient ground for taking cognizance are available. Besides, all the three accused, who appeared through video conferencing did not raise any objection. All the three accused are already in jail, as they were arrested within 24 hours and remanded to judicial custody after the Mahant’s death. After 48 hours the CBI took over the case from UP police on the recommendation of the UP government. During the investigation, the agency has recovered tapes of conversations between the accused and these have been sent for forensic examination. At one stage, it had also moved the court and obtained the permission to record voice samples from Anand Giri and the other accused, which they want to compare to the recovered tapes. The body of the then president of ABAP, Narendra Giri, was found hanging from the ceiling of a room in Shri Math Baghambari Gaddi under the limits of Georgetown police station in Prayagraj on September 20, 2021.  At present, they all are lodged in the Naini central jail here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/narendra-giri-death-cbi-fileschargesheet-against-3-accused/articleshow/87823781.cms||---

The party Mahanagar unit leadership aims to induct at least one lakh more members under the drive in the city till November 30. The membership drive was launched by the state party leadership on October 29. Party’s Mahanagar spokesperson, Rajesh Kesarwani told TOI, "As many as 29,749 new members have been inducted into the party’s fold between October 29 and November 15 including 10,235 from various morchas and 4005 from different cells (prakostha).

It will be a door-to-door membership drive, he added. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener (media) Ashish Gupta told TOI that the party has launched a special membership drive in the state with a target to add at least 1.5 crore, new members, to its existing 2.5 crore party workers. He added that a special membership drive was planned for the state to develop a new chunk of voters for the party, particularly youngsters from all sections of society. He, however, said that people of all age groups are eager to join the BJP and the number of new members is increasing with every passing day. To induct new members into the party’s fold across the district, special camps were being organised including for people from the slums. Not just men, but a large number of women have also taken the membership of the party, said Gupta.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan gets 12 new ministers, 3 dropped||JAIPUR: Putting an end to the suspension over cabinet rejig, chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s office on Saturday declared the names of new faces to be inducted as well those who will be promoted in the fresh council of ministers that would be sworn in on Sunday. Before that, Gehlot handed over resignations of ministers Raghu Sharma, Harish Chaudhary and Govind Singh Dotasra to governor Kalraj Mishra, who accepted the same with immediate effect. Against the vacancy of 12 that existed, six new faces would be sworn in as cabinet ministers while four would be inducted as junior ministers. Two ministers have been reinducted as cabinet ministers; they are Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena. The duo was sacked along with Sachin Pilot (as deputy chief minister) when they rebelled against the leadership of Gehlot in July 2020. The six new cabinet ministers are Hemaram Chaudhary, Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya, Ramlal Jat, Mahesh Joshi, Govindram Meghwal and Shakuntla Rawat, while the three junior ministers who will be elevated to cabinet ranks are Mamta Bhupesh Bairwa, Bhajanlal Jatav and Tikaram Juli. Joshi, is currently chief whip of the ruling party in the state assembly. The four new junior ministers would be Zahida Khan, Rajendra Gudha, Brijendra Singh Ola and Murarilal Meena. Gudha is a BSP-turned-Congress MLA. Among the 12 fresh inductions, five are from Pilot camp and seven are from Gehlot camp. Hemaram, Brijendra and Murarilal are new faces from the Pilot camp, while Vishvendra and Ramesh of the same camp have been reinducted. The fresh inductions have two women candidates—Zahida and Shakuntla, both from the Gehlot camp. Mamta, who has been elevated, too belongs to the Gehlot camp. It was expected that women and minorities will be given adequate representation in the new ministry after party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi announced 50% tickets to women in UP in the upcoming assembly polls. Of the three women members in the expanded cabinet, Zahida belongs to the minority community, Mamta belongs to the Dalit community and Shakuntla, who is a Gujjar, belongs to the state’s most backward classes (MBC). All three junior ministers who have been elevated to cabinet ranks belong to the Dalit community. In the evening, all ministers had tendered their resignations to Gehlot at a meeting of the council of ministers held at the chief minister’s residence here. AICC general secretary in-charge of the state Ajay Maken was present at the meeting. Late night, Gehlot met governor Kalraj Mishra, who reached Jaipur from his home state of Uttar Pradesh in the evening, and handed him over the resignations of just the three ministers, Harish Chaudhary, Raghu Sharma and Govind Singh Dotasra. The three resignations were accepted with immediate effect, according to a Raj Bhawan press statement. Sachin Pilot, who was in Delhi, too reached Jaipur in the afternoon. After the council of ministers’ meeting, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas informed the media that all the ministers submitted their resignations to the chief minister on a proposal moved by party state chief Dotasra leaving the decision to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Khachariyawas said a meeting of the Congress legislature party (CLP) has been convened at the party headquarters at 2pm on Sunday. With the resignations of ministers Raghu Sharma and Harish Chaudhary as well as junior minister Dotasra, the number of vacancy in the council of ministers has increased to 12, if the remaining ministers are retained. All three resigned on Friday. A day earlier, Maken told the media here that some ministers expressed the desire to work in the party organisation rather than in the government. Health minister Sharma was recently made AICC in-charge of Gujarat and revenue minister Chaudhary was appointed AICC in-charge of Punjab, school education minister Dotasra was made the PCC president last year. They would, thus, be dropped as ministers following the party’s principle of ‘'one man, one post'. Preparations were in full swing at the secretariat to refurbish rooms and vehicles for new ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-gets-12-new-mins-3-dropped/articleshow/87824381.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Worli fishermen buoy up stir against coastal road bridge||MUMBAI: The post-monsoon months are the best time of year to catch fish off the west coast. But Worli’s fisherfolk have kept their boats moored this month to protest what they see as a threat to their livelihood: the design of the coastal road. On Friday, some took a boat out to drop buoys in the sea to mark where concrete pillars will soon rise as the new road joins the Worli interchange of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. These pillars will be 60 metres apart, which fishermen say will make it more difficult for them to sail out to sea. Boats have stayed ashore at Cleveland Bunder to protest the road alignmentThe exit from Cleveland Bunder is already tricky: rocks on the shoreline, invisible at high tide, require a roundabout navigation. Then come the pillars of the Sea Link. With the coastal road, they will have to navigate a second set of pillars. “Boats are not cars that you can brake and turn sharply,” said fisherman Johnson Malvankar. Fishermen anchor a buoy to mark the location of the coastal road pillarsThere are other concerns. Reclamation on the shoreline has damaged fish breeding ground and the drilling noise is driving away fish, he says, including of once-plentiful lobsters. The BMC has announced a one-time compensation for any losses during construction, appointed the Tata Institute of Social Sciences to draft a compensation policy. BMC officials have also said the 60-metre span more than meets the requirements of the National Institute of Oceanography and the Inland Waterways Authority of India, and that they got clearance from the fisheries department. Fishermen want the pillars to be redesigned to be 200 metres apart, and say they were not properly consulted earlier. On Friday afternoon, fishing boats sailed to stall work on the bridge.“Compensation for current losses is fine but our concern is for the future,” said Nitesh Patil of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavsay Sahakari Society. A working group has been set up to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, the standoff at sea continues.—Vaishnavi C||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-worli-fishermen-buoy-up-stir-against-coastal-road-bridge/articleshow/87824803.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Train runs over 2 school boys busy playing PUBG in Mathura||AGRA: Two young boys engrossed in playing PUBG, a popular online game, during their morning walk were crushed to death by a goods train on the single Mathura-Kasganj track in Laxmi Nagar, Mathura, on Saturday. While one of the mobile phones was damaged in the accident, the other had PUBG still running when it was recovered, said Shashi Prakash Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Jamunapar police station. “We don’t know exactly which train was passing when the accident took place,” the SHO said, adding that the bodies have been sent for post-mortem. The dead boys were identified as Gaurav Kumar, 14, a student of class X of Guru Nanak Dev Public School, and his neighbour Kapil Kumar, 14, a class X student of BGB Braj Education Academy Senior Secondary School. Both were said to be bright students. No eyewitnesses were available in this case, said police. A few passers-by informed them about the bodies lying on the railway track around 7am. Still coming to terms with the tragedy, Gaurav’s father Rahul Kumar, who runs a dairy business, said his son had decided to go for a walk in the morning and asked to be woken up early. “Today was the first day of his morning walk and I wanted him to make it a routine... but now he is gone,” he said, adding that he had left home around 5:15am and had taken his (father’s) mobile phone for use. Kapil, who lives just 100 metres away from Gaurav’s house, was asleep when the latter convinced him for the walk. “We have no idea about this online game. Had I been aware of it, I would have never given him a mobile phone,” said Kapil’s father Sanjay Kumar, who runs a mattress business. Harvansh Singh, manager of Guru Nanak Dev Public School, where Gaurav was studying, said that he was a good student and never found him indulging in mischief. "He was a simple boy," Singh added. Echoing similar views about Kapil, principal of his school, Sameer Malhotra, said that he had never received any complaint against the student. PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, popularly called PUBG, is an online multiplayer game. Experts claim that the game is highly addictive and may give rise to violent behaviour in those playing it.

Named as ‘Roohani’, the soul of the varsity, the first-ever girl’s band has been formed to spread awareness about gender equality, do gender sensitization and motivate girl students of the campus to showcase their talent in a musical way. Also, the band symbolizes women’s empowerment that puts end to a patriarchal mindset that advocates that only males can be excellent guitarists, drummers or play musical instruments. The best thing about the group is that it has students from all streams and classes, Akansha Singh (guitarist), Kritika Kumar (tabla player), Simanti Prakash (harmonium player) and Shruti Tiwari (lead singer) are of BSc, Sneha Choutala of BCom, Ishita Khanna (guitarist), Anshika Shukla (drummer), Ishika (Mandolin) and Sristy Verma are of BA and postgraduate students, Prajakta Sharma of MCom and Sneha Pandey of MCom and MA respectively. “Roohani is the best example of gender equality as boys from LU rock band ‘Rubaroo’ are our biggest supporters. Both the bands help each other perform better and are flag bearers of spreading awareness that boys and girls are equal and when both support each other new heights are attained,” said band member Prajakta. She said the idea of all girls band was given by LU’s GenSen committee-gender sensitization committee that brought all-girl performers together. “Lalbaradari has turned out to be a musical station of the varsity where students more often request for songs. The best thing about Rooh is all 10 singers are an expert in different music genres, be it classical, jazz, pop, rock or others. Also as the band performs in open at various spots on LU campus has given a message to be confident and perform in mid of crowd,” said band member Sneha Choutala. “There was a need for all girls band as there are a number of girl students who have talent but are a bit reluctant to perform at the stage. This band will motivate new talents from the university and at the same time it will be holding various musical performances on various social issues from time to time,” said Anshika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lus-all-girls-band-to-debut-on-foundation-day/articleshow/87824375.cms||---

Already present there was Titu's relative, Pravesh Kumar. Both men overpowered her and plunged a kirpan (curved sword) into her, killing her instantly. The horrific murder took place in the jungles of Dhekla village under Adampur police station on November 15. After killing Sumitra, Titu and Pravesh then proceeded to decapitate the woman and threw her severed head 50 yards away and her arms (one of which had Titu’s name tattooed) at a distance in order to hide the identity of the corpse. Ironically, it was the recovery of the decapitated tattooed arm that eventually led police to the killers. Four names – Sumitra, Kamal, Rahul and Titu -- were tattooed in Devanagari script on the arm (Kamal and Rahul are Sumitra and Titu’s children). According to police, they tried to identify the deceased woman using social media platforms and other means on the basis of the names tattooed on her hand. Eventually, their search led them to Titu Singh. On being interrogated, he confessed to his crime and was arrested along with Pravesh on Friday evening. Amroha SP Poonam (who uses her first name only), told TOI, "Titu, who is a truck driver, suspected that Sumitra was having an extramarital affair with their neighbour in the village. Consequently, he hatched a conspiracy with his relative and murdered her." She added that a case has been registered under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/headless-armless-body-of-woman-found-tattoo-on-decapitated-arm-leads-police-to-the-murderer-her-husband/articleshow/87823249.cms||Harveer Dabas

Under PMAY, homeless, poor families etc., are eligible to apply. The benefit of the scheme is available to those people whose monthly income is less than Rs 10,000. A monetary help of Rs 1.20 lakhs is given to such people under the scheme." The scheme was launched in the year 2016-17 and so far, 1,14,189 people have been given houses under this scheme in the district and a budget of over Rs 1,370 crore has been given allotted for the scheme, he added. The Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana was started in the year 2018-19. Although under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, homeless of general category can also apply, the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana demands several conditions to be fulfilled . Under the MMAY scheme, families are given benefits whose houses have collapsed due to any natural disaster. People of Vantangia, Musahar, Kol, Sahariya and Tharu caste are also given benefits from this scheme. So far, 8569 people have been given houses under the scheme since 2016-17. Each beneficiary is given Rs 1.20 lakhs for constructing the house. An amount of over Rs 102 crore have been spent under this scheme. As per the year-wise data available, 253 houses were built under the scheme 2018-19, 1381 in 2019-20, 2451 in 2020-21 and 4484 in 2021-22. About the application procedure, the official informed that people who have land but do not have houses can apply under the scheme. It is verified by the District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) following which the registration takes place at the block headquarters and after that the priority list is prepared. After the priority list, its details are sent to the government, after which the budget is released, said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-1l-people-get-homes-in-dist-under-pmay-mmay/articleshow/87823782.cms||---

The Union cabinet has decided to provide not only mobile services but also internet facility at the interior pockets of the tribal areas. To date, the government authorities have not dared to set up mobile towers in these areas fearing they may be set afire by Naxals, which has become a routine incident in the Andhra Odisha Border areas and Maoists stronghold mandals. Earlier, the Visakha rural cops proposed around 150 mobile towers in the tribal mandals, with most of them being in GK Veedhi, Chintapalli, Pedabayalu, Munchingput, G Madugula, Hukumpeta, Dumbriguda, and Koyyuru. New roads were paved in most of the interior areas in Munchingput, Pedabayalu, Koyyuru, GK Veedhi, and G Madugula mandals and new works are in the pipeline. The cops are now focussing on bringing the extremists into the mobile loop in bid to curb the menace. “Visakhapatnam tribal belt with hilly areas, streams, and Maoist threats, forces the district administration to think twice before taking up any activity. We had plans to set up mobile towers but many factors delayed the proposals,” a senior telecom officer said. As per Central government proposal, 1,218 tribal villages will get 4G services including 1,054 in Visakhapatnam, 154 in Vizianagaram, and 10 in Kadapa districts. The Visakha agency area has a population of 6.60 lakh spread in 3,900 villages and 11 mandals. Of which, more than 1,500 villages have neither road nor communication networks.More than 260 village secretariats were set up in the tribal areas but around 160 of them do not have internet facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/250-towers-to-equip-1218-tribal-villages-with-4g/articleshow/87823245.cms||Siva G
---||Lucknow||Striking results with unconventional method: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: The achievement somehow seems to dwarf the critique.” This is how Tom Plate, an American journalist who interviewed Lee Kuan Yew in 2009, assessed Lee who transformed Singapore from being a pirate haven to a city-state with an efficient bureaucracy, an almost corruption-free government, clean air, safe streets, excellent schools, affordable healthcare, and the third highest per capita income in the world. Yogi Adityanath’s achievements in UP during his tenure as the chief minister would also probably deserve a similar assessment. His methods may have been unconventional, but the results have been striking. Not that UP has achieved Singapore’s prosperity, but it has definitely turned a new leaf and is witnessing development on a scale and at a speed it had never seen before. Areas which had been neglected by successive governments — eastern UP and Bundelkhand — are pulsating with economic activities. For his performance, Yogi Adityanath was rated as the best CM for the fourth consecutive time in a poll conducted in 2021. Yogi’s achievements on the law and order front have been most remarkable. At no time in the history of UP did the mafia feel so much heat and pressure of the government as it is painfully experiencing during the present regime. Yogi has gone hammer and tongs against the criminal elements, so much that some of them have been seen begging for mercy. It is estimated that since 2017, a total of 155 criminals were killed in 8,935 encounters with the police while 3,542 suffered injuries. (It works out to one killed every 57 encounters). 13 policemen also lost their lives in these engagements, while 1,212 policemen sustained injuries. The police have been criticized for false encounters, though an American’s comment was that UP policemen must be very poor shooters. Besides, a total of 13,801 cases were registered under the Gangsters Act, in which 43,294 accused were arrested. Their property worth Rs 1,848 crore was seized or destroyed. This has given a sense of security to the common man. UP was governed by either the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party from 2002-2017. During these 15 years, criminals belonging to or supported by the ruling party had a field day. The administrative apparatus became almost dysfunctional. Police carried out the diktat of the party in power, right or wrong, legal or unlawful. One chief minister gave the atrocious order that crime should be reduced by 70%. The result was complainants were shooed away from the police stations. Surprisingly, the human rights lobbies never protested. This was the legacy which Yogi Adityanath inherited. It was quite a tough task bringing the administration back on rails in a state with the population of 23 crore dispersed over 75 districts. Yogi, however, rose to the occasion. He had no administrative experience, and yet within a short period he earned his spurs. A significant breakthrough by Yogi Adityanath was the introduction of a police commissionerate system in UP. It may be recalled that as far back as 1978, the then UP CM had announced that there would be a commissionerate system of policing in Kanpur. Vasudev Panjani was chosen to be the first Commissioner of Police, Kanpur. He, along with the then Home Secretary, KK Bakshi, was sent to Mumbai, Pune, and Chennai to study the system. However, by the time they came back, bureaucracy had shot down the proposal. It remained buried for more than 40 years until Yogi Adityanath resurrected it and Commissioners of Police were appointed in Lucknow and Noida in January 2020. Subsequently, the system was extended to Kanpur and Varanasi in March 2021. Progressive steps have been taken in other areas also to improve policing in the state. Mission Shakti was launched in October 2020 to help women, particularly from the rural areas. Awareness programmes were conducted in villages. Substantial grants were released for the construction of residential and office buildings for police stations. Forensic laboratories have been established in every Range. Cybercrime police stations have been set up at all Range headquarters. The organization of Prayagraj Kumbh in 2019 was a phenomenal success. There is however a flip side also. The state has been a laggard in implementing the Supreme Court’s directions on police reforms. It has not constituted Police Complaints Authorities, as mandated by the Apex Court. Corruption at the cutting edge level continues as before. The grievance redressal system is not effective. Response to a serious situation is at times delayed and indifferent. No wonder, the state government was in eye of the storm in Hathras, Unnao, and Kheri. The stringent NSA and the UAPA could have been used sparingly. However, the fact remains that Yogi Adityanath is dedicated to improving the lot of the common man in UP. In the process, he has given adequate autonomy to the bureaucracy and the police. The tragedy perhaps the most incorruptible CM in the country today, and he is totally, is that some officers holding important positions let him down from time to time. Plato said, “States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become rulers.” In Yogi Adityanath, we have some semblance of a philosopher-ruler.

The accused’s counsel had submitted that he surrendered before the police on November 11 around 6:48 pm, but the police showed his arrest around 12am on the intervening night of November 8-9. Advocate Sanjay Sharma, appearing for the accused, alleged that police officers had mercilessly beaten the accused during this interim period. He sought that the CCTV footage of the cameras installed at the police station be preserved. Metropolitan Magistrate Kapil Kumar said that a perusal of the reply filed by the investigating officer (IO) on November 15 prima facie revealed that he stated that it cannot be preserved due to the non-availability of resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/custody-case-police-to-save-cctv-footage/articleshow/87823783.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Counterpunch: Gadchiroli tribals, families of violence-hit sowed C-60 seeds||Gadchiroli’s counter-insurgency specialist C-60 force wrote another chapter in its success story against Naxalites on November 13. A week after it gunned down 27 Maoists post a 10-hour battle, TOI profiles the unit’s commandos and unravels its originThe genesis of the C-60 commando unit of Gadchiroli police, that has pushed Andhra Pradesh’s Greyhounds unit to second slot when in comes to achievements against Maoists, lies in the minds of the Gadchiroli populace. This includes the villagers, journalists, constabulary and local tribals, including the families of the ones killed in Maoist violence. In April 2018, Gadchiroli commandos had set the national benchmark by neutralizing 40 Maoists. The C-60 commandos neutralized 27 Maoists during the Mardintola encounter of November 13, which is now the second-most successful operation against the Reds in India. According to former state top cop KP Raghuvanshi who had served as Gadchiroli police superintendent (SP) from 1990 to 1992, the district’s citizens had suggested creating a force which would fight Maoists tooth and nail at the ground level. “When every other option failed, I turned back to the people of Gadchiroli for a solution. They told me a force is required which would go on foot and take on the Maoists in the forests, and not roam around in vehicles on the roads and return without any action,” he said. Then, towards the end of 1980s, added Raghuvanshi, the government sanctioned a Rs100 crore-worth ‘special action plan’ for tribals and the development of the backward district, but the measure did not bear fruit. Raghuvanshi, credited to form the C-60 commando unit which was earlier called ‘Crack 60’, said some local constables volunteered to take up weapons and venture into the forest immediately to take Maoists by the horns. “It was a complex, risky situation. After speaking to the then director general of police (DGP), we decided to go ahead. The interested constables underwent training and an officer was placed as administrative in-charge for them,” the ex-top cop said. Raghuvanshi also went on to create Maharashtra’s anti-terrorist squad (ATS) subsequently, and the rest is history. The first hand-picked lot of 100 commandos was ironically sent to the Greyhounds in Andhra Pradesh for training. “I went to oversee the training of our constables and later picked two teams of 30 each, with an officer at the helm. One squad of 30 was sent to Aheri and another retained at Gadchiroli. Thus, our first squad of C-60 commandos was formed," said Raghuvanshi, who later worked in the district as additional DGP (law and order). The C-60 commandos were specially tasked to pick inputs, collect information and strike at armed insurgents. “Earlier, officers from outside would not venture out in the night even when there was a specific input. This problem was solved as the new team was ready to strike anytime and anywhere,” Raghuvanshi said. The subsequent SPs retained the C-60 commando unit and nurtured it into its final form even when there was no government sanction, posting or budgetary allocations, said Raghuvanshi. He acknowledged former Gadchiroli SP Rahul Gopal among others for taking up the issues of C-60 commandos with the government, to make special incentives and emoluments available to them. “The squad was formed somewhere around December 1990. The first major success came after my departure in the form of senior Maoist cadre Santosh Anna,” the former Gadchiroli SP said. Though former state DGP Anami Roy steered clear of the controversy surrounding the incumbent DGP Sanjay Pandey not visiting Gadchiroli after the Mardintola encounter, he said leadership plays a key role in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli. Roy said it’s imperative for leaders of the force to get thoroughly acquainted with the terrain and topography of the area, its multiple operational dimensions, logistics and human aspects — not only to appreciate an accomplishment but also to guide the field force in future operations. The former state DGP said it is necessary to understand that the recruits who join Gadchiroli police defy the Maoist threat. “Later, they voluntarily join the C-60 commando unit and fight a battle which the state and the police force wants them to fight in the larger interest of public safety, risking their lives and social security of their families,” he said. Roy was probably the only state top cop to visit Maoist-affected Gadchiroli first thing after taking charge and also a day before his retirement. During his first visit, Roy took along a number of officers who had the experience of working in Gadchiroli in different capacities earlier, to gain insights from their experiences and assimilate their suggestions for developing operational plans. Roy wished the best of luck to the bravehearts of Gadchiroli police, especially the C-60 commandos — many of whom he shared a bond with. In his maiden visit to Gadchiroli, Roy, who spent four days on the ground zero to get acclimatized with the terrain and the problems, is said to have got camouflage uniforms and jungle boots like the C60 commandos for all visiting senior officers moving around with them on foot in the jungle. Roy travelled from Gadchiroli to Aheri and from there to the last post of Maharashtra at Laheri before moving towards the sensitive Bhamragarh. The ex-DGP and his team went through the forests and visited all such places which could be of any significance from an operational and strategic point of view. The former top cop even skipped a crucial meeting of the Election Commission once to visit the families of the martyrs after an operation. “I always felt it was necessary to visit the families of each and every martyr. We also spent time with lucky survivors in a forest fight in which all the odds are pitted against the police, as Maoist guerrillas have their vantage position,” said Roy, who later switched to non-profit work and extended help to several job aspirants from the tribal district. Roy said the chief must motivate the commandos regularly and convince them that he will always stand by them if anything untoward ever happens to anyone. “I, as the head of the family (of the force) will take care of them and their kin. They will not be abandoned afterwards,” he said, adding that all this motivation needs to be done in flesh and blood and not just through written communication like WhatsApp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/counterpunch-gadchiroli-tribals-families-of-violence-hit-sowed-c-60-seeds/articleshow/87823807.cms||Soumitra Bose

In MMR, by comparison, Thane maintained last year’s 14th rank while Navi Mumbai slipped a rank to fourth from third in 2020. They were ranked among 48-odd cities with a population of more than 10 lakh. Navi Mumbai, though, has bagged the “cleanest big city” award in the country by achieving the first rank in the category of 10 to 40 lakh population. It has also become the second best performing city in India, for which its civic corporation, NMMC, got a Rs 6 crore reward. Maharashtra ranked second in the category of states with more than 100 urban local bodies while retaining its second rank last year among the best performing states. Swachh Survekshan 2021, under Swachh Bharat Mission, is conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs every year. A total of 10 cities in the state have featured in the list apart from Navi Mumbai, Thane and Mumbai. Pune, for instance, has ranked 5th, Aurangabad 22, Nagpur 23, Kalyan-Dombivli 25, Vasai-Virar 29, Nashik 17, Pimpri-Chinchwad 19. The state, in an official statement, said it was proud to have bagged 40% of the awards. While Pune has ranked 5th among cities with 10 lakh-plus population, it is 8th among those with 1 lakh-plus people. Mumbai had ranked 10th in 2016 Swachh ranking. Thane civic officials said their stable ranking was due to an increase in public toilets as well as good public feedback and solid waste maintenance. Several residents, though, disagreed. Sushila K, a Ghodbunder Road resident, said, “The city has atypical demography and it is difficult to judge it as the most clean or not, as area-wise it changes. For instance, most slum pockets are unclean while upscale areas are being maintained by the societies.”  Sangeeta Hasnale, deputy municipal commissioner, BMC, in charge of solid waste, said the award for the best mega city in innovation and best practices was for the various projects the civic body has undertaken, such as converting waste into cooking gas and also encouraging compost pits in housing societies for treating garbage. On the dip in the overall ranking, Hasnale said, “Much of our focus was on fighting the virus and therefore we were unable to represent the city up to the mark.” NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar, on the overall fourth rank, said, “The competition was very tough this time and despite that we bagged the top rank in the 10-40 lakh population category. As far as overall cleanliness award is concerned...we left no stone unturned to get into the overall top three cities but narrowly missed out. ” Mumbai scored 2,021 out of 6,000 marks.

The victim was shifted to Jaipur where she is currently undergoing treatment even as the main accused remains at large. An FIR was registered through a court complaint at Nauganwa police station on November 10. The woman’s mother said that her daughter’s wedding was scheduled for November 27. Another relative claimed that the woman was admitted to a local hospital in Alwar, but doctors referred her to Jaipur for specialised treatment under an ophthalmologist due to the looming risk of vision loss. “Doctor told us that a major surgery is required otherwise she could lose her vision,” the relative said, alleging that the accused also shot the videos of the sexual assault which he later shared with others. The assault took place shortly before Friday midnight when the victim was asleep. The accused and his aides attacked her with a knife, causing multiple injuries to her neck and eye. SP Tejswani Gautam said that a second FIR has been registered in the case against the accused for the grievous assault on the woman. Police claimed that the woman was allegedly raped last year and an FIR for the same was filed at the police station through a court complaint on November 10. The accused was idenitfied as one Hari Om Soni, a native of a nearby town in Haryana. He had reportedly met the woman some time last year on a bus while she was returning home with her mother. The woman’s mother also alleged that the accused had threatened to cause harm to her son. Alwar police said on Saturday that the doctors are keeping a close watch over the woman.

After massive protests, the Centre’s announcement to repeal three farm laws has been welcomed as ‘better late than never’, but BJP’s intentions are being doubted with some suggesting this was done with elections in mind, said Mayawati on Saturday. “Now, it’s necessary to take concrete steps,” she added. The former UP chief minister said to determine the minimum support price, a new law should be brought in and barring cases related to country’s honour, all other cases against protesting farmers should be withdrawn. The BSP chief also reiterated it was necessary to avoid a situation where the country would have to suffer the consequences of a government’s arrogance and dictatorship. “The country had to suffer this during Indira Gandhi’s regime and we can only hope we do not have to witness such times again,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/table-msp-law-says-maya-recalls-indiras-arrogance/articleshow/87824418.cms||---

Casting doubt on the PM’s intentions, Chaudhary said, “The way Modi Ji said that he couldn’t make farmers understand the laws, which is alarming. Besides, a Bihar government minister also stated that the farming laws would be imposed again, Modi Ji would bring the laws back. I’m not saying this, BJP leaders are saying.” The RLD chief, however, congratulated the farmers over the “historic win”, saying: “This has proved one thing that every citizen has become an andolanjeevi.” Interacting with mediapersons on the sidelines of the event, Chaudhary reminded the government of the sacrifices made by the farmers during the agitation and touched upon the Kheri violence deaths as well. “As many as 700 farmers died during the agitation, their families need respect. The minister whose son is responsible for the Lakhimpur Kheri incident is still holding his post. This needs to be answered.” Attacking UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the RLD chief said that he didn’t know how to formulate and implement policies. “How such a person can be made CM? In 2017, the state had a debt of Rs 4 lakh crore, which now increased to Rs 6 lakh crore. The situation is such that the government is unable to pay even salaries to its employees, but Yogi continues with his propaganda 24X7.” Jayant, meanwhile, promised one crore government jobs to the people of the state. “If we are voted to power, one crore government job will be given to the youths. If we fail to do so, I will step down from my position,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/if-bjp-wins-poll-it-will-bring-back-farm-laws-jayant-warns-farmers/articleshow/87823258.cms||Mohd Dilshad

In the letter, which he shared on social media, Varun requested the PM to accept the farmers' demand of making the minimum support price (MSP) a legal right and sought action against Union minister of state Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri case. Varun also asked the government to quash several "politically motivated" FIRs against farmers and demanded Rs 1 crore in compensation for the kin of over "700 farmers who died during the movement." He added that the farmers' protests would not stop until these demands are met. The MP has been a known critic of farm laws. He had earlier written to the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, asking him to take appropriate steps to help improve the condition of farmers. Varun said, “More than 700 of our farmer brothers and sisters have been martyred in this movement as they peacefully protested in extremely difficult and hostile conditions. It is my humble request to you that while expressing condolences...a compensation of Rs 1 crore each must be announced for them.” The MP stressed on the need to "legally bind" the assurance on MSP so that small farmers are ensured adequate remuneration for their crops. He said failure to meet the demand would result in "widespread anger". He called the October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, which resulted in the death of eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, a "blemish on democracy" and the result of senior leaders "giving provocative statements against agitating farmers". Varun demanded strict action and an inquiry against MoS Mishra, whose son, Ashish, is the key accused in the case. Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor, shared Varun's post, adding, “Good to see Varun Gandhi emulating his grandfather in challenging the PM of his own party."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/varun-writes-to-pm-asks-for-nod-to-farmers-msp-demand-action-against-kheri-accused/articleshow/87823257.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Gandhi wrote the letter in context of a function organised in Lucknow which the PM was to address, a day after he announced withdrawal of three controversial farm laws on Friday, which Opposition parties have hailed as a victory for farmers. “Why is it that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra remains silent on the brutal killing of tribal farmers in broad daylight in Bastar, Chhattisgarh? Will she enlighten us about how many Congress leaders went to the site where the unarmed farmers were killed,” he asked. He added that she also needed to explain why there was a lathi charge on the farmers in Rajasthan. Asking how a “Corporate Congress” was suddenly worried about farmers, Singh said that for Priyanka, her husband Robert Vadra must be the most hard working farmer “who does the tedious task of cheating farmers by buying their land for pennies and making crores out of it”. “For Congress, the slogan of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ was merely a slogan used to emotionally fool the public. The PM’s decision to repeal the farm laws reveals his immense respect for the farmers. Only someone possessing a will to serve people selflessly could have done it. Those with vested interests will only know how to find something negative in everything,” he said. He also advised Gandhi to focus on the wellbeing of farmers in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Punjab because as far as the Lakhimpur incident was concerned, the government was doing everything possible in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pgv-mum-on-killing-of-farmers-in-bastar/articleshow/87824430.cms||---

It was ranked 10th in the last edition of the survey. Vadodara had been doing well in the rankings till 2017. It was ranked thirteenth in 2016 and 10th in 2017. However, the city’s rank started deteriorating after this. In the 2018 rankings, it was ranked 44 and slipped further in 2019 when it was ranked 79. The trend was, however, reversed in 2020 when the city improved its ranking significantly and finished on the 10th spot. Officials said that the ranking in 2018 and 2019 were affected due to technical reasons and issues with documentation. Amongst the four largest cities in the state, Vadodara is the only one that has improved its ranking. Surat and Rajkot remained on the second and 11th ranks while Ahmedabad slipped to the 10th rank from the 7th spot. Mayor Keyur Rokadiya said that besides the improvement in ranking, the city has been given a three-star rating for efforts towards a garbage-free city. He added that a series of initiatives had been taken in this direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-climbs-up-to-8th-spot/articleshow/87823265.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata street food hygiene still a concern, water biggest problem||KOLKATA: Providing food vendors the minimum basic infrastructure to conduct the trade hygienically and bringing them under the ambit of a food safety certification can not only lead to a quantum change in Kolkata’s street food safety standards but also positively impact the health of a few lakh people who have street food at least five times a week. This is the inference drawn from a field study on Kolkata’s street food carried out a year ago by researchers from three universities — Binghamton, Monash and Bocconi. Altogether, 681 food vendors from Ultadanga, Dalhousie, Eden Gardens, Indian Museum, Beliaghata, Victoria Memorial, Park Circus, Rashbehari, Ballygunge and Behala, who had earlier attended training and follow-up sessions, in health and hygiene were included in the study. The study revealed that despite being aware of the need for improving hygiene while conducting business and being trained on how to do so, very few practised what they had learnt. While this discovery was not new for it had already frustrated many non-govern-ment organisations that had conducted workshops over the years to change the behaviour of street food vendors only to see them never translating into practice, the study by researchers Sulagna Mookerjee, Denni Tommasi and Gianmarco Daniele revealed the reason behind their peculiar behaviour. First, lack of basic infrastructure like clean water, proper food waste disposal and electricity in the places they conduct business hampers their ability to translate the learnings into action. Second, many vendors do not perceive any incentive to produce safer foods because the improved quality would be difficult to observe in practice, and hence they would not be rewarded by consumers. Third, consumers in this sector may not have a sufficiently high demand for hygienic food. A study of 1,480 consumers between June and August 2019 revealed that while they value food safety and are willing to pay more for it, most are unable to distinguish contaminated food from one that is safe. Also, many have other considerations like variety on offer by a vendor. “The findings implied that training is not sufficient to foster substantial changes in food safety, suggesting that information alone to vendors is not the key constraint in this sector. What is required is a more active role by local authorities, both in terms of providing easier access to infrastructure as well as imposing regulations to mandate safer practices. Bringing the vendors under some sort of food safety certification like Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) can lead to a faster adoption of hygienic practices as customers can then distinguish who is certified,” said Sudipta Moitra, the project coordinator of Gana Unnayan Parshad (GUP), the NGO that was the local implementing partner in the study. While GUP, in partnership with NDITA and FSSAI, has conducted training and certification for 68 vendors in Salt Lake Sector V, it is set to take up another project funded by UN’s Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO) that will try to plug the infrastructure gaps by providing clean water and FSSAI certification to another target group next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-street-food-hygiene-still-a-concern-water-biggest-problem/articleshow/87823256.cms||Subhro Niyogi

According to senior university officials, admission data is being collated as of now to ascertain the number of vacant seats available. Rajeev Gupta, DU’s Dean of Students’ Welfare said, “Currently, the admission data is being collected and studied. Another special drive will be conducted for admissions only if there are a large number of vacant seats available for particular courses. In case there are a few seats available, then the special drive will not be conducted.” Gupta added that in case there is another special drive for admissions, then it will commence from November 23. This year, the university released five cut off lists and one special cut off list apart from conducting a special drive for admissions to the various merit based undergraduate courses in DU. Over 74,000 admissions had already taken place at the university after the fifth cut off list. However, the varsity has not yet provided data on the number of admissions which have taken place under the special drive which was conducted. Aspirants had time till November 19 to make the payment and secure seats in the respective colleges.

The party asked its cadres to focus on Chapter 2 of the SP’s constitution which deals with ‘aims and objectives’ of the party and talks of opposing any idea of state based on religious belief. It also lays emphasis on preferential status to women, schedule caste, minorities and backwards. The SP circular comes a day after the Allahabad High Court stated that the Uniform Civil Code was a necessity and called upon the Central government to forthwith initiate the process for its implementation. The HC observations came while hearing a bunch of 17 petitions filed by interfaith couples, who contracted marriage upon conversion, seeking protection of their life, liberty and privacy guaranteed under Article 21. Section (1) - Chapter 2 of the party's constitution says that the party will have complete faith and dedication in the Indian Constitutions and its very basis comprising a democratic, secular and socialist framework. The party will believe and always support an administrative set up which has decentralisation of financial and political governance as an essential part of it. Sub section (2) talks about parties' resolve to oppose the idea of a state based on religion and bars any individual or organisation supporting or propagating the idea of a state based on religion in any shape of form, from being a member of the party. Sub section (3) talks of preferential treatment to women, Dalits, minorities and backwards and the last and final section of the chapter deals in detail with SP workers showing complete faith in all aspects of the Indian Constitution. “On the directions of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, party workers, leaders and office bearers in every district of the state to observe the Constitution Day on November 26 to revive their pledge to uphold section 2 of the party constitution and the spirit of Indian Constitution,” says an official release from the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppose-idea-of-state-based-on-religious-belief-sp-cadre-told/articleshow/87824453.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Drainage upgrade to solve Bypass waterlogging issue||KOLKATA: After prolonged misery this monsoon when the entire area was inundated for weeks, Nayabad — a neighbourhood off Bypass — is set to get rid of its waterlogging woes. Kolkata Municipal Corporation has taken up a special drainage upgrade project for the area that will benefit thousands. According to a proposal placed before the board of administrators three days ago, the civic body will lay an underground drainage pipeline that will connect Nayabad to Chak Garia drainage pumping station. Times ViewMany neighbourhoods along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass south of the Anwar Shah Connector experience flooding several times every monsoon. The new plans will be a boon for them. But the larger problem -- haphazard construction along the Bypass -- remains and will be more difficult to solve.Nayabad residents expressed their hope over the civic initiative. Chanchal Kar, a KMC official and a resident of Nayabad, said it was a long-standing demand of Nayabad residents to connect the neighbourhood to a better drainage network to save them from inundation. “We hope the drainage upgrade project will bring the much-awaited relief from waterlogging every monsoon,” Kar said. According to a KMC official, the proposal was passed by the majority of the board members. “The necessary funds have been sanctioned and we look forward to implementing the project,” said a KMC official. Besides Nayabad, residents of Mukundapur and Chhit Kalikapur will also benefit from a drainage pumping station built at Chhit Kalikapur which awaits inauguration on Sunday. According to a KMC official, the pumping station will ensure storm water recedes fast from large areas of Mukundapur and Chhit Kalikapur. “Apart from locals, a large number of patients who wade through knee-deep or waist-deep water to visit several private hospitals in the Mukundapur locality every monsoon will also benefit when the pumping station starts functioning,” the official said. Madhumita Ghosh, a resident of Mukundapur and a private firm employee, said, “Finally, steps are being taken to mitigate waterlogging woes in our neighbourhood. We hope to get the desired results next monsoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drainage-upgrade-to-solve-bypass-waterlogging-issue/articleshow/87823263.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||No place for Delhi municipal corporations in Swachh top 10 again||NEW DELHI: The dismal performance of Delhi's three municipal corporations continued to raise eyebrows with none of them making it to the top ten cities of India as declared by the Swachh Survekshan 2021 on Saturday.  While East Delhi Municipal Corporation lagged at 40th position among 48 cities, a rise from the 46th spot last year, the south corporation was at the 31st place and the north body, the worst placed among the trio, at 45th, down from 43 last year. None of them could make headway in the race for the star rankings for a garbage-free city (which accounts for 1,000 points). SDMC had applied for a one-star ranking and EDMC for three stars under the category but were rebuffed. The garbage-free status is awarded when no garbage is found in any public, commercial or residential place at any point during the day. Regarding their efforts in checking open defecation, SDMC was placed in the ODF++ category and EDMC in ODF+ category, both below the top certification. North corporation claimed to have applied for ODF+ certification only for 2022, with one of its officials saying the civic body hadn’t been able to pay salaries regularly due to a funds crisis and this has “automatically affected” the implementation of initiatives. “We still managed to get the first prize for ‘citizens’ feedback’ among mega cities with a population of over 40 lakh,” the official said. “We plan to work intensively in sectors like dumpsite processing, landfill biomethanisation, waste segregation at source and an integrated waste-to-energy plant to use municipal solid and plastic waste.” SDMC officials asserted they had performed better than last year if the overall score of all 420 cities with more than one lakh population was considered. “Last year, we were at 120th position in this list. This year we are at the 112th position. Also, we managed to get the ODF++ certificate against ODF+ in 2020,” said Rajiv Jain, superintending engineer, SDMC. A. Sanjay Sahay, director, press and information, SDMC, said that there was a plan to launch a special drive to clean the streets and drains in the coming months to improve the Swachh rankings. “For decentralised dealing of wet waste, we are setting up more composting plants. Also, to process construction and demolition waste, we have one plant operational and one being set up. The department of environment management services is also working on setting up a waste-to-energy plant to utilise all the solid waste and so avoid their dumping at landfills,” Sahay said The Union urban affairs ministry cleanliness survey was carried out in January and March and the performances judged on parameters such as segregation and collection of waste, processing and disposal of garbage, sustainable sanitation, citizen’s feedback and innovation. An EDMC official said, “We improved marginally despite the financial crunch and are working hard to improve the services with transparency, e-governance initiatives, door-to-door collection of garbage, segregation of waste at source, decentralised composting and biomethanation, etc. We scored 3,226 marks out of 6,000 in comparison with the 1,962 marks we got last year, thus showing improvement.” EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand added, “For Swachh Survekshan 2022, we are planning new initiatives such as toilets on public-private partnership, surface parking and multi-level parking in PPP mode, a sanitary landfill at Ghazipur and a processing plant to deal with the leftovers from abattoirs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-place-for-corpns-in-swachh-top-10-again/articleshow/87823812.cms||Vibha Sharma

While six persons were crushed to death in a house collapse in Anantapur district, six more deaths were reported from Chittoor. As many as 17 deaths were reported from the four affected districts on Friday, of which 12 fatalities were from Kadapa. The toll is likely to rise as there is no clarity on the fate of those who were washed away in flash floods. Heavy rains triggered by a series of depression in the Bay of Bengal led to the overflowing of rivers and water projects, causing flash floods in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Nellore over the last 72 hours. Thousands remain marooned while roads to several villages have caved in to the force of gushing water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/andhra-rain-toll-increases-to-29-50-still-missing/articleshow/87825237.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The arrested man has been identified as Okwudiri Paschal, who was arrested on Saturday from Bangalore while he was withdrawing a cheated amount of Rs 20,000 from an ATM, a police officer said. A person duped by Paschal had filed a police complaint on November 2. He had received a message that his Whatsapp app was going to be upgraded. “He was told, that for this purpose, the system is generating a six digit code and as soon as he typed his mobile number followed by a 6 digit code, his WhatsApp screen became non-functional and was hacked,” said a senior police officer. The officer said that the hacker then started sending messages to his relatives through the victim’s WhatsApp and requested to transfer money a bank account on different grounds. DCP Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said the investigation revealed numerous people were duped similarly. “The accused used to change their bank accounts regularly in order to escape from police,” Yadav said. Paschal told the cops that he is the member of an international cyber fraud racket that has cheated hundreds of other victims throughout India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/whatsapp-hacking-one-held-for-cheating/articleshow/87824463.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Virtual court for e-challan set for debut in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The virtual traffic court, which will hear all e-challan cases, is all set to debut in the city. According to sources, the high court has already begun the process of identifying this court and a final decision is expected in the next few weeks. A few technical issues — chief among them being the jurisdictional reach of this court — are being factored in. Once operational, the police has proposed to introduce e-prosecutions by 2021-start . “Kolkata Traffic Police had in July introduced pilot e-challan software. The trials began across two traffic guards — Headquarters and east — with plans to gradually extend to the 23 other guards. However, there was the challenge to set up an e-challan-special traffic court. With a court now likely to be set up, the full-fledged launch of the e-challan system now looks a reality. Once operational, this e-challan software will bring many changes for the motorists who, with just a click and without having to physically appear in traffic courts or carry physical vehicle documents, can complete paying the fines,” said a senior officer on Sunday. Last week, the cops also took stock of their experiences at the two guards about their experiences in the past four months. “We are satisfied with the trial run so far. We have been in touch with the developer — NIC — with the few issues we faced initially and our concerns are being looked into,” said a senior traffic department cop. “In the final step, we will be introducing this project for the entire Kolkata and integrate it with the e-court where cases can be settled without physically visits. The software will be fully integrated with Vahan and Sarathi databases. Also, documents can be digitally seized and suspended and hence there will be no need to carry the documents. The digi-locker documents will be enough for cops on the road to carry out paperless challan,” said an officer, adding the state will also notify the use of Digilocker system soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virtual-court-for-e-challan-set-for-debut/articleshow/87823286.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dead rubber? Not when India is playing at Eden||KOLKATA: Cricket lovers swarmed the airport, last-minute ticket hunters waited patiently outside Eden Gardens till late in the evening, enthusiastic fans cheered head coach Rahul Dravid and the Men in Blue as they walked into the stadium. The gate of the team hotel remained crowded under the vigil of police commandos. In a nutshell, this was the picture of Kolkata a day ahead of the third T20 between India and New Zealand. Team India has already won the series and the final match at the Eden is a mere formality. But that didn’t seem to have dampened the spirits of the fans. Covid has led to several changes this time from the last international match here when India played Bangladesh in the pink ball test. “Gate 17 — meant for entry of players and match officials — will have an additional gate this time for their entry and exit meant to maintain the bio-bubble,” pointed out a CAB official. Spectators will have to enter in smaller groups and to ensure social distancing. Wearing of masks shall be mandatory, said the police. Entry at the stadium will be allowed from a little after 5pm. On Saturday evening though, Covid was the last thing in the mind of the enthusiasts. “The match might be a dead rubber for Team India but for us, the cricket lovers, it is our first chance to see Rohit Sharma leading the team. From a purely entertainment point of view, there is finally something that we can go out and enjoy,” said Tirthankar Dasgupta, a chartered accountant from Golpark. A straw poll by TOI threw up some interesting star preferences. A large part of the Eden would root for Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul while there is another section who are rushing to the field to see “KKR mate” Venkatesh Iyer. “Both openers are in great form. Last night, they created history. If any of them play the way they did on Friday, my day would be made,” said Avik Sengupta, who idolizes Sharma from his early days. The police, as announced on Friday, increased the parking space expecting all 47,000 allotted seats to be filled up on Sunday evening. Khudiram Bose Road (Auckland Road), North Brooke Avenue and Gostha Pal Sarani (Kingsway) will be closed to all types of vehicles from 4pm till dispersal of crowds. High Court-bound cars may be allowed to move along Esplanade Row West, instead of Auckland Road and North Brooke Avenue. Parking of vehicles will be prohibited on both sides of Gostha Pal Sarani (Kingsway). Khudiram Bose Road (Auckland Road), Govt Place East, Govt Place West, Rani Rashmoni Avenue, Old Court House Street, Indira Gandhi Sarani (Red Road), Guru Nanak Sarani (Mayo Road) and Dufferin Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dead-rubber-not-when-india-is-playing-at-eden/articleshow/87823289.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sreekesh Kumar, an electrician with the civic body in Moradabad, had been hit by a speeding motorbike and taken to the district hospital on Thursday night where doctors on duty announced that he had died. They then bundled him into the freezer in the mortuary before a post-mortem could be done the next day. #Watch: Seven hours after being kept in a #mortuary freezer, UP man came out alive, confounding medical staff.… https://t.co/PsNLbyyRFx— TOI Bareilly (@TOIBareilly) 1637460437000Nearly seven hours later, when a 'panchnama', a document signed by family members after identifying the body and agreeing to an autopsy, was to be filed by police, Kumar's sister-in-law Madhu Bala noticed that he was showing signs of movement. In a video that has been widely shared on social media, an astounded Madhu Bala is heard exclaiming, "He's not at all dead, in fact far from it. How did this happen? Look, he wants to say something, he is breathing." Other equally bewildered family members then crowd around the body and ask for doctors and police. Moradabad’s chief medical superintendent, Dr Shiv Singh, said, “The emergency medical officer had seen the patient at around 3am and there was no heartbeat. He told me he had examined the man multiple times. Therefore he was declared dead. In the morning, a police team and his family found him alive. A probe has been ordered and our priority, at the moment, is to save his life.” Singh said it was one of those "rarest of rare cases". Explaining what may have happened, he added, "Sometimes there are difficulties faced while declaring someone dead. For example, there is ‘suspended animation’ where there is temporary cessation of many vital organs without death. It can lead to extraordinary situations. We can’t call it negligence (on the part of doctors) until we have all the reports in our hand." Even as Kumar's medical state confused doctors, a miracle had quietly happened. A doctor at the hospital who didn't wish to be named, told TOI, “As per the guidelines, a body is supposed to be kept in the freezer in order to save it from decaying. The ideal temperature should be below 10 degrees. However, there was an issue of power and the freezer switched on and off. It probably saved the man’s life.” Madhu Bala, a government teacher, said, “Police wanted four family members for the panchnama and I decided to enter the mortuary. I touched his cheeks and called him ‘jija ji’ (brother-in-law). To my happiness and horror, it was warm. He was breathing. Then I asked him to wake up, saying 'I am Madhu and have come to see you', to which he immediately responded and I informed police and called a doctor, who found him alive.” After Kumar's came out alive from the freezer, he was referred to a health centre in Meerut, where his condition has improved. "He is yet to gain consciousness but doctors have assured us that he is out of danger,” Madhu Bala said. The family is fuming at the doctors, though. “We will lodge a complaint against them for negligence as they almost killed Sreekesh despite him being alive," Madhu Bala said.

With elections set for Sunday, Nagaraj Kiranagi, who was in the fray for the post of president, announced on Friday that he was withdrawing and urged voters to vote for Ramu Mulagi, a recipient of the national teacher award, folk singer, and writer. Kiranagi had moved high court challenging Lingaraj Angadi’s nomination for the post of president for the third consecutive term saying that it was in violation of the bylaws of the KSP. He had also questioned the appointment of Dharwad tahsildar as the election officer saying that an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner should have been made the election officer. The HC bench, which had earlier granted interim stay to the election, later vacated it.  Angadi, Kiranagi and Mulagi were in the contest for the post. Kiranagi had alleged that the court was misguided about the bylaw of the KSP. He had stated that he would challenge the election of Angadi in the court in the event of the latter getting elected again. On Friday, Kiranagi in the presence of senior members, former president of district KSP DM Hiremath and others announced that he had decided to support Ramu Mulagi, a teacher, singer and writer. Lingaraj Angadi’s move to contest the election for the third time had not gone down well with his own supporters and several senior members had advised him to make way for new comers. However he was unrelenting and had filed his papers. The members supporting Mulagi have appealed to Angadi to respect the sentiments of the majority of members and retire from the fray thus paving way to Ramu Mulagi.  BOXes Stage Set for KSP Poll Eections to the state and district unit of KSP will be held on Sunday from 8am to 4pm. Election officer and Dharwad tahsildar Santosh Biradar said a total of 10 polling stations have been set up at Dharwad, Hubballi and all taluk head quarters of the district. In Dharwad two polling stations have been set up at the department of Management Studies in Karnatak College while in Alnavar a polling booth has been set up at Town Panchayat office. In Hubballi three polling booths will be at the tahasildar’s office premises in mini Vidhana Soudha. Tahasildar’s offices will have polling booths at Kundgol, Annigeri, Kalghatagi and Navalgund. There are 5,199 voters including 1,790 in Dharwad taluk, 154 in Alnavar, 1,512 in Hubballi city, 88 in Hubballi rural, 755 in Kundgol, 303 in Navalgund, 388 in Annigeri and 209 in Kalghatagi. The counting of votes will be at tahsildar’s office in Dharwad on the same evening. Confident of win: Angadi Exuding confidence Lingaraj Angadi said he would win the election and become the president for the third time as my previous developmental works will help me to win the election. Speaking to the reporters here on Saturday, he said that as district president of KSP for the past eight years, he has handled many successful programmes including 84th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sammelana in Dharwad in 2019, built the Kannada cultural forum with the help of elected representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/sahitya-parishat-polls-opposition-unites-as-lingaraj-angadi-seeks-a-3rd-term/articleshow/87823155.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI
---||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi to PM Modi: Don’t share dais with minister Teni if you care for farmers||LUCKNOW: A day after calling the repeal of farm laws motivated by fear to lose elections, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday asked PM Narendra Modi not to share the dais with Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni at the DGPs conference since Teni’s son is the prime accused in the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. “If your sentiments for farmers are true, then please do not share the stage with your minister of state for home and dismiss him from his post,” she said. Priyanka also demanded withdrawal of cases lodged against farmers across the country and sought financial aid for the families of farmers who died during the year-long protests against the farm laws. The Congress leader made the appeal to the PM through a letter that she read out in front of reporters at her Lucknow residence on Saturday. PM Modi is in Lucknow to participate in the top cops meet where Teni may share the stage with him. “Yesterday, while addressing the countrymen, you had said that with true mind and pious heart and keeping in mind the interests of the farmers, an unprecedented decision to repeal the farm laws was taken. If this is true, then getting justice delivered to the families affected by the Lakhimpur Kheri violence should be your top priority,” Priyanka stated in the letter. She further said that Teni can influence the probe into Kheri killings. She also mentioned that she had met the families of Kheri victims and said they were in immense pain. “They only want justice and justice is not possible as long as Ajay Mishra remains a minister,” she stated in the letter noting that to ensure justice to every citizen is not only the duty of the prime minister but also his moral responsibility. Cong tributes to dead farmers: Terming the repeal of the three farm laws as victory for farmers, the Congress observed ‘Kisan Vijay Diwas’ on Saturday. The party also organised a small ceremony at the UPCC headquarters in Lucknow to pay homage to the farmers who died during the protests against the farm laws. UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said despite more than 700 farmers losing their lives during the year-long agitation, PM Narendra Modi has not paid tribute to them. “The annadata (farmers) have been humiliated by names such as ‘andolanjivi’, ‘Khalistani’, ‘mavali’ by the ruling government. Their humiliation is historic,” Lallu said.

---||Lucknow||Trash management helps Lucknow retain rank||LUCKNOW: The support from its citizens not only helped Lucknow Municipal Corporation to retain the 12th rank, but was also win the “Best State Capital under Citizens Feedback” award in the Swachh Bharat Survey 2021 released by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry on Saturday. Lucknow secured 4,586 out of 6,000 marks among 48 cities with 10 lakh or above population assessed in this category of the survey. Lucknow’s rank has improved over the years. It was placed at 269 in 2017, which improved to 115 in 2018, but dropped to 121 in 2019 before making a jump to Rank 12 last year. The civic body got the “Best State Capital under Citizens Feedback” because participation of Lucknow’s citizens was maximum in giving voluntary online feedback during the survey as compared to other cities in the category. The evaluation was done under three parameters and LMC performance improved in all parameters this year in comparison to last year’s assessment. LMC got the highest — 1,549 out of 1,800 marks — in the ‘Citizens Feedback’ parameter in which people participated by voluntarily registering and answering questions regarding the civic services on ‘Lucknow One app’. In Service Level Progress parameter, LMC scored 1,936 out of 2,400 marks. This parameter included assessment of smart and new technologies introduced by the civic body over the years to improve living conditions. In the Certification parameter, LMC scored 1,101 out of 1,800 marks. This means that there was significant improvement in management of garbage and making the city open defecation free. In garbage management sub-category, Lucknow received three stars (600 out of 900 marks) and in ODF, the city received the status of ODF++, which means 500 out of 900 marks. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia and municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi were presented with mementos for their continued efforts to give the city a status of GFC and ODF++ status at the “Swachh Amrit Mahotsav” function held in New Delhi. The Swachh Bharat Survey report was also released on the occasion. “Even with limited resources and Covid pandemic, the never ending support of our public has made us retain the spot. We will continue to improve services to our city,” mayor told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/trash-management-helps-city-retain-rank/articleshow/87824467.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Lucknow||‘Tech use & added workforce clicked’||Lucknow: Positive responses from its citizens, transparency in chain command between workers and officials, use of new technology and added workforce to increase door-to-door garbage collection were the main reasons that helped Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) retain 12th rank in Swachhta Suvekshan 2021 and bag ‘Best State Capital Under Citizens Feedback’ award. As per the survey results, Lucknow received three stars in garbage free city category and scored 600/900 marks under certification parameter. Last year, LMC got only one star in this category with 150 marks. Similarly, good public response ensured 1,549 marks in ‘Citizens Feedback’ compared to 1,029 last year. “Improving garbage management in the city was our main aim this year. Our next target will be to completely stop open garbage dumping. We will also focus on providing basic civic amenities to people,” municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi told TOI. LMC had installed over 1,800 three-bin sets (dry, wet and medical waste) for garbage segregation across the city. Further, about 10,000 sites and vacant plots were made garbage-free. Around 120 open garbage houses run by LMC have been eliminated by deploying compactor mounted trucks. Nine mechanized sweeping machines were also deployed to clean 62 roads. Apart from this, a Construction and Demolition Waste Plant has been established on Rae Bareli Road in which the debris/building materials are separated and prepared for reuse||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tech-use-added-workforce-clicked/articleshow/87824478.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The revelation has come from the investigation being done by Wadi police station.The investigation is almost complete, as per PI Lalita Todase. The PI told TOI that as per the investigation, four patients had died at the hospital when the fire broke out on April 12. “Other patients were shifted to other hospitals. Of them, four patients died while undergoing treatment. The charge sheet in the case will be filed soon,” she said.As per sources from Wadi Municipal Council (MC), the health of four patients who died later had deteriorated due to inhaling smoke in the fire. The hospital is running on second, third and fourth floors of a commercial building, Pooja Chambers. As per data available with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department, this is the most severe fire incident in the history of district. “I can not recollect any other fire incident in which more than two persons have died. In 2016, there was an industrial explosion in a pharmaceuticals company on Kamptee road where 12 died. But fire was not the main cause. I think the highest deaths due to a fire have happened in the Wadi hospital case,” he said.Wadi MC sources said family members of deceased were not given any compensation neither from the hospital nor collector office and government.One of the directors of the hospital, Dr Rahul Thawre, did not respond to TOI calls and messages.The hospital is operational despite the closure notice issued by district civil surgeon (CS) and notice directing demolition of building by Wadi MC.As per Wadi MC notice, the building is not sanctioned and lacks fire NOC and systems. As per CS, validity of certificate given to operate the hospital has lapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-probe-reveals-8-patient-died-due-to-wadi-hospital-fire/articleshow/87823309.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad drops to 10th spot in Swachh Survekshan||AHMEDABAD: Over the last three years, Ahmedabad has dropped by four ranks to land on the tenth spot since 2019 in the latest Swachh Survekshan ranking 2021. Gujarat on the other hand has ranked third with 931 points in the latest 2021 cleanliness survey. It is worth pointing out here is that the city had ranked 14 in 2016 and 2017 in a row and then in 2018 it ranked twelfth. The issue is significant as it was in this city — between 1917 and 1919 that Mahatma Gandhi had launched one of the longest running cleanliness drives with Dr Hariprasad Desai in the Walled City, when he had retuned from South Africa to set up the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad. Another major blow to Gujarat in the cleanliness ranking was Bapu’s birthplace Porbandar, which dropped to the 146 rank among 695 districts that were assessed by the Union ministry of urban development. Back in 2016 it ranked 187 and it was only in 2020 that Bapu’s birthplace had risen to the rank 100. The state urban development department had asked Porbandar Nagarpalika and the district administration to come out with a detailed plan for improving the situation of Bapu;’s birthplace Meanwhile, in Ahmedabad city, AMC officials claimed that they deserved much more, “We could have moved higher up in the ranking if the judges had looked at our waste management and processing, we deserved more. We have developed better networks with hotels, educational institutions and offices for wate collection,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-drops-to-10th-spot-in-swachh-survekshan/articleshow/87823851.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Confessional statements can’t be used to infer offence committed’||MUMBAI: The HC in its reasoned ordergranting bail to Aryan Khan and 2 others observed that the NCB seizure is small quantity and said, “Even if it is appreciated, the maximum punishment prescribed is not more than one year for such offence. Applicants have already suffered incarceration for almost 25 days.” The HC issued the bail conditions and set the bond amount on October 29. Khan was released from Arthur Road jail on October 30, followed by Dhamecha and Merchant the next day. Aryan Khan was invited as a guest on the cruise by the event organiser. The HC in its 14-page order said it is “required to be sensitive to the fact that there has to be presence of basic material in the form of evidence so as to substantiate the case of conspiracy against the applicants.” Merely because the applicants were travelling on the cruise, “that by itself cannot be termed as satisfying foundation for invoking provisions of Section 29 (conspiracy) against the trio,” the HC reasoned. It rejected NCB’s submissions made through additional solicitor general Anil Singh that there was conspiracy and since “cumulatively commercial quantity of drugs was seized from the accused persons,” the “intention” of the trio to commit offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act should be considered and bail denied. Khan’s counsel -- Mukul Rohatgi, Amit Desai and Satish Maneshinde -- and Merchant’s counsel -- Desai and Taraq Sayed -- had argued that for an offence of conspiracy, there has to first be a consensus via “meeting of minds’’ before the act is committed, and here there was none. The ASG had said conspiracies are difficult to prove at the bail stage. None of them, the two students and, Dhamecha, a model from MP, have any criminal antecedents, the order said. Dhamecha’s lawyer Ali Kaashif Khan argued she too was invited as a guest for the party on the two-day cruise from Mumbai to Goa. Justice Sambre said that to infer an act of conspiracy on part of the trio with other co-accused in the case, “there has to be positive evidence about such an agreement to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means and such agreement must precede with meeting of minds.” His order noted, “There is absence of material on record of them having such meeting of minds with other accused who were named in the offence in question.” There is “hardly any positive evidence to convince this court that all accused with common intention agreed to commit unlawful act,” said the order, “Rather the investigation carried out till this date suggests that (Aryan and Arbaaz) were travelling independent of (Dhamecha) and there was no meeting of minds.” “There is no material on record to infer that applicants have hatched conspiracy” to commit a drug offence, hence it is difficult to infer at this stage that they are involved in an offence of commercial quantity, hence a stringent provision like Section 37 which places greater checks on courts before granting bail “would prima facie not be attracted to the case.” “It is difficult to infer that applicants are involved in an offence of commercial quantity,” said Justice Sambre. Justice Sambre clarified that ‘confessional statements’ recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act can be considered only for investigation purpose and “cannot be used as a tool for drawing inference that the applicants have committed an offence under the Act.” The trio’s counsel had cited the Supreme Court ruling in the Toofan Singh case, which said NCB officers are also police officers and confessional statements recorded by them are not admissible evidence. The HC rejected NCB claims that Khan and the two others had, via their statements, “accepted” their involvement. The arrest sans a notice first was illegal said Desai, but stating Section 37 makes all offences ‘cognizable and non-bailable’, no such notice under Section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code was required and the arrest was legal, the HC order noted the ASG as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiconfessional-statements-cant-be-used-to-infer-offence-committed/articleshow/87824486.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two doctors to pay woman Rs 29 lakh following ‘medical negligence’||MUMBAI: Awarding a compensating of around Rs 29 lakh to a 49-year-old Dombivli woman towards injury sustained and lifelong follow-up expenses after she suffered from post-operative complications following a hysterectomy in 2010, the state consumer commission said two doctors were negligent in providing medical services. The woman alleged the doctors did not obtain “informed consent” as she was not apprised of details of the operation. Accepting the submissions, the commission said there was negligence by the doctors as they neither maintained proper medical records nor obtained informed consent. It said detail operation notes were not written. “Failure to obtain informed consent and absence of essential medical record is negligence. Moreover, as opponents (doctors) themselves admitted before Maharashtra Medical Council that injury sustained to ureters of complainant was accidental. Opponents are responsible for that,” Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Commission said. It directed Dombivli’s Dr Seema Shanbhag and Nerul resident Dr Ujjwal Mahajan to comply with the order within a month or it will carry an interest of 12%. In the complaint submitted to the commission in 2012, the woman sought compensation of Rs 50 lakh. She said on November 11, 2010, she underwent surgery by the two doctors at Shanbhag’s hospital. On November 19, few days after discharge, she reported back to the doctor for abdominal pain and vomiting. Despite being treated for it, the problems persisted. In March 2011 she had to undergo another operation. She underwent a major surgery in April 2011 and was discharged in May that year. The woman said doctors were negligent while performing the laparoscopic hysterectomy because of which her ureters were injured. She said she suffered physically and mentally. The woman said she had even lost her job due to physical issues and had spent a lot of money over medical expenses. The doctors denied the allegations and submitted that the injury to ureters during the laparoscopic hysterectomy operation was a known complication and there was no negligence. The commission said the defence of accepted complications needs to be looked at very carefully. It said when a patient is within four walls of an operation theatre, to which the relatives don’t have access, it is the responsibility and legal liability of doctors to explain what went wrong. It said whether complications were expected in any operative procedure, then, what precautions were taken by doctors, Preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative periods, must be documented. It said documentation had an important role legally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-doctors-to-pay-woman-rs-29l-following-medical-negligence/articleshow/87824825.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Noida||No elevated car ramp, Noida airport will have a walkway to the terminal||NEW DELHI: You won’t be driving up an elevated ramp to reach the departure level, as you do at Delhi’s IGIA, at Noida International Airport (NIA) when it gets operational in 2024. You will, however, have to walk a bit. The approach to the terminal building of NIA will be through a pathway under a canopied roof that will take you from the point where the car drops you straight to the forecourt, which is at the same level but around 300 metres away. The forecourt with a step design inspired by the Varanasi ghatsThe security hold and pre-boarding area whose roof design is the flowing form of water. The roof’s ‘soffit’ underside can be used for illuminationTaking in a view of the terminal in front, you can take escalators or elevators to the departure level on the first floor. The ‘missing’ ramp is part of the design philosophy for this airport that developer Zurich AG promises will be a fusion of local culture and Swiss efficiency. “We are building a terminal that is clearly at home in UP, rooted in the tradition of the region and where passengers immediately feel welcome,” NIA CEO Christoph Schnellmann told TOI. The forecourt, for instance, has steps that are inspired by the iconic ghats of Varanasi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for the airport in Jewar on Thursday (Nov 25). The airport design, like many of its other aspects, including the selection of the concessionaire, was finalised during the lockdown. Ashwini Thorat, the NIA VP who heads planning and design for this greenfield airport, took architects selected through a competition on a virtual tour of UP’s key architectural mascots — the ghats of Varanasi, temples, the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri and havelis — as well as its rivers. “We had to strike the right balance between providing efficient global infrastructure and giving a very, very local experience, reflecting Indian warmth and hospitality,” she said. The end result is NIA features like the sprawling forecourt in front of the terminal and a courtyard in the post-security check-pre-boarding area that draws from the concept of a temple’s or a haveli’s ‘aangan’. Red granite stone will be used for the sandstone feel with aluminium meshes on the walls – modern versions of the ‘jaali’. The roof’s design is the flowing form of water at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati at Prayagraj. The roof will also be a “canvas for illumination.” “The underside of the roof is a stretched glass fibre fabric system (soffit) that will be very helpful in protecting people from the harsh summer sun. It also allows us to project coloured light onto it, allowing NIA to celebrate special days by illumination the way the Empire State Building in New York does,” said Andrew Thomas, partner at Grimshaw Architects in London and project director for the NIA design team. The airport will have internal green spaces, something Singapore’s Changi excels at, for “biophilia” — the soothing instinct to connect with nature. “NIA will be the only airport where people in the security hold area can go to the open area of the courtyard before boarding their flight when weather permits,” said Thorat, who led Zurich Airport International’s greenfield design phase for Bangalore airport. The airport land has around 11,000 trees. NIA said it has geo-tagged every tree and collected details of each. “We identified the native trees and the foreign ones that shouldn’t ideally be in this environment. Then we studied how many need to be preserved, how many can be transplanted and how many can be cut. The native species — neem and Kadamba, the tree associated with Krishna — will be preserved for posterity,” said Thorat. The approach to the airport will not be a manicured lawn, it will be the landscape in its real form. “Placeless-ness is an expression of modern air travel (referring to how most airports look alike). It’s fundamentally important for us to have an airport say where it is. I have designed airports across continents. I can say in all sincerity I have never worked in a place where the inspiration is as rich, diverse and powerful as it is in India and in UP,” said Thomas who has led the designs of several airports, including new terminals at Heathrow, John F Kennedy Airport, the new Istanbul Airport, and Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg. The environment within the forecourt is not one that is dominated by cars. There are some great Indian airports with great over-sailing roofs (but) there you are surrounded by cars,” he added. “The decision not to have an elevated road in front of the terminal allows the terminal building to have a position of prominence. The front will not be overwhelmed by cars,” said Thomas. How users react to the walk to the terminal remains to be seen. VIP curbs will be closed and public transport modes have been prioritised in terms of access to the airport. NIA has a provision for switching over to a drive-to-front-of-terminal model, of saying IGIA, depending on passengers’ feedback.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-car-ramp-noida-airport-plans-walkway-to-terminal/articleshow/87824475.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Goa||FC Goa ready for Mumbai City challenge in their season opener||If FC Goa fans jog their memories to last season, they will see a lot of Mumbai City FC. It were Mumbai who ended Goa’s campaign in the Indian Super League at the semifinal stage, after a nail-biting penalty shoot-out. Given what transpired before the season, Mumbai were their fiercest rivals, and it were their neighbours with a lot of familiar faces that emerged champions, winning both the league and the trophy. Eight months later when Goa start their campaign against the defending champions, head coach Juan Ferrando knows there won’t be Sergio Lobera in-charge but expects the same threat from Des Buckingham at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Monday. “It is the city group and the head coach now will be thinking the same way as the ex-coach. They are working more a less in the same style. “Now the team, except Hugo (Boumous), (Adam) Le Fondre, they have the same squad. Apuia is helping them in midfield. My point of view is that they have the same style. Of course, (they will) change some details because every coach is different. But the game is the same way as last season,” Ferrando told TOI during an online interaction on Sunday. Lobera, who had three successful years in Goa, built his core team with key players that he took along with him at Mumbai. This year, the defending champions have roped in former Goa striker Igor Angulo, who scored 14 goals in 21 games to win the Golden Boot award. Goa know they cannot take the 37-year-old lightly. “We know Igor. Everybody knows him. He is a good number nine and efficiency is 100 percent inside the box. For us, it is important to work as a team and not only Igor. At the moment, they are the champions and it is very important to work as a team,” said Ferrando. Goa – now on a record 15-match unbeaten run in ISL -- have made few reinforcements and retained Spanish captain Edu Bedia, Alberto Noguera, Ivan Gonzalez and Jorge Ortiz. They have roped in Australian centre-back Dylan Fox from NorthEast United FC and will rely on yet another Spaniard, Airam Cabrera, for goals. The Durand Cup triumph has boosted their morale as they search for their first ISL title, after two failed final attempts. Muhammed Nemil and Devendra Murgaonkar have shown they have knack for goals, and Ferrando knows he can count on them. Unlike last year, Ferrando spent more time with the team during pre-season which commenced in August. “The pre-season for us is very important because it is the moment to work with the team. To improve in tactical, not only in physical conditions. I am very happy that the foreign players decided to join the team so early,” said Ferrando. Mumbai will also want to start their season on the right note and aim for nothing less than three points. Buckingham, into his 19th season in coaching and first in India, has analysed most of the teams, but didn’t have the luxury to be with the squad early in pre-season. “I think we have done as much as we could in the time we had,” said Buckingham. “I think anywhere in the world, you would like to have more time with the players on and off the field, but we haven’t had that. We had to make very good use of the time we had with this group.” Mumbai have 11 new faces in the squad with four new foreign arrivals. It will be the 19th time the teams face each other. When the ISL started in 2014, Goa always enjoyed the upper hand. Last season, it was different as the two-time finalists failed to defeat Mumbai in four attempts, drawing three games, including the second-leg semifinal which they lost on penalties. Goa will want to change that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-ready-for-mumbai-city-challenge-in-their-season-opener/articleshow/87837334.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

In 2020, the city had secured 18th rank. This time, the city scored 3721.83 marks out of 6,000 in the survey conducted at 48 cities on various parameters including feedback from citizens.Pimpri-Chinchwad and Aurangabad cities improved their rankings and secured 19th and 22nd position, respectively. Nagpur was ahead of them in last year’s survey. Chandrapur city stood at 11th position after scoring 4700.80 marks in the category of cities with 1 lakh to 10 lakh population. Wardha city was at 52nd place with a score of 3782.24, while Amravati secured 54th position with a score of 3782.24 marks in the same category.In the 10-40 lakh population category, Nagpur scored 1,865.91 (out of 2,400) in service level progress, 500 and 1355.91 in open defecation (700 maximum marks) and citizen voice (1,800 maximum marks).The NMC had scored zero in the Garbage Free City (GFC) rankings released early this year, which affected the overall ranking. In 2020 too the city had secured similar marks in GFC category.Due to the abysmal performance in GFC rankings, the city scored only 500 out of 1,500 in the certification category. The 500 marks were awarded due to ODF++ certification, the official sources said.Green Vigil activist and former ambassador of NMC’s Swachh Bharat Mission, Kaustav Chatterjee said: “Once again we failed in certification. Surprisingly, last year we had scored 500 out of 1,500 and maintained the same score out of 1800 this year too. This clearly shows we failed in our efforts to get desired certification.”TOI has been regularly reporting about poor sanitation management by the NMC. Despite paying more money to two private agencies — AG Enviro and BVG India— the door-to-door garbage collection has failed to improve. In fact, it has deteriorated further, forcing mayor Dayashankar Tiwari to constitute an inquiry committee headed by ruling party leader and senior BJP corporator Avinash Thakre.Chatterjee said, “Without a solid waste treatment plant, we will never be able to get into the first 10 as around 40% of the total marks are assigned to solid waste collection, transportation and treatment. We could not score under GFC as even after appointing two new agencies with new infrastructure, garbage collection is not up to the mark.”Tiwari was not available for comments. “Lack of garbage processing at the dumping yard has hit city’s score. The service level survey was held during the second wave of the pandemic,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. The civic chief stated that the NMC has taken many initiatives, including processing of waste in the dumping yard, “which will definitely improve city’s marking in the next survey”.

The incident took place on Wednesday. TOI reported the incident on Saturday. A contract labourer was made to climb down a manhole late on Wednesday night on the road opposite Tulsi Residency in Chandkheda. A video was recorded by a member of Manav Garima Trust, an organisation working for the rights of sanitation workers in the state showed a few workers standing near the manhole while one worker was made to enter. The video showed that the worker, clad in shorts and a vest, had no safety equipment other than a harness attached to a rope. The AMC had claimed that the manhole was over a storm water drain and was not a sewer. The video shows that the worker going completely into the manhole holding a sand bag. He is later seen emerging from it. “We investigated the incident and found that there was a leak in the drain and the worker was lowered into a three-foot manhole and as the pit was shallow he was not wearing a respirator. Later, when he was lowered deeper into sewege, he was given an oxygen mask,” said a senior AMC official. An AMC official said the contractor has been fined Rs 25,000 and has been issued a show-cause notice. “We welcome the civic body’s action against the contractor. We also request civic bodies to provide safety gear to workers,” said Parsottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima Trust. Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013 prohibits states and Union Territories from employing workers for manual scavenging, or entry into sewers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/worker-in-sewer-amc-fines-contractor-rs-25k/articleshow/87823847.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Ahmedabad||Basic maths in Class 10? Can enrol for diploma engineering||AHMEDABAD: The state education department on Saturday clarified that students who have opted for either basic or standard mathematics for Class 10 will be eligible to enrol for diploma engineering studies, given that they meet other qualifying norms. The department also said that in the case of disabled students who have cleared Class 10 with 20 marks in one or more subjects, they will be allowed to enrol in diploma engineering courses. “The decision comes after complaints that such candidates were allowed to enrol in Class 11 but were not allowed to enter diploma courses due to the criteria of having cleared Class 10 with 35% overall performance in the board exams,” said sources close to the development. The registration process for Class 10 board exams for 2022 is underway and there was some confusion regarding the choice of mathematics subject for applying in diploma courses next year. Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) has earlier this year released a blueprint for two separate exams for Class 10 mathematics subject in 2021-22 academic year.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Did honeytrap woman cry sexual assault against doctor too?||MUMBAI: A day after a gang that blackmailed and extorted Rs 3.3 crore from a businessman was busted, the police said that one of the two women from the gang had filed a molestation case against a doctor at Amboli police station in 2018. The police are now digging out similar cases that could help dig out skeletons and expose the gang’s other such cases. So far, they have stumbled upon at least two such molestation cases and are probing as to how genuine these were. On Thursday, three people were arrested — Anil Choudhary alias Akash (42), Manish Sodi (41) and fashion designer Lubna Wazir alias Sapna (47). Their aide from Delhi, Monica Bhagwan alias Dev Choudhary, who was the honeytrap is wanted by the police. They have been accused of honey-trapping a 64-year-old businessman from Kolhapur after filming him with Moncia who, the police said, was partly undressed. The gang had threatened to make the video viral, extorted money and threatening to to falsely implicate him in a sexual assault case. “One of the accused women had lodged a molestation case against a doctor, We are now gathering more details about that case,” said a police inspector who is part of the investigation. Another case of 2018 that the police are looking at is one in which a woman, had lodged a rape complaint against a businessman in Jaipur. Two of those arrested for extortion from the Kolhapur businessman and the wanted accused were witnesses in the Jaipur case. Around four years ago, the businessman from Kolhapur was in Goa when he first met Anil. Later, whenever he came to Mumbai, he would meet him, sources said. During one such meeting in Mumbai, Anil introduced Sapna to the businessman. In 2019, the businessman had come to Mumbai and invited Anil to a five-star hotel where he had checked in. He took Sapna and Monica along with him. In the hotel room, as per plan, Sapna shot a video of Monica in a state of undress with the businessman around. This is when they started threatening the businessman to upload the video on social media and demanded Rs 10 crore to settle the matter, said the police. The businessman ended up paying up to Rs 3.3 crore until recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/did-honeytrap-woman-cry-sex-assault-against-doc-too-in-mumbai/articleshow/87824529.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Nagpur||First time post Diwali, Covid recoveries more than new cases in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Nagpur district reported six new cases of Covid-19 while nine patients recovered on Saturday. For the first time since November 4, the Diwali day, the recoveries are more than the cases. Though the difference in new cases and the recoveries is very small, the development has an important significance. A surge in new cases was expected in the region, especially as an outcome of the festive rush as people travelled and mingled during Diwali. Nagpur started reporting more cases right after Diwali. The number of cases reached double digits once or twice during the last two weeks. On the other hand, the recoveries went down. The number of under-treatment patients, which was less than 30 before Diwali, had surpassed 60 on November 19. All these days, the number of recoveries was constantly less than number of new cases. “On Saturday, nine patients have recovered from Nagpur district against six new cases. This could be an early indicator that the post-Diwali surge in new cases is now ending,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte. “If 50 cases in 15 days was the post-festive surge, then we could conclude that the pandemic is going to become endemic soon,” he added. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde had said that two weeks post festive season were crucial. If we consider Diwali week ended on November 7, the two weeks will complete on November 21. “The known cycle of the virus is of 14 days. We have received a very few number of new cases in the last 14 days. The death toll is almost nil. All these are very good signs,” said Dr Shinde. Like Nagpur, all other districts in Vidarbha also reported similar picture. Total 16 new cases were reported in last 24 hours and 15 patients recovered. This means, the number of recoveries is increasing. Total 4,745 tests were conducted in the region in the last 24 hours. Tests were less due to Guru Nanak Jayanti holiday. The test positivity rate is still under 0.35%. Recovery rate in Vidarbha is 98%. No death due to Covid-19 was reported in the last 10 days. “Overall, conditions are promising,” Dr Shinde said. Akola: All 199 tests conducted in last 24 hours were negative in Akola. With no recoveries in a day, total eight patients are under treatment. Washim: One new case was detected in Washim after 11 days on Saturday. Now, the lone patient is under treatment here. Buldhana: Four new cases were detected in Buldhana where 144 tests were conducted. As no patient got discharged on Saturday, now 21 patients are under treatment here. Bhandara: No new case was detected in Bhandara on Saturday. Only two patients are under treatment. Gondia: All 184 tests conducted in last 24 hours were negative in Gondia. The district still has only one patient undergoing treatment. Gadchiroli: While all 356 tests done in Gadchiroli were negative, one patient recovered from Covid-19. Now, the district has seven patients under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-time-post-diwali-more-recoveries-and-fewer-cases-in-nagpur/articleshow/87823331.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Airport queue time same as flight duration||AHMEDABAD: Soon after the Diwali holidays, when Anuj Pathak, the owner of a city-based travel company, left for a holiday from the city airport, it took him an hour and a half to wade through the rush from the check-in counter to the boarding gate. “Fortunately, I had reached the airport two hours before or I would have missed my flight. The baggage conveyor belt at the check-in counter had malfunctioned, due to which the queue was very long,” Pathak said. Amid the festive and wedding season, as travel has revived and flights are allowed to operate at 100% capacity, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport has been witnessing an unprecedented rush of fliers, especially during peak hours. At least 14,000 passengers transit through the airport every a day, according to airport sources. However, with multiple checkpoints and the rush, passengers say the time taken to get to the boarding gate is going up. “Getting through the airport during peak hours was a nightmare. There is a queue at every check point right from entering the airport, to getting baggage screened to check-in and baggage drop counters to e-gates and security check. Even though we opted for priority check-in, it took us at least 45 minutes to reach the boarding gate. Perhaps increasing the number of check-in counters will help,” said Shalin Shah, who travelled from the city airport with his family for a vacation recently. Besides the delay in getting through the crowd, long waiting times at the arrivals area is also a concern. “The parking and pick-up and drop area is very crowded at SVPI, leading a lot of chaos while exiting. It takes long for cabs or even private vehicles to enter the arrivals area because of the unmanaged rush,” said Monica Yadav, a city-based entrepreneur who is a frequent flier. An email query sent to the city airport operator, asking about measures in place to manage the rush, went unanswered. Airport sources said some four e-gates have been installed after the check-in and baggage drop counters to speed up the security check process. Passengers have also complained of not enough seating. Against footfalls of 14,000 passengers a day, the domestic terminal of the city airport has barely 560 seats in the security hold area for passengers to sit, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/airport-queue-time-same-as-flight-duration/articleshow/87823850.cms||Niyati Parikh

He instructed officials to provide Rs 2,000 to each family affected by the floods immediately besides food and drinking water, and take measures to prevent spread of diseases. He also asked officials to support pilgrims who are stuck in Tirumala due to heavy rains. The government has already appointed special officers to monitor relief measures for the flood-affected. The deep depression, which crossed Tamil Nadu coast on Thursday night, triggered heavy rains in the neighbouring districts of Nellore, Anantapur, Chittoor and Kadapa. Officials have been told to distribute the interim relief immediately to help the affected mend their houses. The overflowing ponds and water bodies are being fixed on war footing while efforts are on to restore power at the earliest. Nellore collector KVN Chakradhar Babu informed the CM that there was heavy inflow into Somasila project. The chief minister directed him to proceed with comprehensive strategy taking inflow and water capacity into consideration, and coordinate with irrigation department officials in the release of flood water.

---||Rajkot||BJP chief draws roadmap for assembly polls next year||Rajkot: BJP president C R Paatil prepared a roadmap for the assembly election slated to be held sometime next year, specifically after the state effected a change of leadership recently. In Rajkot on a one-day visit on Saturday, Paatil also repeated the government’s commitment to withdraw the cases of Patidar agitators and held a meeting to this effect with Naresh Patel. However, former chief minister and Rajkot MLA Vijay Rupani or his supporters were conspicuous in their absence in all these meetings. Addressing media persons, Paatil said, “The government withdrew many cases of Patidar agitation and 78 cases are in the process of being withdrawn. The government is firm on its commitment given to the agitators.” He, however, refused to give details of the blueprint for the assembly elections, but said, “We are not ready to allow any worker of Congress to join the BJP.” Paatil has once again made it clear in Rajkot that non-vegeterian food item vendors will not be removed from the roads. Incidentally, Rajkot was the first municipal corporation to remove such carts, followed swiftly by many other civic bodies too. “I have instructed the office bearers of all the civic bodies not to take coercive actions against non-veg carts on the roads. There is no provision in the law to ban them from selling non-veg food,” Paatil said, while talking to media persons. In the afternoon, Paatil met trade and industrial leaders in a hotel, along with office bearers of all major associations of Rajkot including Rajkot chamber of commerce and industry (RCCI), Rajkot builder association, jems and jewellery association, imitation jewellery association, engineering association among many others, where he reassured them that the projects started by the Rupani government will not be hampered. Besides a toy park and imitation park in Rajkot, industry leaders demanded being provided 5,000sqm land at 50 percent rate, instead of 3,000sqm after the new limit of MSME. Paatil also suggested forming a committee under the umbrella of RCCI and taking up issues of all of the businessman at Gandhinagar level one by one. According to sources, during the meeting with industry bodies Paatil also asked Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav to remove stray cows and dogs from the roads. Paatil also paid a surprise visit at the residence of Khodaldham trust head, Naresh Patel, and termed the meeting as an exchange of greetings for the Gujarati new year. Khodaldham is the apex religious and social body of Kadva Patidar. After the meeting, Patel told the media, “We had no political talk during the meeting.” “Khodaldham and Umiyadham both had appealed to the government to withdraw all the cases against the Patidar agitators. It’s good that the government is working on that,” he said while replying to a query on the move. Paatil also took part in several marriage functions of BJP workers and addressed the party workers in afternoon before leaving the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bjp-chief-draws-roadmap-for-assembly-polls-next-year/articleshow/87822760.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Wedding season kicks off on a high note for stakeholders||AHMEDABAD: Just after Dev Diwali concluded, the wedding season has started on a high note! Estimates by wedding planners and pandits suggest that at least 1,000 weddings are scheduled to be organised in Ahmedabad alone over the next ten days i.e. till November 29. With good number of muhurats, Covid-19 cases remaining under control and a pent-up demand that cropped up as various weddings which were planned for last year were deferred, this wedding season is set to give good business to caterers, florists as well as decorators and venue-owners. Kandarp Shastri, a pandit who performs the wedding ritual, said, “It is peak wedding season from November 20-29 and every day I have to perform the rituals for at least one wedding. There are a lot of good muhurats till December 13, after which the kamurta period sets in as per the Hindu calendar, which is considered inauspicious o hold weddings.” Due to Covid-19, over the past year and half, barely a few weddings have taken place and therefore, all the families which had deferred occasions from last year are now organising them. Dhiren Shastri, another pandit from Ahmedabad, said, “Over the next fortnight or so, there are a lot of auspicious muhurats during which various weddings are scheduled to be held in the city. I was also approached with numerous inquiries however, I was compelled to pass it on to others due to frail health. On November 29, I have already made commitments for two weddings, which I will fulfil.” Venues across the city including hotels and party-plots are running on high occupancy levels given the weddings that have been planned. “The coming ten days of November as well as the first couple of weeks of December is a busy time for the hotel as several weddings are scheduled to take place at the hotel. Couple of weddings which were deferred due to the Covid situation previously are also taking place this time. The number of occasions is surely better as compared to the last year and half and people are cautiously optimistic,” said Neelabh Chug, general manager, Renaissance Ahmedabad Hotel. With more weddings taking place, event managers, florists as well as caterers are doing brisk business. Pintoo Dandwala, owner of an Ahmedabad-based event management firm, said, “Farm house weddings is the new trend this year and we have a lot of private farm houses along Ranchharda Road and Shilaj being hired for wedding occasions.” The cap on the number of guests allowed at weddings as part of the Covid-19 guidelines has now been raised to 400. This is also making people more optimistic. Bharat Paliwal, an Ahmedabad-based caterer said, “People are optimistic, and I have a good number of catering orders this time around. The business has picked up well and I hope the trend remains.” Flower prices have increased significantly. Joita Ram, a wholesale florist operating from the Jamalpur flower market, said, “Roses are expensive this time. Due to winter, the supply has dropped. Moreover, the demand is high due to the wedding season and to meet this, we have to procure roses from other states, which is adding to the cost, taking it as high a Rs 160 a kg.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wedding-season-kicks-off-on-a-high-note-for-stakeholders/articleshow/87823849.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The video, shot at Unnati School, was recorded by a parent whose daughter was also forced to sit in the corridor outside the classroom. The incident happened on Friday when students of Class 10 and 12 were called in the school for verifying personal details for filling up the exam forms of the Gujarat board. The video shows a woman, probably a teacher, asking around 10 students to sit in the corridor outside the classroom.When the person recording the video on his mobile phone asked the reason for the punishment, the students replied that it was because they were not able to pay the school fees. The students are also seen complaining that they were forced to write exams sitting in the corridor outside the classroom. Sources said that the school is currently closed for Diwali vacation but the students of Class 10 and 12 were called to verify details like full name, date of birth, subjects opted for and submission of photos before finalizing the data for the Gujarat board exams. District education officer B S Kaila told TOI that a team was sent to the school. “I had seen the video and a team went to the school on Saturday but no students were present due to the Diwali vacations. A team will again visit the school on Monday and record the statements of students and their parents and thereafter we will issue the notice to the school for explanation,” Kaila said.

A visit to the market would leave a big hole in the customer’s pocket as most vegetables cost anything between Rs 50 and 90 a kg. Tomatoes touched the highest ever, almost doubling in 20 days from Rs 45 a kg in the first week of November to almost Rs 100 on Saturday. Beans, which costs about Rs 50, is now at Rs 90. There is a slight variation in prices among the three main cities in the state but in the interiors, it is much costlier. Vegetables like potato and onion that come from north or west India are much cheaper. Drumsticks for all its healthy qualities will not make it easily to the dining table as it touched Rs130 from Rs 60 in two weeks. Carrot prices rose from Rs 45 to Rs 85. Traders said that while there would be a hike in vegetable prices in the Sabarimala season, no shortage was experienced. However, this year, there is a huge shortage of promised vegetable consignments as rain played havoc. The state horticulture corporation said that they were making all-out efforts to procure from the farmers. “The production in Tamil Nadu has been affected, leading to the shortage. Even our farmers are affected, especially in places like Idukki,” said J Sajeev, MD, Horticorp. “What we can do is moderate 25% of the price, sold in our Horticorp markets. We plan to start Friday markets. As of now, we have started only in Kozhikode and soon it will be extended to other places,” he said. “The unprecedented rainfall is affecting our crop. Many of us have stopped vegetable production for commercial purposes due to crop loss. We plan big only for Onam when the government agencies also support procurement or marketing,” said Vivek Thomas, a farmer in Konni. Vinil Raj, a farmer who gave up his vegetable cultivation and switched to rice for want of better support system for paddy, said the procurement agencies don’t really work with farmers. K Jayaprakash, president of the vegetable farmers society in Vattavada, Munnar, said that farmers in the region receive low prices for vegetables even when the prices skyrocketed. Traders said that Kerala was still far away from meeting self-reliance in vegetable production. “The demand for vegetables has also gone up more than meat, because of health concerns,” said K K Asharaf, president, Ernakulam market stall owners association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vegetable-prices-hit-new-high-in-state/articleshow/87823360.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams operated one of the twin ghat roads leading and exiting the hill town for a few hours on Friday morning, but had to seal it off again as rains started falling again in the afternoon. The devotees, who could not leave the town as both ghat roads and pedestrian routes were sealed off, started scrambling down the hills after TTD reopened one of the ghat roads. TTD officials, led by executive officer K S Jawahar Reddy and chief security officer Gopinath Jatti, inspected the ghat roads which were blocked by landslides and uprooted trees at several places. The EO appealed to devotees to reach out to TTD’s toll free number in case they were stranded and added that the temple body will take care of their food and shelter needs. The twin pedestrian routes from Alipiri and Srivari Mettu have also been severely damaged. TTD officials said it will take some time to reopen the routes as the engineering department has to undertake massive repairs along the routes. An assessment of the damage will be done, and renovation and repair works will commence soon, Jawahar Reddy said. “TTD will facilitate darshan and accommodation for devotees who booked their darshan and stay arrangements in advance but could not visit the temple town due to inclement weather at a later date,” he assured.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata urban belt logged nine cyber crime cases a day in festive season||KOLKATA: Police in Kolkata and adjoining Bidhannagar and Barrackpore commissionerates have witnessed a spurt in cyber crime cases during the festive period with 550 cases being lodged in over two months — an average of nine cases a day. In all, people have been defrauded of Rs 65 lakh. Police said the frauds began a month before Durga Puja and continued till Jagaddhatri Puja. They included fake discount offers at restaurants and fake holiday packages. The sheer number of cases has prompted the detective department to issue advisories. Cops found that the cheats were constantly innovating to stay one step ahead of the law enforcement agencies. The fake food coupon offers have now stopped naming restaurants on Park Street and Ballygunge and are instead using names of bakeries and biryani joints in New Market and Park Circus. Also names of popular local Chinese and pizza chains are being used. This was after eateries in Park Street and Ballygunge reported such cases to police and warned their patrons of possible cheats. Fraudsters are also targeting delivery apps and covering their tracks by erasing their cookie history and using voice-over-IP (VOIP) manipulation as they test stolen credit cards. A bakery’s name was used to dupe Arijit Banerjee in Belgachhia recently. Banerjee had called on the contact number of the bakery and it was answered in Hindi by a person who is actually a fraudster. “The man then told the customer to make a booking for the order and insisted that the customer needs to pay Rs 5 as a token fee at a link that he would be sending. The moment the customer accessed the link, the personal banking details are getting exposed and he runs the risk of losing a substantial amount of money,” said an officer. A similar complaint was lodged by Sidhartha Saha, a resident of BE block in Salt Lake, who too has lost more than Rs 31,200 in a similar fraud in the name of a bakery. The police said that the money was looted in two attempts. The complaint, lodged at Bidhannagar North police station, mentions the duration of his fall call with the cheat and the e-wallet transaction that followed. For those planning a trip to some popular destinations like north Bengal and Sikkim or offbeat ones like Kashmir during the festival season were duped after being handed over fake tickets. Sumit Singh of Cossipore lost Rs 30,000 after being handed over fake tickets to travel to Kashmir by air. Pratyusha Banerjee of Behala was stranded at Gangtok after she booked a package through an unknown agency to save money during her planned North Sikkim trip but found that the agency never existed. “The fraudsters are now also using display advertisements on networking sites in the name of some of the finest eateries of south and central Kolkata saying that one can buy two meals for the cost of one. They are also offering the cheapest rates to travel across the country. Once the victim is convinced about clicking on these advertisements, several google forms appear where the victim is asked to place orders and make payments,” said an officer of anti-bank fraud cell of Kolkata Police. “We are certain that some local elements have ganged up with some Jharkhand-based gang. We are ascertaining details from telecom service providers,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-urban-belt-logged-nine-cyber-crime-cases-a-day-in-festive-season/articleshow/87823359.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Satellite images show brown patch where once trees stood||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has called a public hearing for the felling of over a 100 trees which, according to experts and satellite images, have already been chopped down. The hearing, scheduled on November 23, is expected to be a stormy affair. Recently, the civic body’s garden department issued a notice in local newspapers informing citizens about the public hearing for felling of trees at different locations between Itwari and Dighori railway stations, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) premises, in Gandhibagh zone, on Kelibagh Road and at Futala lake. Earlier, the NMC had called out objection letters for the felling of 121 trees along the periphery of Futala lake for the construction of a retaining wall. The permission to fell these trees was sought by MahaMetro to protect the existing wall and the water body. However, spot inspections by environmentalists and latest satellite images show that most of these trees have already been cut without permission. “A few months back, there were marking on the trees but the today the trees have disappeared. How can NMC call for hearing when contractor DP Jain and MahaMetro have already cut trees? NMC should urgently file a first information report against both the agencies, said environment activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. Satellite images sourced by environment activist Kunal Mourya has brought fore the revelations which have shocked the environmentalists. While MahaMetro had sought permission to fell roadside trees, the images show a huge patch of barren land opposite the lake, where, as per activists a parking plaza is supposed to come up. TOI compared satellite images of October last year, January and September this year. While the patch of land is completely green in last year’s image, it looks completely barren in the image from January. Moreover, September’s photograph shows that tree felling is getting extended. “It is so obvious that hundreds of trees have been illegally cut. It is shocking how NMC did not take any action yet,” said Mourya. NMC officials told TOI that they are looking into the matter and carrying out spot inspection. Citing the amended state tree act, activists also pointed out that the case of felling 249 trees at Neeri to construct parking are of Ajni Metro station should go to the state tree committee. “Any project which includes felling of more than 200 trees should be referred to state-level committee. NMC has no power to conduct hearing on this. Also, there are plenty of alternate spaces to build the parking plaza without damaging the green cover,” said activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/satellite-images-show-brown-patch-where-once-trees-stood/articleshow/87823854.cms||Manka Behl
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Probe against MCH security men for ‘assault’ on bystander||Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister Veena George has ordered an inquiry into the complaint made by a bystander that the security personnel of medical college hospital (MCH) assaulted him. The minister has asked the director of medical education to submit a report on this. The alleged incident occurred on Friday morning when Arun Dev of Chirayinkeezhu had an argument with the security personnel of the hospital while seeking an entry into the wards. His grandmother is undergoing treatment at the hospital. A video clip taken by other bystanders, who were waiting at the entrance, shows the security personnel dragging the youth inside the gate before assaulting him. The security personnel had allegedly locked the gate from inside after taking the youth inside. It was also seen that more security persons were joining in the alleged attack against the youth inside the gate. With this video clip becoming a major controversy, the government ordered an inquiry into the incident. Arun Dev said he had come with a valid pass to enter the wards, but the security personnel took the pass from him and did not allow him to enter. He alleged that three security persons were involved in the attack. He has filed a complaint with the medical college police also. However, the hospital authorities are of the view that the bystander had come at the rear side of the wards and it was not the entrance for the bystanders or patients. This gate, opposite to the old mortuary, is used only by the staff and the doctors. Meanwhile, during the Covid time, the patients and bystanders were allowed through this gate since the Covid wards were situated at the main entrance. But now it has come back to normalcy and this entrance is restricted for patients and bystanders. The security personnel are of the view that the bystander was asked to take the visiting pass for entering the ward block. However, the bystander was not willing for it and entered into an argument with them. No action has been taken against the security personnel as the hospital authorities said they are not the staff of the hospital, but has been employed through an agency supplying man power. Attack against doctors In yet another incident two youths unleashed an attack against the doctors and staff of the Kollam district hospital on Friday. Abu Sifiyan of Panmana and Sujit of Ramankulangara have been arrested by the police for the attack. The two men were brought to the district hospital after they got injured in a road accident at Sakthikulangara. However, during the treatment they attacked the doctor. The duo even destroyed the hospital equipment. When the police reached the hospital, the duo even attacked the police team. Both of them have been arrested by the police based on the complaint given by the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/probe-against-mch-security-men-for-assault-on-bystander/articleshow/87806823.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Woman dies after contract killers stab her, husband held||NEW DELHI: A woman died after being stabbed numerous times allegedly by contract killers hired by her husband in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar. Police have arrested the husband and the others accused. Police received a PCR call from the hospital in Sheikh Sarai about a woman brought in by her husband who had been stabbed to death. Benita Mary Jaiker, DCP (South), revealed that the woman's husband, Naveen Kumar Gullaiya, informed them that on Thursday at around 2.30pm, he had gone to see a doctor with his son, leaving his wife alone at home. “He said that after the visit to the doctor, the two of them went shopping. After leaving his son at a barbershop, he went to his office at Kalkaji,” Jaiker said. According to the DCP, Gullaiya phoned an employee to take his son home after his haircut. “Around 4.45pm, the employee called back to tell Gullaiya that his wife was lying in a pool of blood in the drawing room,” Jaiker said. He reached home and took his wife to the hospital. A team led by Kumar Kant Mishra, SHO (Malviya Nagar), began pursuing the case. CCTV footage showed two men entering the woman’s house. Probing the frequent phone calls that Gullaiya made to a woman living in Govindpuri on the day of the murder, police traced the caller Rahul. He was questioned and he confessed to his involvement in the crime. Later, Sonu was also arrested from Govindpuri. Gullaiya was friends with another woman for the last year and half. When his wife learnt about this four month ago, there were constant quarrels between the couple. “She would often check his location through video calls,” Jaiker said. This angered the man so much that he decided to do away with his wife. He hired a Rahul for the task, promising him Rs 5 lakh after the killing. Gullaiya sent Rahul the location of his house. As planned, the man left his wife at home on Thursday. While leaving the house, he locked the main gate door and gave the key to Rahul, who entered the house with his associates, Sonu and Chandu, and killed the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-dies-after-contract-killers-stab-her-husband-held/articleshow/87824580.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Mobile medical camps played key role in farmer agitation||Kundli-Singhu/Sonipat: Multiple medical camps, including a hospital named Llife Line foundation at Singhu border, played a major role in keeping farmers active and healthy during the year-long struggle against the three farm laws. The Life Line Foundation, one of the medical aid points, alone has treated over around one lakh farmers, including 45,000 OPDs, 4,500 IPD, 8,000 lab tests, 20,000 diabetic tests and other ailments during the past around 11 months of protest. Moreover, 3.20 lakh farmers were given free medicines and only 120 farmers had to be referred to higher institutions, said Avtar Singh, a key member at Life Line Foundation, who has been giving his services from the begining. In a situation when farmers had decided to die but had no plan to go back until demands were met, these medical camps which treated them at the border used to witness long queues every day, said Singh. Medical staff serving on the spot told the TOI that pneumonia, dengue, blunt injuries, cardiac, cervical issue, diarrhea and other ailments were treated well at the spot. As permanent medical facilities were available only at Sonipat, these medical camps played a prominent role in helping farmers fight against the laws. Some farmers also chipped in donated medicines worth Rs 40 lakh in one camp. Avtar Singh also added that the medical camp, equipped with a cardiologist, surgeon and some other specialists, will continue as long as the farmers are around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mobile-medical-camps-played-key-role-in-farmer-agitation/articleshow/87823858.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bypass crackdown in Kolkata: 789 booked for traffic offences||KOLKATA: It is not only Chingrighata Crossing that’s now high on the Kolkata Traffic police’s priority list. The cops are taking steps to bring down accidents on the entire stretch of the 17-km EM Bypass, from Garia to Ultadanga. Officers from six traffic guards hit the roads on Friday afternoon to discipline motorists and bikers. Traffic offences like triple riding, lane cutting and jumping and dangerous driving and drink driving were brought to book. At the end of the special drive that lasted for about five hours, 789 people were prosecuted. While 197 cases saw the use of breakdown vans (to remove vehicles parked illegally on the Bypass and service roads), there were 585 citations (on the road fines) and seven sticker cases. The drive, claimed cops, had become necessary after CCTV footage showed several motorists were sticking to traffic laws only at those spots where cops were present. “We found bikers as well as bus drivers to be equally negligent about maintaining lanes. After pedestrian issues, lane-jumping is the biggest contributor of accidents on Bypass,” said an officer. These surprise drives will continue at least till January, said a senior officer at Lalbazar, citing how the EM Bypass has over the years become a major challenge in policing before any festival due to the rising number of food and liquor options along with the scope of of quick getaways. Police sources cite the example of a bike patrol last month that helped solve a murder case after they flagged down a taxi for checking. The accused had stuffed a body in the taxi boot. Similarly, it was another bike patrol that helped locate the body of a woman who was murdered by her neighbour — an app cab driver. “We could solve both the cases due to the bike patrols and reached those places when the accused least expected us,” said an officer. It has been decided that greater patrolling and checks will be carried out in this area that is now often termed as the “new Park Street of the city”. Bypass will also witness heavy cop presence at night from local police stations. “We have been keeping nakas at Parama Island, Highland Park, Mukundapur Market and Chowbaga since the pandemic. We have added Urbana approach road, 206 bus stand, Ajoynagar approach, the Dhalai bridge and another on the Kasba connector to that list,” said a senior Lalbazar officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bypass-crackdown-789-booked-for-traffic-offences/articleshow/87823388.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation eyes stormwater lines, culverts to check flooding||PUNE: The civic body will execute various measures such as construction of stormwater lines, culverts, cleaning of nullahs, to deal with flooding during heavy rains in over 10 areas, including Dhanori-Vishrantwadi and Wadgaonsheri. The works are planned under the third phase of the stormwater management project. The civic administration will spend around Rs39 crore to execute the measures. The tendering process to appoint the agencies is set to begin. As per the scheduled, the works are expected to be completed 18 months after the work orders are issued. The Dhanori, Vishrantwadi, Yerawada and Wadgaonsheri areas had witnessed huge water logging during last month’s downpour. The residents and elected representatives had demanded for provision of stormwater lines and cleaning of nullahs to overcome the issue of accumulation of water. The issue was also raised by the corporators at the general body meeting. PMC officials said phase-3 of the project would cover the areas under 12 basins including the city’s eastern parts. The areas included Hadapsar, Kondhwa, Hinge, Panshan-Bavdhan, among others, the official said. “The work will include the survey of existing roads, stormwater drains, nullahs and identification of control points. This will be followed by construction of road side stormwater drains, construction of culverts, de-silting, cleaning, maintenance and repairs of nullahs, construction of side walls. Surveys are being conducted to identify the chronic spots. Plans will be finalized based on the observations,”an official from PMC’s drainage department said. Sunil Tingre, the Wadgaonsheri MLA, said that a meeting was conducted with the PMC officials soon after the flooding in Dhanori and Wadgaonsheri. “The administration has assured to take elaborate measures. We will be monitoring the plans and execution of work,” Tingre said. Suresh Jadhav, a Vishrantwadi resident, said that the residents faced hardships during monsoon. “Water was accumulated at many spots. The water channels were not cleaned. The administration should upgrade the infrastructure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-eyes-stormwater-lines-culverts-to-check-flooding/articleshow/87823391.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Surat||Gujarat: Missing page of rape victim’s diary found||SURAT: The investigation into the alleged gang-rape of an 18-year-old girl gathered pace after police recovered one of the missing pages of the victim’s diary. The girl was gang-raped on November 2 in Vadodara. Later, her body was found hanging inside a coach of the Gujarat Queen Express in Valsad November 4. The police found a photo of one of the pages of the diary from the mobile phone of a woman employee of the Vadodara-based institute where the victim was working as an intern. The mobile phone of the employee along with that of her few colleagues, the victim’s roommates and her brother were sent for forensic investigation by the cops. In her diary, which was earlier recovered by the cops, the victim had mentioned that she was sexually assaulted by an autorickshaw driver and his aide at the Vaccine Institute Ground in Vadodara. But some pages of the diary were mysteriously missing. During the initial investigation it came to fore that the mentor of the institute had sent images of a few pages of the victim’s diary to her seniors. Sources said that during questioning, the mentor told the cops that many of the staff members were on a trip to Jammu & Kashmir during the period when the rape incident happened. After being informed by the mentor, the senior officials of the institute asked her to send photos of diary pages and injuries suffered by the victim. The mentor sent the photos to one of the female employees who in turn forwarded them to the seniors. The photos were later deleted as instructed by the seniors, the mentor said. Police immediately called the other woman employee and found a picture of one of the torn diary pages in her mobile, sources said. The employee’s mobile phone was seized by the cops. Also, police also came to know that the institute allows only one mobile phone for a group of four girls. The mobile phone which the victim shared with her roommates was also seized. Investigation also revealed that the victim didn’t use a mobile phone. She had borrowed her brother’s phone when she left her home saying she was going to Maroli. Meanwhile, police are again questioning 54 autorickshaw drivers whose mobile location was in the same area when the incident of rape happened. Police are also questioning people like milkmen, vegetable vendors and others who operate in the area where the victim was living in Vadodara.

---||Nagpur||Government approves ‘in-house’ teacher transfers||NAGPUR: The state government has permitted transfer of teachers within schools belonging to the same trust, which has come as a huge relief for many academics. The reason this particular decision is being welcomed is because it allows transfer of teachers from ‘unaided’ sections to ‘aided’ sections. In the latter, salary is paid by the state government which offers not only stability but also a much higher pay scale. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA) said, “If there is a vacancy in the aided section of a school, then no need to hire teachers from outside. Schools can shift their existing staff from unaided section here.” This will be a big bonus for the teachers working in private unaided schools. Gavhankar said, “Pay scale in unaided section is very low in majority of the schools, and that’s directly connected to fee collection. So for a teacher moving to aided section will be a big jump in salary, plus the guarantee which comes with a government job.” Earlier there were speculations that a reverse order, shifting from unaided to aided will be permitted to save excess teachers from being shunted out to far flung places in the state. Since state government pays salaries, it has fixed a basic pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) that dictates how many teachers can be hired by a school. In vernacular medium schools the student enrollment is dropping as parents now prefer English schooling, which over a period of time has led to the PTR getting breached. Gavhankar said, “So now we have a situation where there are no students to teach, and hence teachers get categorized as excess.” Once marked as excess, the teacher is liable to be transferred anywhere in Maharashtra where vacancy opens up. Teachers obviously protest this move and school owners were trying to transfer teachers within their own set ups. “But if they move to unaided section, who will pay their salaries,” said Gavhankar. “So it was impossible to implement such a scheme, regardless of the demand being made,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/government-approves-in-house-teacher-transfers/articleshow/87823860.cms||---

Ballari is one of the worst-hit districts due to heavy rain in the last five days. Farmers, who were preparing to harvest their crops, are distraught seeing them damaged due to the downpour. They were expecting better yield this year, but unseasonal rain has washed away standing crops grown on hundreds of hectares in the district. According to sources in the district administration and the agricultural department, paddy and chilli, which are major crops in the district, have been damaged. Paddy grown on 11,030 hectares in the district, including 4,538 hectares in Siruguppa, and 2,893 hectares in Kampli, have been damaged. The other crops to have been lost: chilli grown on 4,758 hectares, Bengal gram grown on 1,205 hectares, and cotton grown on 50 hectares. The district has received a maximum rainfall against its normal rainfall between November 7 and 20. Ballari taluk has received 107.3mm rain (as against 5.4mm normal rainfall), Kampali has received 179.9mm (against 9mm normal rainfall), Sandur has received 124.4mm and Kurugodu taluks received 104.4mm rainfall (200% above their normal rainfall). In the last two days, 100 houses were partially damaged, causing a loss of Rs 24.75 lakh. Of them, 32 were in Ballari taluk, and 33 in Sandur. Mallikarjun, joint director of the agriculture department (Ballari), told STOI that a majority of the standing crops have been extensively damaged in the last six days following unseasonal rain. “Standing crops grown on 12,000 hectares, including paddy and jowar, have been damaged. Horticulture crops grown on 4,802 hectares, including chilli, have been damaged. As per a preliminary report, agriculture crops worth Rs 15 crore and horticulture crops worth Rs 6.5 crore have been destroyed,” he said.

Punjabi singer Kanwar Grewal, who reached the Singhu border on Saturday, said his team will keep tabs on the camp. He said: "Now when the farmers have humbled the Narendra Modi government, someone might try to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the march to discredit them. The farmers should be watchful till they get the repeal document in written." Kanwar Grewal also sang ‘Hun faslan de faisle kisan karuga’ (now the farmer will decide on the crops) from the stage to invoke the spirit of unity. The celebrations on the site continued for the second consecutive day. The SKM coordinators were congratulating the fellow farmers who had stayed with them till the end "despite conspiracies and diverting tactics". They released a giant balloon over the Singhu border as a mark of victory. It was marked ‘Nirbhau (without fear)’ and ‘Nirvair (without enmity), words taken from the Sikh prayer of Japji Sahib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/keep-tractor-march-disciplined-skm/articleshow/87823872.cms||---

With the inauguration of these facilities, now eight police stations in the city are “child-friendly”. The facility was started at Kothrud, Warje, Uttamnagar, Sinhagad Road, Dattawadi, and Alankar police stations on Saturday. Gupta said, “Many times children accompany their parents to the police stations and in tense situations. They either accompany their parents or sit outside the police station. They face troubles while alone on the police station premises. To avert this, such facilities are required.” “Also, police will work on the complaints of the children using the facility, and will solve them with due diligence”, Gupta said. About a year ago, the city police started the first “child-friendly” police unit on the premises of the Cantonment police station. According to police, child-friendly rooms have colourful walls depicting cartoons, trees and artworks. They have toys, cartoon books, television sets and other facilities for children. Police are also taking the help of child counsellors to address the problems faced by children. Gupta said, “Such units will be started at all police stations in the next few months.” Joint CP Ravindra Shisve, additional commissioner Rajendra Dahale and deputy police commissioner (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad were, among others, present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/play-facilities-for-kids-inaugurated-at-six-more-police-stations-in-city/articleshow/87823383.cms||---

Addressing a gathering of Sikhs in Jammu region on the occasion of Gurpurab, Sinha said that matters would be clearer in three to four days and "I would be able to discuss more on the issue (sic)". The L-G has already ordered a magisterial probe into the Hydepora encounter in which four people, including the owner of the building where the incident took place, Altaf Ahmad Bhat, and Dr Mudasir Gul were killed. Both were residents of Srinagar. While the police maintains that Altaf Bhat was killed in the crossfire, it says Gul was an OGW operating with Pakistani TRF terrorist Haidar, alias Bilal, killed along with the terrorist’s local associate, Amir Ahmed of Banihal. The bodies of Altaf and Gul were first buried by the police at Handwara. After protests by the families of the slain men and a public and political outcry, the bodies were exhumed and handed over to the families on Thursday evening. The two slain terrorists remain buried in Handwara, Kupwara district. The probe ordered by the L-G is being conducted by the ADC, Srinagar, who has already issued a notice inviting witnesses for recording of statements. The L-G has promised the probe will be conducted in a time-bound manner. The family of Amir Ahmed of Banihal has also demanded the return of his son who, they say, was an office boy at Gul’s office and not a terrorist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hyderpora-encounter-those-found-guilty-wont-be-spared-says-l-g-manoj-sinha/articleshow/87825266.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The SC-approved rule curve in Mullaperiyar dam till Saturday was 141ft. But the water level reached 141.05ft at 5am on Saturday after which TN opened one more shutter, besides the one opened earlier, and raised the shutter to 30cm at 6am. Despite opening one more spillway shutter the water level rose to 141.10 ft. The new rule curve of 142ft in Mullaperiyar will be applicable from Sunday till November 30. One shutter of Mullaperiyar dam was closed at 10pm on Saturday. “The rule curve was prepared by TN but they failed to maintain it. Basically, the rule curve aims to prevent chances of flooding. The Idukki dam has more than enough space. But KSEB opened the shutters early to strictly ensure that the water level did not reach central water commission (CWC)-fixed rule level. We don’t consider the water release as a loss since it was a precaution to avoid flooding,” said a KSEB source. “While fixing the rule curve in Mullaperiyar, Kerala demanded it to be at 137ft so that water level does not rise to 142ft in case of excessive rains, thus avoiding sudden opening of the dam shutters. But TN did not consider i,” said another official. Meanwhile, more water was released from Idukki reservoir on Saturday following heavy rainfall since Friday. Shutter three of Cheruthoni dam that was raised to 40cm on Thursday was further raised to 80cm on Saturday at 10am to release around 80cumecs of water, and it was closed at 10:15pm. The water level reached 2,399.82 ft at 5am. The upper rule level is 2,400.03ft till Saturday. After the release of more water, the water level at Idukki reservoir continued to rise and reached 2,400ft at 3pm. Idukki reservoir had storage of 96.41% at 5pm and its full reservoir level is 2,403ft. As per the rule curve fixed by CWC, from Sunday, the orange alert level will be 2,401ft, red alert level will be 2,402ft and upper rule level will be 2,403ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tn-fails-to-maintain-rule-curve-at-mullaperiyar/articleshow/87823403.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The girl reportedly had an argument with her father on Thursday night, after which her mobile was taken away. In a similar incident reported from Garbeta in West Midnapore, a Class-XII student, died by suicide after reportedly being scolded by her parents for being on her mobile for a long time. They had asked her to keep the mobile phone switched off, but she refused. On Saturday, the girl set herself on fire at her residence in Garbeta. The Behala youngster had been given her mobile for her online classes a couple of years ago. She would stay up late at night and chat with her friends, neglecting her studies, the police said. “It is too early to comment on the exact reason for suicide. But, prima facie, the Thursday evening argument seems to have played a major role,” said an officer. According to Parnasree Police, it was around 3 pm on Friday that they received an information from Vidyasagar Hospital police outpost that the victim has been brought dead. The girl was a student of Class XI at a reputable Bengali medium school in Behala. During inquiry no suicide note was found from the spot and no complaint has yet been received. “An inquest and post mortem will be done,” said an officer from Parnasree Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/denied-mobile-2-students-end-lives/articleshow/87823396.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In 11 years, BMC gave nod to cut 39,000 trees, reveals RTI reply to BJP MLA Ameet Satam||MUMBAI: In 11 years, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gave permission for cutting 38,899 trees and transplanting 36,117. Maximum tree cutting permissions were granted to private parties — 21,253. Data procured by Andheri MLA Ameet Satam from the BMC’s garden department showed that during the period between February 2010 and July 2021, the BMC’s tree authority gave private players permission to cut 21,253 trees and to transplant 17,964 while BMC was given permission to cut 8,843 trees and to transplant 10,075. Other government authorities like the MMRDA, Metro, railways and Mhada were given permissionx to cut 8,803 trees and to transplant 8,078. Satam, in a direct attack on state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, said that on one hand, the Shiv Sena stalled the Mumbai Metro Line 3 project car shed by vehemently opposing the cutting of over 2,000 trees at Aarey Colony, but on the other hand, the same party-ruled tree authority gave permission for cutting 38,899 trees. “I had sought details via Right To Information (RTI) Act in January this year, seeking permissions granted since 1997 for tree-cutting and transplanting. However, the authorities kept delaying giving me the information,” said Satam. The legislator added, “I have written a letter to the state environment minister as I fail to understand how around 21,000 tree cutting permissions can be given to private parties in Mumbai while the Metro car shed depot -- which is meant for a project that is meant to ease travel in the city has been stalled in the name of around 2,000 trees,” said Satam. Activist Zoru Bhathena pointed out the data shows that not enough number of trees have been planted for those that have been cut. “There are two trees to be planted for every tree cut. However, data clearly shows that not enough are planted as compensation for it. Besides, transplanted trees also have a very low survival rate and no one monitors if these survive well or not after they are transplanted,” said Bhathena The activist added that the tree authority has corporators from across political party lines, including the Bharaitya Janata Party and this shows that no one has raised enough opposition to the tree-cutting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-11-yrs-bmcs-nod-to-cut-39k-trees-rti-reply-to-bjp-mla/articleshow/87824874.cms||Richa Pinto

The officials close to development said that experts from different departments have been roped in to ascertain the shipment. Other agencies were also appraised of the find as the origin and the destination of the cargo is under scanner. “Senior officials from agencies including DRI and customs visited the port on Saturday. The substance is yet to be verified as proper equipment is required for the investigation. Forensic science experts and agencies working with atomic energy have been roped in to assess whether the cargo was within legal limits,” said a senior official. DRI did not issue any official communique on the seizure on Saturday. Adani Group on Friday had issued a statement outlining the details of the seizure. ‘The seized containers were not destined for Mundra Port as well as any other port in India. These hazardous cargo containers were en route from Karachi in Pakistan to Shanghai in China,’ mentioned a tweet by the group that handles the port. The authorities had them offloaded at Mundra for further inspection. The authorities had pointed that the cargo was listed as non-hazardous, but the seized containers had Hazard Class 7 markings (which indicate radioactive substances). Due to sensitive nature of the operation, the multi-agency team is likely to be formed to probe any local connections, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mundra-radioactive-haul-yet-to-be-verified/articleshow/87823397.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Don’t take girl child’s life, hand her to govt: West Bengal minister||KOLKATA: State minister for woman and child development and social welfare Sashi Panja on Saturday made an impassioned appeal to families to desist from making gender discrimination and against children and to hand a girl child over to the government instead of taking her life if they could not take care of her. “Please do not kill a defenceless child because it is a girl and not a boy. Any child that is born has a right to life and family. There are many couples who are keen to adopt and these children will get foster homes,” Panja said on the occasion of International Child Rights Day. She was addressing members of NGOs and cops engaged in child protection and anti-trafficking movement at an event organised by West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights. Several kids were felicitated at the programme for their contribution to society. “Parents also abandon children with special needs. It is difficult to find foster homes in India for them because our consciousness has still not developed to embrace them. Please hand them over to state agencies so that the child is not harmed,” said Panja. There are currently over 4,000 children in the 19 state-run and 520 NGO-run homes. Around 2,000 children are those with special needs. Among the children are also those who have run away from their homes, victims of trafficking and abuse, orphans and children who are abandoned or surrendered by their biological parents. Panja also highlighted the issue of child labour and child marriage, pointing out how parents often cited there were too many mouths to feed as an excuse for both. “The Kanyashree project in the state has empowered girls and made them agents of change,” she said. Emphasising on the need to listen to children’s voices, both by parents at home and teachers at school, the minister pointed out that governments often tended to ignore them as well since they were not a vote bank. “The Bengal government is committed to hearing what they have to say and how they want to shape their future,” Panja added. WBCPCR chairperson Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti said the commission recognised the role of each stakeholder — NGOs, police and media — in upholding children’s rights and hoped they would continue to work in tandem to secure children’s future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-take-girl-childs-life-hand-her-to-govt-minister/articleshow/87823404.cms||Subhro Niyogi

We have requested them to increase the numbers. Before the strike, called by the drivers and conductors of the corporation, around 800-900 MSRTC buses plied from Pune on 770 routes every day across the state. Now, private buses are plying on 150 to 200 routes only. There are no buses for around 600 to 650 routes,” an MSRTC official told TOI. The Pune division of MSRTC has incurred Rs 15 crore losses so far because of the strike, another official said, adding that private buses had their own route limitations. “Most of the private buses are either luxury or semi-luxury air-conditioned buses and they don’t ply to remote villages in different districts like our Lal Pari or Hirkani buses do. Moreover, many private buses have been off road for months because of the pandemic and without maintenance. To make them operational, the private transporters need to spend money on basic maintenance. Also because of the pandemic, many buses have lapses in insurance and road tax,” the official said. Private bus operators said though their buses were plying to all major districts from Pune, operating in small towns and villages was difficult. “We are plying on routes in which our buses have been plying earlier. Kolhapur, Solapur, Nashik, Nagpur and Nanded are some ,” a private operator said. Baba Shinde, the president of Maharashtra State Goods and Passenger Transport Association, said their route network was limited. “We are not on a par with the MSRTC network. We shall run buses to places from where we can earn profit. If a bus is going to Kolhapur, we expect it to return to Pune in full capacity. We are in touch with the MSRTC depot managers in different districts, and will increase and decrease the number of buses based on the passenger load. At present, around 150 to 200 buses are running from MSRTC depots in Pune and 900 buses having all-India permit are plying from other termini,” Shinde said. Driver ends life; cops stop protesting staffers Gahininath Ambadas Gaikwad, an MSRTC driver and resident of Peth, allegedly ended his life on Friday evening. The police have registered a case of accidental death and said they have not found any suicide note. In Manmad town, 21 MSRTC employees, who were about to board the Panchavati Express to reach the Azad Nagar Maidan for an agitation, were allegedly stopped by the local police. “None of them were detained for any reason, but they decided to return home,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/st-strike-leaves-85-routes-off-limits-for-commuters/articleshow/87823405.cms||Joy Sengupta

The party has invited recommendations from senior leaders and the names will be shortlisted by party national spokesperson Sambit Patra. At present, the party has 20 media panellists, mostly based in Jaipur.The idea of having more panellists was coined by BJP state in-charge Arun Singh, based on the feedback that failures of the Gehlot government are not being raised properly in the media during his last visit. The party is soon going full throttle on all media platforms highlighting the failures of the government at all levels as elections are just two years away.Party officials said that present panellists have been engaged with the state and national media while the party doesn’t have proper faces for regional and local media. “The media houses, Facebook pages and Youtube channels run at the regional and local level have the higher presence and hold larger credibility in the people. Any local person stating the facts at local level finds more connect then the same facts delivered at the state level,” said a party source. The shortlist panellist will receive training in workshops before they hit the tv studios also training on the use of social media. This will also be an opportunity for the party to strike a balance among the state-level leaders by giving space to their representatives. The saffron party has proposed its biggest series starting from November till December from block level to district and division to state level against deteriorating law and order, unfulfilled promises, other issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-bjp-set-to-double-its-media-panellists/articleshow/87824601.cms||---

The departments were asked to submit project details and deadline for their completion by the month-end. Sources said that the move was aimed at speeding up projects delayed due to the Covid pandemic. As the MC poll process will be completed by December-end, the UT administration and municipal corporation will start working on new projects in January. Recently, the UT engineering department and others submitted a progress report of ongoing projects to the UT adviser, who convened department-wise meetings of department heads. The UT finance department is also keeping a check on budgetary allocation for projects to carry out timely work on important projects, ensure timely completion and preparation of estimates for the next budget. This was done in view of a dip in revenue collection. A senior UT official said that though there was a dip in Covid cases in Chandigarh, the focus of the UT administration would be on the health sector in 2022. Recently, the UT administration had directed the health department to accelerate vaccination to cover the maximum population as soon as possible for the second dose. The Centre had also asked the UT administration to strengthen medical infrastructure and accelerate the pace of vaccination.

---||Pune||‘Need to inculcate research in medicos right from UG’||Pune: There is a need to move away from the aim of mass-producing doctors to a country that pioneers in medical research. Covid 19 has taught the country the need to collaborate medical education, medical research and public health all into one, in order to find solutions. A curious and questioning mind and an ability to do research need to be inculcated among the students of medicine, said Lt Gen Dr Madhuri Kanitkar, vice-chancellor of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, in the seminar on Physician-Scientist held at Symbiosis Medical College for Women on Saturday. Raman Gangakhedkar, who is a member of an expert group constituted by the World Health Organisation that will examine the origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens of epidemic and pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, talked about his journey about beginning his research in the medical field. Talking about the importance of research and publishing research papers, Gangakhedkar said, “I used to be in Gadikhana clinic when HIV was at its peak. Sex workers had a 50-60% HIV prevalence rate in Pune. We looked at the data and found that among women patients, there was a 14% HIV prevalence in married monogamous women with no risk behaviour. So, I wrote a research paper on this. That small contribution was used by UNAIDS advocacy towards women-centric preventive measures and interventions, which I used for advocacy of the EMTCT (elimination of mother-to-child transmission) program. I used this part to initiate a free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program. This was the first chronic infection, where the treatment had to be given for lifelong.” Rajiv Yeravdekar, dean, faculty of health sciences, Symbiosis International (deemed to be university), said, “While the concept of Physician-Scientist is fairly well established in advanced countries, in India, the concept of research in medical academia has many lacunae. Symbiosis is aiming to give a fillip to mainstream research amongst the medical academic fraternity by collaborative arrangements with other scientific organizations who have been conferred the status of “Institutes of Eminence” by the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/need-to-inculcate-research-in-medicos-right-from-ug/articleshow/87823416.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These include 85 in Kerala and one each in Mahe and Amini (Lakshadweep) before the next monsoon. “All the 87 instruments will reach the regional office shortly. This is part of a project to install 400 AWS across the country. We expect all the AWS to be operational by the next monsoon season in 2022,” said K Santhosh, regional director, Thiruvananthapuram. He said that all the sites for the project in Kerala region have been identified. Explaining the working of AWS, he said that it will give observations only and cannot be used as a forecasting system. It gives details like current situation of weather parameters like wind, temperature, atmospheric pressure and rainfall. The advantage is that IMD would get this information every 15 minutes and the public can get the data on the web through their mobiles, he added. After the 2018 floods, the state government had put in a request for more monitoring stations in the state due to the changing weather patterns. IMD informed that 100 AWS would be installed as part of the weather monitoring expansion plans. A total of 15 have already been installed. Around 138 sites were identified by the Kerala state disaster management authority with the help of other departments including revenue, irrigation and KSEB. Due to Covid, site visits by experts were delayed as the entire process was scheduled to be finished by Dec 2020. In October 2018, the government had written to the ministry of home affairs on the inadequacy of IMD stations as it gathers rain data from just 68 stations. The state said that it has been demanding one more Doppler radar at Kozhikode/Wayanad district boundary. The letter also put forth a demand for cyclone warning dissemination systems (CWDS) to be set up in fish-landing centres in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-to-set-up-more-weather-stations/articleshow/87823428.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

MS Sirsa lodged a complaint to the additional commissioner of police (ACP), West Mumbai, and Cyber Crime Cell at New Delhi and sent its copy to Rakesh Asthana, commissioner of police, police headquarters, New Delhi. Sirsa said Kangana deliberately portrayed the farmers’ protest as Khalistani Movement and dubbed the Sikh community as Khalistani terrorists and recalling the massacre and genocide that happened during the period of 1984, and earlier, as a planned and calculated move on part of (former Prime Minister) Indira Gandhi Sirsa said, “Kangana used very derogatory and insulting language against the Sikh community, as much as, she has said they were crushed under her (Indira Gandhi) shoes (jooti)“, calling it most degrading, disrespectful and contemptuous. In his complaint, Sirsa shared the objectionable post of Kangana Ranaut made in stories on Saturday, that reads, “Khalistani terrorists may be arm twisting the government today....But let’s not forget the women prime minister (Indira Gandhi) ne inn ko apni jooti ke neeche crush kiya tha...No matter how much suffering she caused to this nation...she crushed them like mosquitoes at the cost of her own life...Lekin desh ke tukde nahi hone diye...even after decades of her death ...aaj bhi uske naam se kampte hain yeh...inko vaisa hi guru chahiye....” Sirsa stated that in her past too Kangana has made such posts on social media, “which clearly indicates her hidden agenda to provoke Sikh community and malign them. Her personal hate against Sikhs has been evident earlier too. Now when the farm laws are repealed, she is bringing back 1984 reference to provoke Sikhs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dsgmc-leader-lodges-complaint-against-kangana-for-objectionable-remarks-against-sikhs/articleshow/87823916.cms||---

Clearing the air on anti-defection laws, Birla said that a strict law is in process. "A committee has been formed to make the anti-defection law more powerful. It is consulting with the state assemblies. However, a consensus has not been reached on the same," said Birla.He further added they are working to devise a method that would identify and evaluate the officers/employees for innovating and promoting the work of assemblies. He called for an immediate response to the questions being asked at state assemblies, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. "Questions here shouldn’t go without answers. It will increase the accountability and also keep the government under the pressure to perform," said Birla at a private hotel.He refused to comment on the repeal of the farm laws but said that it is the prerogative of the government to bring laws and repeal them.

Following complaints of child torture at the home and illegal adoption from there, the Howrah city police on Friday night conducted a raid on the institute. During the raid, several children were rescued and the 10 people, who were arrested later, were interrogated, police said. A WBCS officer was also questioned. While three of them were sent to police custody, seven, including Adhikari’s daughter-in-law, were remanded in judicial custody by the Howrah court. According to police, the home, which has been in operation for the past 10 years, has created a network with adoption agents and NGOs working in rural areas. The organization helped needy children with clothes and food but unauthorized activities might be going on in the background, police said. Cops are investigating if the home accepted payment for illegally facilitating adoption. They are also asking the WBCS officer whether he was privy to any of the unauthorized activities. Adhikari could not be contacted as her phone was switched off. “A team has been formed to probe the matter. They found several discrepancies, following which the arrested were made. A case is filed under POCSO Act,” said an officer from the Howrah Police. He said they were finding out whether the NGO had links with inter-state child-trafficking gangs or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trafficking-plaint-at-home-for-kids-10-held/articleshow/87823417.cms||Rupak Banerjee

A delegation led by BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha met municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, submitting a written demand for suspension of the tender process pending an inquiry. At a press conference at BJP state headquarters, Kotecha said the civic administration was in cahoots with the ruling Shiv Sena in rigging the tender process for the trenches contract. “On October 28, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra had informed the commissioner that a meeting was being planned by some contractors to form a cartel, and along with Sena and contractors alter the terms and conditions of the tender. On November 17, he sent a second letter warning of a possible scam in the process, including manipulation of rates. On November 18, when the tender was floated, Mishra’s allegations were proved true,” he said. Kotecha said when the tender was first published in August, five contractors submitted bids for Rs 380 crore and on November 18 the tender for Rs 569 crore was published. “In three months, cost increased substantially,” he said. Mishra said BMC must file an FIR against the contractors for fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-steps-up-demand-for-trenches-contract-probe/articleshow/87824898.cms||---

As November 21 is marked as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, the statistics by the city police give a snapshot of the casualties due to RTAs. The statistics revealed that out of the fatalities, 67 or 22% were below 25 years of age, the same percentage as the injury victims. While monthly fatalities of 30 are slightly higher than 28 in 2020, it’s still lower than 36 in 2019, reveal the analysis. Sanjay Srivastava, city police commissioner, in an event organized by the Ahmedabad Traffic Consultative Committee (ATCC) on Friday, said that the city police are determined to reduce the fatalities and make the city roads safer through initiative involving citizens. “The incentive to Good Samaritans announced recently would surely motivate citizens to take the RTA victims to hospitals and save lives. Along with Engineering, Education and Enforcement, the fourth E of emergency is also now part of making the roads safer,” he said. Dr Pravin Kanabar, president of ATCC, said that the motivation of observing the day annually to ensure that the fatalities are reduced gradually through concrete steps where all stakeholders including road users, enforcement agencies, infrastructure providers and planners look at safety aspects. The speakers at the event also included urban planners and road safety analysts. Analysis by an agency revealed that the pedestrians and two-wheeler users accounted for 56% of the total fatalities in the past five years. The experts suggested that removal of blind spots both on the crossroads and on major roads can be an important step along with improving the road signs and markings. The analysis mentioned that about 28% of the accidents had taken place due to improper infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-death-on-city-roads-every-day-this-year/articleshow/87823421.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Goa||Poor infra, potholed roads mark industrial estates: Industries body||PANAJI: The government continues its step motherly treatment towards the state’s industrial sector with infrastructure, particularly roads, being left in a bad state, said Goa State Industries Association (GSIA).  Virtually poking holes into the state’s ambitions to become a logistics hub for the western sector, GSIA said that roads in most of the industrial estates are in pathetic conditions. GSIA president Damodar Kochkar also criticised the government for repeatedly asking for funds from the private sector while making no attempt to address the concerns of the industry. “They need us only when they want funds or some CSR. The condition of the roads even in the prime industrial estate is very bad,” said Kochkar. “The industry, which is the highest contributor to the state’s GDP, has been completely neglected by the government.” Chief minister Pramod Sawant had directed the PWD to repair all national highways, state highways and major district roads by November 1. However, roads in industrial estates were not repaired. “The government, which had made a budgetary provision of Rs 10 crore for improving the infrastructure in industrial estates, should at least release some funds to the Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) for up-keep of the industrial estates,” Kochkar said. Kochkar, who is a member on GIDC’s board, said that the government-run corporation is bankrupt and unable to pay salaries and develop infrastructure. GSIA has demanded an investigation into GIDC’s fund utilisation and the tenders for infrastructure works. “GIDC is harassing the industries at every possible opportunity to extract money to pay their salaries and other administrative costs. Exorbitant fees are charged to issue construction licences. For extension of construction licence, three times of the fees are charged, which works out to more than erecting a simple industrial shed. Further, if the implementation of the project is delayed for any reason beyond three years, lakhs of rupees are charged as penalty to grant extension,” Kochkar added. He also demanded that a contract to digitise GIDC should be given to a reputed private firm so that the work can be completed in a short time frame and at a reasonable cost. “For the last four years, Goa Electronics Ltd has been struggling to digitise Goa-IDC services,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poor-infra-potholed-roads-mark-industrial-estates-industries-body/articleshow/87823949.cms||---

The youth, Saurav Kumar Munda, who is from the city, is among the first few from his tribe in Jharkhand to make the cut in Film and Television Institute of India, (FTII) Pune, but financial crunch threatened to curtail his ambition. In September, Munda began a crowdfunding drive on social media to raise the funds required for his dream course. After TOI highlighted his cause on September 30, the state government took cognizance of his plight and officials from the state IPRD department’s film division contacted him, promising help. Munda, who managed to collect about Rs 1 lakh through crowdfunding, has decided to return the money to the donors after the state stepped in to fulfil his dream. He said, “I am happy that the government promised me to fund my entire studies at the FTII after my story was published in TOI. I thank everyone who stood by me.” A postgraduate in journalism and mass communication from Gossner College and gold medallist from the Ranchi University’s 2018-20 batch, Munda said his application for the scholarship has been approved by the IPRD department. He is now waiting for the funds to be sent to his institute. Rashid Akthar, assistant director and nodal officer of the state IPRD’s film division, said, “As per the state’s film policy, there is a provision to fund students who get through to institutes like FTII. So, when we learnt about Munda’s case, we contacted him. The government has approved his application and the funds will soon be released. This year, we are giving financial assistance under the state’s film policy to nine students.” Munda said he has paid an initial admission fee of Rs 35,000 and requires another Rs 3.54 lakh for the entire course. Youngest of three siblings, Munda is also a hotel management graduate from BIT Mesra. He said his father is a retired teacher and in his 60s. His elder brother works as a teacher at Chaibasa in West Singhbhum district and his sister is married. City-based ace documentary filmmaker Shri Prakash, who also teaches in St Xavier’s College, was one of the few who helped Munda craft his crowdfunding campaign. “It’s a welcome move by the government. A tribal student like him needs proper support as his success will inspire many more from his and other marginalised communities to walk into the field of filmmaking,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-steps-in-to-fund-tribal-youths-ftii-dream/articleshow/87823304.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The IMD in its forecast on Saturday has said that there would be a further rise in night temperature in the next four days by around 3 to 4 notches. “During the next two to three days, there would be morning fog, followed by cloud cover during the daytime, resulting in the rise of night temperature. Once the cloud cover subsides, night temperature is expected to fall by 4-5 notches all over the state,” the bulletin read. As per IMD’s bulletin, Ranchi on Friday night recorded 15.2°C as minimum and 28.6°C as maximum temperature, both of which were 2.1 notches and 2.5 notches above the normal range, respectively. Jamshedpur remained the warmest in the state by recording 31°C, which was 1.7 notches above normal while the night temperature was 18°C, 2.4 notches above normal. The deviation was much more pronounced in Chaibasa where the day-time temperature, which was at 30.8°C, was 2.9 notches above the normal range and the night temperature, which was at 19.2°C, was 3.4 notches above normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cloud-cover-to-push-up-mercury-in-next-4-days/articleshow/87823254.cms||---

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management ( Dipam) has invited bids on the MSTC portal for six properties of BSNL and MTNL, kick-starting the non-core asset monetisation of the two struggling telecom PSUs. The two companies, which have failed to show any credible turnaround despite being given a massive Rs 70,000-crore revival package some time back, own massive land assets across the country worth thousands of crores. The government will, however, start the sale process of some of these assets in a phased manner. There is the issue of land use that may put restrictions on utilising the land for non-telecom purposes. Apart from land bank, the government had previously also discussed monetising the tower assets of BSNL and MTNL, though not much headway seems to have been made. The Centre unveiled a Rs 6 lakh crore asset monetisation plan over the next four years. Assets which have been identified include roads, power transmission and generation, gas pipelines, warehousing, railways, telecom, 25 airports, 31 projects in nine major ports, coal and mineral mining, sports stadia, redevelopment of colonies. Only brownfield assets will be considered; land has been left out. The top five sectors include: roads (27%), followed by railways (25%), power (15%), oil & gas pipelines (8%) and telecom (6%). Roads and railways together account for 52% of a total NMP value, according to the government data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-calls-bids-for-six-mtnl-bsnl-properties/articleshow/87825341.cms||Surojit Gupta

---||Goa||Glitches mar inaugural of 52nd Iffi||PANAJI: The opening ceremony of the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) saw many glitches, with invitees complaining of being forced to enter the venue more than an hour before the event could begin. The Iffi inaugural event also saw the festival organisers being accused by mediapersons and delegates of privatising a government event. Invitees pointed to the invite which stated that the event would begin at 3.30pm. The card also asked invitees to come half an hour prior and said seating will be on first-come-first-serve basis. However, delegates said the organisers knew beforehand that the event would begin at 4.30pm and said they spent a torturous one-and-half hour seated in a crowd during the pandemic, waiting for the event to start. Meanwhile, photojournalists put their cameras down on the road outside the Iffi inaugural venue at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium. They were protesting after being denied entry to the ceremony. Organisers told the journalists that the telecast rights were sold to a private channel and so the photojournalists could not be allowed to photograph the Iffi inaugural, even though the mediapersons had valid accreditation cards. “Congress party condemns the act of selling broadcasting rights to a crony company and denying entry to Goan photo journalists to the opening ceremony of Iffi. It is a shame on chief minister Pramod Sawant that the local photo journalists had to protest against the pro-capitalist decision of BJP government,” leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said. The invitees said they entered the venue only to see that till 3pm, final décor touches were still being given by workers. “It is ridiculous that the sponsors were placed so prominently in the décor throughout the inaugural event. Iffi is the Indian government’s prestigious premier film festival. I have been coming to Goa to attend Iffi ever since it came to Goa in 2004. It was much better organised under Manohar Parrikar as the CM. Over the last few years, the festival has lost its sheen and now, to make matters worse, it is being privatised,” said V Subramaniam, a delegate from Kasargod. When the international jury, led by chairperson and Iranian filmmaker Rakhshan Baneitemad, were felicitated at the opening ceremony, they were seen being handed only a Goa-themed curio, meant for tourists. “I drove for several hours to be at Iffi, only for my vehicle to be blocked by others at the opening ceremony venue. There were no proper parking arrangements and I was unable to get out for a couple of hours after the event was over,” said Raghurama N, a delegate from Mangalore, who has been attending Iffi for the last 10 years. The usual red carpet entry of celebrities was also missing at this Iffi inaugural. The heavy rainfall also added to the delegates’ misery. “I thank you all for being present amidst the fury of nature. It is raining heavily outside,” director for Iffi 2021, Chaitanya Prasad said as the opening event came to an end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/glitches-mar-inaugural-of-52nd-iffi/articleshow/87824185.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Discounts to grants, how Haryana's Nuh is giving Covid vaccine a push||NUH: The festive season is over, but it’s still raining discounts and incentives in Nuh. From medicines, even petrol, to development grants, people who have taken their vaccine shots are being offered a slew of benefits. Along with sustained awareness programmes, the Nuh administration has chalked out innovative initiatives to encourage residents to get vaccinated against Covid. Just an hour’s drive from Gurugram, which is inching towards inoculating its entire targeted population, Nuh has had the lowest vaccine coverage among 22 districts in the state. In June, only about 10% of the targeted population in the district had taken their first shot. The door-to-door counselling sessions, coupled with the promises of development funds and discounts, seemed to have helped. As of November 19, about 45% of the residents had taken their first dose. However, the pace of second dose vaccinations is quite slow. Only about 10% of the people in Nuh have been fully vaccinated as of now. On Saturday, the district administration held a mega drive. It managed to inoculate 17,373 people across the district, of whom 15,409 took the first shot. Deputy commissioner Shakti Singh claimed that more than 50% -- and not 45.9% as mentioned in the records -- of the estimated population had taken their first dose. “This is because there are at least 40,000 vaccinations that have been completed but not yet uploaded. If they are added, we will cross the 50% mark in terms of first doses. The number of people who are eligible for vaccination here is 7.5 lakh. We have covered 4.5 lakh so far, which is more than half,” Singh added. In absolute numbers, there is a lot to be covered still. Of 435 villages in Nuh, eligible residents in only 18 villages have been fully vaccinated. But this came after a tough battle against hesitancy and rumours that the vaccine may have side effects. Even before the administration announced the discounts, Asha and ANM workers toured these 18 villages and went to each and every household to raise awareness. Reaching the villages wasn't easy – there was hardly any transport. So, the health department arranged for 44 vehicles to ferry the Asha and ANM workers. “We selected 50 villages with the lowest vaccination rate and 50 with the highest. Those who were hesitating to take the vaccine were told about those who had taken both their shots. Each ANM worker was given two villages to raise awareness,” the DC said. “We have given aprons to the Asha and ANM workers so that it instills confidence in them and they feel proud to do the work. Every day, I identify the top five vaccinators and those who are yet to catch up. I speak to both,” Singh said. It was also decided to involve priests and maulvis in the awareness drive. Slowly, the teams were able to wipe out the hesitancy in some of the villages. “We have a long way to go,” an official said. The administration has also promised a development grant of Rs 10 lakh each to the first 10 villages where the entire targeted population have taken both doses. The administration has collaborated with the Nuh chemist association, which has asked pharmacists to offer a 5% discount on medicines to those who have taken their first shot and 10% to those who have been jabbed twice. The chemist association’s appeal found a response. More than 300 medicine stores are offering discounts now. “We pasted posters outside each shop, promising rebates. A person has to show the vaccine certificate and the discount would be offered,” said Tej Pal, who heads the chemist association. But what has also worked, officials feel, is a 50p cut on every litre of petrol to those who have taken at least one shot. Rising fuel prices had become a cause for concern across the country. “These decisions were taken at the sub-decision level. “Earlier, it was only the health department that was involved in motivating the villagers. Then, the administration joined. We made village-level committees and village heads were made part of these committees. It is easier to convince the villagers this way,” said Surender Kumar Yadav, the chief medical officer. The administration is also drawing up a list of people with disabilities. Such people would be vaccinated at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/discounts-to-grants-how-this-hry-district-with-lowest-vax-rate-is-pushing-up-coverage/articleshow/87824499.cms||Sagrika Kissu

He said GFP was confident that Kandolkar and his wife Kavita could have contested the 2022 assembly elections from Aldona and Tivim as part of the alliance agreement. “Kiran Kandolkar’s resignation from the party is shocking and it was unexpected,” said Sardesai. Despite the sudden move by Kandolkar to ditch GFP, Sardesai said he understood the motives behind the exit. “He seems to be having doubts about whether he would be getting a ticket in a possible alliance that we may have in the future. I have given him respect in our party and I was confident that I would give him what he wanted,” said Sardesai. The GFP chief said that changing political allegiances are expected ahead of the elections, especially when new political parties enter the fray. “He must have given it due thought and it was quite possible that he had doubts about whether he would get the ticket for his wife and himself in a possible alliance. I am quite confident that winnable candidates would not be denied tickets in the alliance,” said Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kandolkars-exit-an-unexpected-setback-admits-gfp-president/articleshow/87824221.cms||---

For the last eight months we have been trying for an alliance. If Congress wants to go alone, it’s their decision.” Though he didn’t spell out his options, Alemao was effusive in his praise for Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee. “Mamata is like me, a firebrand fighter. Didi is a big political force to reckon with,” the MLA said. Alemao also opined in favour of an alliance of Congress, NCP and TMC to take on the might of BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-no-cong-ncp-alliance-i-will-take-my-own-decision/articleshow/87824268.cms||---
---||Goa||Rain sweeps across Goa from Karnataka||PANAJI: Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely to continue over Goa till Monday as the combined impact of a trough from the Arabian Sea and the remnant of a low pressure system over south interior Karnataka will take some time to wear off. “The rain is due to a trough from a well-marked low pressure area which initially formed as a low pressure area in the Arabian Sea and remnant circulatio of a low pressure area over south interior Karnataka,” Rahul M, scientist, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji said. The system over Karnataka is remnant of the depression that had crossed near Chennai on Friday. Both systems triggered intense moisture inflow and widespread rainfall over the state during the last 24-hours since Saturday afternoon. Earlier last week IMD had forecast heavy rainfall on the weekend. Quepem received heavy rainfall of 69.4m similar to the monsoon season, while Panaji recorded 19mm, Margao 16.2m, Sanguem 16mm and other centres on a lesser scale. The state average rainfall recorded on Saturday was 16.3mm. Identically another spell on November 6 had yielded 16.3mm. But the wettest 24-hour spell during this month was 26.8mm recorded on November 17. With this continuing offseason rain activity continuing to impact agriculture and other activities, the post-monsoon total has touched 349.6mm. A total of 188.3mm is considered normal at this stage and the surplus has soared to 86%. Thunderstorms during the next two days are likely to be in isolated places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-sweeps-across-state-from-ktaka/articleshow/87824301.cms||---

Overall, Uttar Pradesh improved its ranking by a notch, from seventh in 2020 to sixth this year.  State urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon, mayors and officials of 18 cities from UP received their awards in various categories from President Ram Nath Kovind at the Swachh Amrit Mahotsav-2021 organised in New Delhi on Saturday.  Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has congratulated the people of UP for an improved performance of the state. “The swachhta campaign being run under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed to create a public awareness about the issue. This has largely helped us tackle the Covid-19. The UP government is ensuring an effective implementation of the Swachh Bharat Mission.” While Varanasi was awarded in the category of cities with a population of over 1 lakh, Kannauj also got the ‘Number One Best Ganga Town’ award among cities with a population up to 1 lakh for the second successive year.  Lucknow won the award for ‘Best State Capital In Citizens’ Feedback’. Overall, it secured 12th rank and retained its previous year’s ranking to become top-tanked UP city in population of 10 lakh and above category. Among other seven UP cities in top 30 were Ghaziabad (18th), Kanpur (21st), Agra (24th), Prayagraj (26th), Meerut (27th) and Varanasi (30th).  Three of these — Ghaziabad, Kanpur and Meerut — have improved their rankings while three others -- Varanasi, Prayagraj and Agra have slipped a bit, but have retained their position in the top 30. Last year, six UP cities were in the top 30. This year, the number has risen to seven.  Urban development minister Tandon and additional chief secretary, urban development, Rajnish Dubey, have congratulated the officials and representatives of award-winning municipal bodies for their good work.  While ‘Citizen Feedback’ included public response and satisfaction, ‘Service Level Progress’ encompassed use of technology in providing services to the people, water conservation and sewage treatment and ‘certification’ assessed open defecation free status and garbage collection.  The direct observation parameter which included third party inspection was merged with the service level progress this year.  Among other award-winning UP cities, Meerut won the ‘Fastest Mover Big City’ award in the category of cities with a population of 10 lakh to 40 lakh, while Ghaziabad won the ‘Best Big City In Innovation and Best Practices’ award in the same category.

Though Lucknow remained on 12th rank, its score improved to 4,586 from 4,102 last year. Kanpur also improved its score from 3,783 to 3847 and jumped to rank 21 from 25 last year. Ghaziabad improved its rank by a notch from 19 last year to 18 this time even as its overall score witnessed a decline from 4,283 to 4,220.  The rankings released by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) on Saturday are based on a cleanliness survey done across the country after segregating cities and towns based on their population.  Overall, 4,320 urban local bodies, including cities, towns, municipalities, and cantonments, in various categories were assessed. Of them, two major categories were 372 cities/towns with population between 1-10 lakh, and 48 big cities with 10 lakh or above population.  The Swachh Bharat Survey 2020 had four parameters — Citizen Feedback (1,500 marks), Certification (1,500 marks), Direct Observation (1,500) and Service Level Progress (1,500).  However, this year, the assessment was done on three scales — Citizen Feedback (1,800 marks), Service Level Progress (2,400 marks) and Certification (1,800 marks). Total marks up for grabs were 6,000.  Meerut was the star performer, recording a big jump of 14 rungs — from 41st rank last year to 27 this time — with an aggregate score of 3,598, a substantial increase in comparison to last year.  On the other hand, the biggest drop in ranking among UP cities was recorded by Agra, which slipped from rank 16 last year to 24 this year. Agra’s net score also plunged to 3,715 from 4,391 last year.  Prayagraj also lost six spots from rank 20 last year to 26th this time. Its net score in 2020 was 4,141, which came down to 3,613 this year.  Varanasi, too, slipped three rungs from 27th rank last year to 30th this time, with its score dropping to 3,532 from 3,684 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/varanasi-declared-best-ganga-town-for-2nd-successive-year/articleshow/87825406.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

---||India||Indore retains title of cleanest city for 5th time in a row||NEW DELHI: In a laudable feat, Indore retained the tag of the cleanest urban local body (ULB) for the fifth time in a row, while the biggest show of improvement was of Noida, which jumped from 40th position in 2020 to 9th this year among ULBs with more than one lakh population, according to the government's cleanliness survey. In the Swachh Survekshan 2021 results announced on Saturday, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which covers the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone, also improved its ranking to 5th from last year's position of 8th among ULBs. The NDMC also received the award of being the cleanest city in the category of ULBs with '1-10 lakh' population.Unlike last year, the annual swachhta (cleanliness) survey did not put out a comprehensive list of ULBs under the category of 'more than 1-lakh population'. This year, it published ULB-wise scores, which TOI used for comparing the ranking of municipal areas under two categories like last year - 'less than one lakh' and 'more than one lakh' population. The three municipal corporations in Delhi and its Cantonment Board did not have a score to make it to list of the 'top 100' in the one-lakh plus category. However, in the sub-category of 48 ULBs with more than 10 lakh population, municipal corporations of South Delhi, East Delhi and North Delhi ranked at 31, 38 and 43, respectively. President Ram Nath Kovind gave away the awards to the top-ranking cities at an event in Delhi. Appreciating Indore's performance, Kovind said while winning the top position is an achievement, to retain it is a bigger challenge. Among all ULBs with less than one lakh population, eight out of the top 10 were from Maharashtra - Vita emerged as the cleanest among them, followed by Lonavala. Since the inception of the national-level survey of ULBs in 2016, the housing and urban affairs ministry has introduced changes in the scoring pattern, which it claims to make the findings more accurate and progressive. To that end, this year, it increased the citizens' feedback to a maximum score of 1,800 compared to 1,500 in the 2020 survey. Interestingly, some ULBs which could not make it to the top 10 among the one lakh-plus population category, had recorded more scores in public perception about cleanliness of their cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indore-retains-title-of-cleanest-city-for-5th-time-in-a-row/articleshow/87825471.cms||Dipak K Dash

Vijayawada emerged as the third cleanest city in the country, while Vizag retained its ninth position from last year's survey in the category of cities with more than 10 lakh population. Tirupati stood third place in the category of cities with a population of one to 10 lakh population. Other major cities that made their mark in the same category were Rajahmundry (41st rank), Kurnool (70), Kakinada (103) and Nellore (107). In overall rankings (cities with more than one lakh population), Vijayawada occupied third place, Tirupati seventh place and Vizag 18th rank. These cities also got several individual awards. When it comes to rankings of major states that have more than 100 urban local bodies, Andhra Pradesh stood fifth. Visakhapatnam district was the ninth cleanest district as per the survey, while Krishna was ranked 22nd in the same category. GVMC mayor dedicates rank to VizagitesA new category, 'Prerak Dauur Samman', was introduced as part of the 2021 survey to classify cities on six indicators. Cities were categorised as 'platinum', 'gold', 'silver', 'bronze', and 'aspiring', based on their performance on select indicators from the SS-2021 'Service Level Progress'. Tirupati was classified a 'platinum' city, alongside Indore, Surat, Central Delhi and Thane. Vijayawada and Rajahmundry have been categorised as 'gold' as per the survey. Kadapa, Kurnool and Madanapalle have made it to the 'silver' list. Indore retained the top position as the cleanest city for a fifth consecutive year. GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari dedicated the awards and ranking to Vizagites. "The dedicated efforts of sanitary workers of the city have reached fruition with our ninth rank. The GVMC will try to improve cleanliness in the coming days," said Venkata Kumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-cities-continue-winning-streak-in-swachh-2021-survey/articleshow/87825491.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Strong winds likely to make Delhi's AQI moderate in three days||NEW DELHI: Strong winds are likely to clean Delhi’s air and provide some relief to the citizens. The air quality, which has been fluctuating between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ for over 15 days, is likely to improve from Sunday. The air quality early warning system for Delhi, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said that the air could improve to ‘poor’ or ‘moderate’ on Monday and Tuesday. However, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday was 374 in the ‘very poor’ category, despite the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 being just 5%. The Central Pollution Control Board’s data shows that Delhi recorded eight ‘severe’ air days so far in November and one ‘poor’ air day on November 1 when AQI the reading 281. The air quality has mostly remained in the ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ categories so far this month. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Like Friday, there were calm and light winds on Saturday. However, the wind speed is likely to pick up from Sunday, which will facilitate dispersion of pollutants.” IMD forecast north-westerly winds at the speed of 8-12 kmph on Sunday and strong surface winds at the speed of 20-30 kmph during the day on Monday. Track the pollution level in your citySystem of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), said, “AQI is likely to improve marginally, but remain within the same category on Sunday as the share of farm fires has reduced considerably and transport level winds have become slow and originating in the north/northwest direction. Local surface winds are also low with moderate ventilation of near surface pollutants.” While Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said in its bulletin on Saturday that the air quality was likely to improve but remain in the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ categories on November 22 and 23, SAFAR said, “From November 21 to 23, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality. Transport level winds coming from northwest direction are likely to be strong during November 21-23, flushing out locally emitted pollutants from Delhi to the southeast region that is expected to improve air quality further to the lower end of ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ category in Delhi.” SAFAR also said, “The contribution of farm fires (count 752) in Delhi’s PM2.5 is negligible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/strong-winds-likely-to-make-aqi-moderate-in-three-days/articleshow/87823639.cms||---
---||Indore||Indore’s ‘Punchline’: Five Swachh #1 awards in a row||INDORE: In 2017, Indore punched above its weight — fighting its way from rank 25 to Swachh #1. As reigning champion for four years, its tagline for this year’s Swachhata Abhiyaan — ‘Punch Lagayenge’ — hit home on Saturday when it swept up the cleanest city in the country award for the fifth time in a row. Over the past five Survekshans, the Swachhata consciousness of Indoreans has turned into a model for the country, but the civic administration too has ensured the city stayed ahead of the competition by scoring high on the tough parameters — ODF in 2017 and water-plus in 2021. Indore also bags ‘Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge’ AwardIndore was the first city to bag the water-plus tag this year, just as it did with the ODF tag in 2017. To let in on a secret to Indore's winning ways — it had begun working for next year's Swachh rankings well before this year's scores were out, just as it did last year. An elated chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted in typical Indori style: “Arey Wah Bhiya, Chha Gaya Apna Indore Phir Se.. Indore Adbhut hai, Gajab hai, Dhanya hai Indore Ki Janta Ka. I would like to congratulate the citizens of Indore, public representatives, local municipal corporation, administration, social workers, and sanitation workers for winning the cleanest city award for the fifth time.” Indore clinched the #1 rank in the above-10 lakh-population category by securing 5618.14 marks out of 6,000. This time, though, it was a rather close win. Surat came within punching distance of the top slot, trailing Indore by only 59 marks. In fact, Indore trailed Surat in ‘citizens’ voice’ by over 17 points. Surat’s score increased from 5519.59 last year to 5559.21, while Indore’s score slumped by around 29 marks. Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh) came third with 5368.37marks. Apart from winning the ‘cleanest city’ title, Indore has also won the ‘Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge’ award for exemplary work in ensuring a safe working environment for its sanitation and drainage workers engaged in cleaning of sewers and manholes. Adjoining city Dewas was ranked #1 in the 1-3-lakh population category. Ujjain and Dewas came fifth and 10th in the 1-10 lakh category. Indore Municipal Corporation officials said it takes a lot to stay on top for five consecutive years — from innovations to sustainable measures, and spending hundreds of crores of rupees on technology, clean-up and human resources. Shutting down outfalls and cleaning of nullahs alone cost over Rs 300 crore but it was crucial to winning the ‘water-plus’ certification. “Winning the Swachh Survekshan title in the country is always laudable, but sustaining the position for five times is something only an extraordinary city like Indore can do, thanks to the required political support and dedicated workforce,” said IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal. She hopes to improve the city’s score in the next survey. “We have planned a slew of new initiatives under the cleanliness mission. We have already started working on expansion of our solid waste management system. Measures like collection of used cooking oil, clean air programme, and a mega bio-CNG plant are some of them,” the commissioner told TOI. PCC chief Kamal Nath said that it certainly is a proud moment for all as Indore secured first place in cleanliness for the fifth consecutive time.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra halves excise duty on imported liquor to 150%||MUMBAI: Imported liquor is set to become considerably cheaper in Maharashtra with the state slashing excise duty on this segment by a steep 50%—from 300% to 150%—in an attempt to crack down on smuggling and bootlegging. Thus, the price of a 1000ml imported liquor bottle like of Scotch whiskey, which ranges from Rs 5,800 to Rs 14,000, will drop by 35 to 40%. The notification was issued on Thursday. “The new notification will reduce MRP on imported whisky by around Rs 1,500-2,000. It will put liquor rates on a par with other states,” said principal secretary (excise), Valsa Nair Singh. ‘Duty cut will end illegal entry of imported liquor’This will put an end to illegal entry (of such liquor) into Maharashtra. We will be able to stop non-duty-paid liquor sales in the state and prevent the grey market. We hope to double revenue in this sector from Rs 100 crore to 250 crore in one year. Sales will go up from 1 lakh cases (bottles) annually to 2.5 lakh cases,” said Singh. The reduction will apply to whiskey, rum, brandy, gin and vodka and not for beer and wine, she said. “With this duty cut, we expect incidents of smuggling of imported liquor bottles from Delhi and other states to Maharashtra’s cities by flights or trains to come down,” excise officials said. They added, “Now the call on reduction in prices is to be taken by the liquor companies, who are expected to do so from Monday,” said a state official. During the three financial years from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the excise revenue from imported spirits was around Rs 200 crore, according to officials. However, they said, the revenue dipped to Rs 100 crore during 2019-20 and 2020-21. This did not occur because of Covid but due to the sudden rise in sales tax, they said. Also, the formula for levying excise duty was revised earlier. This added a heavy tax burden, leading to price rise and ultimately affecting revenue and also the volume of sales. “With this tax cut, we expect the volume and tax revenue to grow,” officials said. The International Spirits and Wine Association of India said the decision would help bring prices for imported liquor in Maharashtra on a par with other states like Goa, since reduction would be 35% to 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-halves-excise-duty-on-imported-liquor-to-150/articleshow/87825518.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP offers legal aid to SSC protesters||Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar on Saturday reached out to School Service Commission (SSC) candidates — agitating for a month against the state education department over alleged job discrimination — and promised legal aid. “I don’t want politics here. I only want deserving candidates to get jobs. There were errors on the part of the commission and the education department, which have now come out in the open. We want an inquiry into the mess that happened during the tenure of the former education minister (Partha Chatterjee),” Majumdar said at the dharna site. Calcutta High Court has already directed the petitioners to add the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education as respondent in the case because the board appointed 25 people based on recommendations, allegedly from the SSC, after the expiry of the last date of appointment on May 4, 2019. The West Bengal Central School Service Commission secretary, through an affidavit in court, said no such recommendations were issued from any of the five SSC regions. Senior Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy pointed out that the BJP was meddling with a sub judice matter. “The high court is hearing the SSC-related petitions. The state government will act according to court order. The BJP has nothing to do with the dispute. It is the state that has to give jobs to candidates if the HC orders so. The BJP has no stake,” Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-offers-legal-aid-to-ssc-protesters/articleshow/87823959.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Tathagata tweets ‘farewell’ to Bengal BJP, party silent||Kolkata: Former Meghalaya governor and now a whistleblower in Bengal BJP, Tathagata Roy bade “farewell” to the party’s state unit because he didn’t find any “visible change” in the ways party leaders function even months after he exposed the “kamini-kanchan (women and money)” connection of a section of BJP seniors who were responsible for ticket distribution and campaign management during the assembly polls. On Saturday morning, Roy took to Twitter to express his disappointment and make the announcement. “I have been writing in vain to make the party aware of the fact that a section of leaders is getting swayed by money and women. The results will speak for themselves. I will wait for the results of the municipal polls. Farewell, for now, West Bengal BJP,” he wrote in Bengali. Speaking to TOI later, Roy said he had nothing more to add. “I have done my bit by trying to address the conscience of party leaders. They (the Bengal BJP) have committed hara-kiri. There has been no visible change since I raised the matter. I don’t see any effort towards course correction,” he said. Earlier this week, the BJP veteran had emphasised that the party in Bengal would be decimated if local leaders didn’t mend their ways. He had criticised top leaders, including BJP’s Bengal observer Kailash Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, for the debacle in the state polls. Following Roy’s statements, Ghosh had said the former was free to leave the camp if he was “upset and ashamed” over its style of functioning. On Saturday, however, Ghosh said: “I can’t comment on what he (Roy) said (about leaving the state party). There is no official communication from him. I have not spoken to him for long.” On Twitter too, the Bengal BJP did not respond to Roy’s post. According to party insiders, Roy is not leaving the party, but trying to grab the attention the BJP brass in Delhi. Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh, meanwhile, took a dig at Roy and said it was “a temporary loss to political entertainment”. “Viewers will remember him for his ability to make people laugh,” the Trinamool leader tweeted. Roy responded with sarcasm about how happy he was to know Kunal Ghosh “is out on bail now”. For the rest of day, Roy continued his tweet tirade against the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tathagata-tweets-farewell-to-bengal-bjp-party-silent/articleshow/87823940.cms||Rohit Khanna

Sources said Maya (T-12), the most popular tigress of Tadoba, was responsible for the attack. Dhumane was on foot with three labourers for the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) 2022 exercise when the incident took place. There have been cases of foresters being attacked by carnivores while on duty but all had escaped with injuries. Following Saturday's incident, Tadoba field director Jitendera Ramgaonkar has suspended the enumeration exercise as well as the movement of tourists in Gypsys in the area. According to Ramgaonkar, Dhumane and team had started walking around 7 am. After 4 km, they noticed Maya sitting on the road about 200 metres ahead of them. The team waited for around 30 minutes and when the tigress didn't budge they decided to take a detour through the forest. The tigress then attacked Dhumane and dragged her into the forest. On being informed, senior forest officials reached and traced the body. It was later shifted to Chimur government hospital for post-mortem. Maya's sudden aggressive behaviour has surprised those who have followed her life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/most-popular-tadoba-tigress-kills-woman-forest-guard/articleshow/87825536.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Kolkata||WHEELS OF HOPE||Kolkata: After an extremely challenging year when the industry was hit by the double whammy of major hurdles in manufacturing and plummeting demand, the two-wheeler market is expected to move into top gear in the second quarter of next year, riding on restoration of supplies and a robust growth in demand. While the pent-up demand, particularly in executive and performance segment bikes, is expected to trigger the initial sales growth, the re-emergence of col-lege-goers as a customer segment coupled with rising fuel costs that have brought the frugal two-wheelers back in the reckoning of customers considering entry-level cars, is expected to sustain the growth through the next year. But all that will happen only if two-wheeler manufacturers live up to the promise of restoring supplies of motorcycles in the 150cc and above categories that have been badly impacted by the global chip shortage.  This September, only 65,500 units of bikes and scooters were sold in Bengal, a decline of 37% against 1.04 lakh units in September 2020. The industry had last September recorded a growth of 12% against September 2019, when 93,000 units were sold. While the spectacular jump in sales last year despite the sector losing out nearly three months to lockdown was driven by the pandemic and fear of using public transport, sales took a beating countrywide during the second wave this April-June. Any hopes of recovery were dashed by the chip crisis that crippled production. Among the bikes that have virtually vanished from showrooms are Honda’s Unicorn, XBlade and Hornet 2.0; Bajaj Pulsar 150 and 180, and NS 200; TVS Apache 180 and 200; Yamaha FZ, FZX and R15. Only Hero’s XPulse 200 and Xtreme 160 R are available in the market. The worst hit though are companies that play in only the higher end of the market: Royal Enfield, Jawa, Harley Davidson, Triumph, Indian Motorcycle, Ducati, Hayabusa and others. “It is difficult to tell if sales would have been as high as 2020 given the multiple challenges that we faced this year. But it would certainly have been way bet-ter had the industry not been hit by a supply crunch. In Kolkata and the rest of Bengal, there is a fair demand in the executive and performance & style segments of two-wheelers,” said Federation of Automotive Dealers Association (FADA) chief executive officer Saharsh Damani. Apart from the devastating second wave that impacted cities as well as suburban towns, the floods in July-August and again in early September stymied semi-urban and rural sales. Loss of standing crop led to many farmers shelving plans to purchase a motorcycle. In many places, showrooms were submerged and remained shut for over a fortnight. Petrol prices that went through the roof didn’t help the cause with many prospective customers for entry level or commuter segment bikes deciding to push back purchase. Many developed cold feet at the prospect of having to buy petrol at over Rs 100 a litre. “Usually, 35-40% of the annual two-wheeler sales happen during the festive months of September to November. But this year, around 60% of that business did not happen due to these factors,” pointed out Abhinav Agarwal, a Honda dealer in Hooghly. Incidentally, 88% of two-wheeler sales in Bengal happens outside Kolkata in tier-II/III towns like Siliguri, Asansol and Burdwan, and in the rural belt with motorcycles accounting for 65% of the two-wheeler pie. In Kolkata, prospective customers of executive and performance category bikes who have not had such an adverse financial impact due to Covid are ex-pected to make their purchase if supplies resume. “With two-wheeler manufacturers hinting at improved supply soon, we hope sales will be generated from those who have been waiting for the bikes as well as college-goers who have been confined to homes for two years as educational institutions had remained shut,” said Divyanshu Mahansaria, a Honda dealer in Kolkata. Arnab Sarkar, the sales and service executive at a Yamaha dealership, is confident that if supplies are restored, more two-wheelers will be sold in December than during the past three months. “We have around 200 customers waiting for the bikes,” he said. Royal Enfield dealers are among the worst hit by the chip crisis as it has no motorcycles in the sub-150cc category. In fact, with its portfolio comprising bikes between 350cc and 650cc, all of them are heavily dependent on chips. RE dealer Kushal Bajoria says but for the supply constraint, he could have sold three times the number of bikes he has managed to sell during the festive months. “We saw phenomenal demand last year that translated into huge sales. We should get to the 2019 level gradually. I expect to see some green shoots in the latter half of January,” said Bajoria. What’s also expected to spur the two-wheeler growth is the acceleration in the EV initiative with companies like Hero Electric, TVS iQube, Revolt, Okinawa, Ola, Ather and others launching battery operated vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wheels-of-hope/articleshow/87824363.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Teaching and non teaching staff in such low-enrolment schools too will be absorbed into the proposed model schools. “We want to ensure quality education for schoolchildren. Thousands of schools in the state have very few students on the rolls. The number of teachers is also not encouraging. This is not a sustainable model,” said B C Nagesh, primary and secondary education minister. “If we merge such schools into a bigger ‘model’ school, there will be better focus on academic performance,” the minister said. ‘Tie up with corporates to improve infra’The proposal comes in the wake of calls to create a better academic environment in government schools. Statewide data captured by the department of public instruction (DPI) revealed that as many as 3,179 lower primary schools and 219 higher primary schools run by the department have less than 10 students this academic year. In total, 10,588 schools run by the DPI have up to just 20 students each. The finding has raised a serious question — whether these institutions should be continued or merged with the nearest schools. Schools in the same panchayats where student strength is abysmally low will be merged into one single institution. Funds will be pooled for the new school to add facilities, and to delegate more teachers. Former education minister Kimmane Rathnakar said: “I had a similar idea where public schools are set up in all gram panchayats. We need quality schools in every village with good student strength, oneteacher-per-section, transport facility, nutritious midday meals, etc. The government should ensure transport for all students.” He urged the government to tie up with corporates to ensure best of facilities in village schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/schools-with-poor-enrolment-to-merge-in-karnataka/articleshow/87825663.cms||Shrinivasa M

The city is ranked first as the Fastest Mover Mega City, in the 40 lakh plus population category. The tech capital secured 28th spot in cleanliness among 48 urban local bodies with more than 1 crore population. In 2020, Bengaluru’s ranking had slipped to 214, from 194 it held the preceding year. The tighter population-wise category wasn’t introduced then. The award and improvement in overall ranking comes as a shot in the arm for Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, solid waste management special commissioner Harish Kumar and joint commissioner Sarfaraz Khan received the award in New Delhi. Bengaluru scored 3,585.56 points out of 6,000 while the national average was 2,072 points. While the city scored high with regard to ending open defecation and increasing citizen engagement, what prevented a higher ranking was collective failure of the administration and people to make it a garbage-free city. The BBMP officials are elated. “We know a lot more has to be done as the city has been evolving at a greater speed than one can imagine,” said a senior official. City’s waste segregation must improve: OfficialWe have been working hard since 2016 to put in place a proper system to monitor and streamline solid waste management, and today we’re happy about it,” said a senior BBMP official, adding: “Bengaluru’s participation in Swacch Survekshan is driving the citizen and us to perform better.” Last year, BBMP collected nearly 4,200 tonnes of waste per day, now it has increased by 400 tonnes. Various developmental activities have been taken up by the civic body and citizen participation has helped them achieve this rank. “Waste segregation in the city is 45% as of now, but it needs to improve to 100 percent in the coming days. Apartment complexes and individual houses are segregating wet waste with their own composting methods, which is good progress”, a senior SWM official said. While citizens are happy about the ranking going up, Sandya Narayanan, a member of Solid Waste Management Round Table (SWMRT), said it is a pleasant surprise that BBMP has been recognised as a Mega City Mover, but more ground needs to be covered. “Bangalore SWM has scored 50% and this is a lacklustre performance with service level progress barely keeping its head above water. The certification process is demanding and needs a focussed approach from the administration to put in place required SWM systems and processes,” she told STOI. Ram Prasad, an eco-warrior, said Swachh Survekshan is a mirror and it is showing our status. “It is an uphill task which should be taken up in a transparent manner, where we need to score a higher rank in 2022. We should achieve Garbage Free City tag soon,” Ram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-ranked-fastest-mover-mega-city-28th-in-cleanliness/articleshow/87825701.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Author Subhashini Kukde, who was fond of writing Marathi short stories, was admitted to the ICU of New Dande Hospital for severe lung failure. Her short story collection - Mom you are great - was released at 9.30pm on Friday and she breathed her last hours later at 2.30am on Saturday. The book, which was awaiting a formal release for almost a year-and-a-half due to Covid-19, was released by state Congress president Nana Patole, MLC Abhijit Wanjari and MLA Vikas Thakre. Subhashini's husband Madhukar Kukde, a senior social and political activist associated with Sanyukta Maharashtra movement, said it was her wish for the last many months and "it proved to be her last wish too". Kukde recalled how his wife penned down the 18 stories while fighting against poor eyesight and poor lung capacity due to old age. The book was ready for release in January 2020. "We had to postpone the event twice due to the first and second waves of Covid-19. Meanwhile, Subhashini's health deteriorated. She was undergoing treatment at Dr Dande's hospital for the last two months," said Kukde. Dr Pinak Dande, who looked after the patient for months, said Subhashini used to talk about the book whenever she could. Subhashini was 79 years old and it was difficult for doctors to revive her damaged lungs. "When I told this to her husband, he asked me to wait for some time. In the next two days, he contacted Nana Patole, who agreed to release the book," Dr Dande said. The author's family performed her last rites on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hours-before-death-author-saw-her-book-released-in-icu/articleshow/87825718.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

"If your sentiments for farmers are true, then please do not share the stage with your minister of state for home and dismiss him from his post," she said, a day after saying the government's move to repeal farm laws was driven by the fear of losing elections.

---||India||In a first, Rajasthan cabinet set to have four Dalits||NEW DELHI: In what seems a repeat of the “Channi move” in Punjab, the Congress will have four Cabinet ministers from the Dalit community in the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan following the reshuffle that will be executed on Sunday. As many as 12 new ministers have been added to the Gehlot ministry and the Congress has filled all the existing vacancies in the council of ministers. A list of 15 ministers who will take oath on Sunday, including three promotions from the “minister of state” rank, has been sent to the governor. The key feature of the expansion is that while a new cabinet minister from the SC community is being inducted, three Dalit “ministers of state” are being promoted to the cabinet rank. Also, there are three tribal ministers and three women in the new additions. Read AlsoAll Rajasthan ministers resign ahead of cabinet reshuffleJAIPUR: All Rajasthan ministers on Saturday tendered their resignations ahead of the proposed cabinet reshuffle. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had called chaired a meeting of his council of ministers earlier in the evening at his residence in Jaipur. "All ministers resigned in the meeting," PratapThe presence of four Dalit cabinet ministers in the council of 30 is a big representation to the community and appears in line with the social justice push of the Congress leadership seen earlier in Punjab. It is also being said to be a first in the state. According to sources, five of the new ministers belong to the Sachin Pilot camp. It is a big leg up for the leader who was sacked as deputy chief minister and state president after he rebelled against the state government with a band of MLAs last year. Three ministers including Pilot were removed from the Gehlot government then. Pilot has been demanding a rejig for a long time.

Sources said this is a sign of confidence that the party has found after the recent by-election victories which took its tally to 102, giving Congress a majority of its own. Well-placed sources said that there will be a major reshuffle of portfolios following the oath of new ministers on Sunday. Earlier, following a cabinet meeting, all the ministers tendered their resignation to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, out of which only three resignations were accepted on the principle of "one man one post." The three to resign are state president Govind Dotasra, recently appointed AICC in-charge of Punjab Harish Choudhary, and new AICC Gujarat in-charge Raghu Sharma. Gehlot and AICC Rajasthan in charge Ajay Maken held a couple of meetings to discuss the nitty-gritty of the changes and, sources said, the list of the new ministers was sent to the governor late at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-rajasthan-cabinet-set-to-have-four-dalits/articleshow/87825744.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Noida||Give equal compensation, plots to 18+ women hit by airport project: Study||Greater Noida: A seven-member multi-disciplinary expert appraisal committee, headed by IGNOU professor Satish Kumar, reviewed on Saturday the findings of the social impact assessment (SIA) study which recommended equal rights and rehabilitation and resettlement (RnR) benefits for women to be affected by the second stage of the Noida International Airport project. The panel will forward the findings of the SIA group to the state government for further action. The faculty members of the Gautam Buddha Nagar University, who were tasked with compiling the SIA report, had conducted public hearings across the six villages — Mundhera, Birampur, Kureb, Ranhera, Karauli Bangar and Dayanatpur — that will come under the second stage of the project from November 1 to 11 and presented their findings before the expert committee recently. According to officials, a total of 6,830 families are likely to be affected by the second phase of the project. Of them, 5,063 families are likely to be displaced. During the public hearings, the people likely to be affected by the project had sought several changes in the existing policies, the SIA team said. Key among them is equal rights and rehabilitation and resettlement (RnR) benefits for the women who will be affected. During the first phase, though Rs 5.50 lakh were offered to the adult female members of a family who had to give up their house because of the project, a plot in the Jewar Bangar township was offered only to adult male members. Explaining the reason behind the mismatch, a senior administrative officer said that it was assumed that the unmarried girls, over 18 years, would ultimately shift to the house of their prospective spouse after their wedding and hence no plot was offered to them. Vivek Mishra, the nodal officer of the SIA team, said that the team has recommended giving a plot to adult unmarried female members under the RnR scheme. He added that the final award for the land will be decided by the district administration in the later stages. The team has also recommended acquiring the land and doling out RnR benefits through a single window, unlike last time when villagers had to make multiple rounds of government offices to claim the benefits or to submit the required documents for verification. The team has asked authorities to pay up the award for the acquired piece of land and the RnR benefit amount together to the project-affected families to help them plan their future lives in a better manner. Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority, meanwhile, will be asked to notify the abadi settlements within the villages that do not come under the project to ensure they are not asked to vacate their land parcels in the future, officials said. YEIDA will decide whether different building bylaws will be implemented within the abadi settlements going forward. The SIA team has also recommended realigning the boundary of the second stage of the project to keep the abadi settlement of the Nagla Hukum Singh village out of the purview. Kunwar Pal Singh from Ranhera village, who is a part of the expert committee, demanded the people, who are self-employed and run small businesses, should be offered equivalent employment opportunities during the resettlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/give-equal-compensation-plots-to-18-women-hit-by-airport-project-study/articleshow/87824447.cms||Shalabh

In all, 35 people were put to RTPCR test and three of them turned out to be positive. A test report of about 20 more is awaited, officials said. One of them was already found positive last week making the total number of cases four. Earlier this week, as many as 35 employees of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) returned to the work in Hata camp of the corporation. After random testing of 35 people in two different batches of 20 and 15 employees, three were tested positive on Friday. Test report of the batch of 15 is awaited, said Dr Sangeeta Trivedi, the chief medical and health officer (CMHO). All of the 4 were admitted at Hata government hospital. The CMHO said that all those who had been in contact with the employees who were found positive should also get themselves tested for the coronavirus. “ It is expected that more people may be found positive for Covid-19”, said district administration sources. On November 19, the government’s health bulletin said, there were three and two Covid patients in Indore and Bhopal respectively while one was found positive in Badwani. Amidst sporadic detection of Covid-19 cases from various pockets of MP, the state government had lifted all the restrictions that were imposed to check the further spread of the viral diseases that has been wreaking havoc for the past about two years. Ahead of proposed civic and panchayat polls as the government lifted the restrictions, the opposition has questioned the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-after-90-days-3-covid-positive-cases-in-damoh-more-reports-awaited/articleshow/87825750.cms||---

In Ghaziabad, the AQI dropped 33 notches from 377 on Friday to 344 points. In Greater Noida, AQI slipped by 60 points to settle at 322 on Saturday from 382 a day back. Noida, too, got some relief, recording an AQI of 356 on Saturday, down from 376 a day back. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to improve marginally on Sunday but will continue to remain in the ‘very poor’ category. Decrease in instances of farm fire and transport-level wind blowing in from north and northwest direction are behind the improvement of overall AQI, experts said. Low local surface winds, they added, with moderate ventilation of near-surface pollutants have also helped clear pollutants. Surface level wind speed is likely to be strong between November 21 and 23, which will further help in the effective dispersion of pollutants trapped in the air. Transport level wind, coming from the northwest direction, is likely to be strong during the corresponding period and will help to flush out locally emitted pollutants from the region, experts said. Meanwhile, the AQI at Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara pollution monitoring station was recorded at 333, while Indirapuram clocked 335, and Sanjay Nagar 329 on Saturday. Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park-3 station recorded an AQI of 322, while Knowledge Park-5 recorded 315, both at the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category. Noida’s Sector 62 station recorded the worst AQI in the region at 418, which is under the ‘severe’ category. The Sector 116 and Sector 1 centres recorded average AQIs of 326, while data for Sector 125 station was not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/slight-improvement-in-ncrs-aqi-as-farm-fires-remain-low/articleshow/87824483.cms||Abhijay Jha

Among cities, Chennai, grabbed the national rank of 43, and has performed better than Coimbatore and Madurai within the state. People's perception about cleanliness management in the city seems to have improved considerably as per the ranking because the city made a sharp climb in ranking when compared to the previous years. In 2020, Chennai was ranked 45. Coimbatore is ranked 46 followed by Madurai, which scored 47. But non-metro cities like Vijayawada, Pune, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Gwalior are among the top 20 cities. Among the city suburbs, three urban local bodies - Avadi, Tambaram and Pallavaram - have made it to the list among ranking for urban local bodies that have populations between one lakh and 10 lakh. Like Chennai, these suburbs also showed improvement. For instance, Avadi is now ranked 267 as against 367 last year. During the same period, Tambaram scored 200 compared to 314 and Pallavaram was at 233 compared to 283 in 2020. Other urban local bodies that performed better were Trichy, Salem, Dindigul, Tuticorin and others. Swachh Survekshan is an annual survey of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation in cities and towns across India launched as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which aims to make India clean and free of open defecation. In 2021, the national-level ranking was done based on the feedback given online by residents. The cities are classified based on population - cities that have a population of more than 10 lakh form major cities and those that have 1lakh to 10 lakh population are considered small cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-top-from-tamil-nadu-on-national-swachh-list/articleshow/87825820.cms||---

The facility has taken in 28 such kids since Covid-19 broke out. Loss of livelihood during the pandemic and parents not being able to care for the third child are among reasons for them giving up their kids. While all 28 children have been adopted, 13 are still in the Spandana Adoption Center and will be handed over to their adoptive parents once the legal process is over. A total of 42 children have been adopted from the centre since 2008 — 14 between 2008 and 2019. The centre houses many kids who are victims in Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) cases and those born out of wedlock. Authorities from the department of women and child development, district child protection centre and Spandana confirmed that the number was higher as compared to the pre-pandemic era. This can be attributed to many people struggling to eke out a livelihood and unable to provide food or care to their children due to Covid, sources said. Of the 28 kids, 25 have been surrendered by people from Shivamogga district. Other adoption centres in the state have also witnessed an increase in the number of surrendered children. A private medical practitioner in Haveri pointed out that normally those into extramarital relationships opt for illegal abortion. “But due to the pandemic, they were unable to do so, hence they surrendered their child to the adoption centre after delivery,” he added. Srinivas Aladarthi, deputy director, department of women and child development, said premarital or extramarital relationships are major reasons for parents surrendering or abandoning kids. Mallikarjun Mathad, district child protection officer, said most children taken in by the centre were not breastfed. “Some parents surrendered kids and some left them on the roadside. We are taking care of them and will hand them over to adoptive parents after the process is over,” he said. “We have received children who were surrendered, abandoned or orphaned. A total 101 children have joined Spandana Adoption Center, recognised by the state government, since 2008. A 15-day-old girl was surrendered by her parents from Shivamogga recently,” said Sangeeta GH, a coordinator at Spandana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-rise-in-kids-surrendered-adopted-post-pandemic-in-haveri/articleshow/87825845.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Stalin visited Vadivudaiamman Nagar, Mahalakshmi Nagar and Vivekanandha school, where about 25 families from Irular colony in Sadayankuppam area have been given temporary shelter after their houses went under water. A local C Ettiyappan said whenever surplus water is released into the Kosasthalayar river, many residential areas in this region get flooded. "Many politicians, including the chief minister visited our area. But we don't know when the rehabilitation measures will start, and stagnant water will be pumped out." Irular colony has 40 families of which only 8 have been provided concrete houses. The rest are still living in huts. All the families have been affected due to the flooding, Ettiyappan said. The PWD on Saturday reduced the release of surplus water from the Poondi after the quantity of inflow came down. On Friday, it was over 37,000 cubic feet of water per second (cusecs) and the inflow was more than 42,000 cusecs of water. Only due to the increased inflow, the authorities had to release the water from the Poondi reservoir, said a PWD engineer. As on Saturday evening, the inflow in Poondi reservoir had come down to 23,721 cusecs. Of this, the authorities have released 23,506 cusecs of water.  With the reduction in the inflow and the rainfall in the reservoirs and its catchment areas, the release of surplus water from the reservoirs will be reduced in the next couple of days, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/inflow-in-poondi-reduces-tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin-assesses-damage/articleshow/87825851.cms||P Oppili

The policy says every child shall have access to quality healthcare and education and will be able to freely express his or her views on any issue concerning him/ her. The policy, which was released by chief minister M K Stalin, says, “The government of Tamil Nadu resolves to build a safe and secure environment and child friendly spaces as foundation for realisation of the rights of all children in the state." It also wants to strengthen and sustain community based mechanisms to protect children from all forms of abuse (physical, emotional, sexual, neglect, denial and online), discrimination, exploitation, violence or any other activity that will harm them or affect their care, protection and overall development. The policy also reaffirmed its commitment towards zero tolerance to any form of violence against children. It further wants to introduce a child safeguarding policy in all schools to make all schools safe for children. Forming internal complaints committee in all schools under POSH Act (The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013) and conducting awareness campaigns against all forms of violence against children and its negative impact on children, laws/ institutions to be accessed or approached for redressal, implementing highest standards of safety and security within all child care institutions, building a preventive, responsive children protection system, promoting effective enforcement of legislation are some of the measures suggested in the policy. It suggests upgrading rehabilitation services under the child protection system with special focus on mental health and psycho-social support and ensuring privacy of the children in need of care and protection, allocation of adequate budget in proportion to the hilt population of the state. It wants to consider institutional care as a last resort and wants to strengthen family care and alternative care. The government says it will be implemented by developing a comprehensive plan of action with consultation of all stakeholders. "The policy was framed based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. The announcement that they will prepare a plan of action based on the inputs from civil society organisations, academicians and children is also a good move," A Devaneyan, a child rights activist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-govt-policy-for-kids-to-prevent-abuse-violence/articleshow/87825844.cms||---

The edited clip went viral, sparking tension in Kodagu district last week. According to police, the women were protesting against the arrest of a few men, shouting ‘Ambedkar Zindabad’. The accused allegedly edited out the slogan and inserted ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. Claiming atrocities against Hindus, the trio called a bandh on November 15.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wary Covid suspects rushing to book hospital beds only to test +ve for dengue||KOLKATA: Fear of Covid is leading scores of Kolkatans suffering from fever and other Covid-like symptoms to seek hospitalisation only to test positive for dengue. This has led to a sharp rise in the number of dengue patients at hospitals over the past month even as the number of Covid cases has remained stable. Almost all private hospitals have now made dengue and malaria tests mandatory for all patients admitted with fever along with an RT-PCR for Covid. A majority of the dengue patients currently admitted in hospitals have mild to moderate manifestation of the disease and would not have taken admission had they not feared a Covid infection, said CMRI Hospital's director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. "Similar symptoms are prompting many, particularly the elderly and the comorbid, to go for hospitalisation without waiting for the test results even when they are fully vaccinated," said Dhar.  AMRI Hospitals now has around 50 dengue patients and 55 Covid patients admitted across its three units. "We have made dengue and malaria tests mandatory for all fever patients," said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. 'Dengue, malaria tests must for all fever patients here'  Many are rushing to hospital with fever and associated symptoms, fearing Covid. Most of them are testing negative for Covid but positive for dengue or malaria. A substantial number are being diagnosed with just influenza. But they are preferring to stay till they recover. We have made dengue and malaria tests mandatory for all fever patients," said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Belle Vue Clinic currently has 15 confirmed Covid cases while eight suspected cases tested positive for dengue and one for malaria. Four others with fever are awaiting test reports. "Chances of the suspects testing negative for Covid and positive for dengue or malaria or negative for all remain high. In that case, other fever patients will almost touch the number of Covid positives," said a doctor. Peerless Hospital is conducting both Covid and dengue/malaria tests on fever patients. "Since initial symptoms are similar, many are not willing to take chances," said CEO Sudipta Mitra, adding that several dengue patients at the hospital suffered platelet drop and their Covid scare turned out to be a blessing as they wouldn't have otherwise gone for early hospitalisation. Ruby General Hospital has been refusing admission to fever patients unless they have tested positive for dengue with a sliding platelet count. "We are advising others to stay home," said Ruby GM (operations) Subhasish Datta. At the RTIICS laboratory, Covid positives have slid to 18 this week from 24 last week while nine patients with fever tested positive for dengue. "Dengue patients are at home barring a few who have a severe disease," said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairperson Alok Roy said while the Covid number at the hospital is stable, many fever patients have tested positive for dengue over the last fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-wary-covid-suspects-rushing-to-book-hospital-beds-only-to-test-ve-for-dengue/articleshow/87825866.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal’s chief, Baba Harnam Singh Khalsa, said: "The PM’s firmness and the willpower are appreciable but he should maintain this determination in the larger interest of the farmers. The Centre should have not enacted the controversial laws in the first place but, eventually, good sense prevailed on Gurpurab." Panthic Talmel Sangathan core committee member advocate Jaswinder Singh said: "The revoking of three farm laws is a partial victory, while there are several unresolved issues. The government didn’t talk about MSP, the Lakhimpur Kheri case, or the fate of police cases filed against the farmers during their struggle. The farmers who died during the agitation also deserve justice." The sangathan has demanded an agriculture roadmap from the government. Jaswinder Singh said: "Tell the farmers about environment-friendly crops that are associated with health and economic viability, and link those to MSP for success." Mission Kisan Sangarash Fatehyabi Committee president Iqbal Singh Tung said: "We forced the Centre to listen to the farmers." The former personal assistant of the Akal Takht jathedar said his group had begun a serial recital of Gurbani from June 8 and the bhog its 25th path will be on November 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/repeal-of-laws-partial-victory-for-sikh-bodies/articleshow/87823942.cms||Yudhvir Rana

He tweeted on Saturday that: "While Narendra Modi repealed all three agri-marketing laws with great respect, there was an andolan (agitation) earlier too. The leader was Jaiprakash Narayan, the slogan was Sampurna Kranti (total revolution), and the ruling party was the Congress. In place of accepting the demands, Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in 1975 and put all the leaders in jail." In the tweet’s thread, Vij posted: "This is the difference between the Congress and the BJP. The stature of Narendra Modi has increased. Everyone should respect his words." Targeting the Congress leadership, Vij tweeted: "Before speaking against Pradhan Mantri (PM), Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka should know the history of their family and party. They have no right to speak on democracy, as they have never kept its honour."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/modi-gesture-tells-bjp-apart-from-cong-vij/articleshow/87823951.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Diwali night killings in Gurugram: Cops nab four more||GURUGRAM: Police late on Friday night arrested four more persons in connection with the indiscriminate firing at the residence of a former sarpanch of a Manesar village on Diwali night that left four men dead and two others, including an eight-year-old boy, injured. Earlier five men were held and three juveniles detained for the crime. The mastermind behind the crime is still at large. Around 8pm on November 4, some 8-10 men barged into the house of ex-sarpanch Gopal in Manesar’s Kasan village and fired indiscriminately at his family members who were performing Lakshmi puja. While two of his sons had died on the spot, two injured relatives died during treatment later. The shooting, police had said, was the fallout of an enmity between two families in the village dating back to 2007. That year, the two sons of Gopal and another relative shot dead one Manoj, a villager. The two sons were handed life imprisonment. A few years ago, when they came out on bail, Yogender, Manoj’s elder brother, hatched a conspiracy to kill them. “The four arrested men are shooters — Abhishek Sroha, Sanjeev, Sahil and Vikash. While Abhishek was arrested from Delhi, cops nabbed Sanjeev from Rohtak. Sahil and Vikash were picked up from Sonipat by inspector Joginder Singh, in-charge of Palam Vihar crime unit, and his team,” a senior police official told TOI. “Others arrested include people who had provided shelter to the accused and helped them escape.” The crime unit of Sector 31 first arrested two accused — Amit Singh from Kaithal and Tarun Kumar from Panipat. Two days after the arrests, on November 12, three more accused — Subhash Singh, Gopal and Devid — were apprehended. During interrogation, the accused named Yogender as the mastermind behind the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/diwali-night-killings-cops-nab-four-more/articleshow/87824632.cms||Bagish Jha
---||India||Clip shows Sidhu 'calling' Pak PM 'bada bhai'; BJP hits out||NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday hit out at Congress after its Punjab president Navjot Singh Sidhu reportedly called Pakistan PM Imran Khan his "elder brother" during a trip to Kartarpur Sahib, alleging the opposition party sees terror groups like IS and Boko Haram in Hindutva and finds a "bhai jaan" in Khan. A purported video of Sidhu being welcomed by a Pakistani official on behalf of Khan has gone viral in which he is heard saying Khan was like a "bada bhai" to him and that he loved him a lot. As BJP seized on the issue to target Congress, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said it is a serious matter of concern for India. He claimed that there was a larger design at work, and Sidhu's comments were linked to a number of Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, criticising Hindutva. BJP IT department head Amit Malviya tweeted, "Rahul's favourite Navjot Singh Sidhu calls Imran his 'bada 'bhai'. Last time he had hugged Gen Bajwa, Pakistan Army's chief, heaped praises. Is it any surprise that the Gandhi siblings chose a Pakistan loving Sidhu over veteran Amarinder Singh!"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clip-shows-sidhu-calling-pak-pm-bada-bhai-bjp-hits-out/articleshow/87825880.cms||---

The MLA promised to look into the matter and take necessary action. Despite repeated complaints, the residents claimed, authorities had not acted against those involved with the construction on public land. Udayvir Yadav, the president of the Sector 10A residents welfare association (RWA), said, “A few people have illegally constructed a religious structure on a portion of the green belt, and we have been opposing this for a long time. It is nothing but sheer grabbing of land and its conversion into a worship place while the authorities concerned seem to be mute spectators on the matter. We have urged the MLA to help in the removal of the encroachment at the earliest.” The residents urged Daultabad to probe into the matter to fix responsibility and prevent further encroachment on public land. “There have been continuous efforts to encroach upon this land since 2012, but now with political patronage and official connivance, some people have constructed the religious structure in the green belt,” said Tara Chand, the general secretary of the Sector 10A RWA. When contacted, Daultabad said, “I have already instructed the officials concerned to examine the matter, and then they will take appropriate measures to secure the land.” Despite clear instructions from the Supreme Court against green belt encroachments, residents said, the lack of enforcement by the authorities concerned was encouraging the public to violate all rules and regulations. The RWA president added that residents are now preparing to file a petition with the high court. “This is a green belt, which is supposed to be our ‘green lung’. However, it is getting concretised in the name of renovation. We are not against any development, but this kind of encroachment is causing serious damage to the environment, other than this being completely illegal,” said SR Yadav, a Sector 10A resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/green-belt-encroached-with-officials-support-say-residents/articleshow/87824636.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Naik Deepak Nainwal died in May 2018 of injuries suffered while fighting terrorists in J&K’s Anantnag a month earlier. “I am the proud daughter of Deepak Nainwal,” said 9-year-old Lavanya as she waved at her mother from the gallery with her seven-year-old brother, Reyansh, in tow. Jyoti Nainwal, commissioned as a lieutenant, is the first member from her side of the family to join the Army. “I would like to thank my husband’s Mahar Regiment. They stood with us through thick and thin and whatever I am today is because of the regiment,” said the former homemaker from Uttarakhand’s Dehradun. Jyoti, a postgraduate in economics, had started preparing for the Service Selection Board test for entry into the armed forces officer cadre soon after losing her husband. On clearing the test, she underwent 11 months of training at the Chennai academy. A total of 153 cadets were commissioned on Saturday. Sixteen men and nine women from Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives, too, completed their training. Vice-Chief of the Army Staff Lt Gen CP Mohanty said women officers have been playing a significant role in the Army over the past few decades. He presented the Sword of Honour and OTA gold medal to ACA Siddhanth Sharma, the silver medal to BUO Dimple Singh Bhati and the bronze to BCA Muneesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-3-years-after-soldiers-death-his-wife-is-an-army-officer/articleshow/87825914.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
