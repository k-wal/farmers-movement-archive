The attached properties include the office of Ananta Merx, owned by Pawar’s son Parth in Nirmal Building at Nariman Point. Last week, the enforcement directorate (ED) had searched the Ananta Merx office in a money laundering case they are investigating against Unitech Group at Delhi. The other attached properties are Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana, a flat in Delhi, a resort in Goa and 27 land parcels at different parts of Maharashtra. I-T restricted sale-purchase of these assets. The Income Tax dept investigated the properties after receiving information that those were benami properties of Ajit Pawar and his family members. Recently, the investigation wing of the I-T dept has searched these properties along with around 70 other premises in Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa and Jaipur unearthing unaccounted and benami transactions worth Rs 183 crore. The I-T found several suspicious transactions by two builders (D B Realty and Dynamix group) and Ajit Pawar. During the search, I-T seized unaccounted cash of Rs 2.13 crore and jewellery worth Rs 4.32 crore. Earlier during the raid, Pawar had said that it was politically motivated. The I-T said that the tainted fund had been utilised to purchase offices at Nirmal building, the flat in Delhi, resort in Goa and the land parcels. The book value of these assets aggregates to about Rs 170 crore. Sources stated that the current market values of these properties are worth more than Rs 1,000 crore. After the search last month, the I-T issued a press note where it said, “The search action has led to the identification of transactions by these business groups (builders) with a web of companies which, prima facie, appear to be suspicious.” It further added, “A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes etc. It has been observed that such suspicious flow of funds has taken place with the involvement of an influential family of Maharashtra.”  The I-T sources said that the influential family that was mentioned in the press note referred to Ajit Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-income-tax-dept-attaches-benami-assets-over-rs-1000-cr-of-deputy-cm-ajit-pawar-relatives/articleshow/87495336.cms||Vijay V Singh

Earlier, physically challenged people from North Karnataka would travel to Jaipur, Rajasthan, to receive artificial limbs. They are now getting them for free in Hubballi. The centre has been honoured with the Swatantryada Amruta Mahotsav Rajya award 2021.Mahendra Singhi, founder president of AIJYF MLC, said that the centre was founded in 1995 to provide free services for the rehabilitation of physically challenged people by providing artificial limbs, clutches, callipers, and tricycles. “We used to hold health camps, blood donation drives and eye check-up camps. People did not come forward to donate at first. Dr SJ Nagalotimath, the director of KIMS Hubballi, approved space for our centre in 2000, and we have been holding free limb camps on a regular basis since then. We have already held over 200 camps in the states of Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Many people, including drivers, soldiers and labourers, who have lost a leg or a hand in train accidents, road accidents, or other tragedies, have benefitted from our centre,” he said. Currently, the centre sees more than five patients per day ranging in the age from one to 65 years. AIJYF also assists beneficiaries in finding work or starting a small business in order to achieve self-dependency in life. Singhi went on to say that many people, including businessmen, politicians from all parties, officials, social organisations and commoners are pitching in to help run the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hubballi-jain-federation-has-made-40000-people-self-dependent-by-extending-artificial-limbs/articleshow/87495191.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||India||J&K gets SIA for speedy probe in terror-related cases||SRINAGAR: The Jammu & Kashmir government has given a go-ahead for the formation of a State Investigation Agency (SIA) to effectively investigate terror-related cases as well as coordinate with central agencies. The Jammu and Kashmir home department in an order issued on Monday said the SIA, which will be headed by a director, will be mandated to probe terror offences like terror finance and false propaganda and those under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The Counter Intelligence units of Kashmir and Jammu, both under the CID department of the police, will also be the police stations under the new SIA for registering of terror-related cases, it said. The CID chief will be the ex-officio director of the SIA, the order said. According to the order, in-charge of police stations will mandatorily intimate the SIA immediately upon registering a terror-related case and about any such cases where any terrorism linkage surfaces during the probe. If any case is not taken by the NIA, the director general of police (DGP), having regard to the gravity of the offence and progress of the probe, will determine in consultation with SIA whether it is fit to be investigated by the agency and transfer the probe, it said. “However, if there is a difference of opinion, the DGP shall take a decision, while recording the reasons in writing,” the order said. If the case is not handed over to the SIA and local police continue to probe it, the police headquarters will ensure that the SIA is informed about the progress of investigation at regular intervals, it said. Giving an edge to the SIA, the order said if the agency is of the opinion that an offence related to the “scheduled crimes” has been committed, it can register an FIR keeping the DGP informed. The order said a special incentive of 25% of the basic pay shall be paid to the employees who are posted in the SIA. Scheduled crime, which have been kept in the list of the SIA, include those registered under the Explosive Substances Act, the UAPA and the Atomic Energy Act. Anti-hijacking, terror conspiracy, terror financing and terrorism-related to narcotics, terrorism-related to kidnaping and murder are also among scheduled crime cases. Among other offences mentioned in the scheduled offences of the SIA are terrorism linked thefts and extortions, ATM and bank robbery cases, terrorism-linked weapon snatching and robbery cases and cases related to propaganda, creating false narrative, large scale incitement, spreading disaffection, enmity against the Indian Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-gets-sia-for-speedy-probe-in-terror-related-cases/articleshow/87495572.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Official sources said services of Feroz Ahmad Lone, DSP (Prison), and Javid Ahmad Shah, principal of government higher secondary school in Bijbehara were terminated on Monday. Lone, who was appointed as DSP (Prison) in 2012, was charged with facilitating a meeting between two youths and a jailed terrorist commander, who was arrested by NIA. He was accused of misusing his official position by facilitating issuance of passes to the two youths, who had come to meet the terrorist in Srinagar jail. “It was in this meeting that a criminal conspiracy was hatched to send the duo to Pakistan for arms training,” an official claimed, adding that both were, however, arrested before crossing over to the neighbouring country. According to sources, Javid was a sympathizer of Hurriyat and Jamat-e-Islami. He was charged with playing the role of an advisor to Hurriyat cadres and Jamat operating in Bijbehara in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-govt-sacks-dsp-school-principal-for-terror-links/articleshow/87495594.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The bombings were followed by indiscriminate firing from inside the hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported that a number of fighters from Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) had entered the hospital and clashed with security forces. Bilal Karimi, deputy spokesman of the Islamic Emirate, said the blasts occurred at the entrance of the 400-bed Sardar Daud Khan hospital in Kabul’s affluent Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood. "Security forces are deployed to the area, there is no information about casualties," Karimi posted on Twitter. Another Taliban official was quoted by Afghan media as saying that a suicide bomber and gunmen were involved in the attack. "The attack was initiated by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle who blew himself up at the entrance of the hospital," the anonymous official said. He claimed that all the attackers had been killed. Habib Rahman, a doctor at the Daud Khan hospital, said that at least 20 people were killed and more than 50 wounded. He added that the toll could be higher as a number of people were hit by the first explosion at the entrance. Photographs shared by residents showed a plume of smoke billowing from the site of the blasts in the former diplomatic zone. One of the videos, captured from a high building nearby, showed gunmen firing, running and hiding in the hospital’s lawns. The Sardar Daud hospital has been targeted before. In 2011, Taliban suicide bombers blew themselves up inside the facility, killing six people. In 2017, IS-K terrorists disguised as doctors had killed 30 people during a six-hour siege that ended when Afghan security forces killed the attackers. A shipping container full of the physical remains of soldiers who had fought for the former government are still being held at the same government hospital. According to the Taliban defence ministry, their families have not yet been identified. Afghanistan has been embroiled in crisis since the Taliban toppled the American-backed Afghan government in August. Billions of dollars in assistance were halted and the international community has warned that the country would soon collapse into chaos. Last Friday, three guests were shot dead and over a dozen wounded at a wedding reception in Jalalabad, the capital of eastern Nangarhar province, apparently because music was being played at the event. The IS-K has also increased violence across the country and has carried out a series of attacks on mosques and other targets since the Taliban took control of the country. The group appears to be taking advantage of the Taliban’s difficulty in securing urban centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/twin-blasts-kill-20-injure-50-in-kabul/articleshow/87495604.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The AOB Maoists condemned the police statements that naxals are encouraging and supporting ganja cultivation. It is recalled that the state DGP Gautam Sawang after the interstate coordination meeting over enforcement on ganja in Vizag, stated that Maoists are supporting the ganja cultivation by the tribals. Responding to that statement, the AOBSZC Maoists released a press note in the name of its secretary Ganesh on Tuesday in which they asked the people to demand governments, politicians, and cops for an alternative for ganja crop and not parivarthana which is nothing but attack on tribal populace. The Maoist leader said that they have been discouraging the public in their struggle areas. “We never supported it. We have been discouraging the tribals by clamping down on many conditions including that they should not engage laborers and pits number should be very less,” he said. He alleged that middlemen, police, and shaukars are getting benefits through ganja, not tribals. Munchingput police station sub-inspector Arun Kumar was involved in the ganja cultivation as he forcibly involved tribals in and around 1000 pits for plantation. Paderu DSP Raj Kamal was involved in the ganja trade and earned lakh of rupees, he alleged. Maoist leader Ganesh accused that people burnt the Dumbriguda police station three years ago following the murders of Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma because they have anger against sub-inspector of Dumbriguda because he cheated the farmers of Dumbriguda police station limits by involving them in ganja cultivation. Maoists leader Ganesh said that lack of water facility in Podu cultivation, drought conditions, and other factors forced the tribals to take up the ganja cultivation. Government should provide them alternatives. Ganesh gave a call to the tribals to attack the police whenever they visit the villages and destroy the ganja fields. However, the Visakha Range DIG LKV Ranga Rao gave a call to the public in tribal areas to come forward and follow the footsteps of villages which came forward to destroy the ganja crop on their own. This spirit should continue till the eradication of the ganja cultivation in the Visakha agency area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/visakhapatnam-maoists-allege-cops-involvement-in-ganja-cultivation-and-trade/articleshow/87495082.cms||---
---||Jammu||BJP ex-MLC Vikram Randhawa stripped of all posts over hate speech||JAMMU: A day after serving a show-cause notice to its former legislator Vikram Randhawa for his hateful remarks against a particular community, the J&K BJP removed him from all party posts, including that of the UT secretary, on Tuesday. The move came after Randhawa, in a video that went viral on social media, was allegedly found making offensive remarks about the community following Pakistan’s win in the recent T-20 cricket world cup. The party’s disciplinary committee has already initiated proceedings against the former MLC while J&K Police has filed an FIR in this regard. BJP’s UT vice-president Sham Choudhary — former minister and former MLA (Suchetgarh) — will be taking over Randhawa’s role. The show-cause notice served on Monday had asked Randhawa to explain his position on the issue within 48 hours besides issuing a public apology. He was also directed against addressing the media till the proceedings were over. J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina had said Randhawa’s remarks were against the party’s basic principles which believed in respecting all faiths. “This is unacceptable to the party and has brought (us) disrepute and embarrassment. Such conduct is likely to dent the party’s public image,” disciplinary committee chairman Sunil Sethi had said on Monday. In May, Randhawa was served a similar notice after he levelled corruption charges against Union minister Jitendra Singh over the issue of mining policy, over which he had even threatened to immolate himself.

---||World||Texas governor hosts Diwali event||TEXAS: The Governor of Texas Greg Abbott hosted a Diwali event at his home in downtown Austin last Sunday for a select group of prominent Indian Americans from all across Texas on the occasion of Diwali. The lamp has found a permanent home at the historic Governor's mansion, Abbott said at the event. The Diwali celebration has, in fact, become a regular event for the Texas Governor, for the last six years; with the only exception last year, when it wasn’t held because of the pandemic. Governor Abbott, who was dressed in a traditional Nehru jacket, welcomed prominent members of the Indian American community to his home along with First Lady Cecilia Abbott. They exchanged Diwali greetings with the guests and the governor addressed the gathering after lighting the ceremonial lamp. Abbott expressed his pride at being the first Texas governor to start celebrating the Indian festival of lights a few years back. It has become an annual event now. Arun Agarwal, CEO of Nextt, the Dallas-based home textile industry major, and co-founder of the Indian American CEO (IACEO) council, was behind the Diwali event this year. He gifted a pair of decorative elephants to the governor and the first lady on the occasion and appreciated the Governor's friendship with the Indian American community of Texas. "Texas is currently the second largest exporter of American goods to India and the fourth largest importer of Indian goods in the United States, and it is on a growth trajectory. Governor Abbott had a successful visit to India a couple of years back to further Texas-India trade relationship and cultural ties," said Agarwal. "Two of the world’s largest economies, Texas and India share a long and prosperous economic relationship. Indian-Americans have helped shape Texas’ economy, public policy and cultural landscape through their work in entrepreneurship, research, technology, medicine and education. The Indian diaspora has become such a critical mass in Texas, that going forward, the friendship between the two countries will only grow further. It is so nice to celebrate Diwali at the Texas Governor's mansion in Austin, it has a great symbolism of the growing influence of Indian Americans, and hence the soft power of India,” said Jiten Agarwal, a prominent Indian American business leader from Houston attending the Diwali celebration at the Governor's mansion. Some of the other Indian Americans present were Dr. Manoher Gurru, MD from Midland, Dr Satish Nayak from Andrews, Dr Deepak Chawda from Arlington, Rahul Agarwal, a student from UT Austin, Rachna Agarwal from Houston, Bangar Reddy from Houston, Ashok Mago from Dallas and Dr. Rajesh Gupta from Houston.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-governor-hosts-diwali-even/articleshow/87496052.cms||Ishani Duttagupta

---||India||Bypoll battle: TMC sweeps Bengal, BJP+ Assam, Congress Himachal||A clean sweep of five seats in Assam and a string of setbacks in Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, where it cumulatively failed to retain six constituencies, on Tuesday marked a bittersweet judgment day for BJP in byelections to 30 assembly and three Lok Sabha vacancies. While BJP individually won eight seats overall in this round of bypolls, Congress did a shade better by clinching nine, including two surprise victories in Himachal at its rival's expense. In Assam, BJP ended Congress’s three-decade run in Mariani and stormed Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF’s citadel Bhabanipur by fielding the two sitting MLAs, both of whom had defected to the saffron party recently. BJP also won the Thowra seat, while its Bodo ally UPPL completed a perfect 5 for NDA with victories in Tamulpur and Gossaigaon. Trinamool Congress’s thumping victory in all four assembly seats at stake in Bengal – Khardah, Santipur, Dinhata and Gosaba — ensured loss of ground for BJP not only in terms of the two seats it couldn’t retain there, but also vote share. In three of the four constituencies that went to polls, BJP candidates lost their security deposit. The result means Trinamool’s strength in the 294-member Bengal assembly rises to 217 while BJP's presence in Mamata Banerjee's fortress declines to 75, adding to the jolt of at least five party MLAs declaring they are not with the party anymore. Read AlsoBypoll battle: Congress wins big in Himachal, Trinamool sweeps West Bengal; BJP, ally consolidate in AssamThe results of the bypoll battle are out. While it is a mixed bag for both the BJP and the Congress, Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress has once again emerged as a clear winner. The BJP, as expected, continues to dominate in several states, especially the northeast. But the party will be hugelyHimachal Pradesh served up a double whammy for BJP, with Congress wresting the prestigious Mandi Lok Sabha and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seats from its rival. Congress waded into BJP territory in Rajasthan, too, winning the Dhariawad (ST) seat that was previously held by the saffron party. Congress retained the Vallabhnagar seat, increasing its assembly tally to 108. In Karnataka, BJP won big in Sindgi constituency of Vijayapura district, but its celebration was dented by the loss to Congress in CM Basavaraj Bommai’s home district of Haveri. The Hangal defeat is seen as a personal setback for Bommai as he represents its neighbouring segment – Shiggavi — in the assembly. “I’ve taken this electoral setback seriously, and will take corrective action,” Bommai said. JD(S), which had held the Sindgi seat, lost deposits in both constituencies that went to polls. Dadra & Nagar Haveli gave Shiv Sena its first Lok Sabha triumph outside Maharashtra, again at BJP's cost. Victorious candidate Kalaben Delkar’s late husband Mohan Delkar, a former BJP member, was the independent MP from this seat. Read Also1. Bypoll results a mixed bag for BJP, Cong sweeps HPHimachal Pradesh: In a major setback to the ruling BJP, the Congress won all three Assembly seats — Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai — in addition to the Mandi Lok Sabha seat. (Mandi is the home district of CM Jairam Thakur). The results hold significance as HP is scheduled to go to polls nextBihar CM Nitish Kumar's JD(U) retained both Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats in the state to maintain status quo for NDA. RJD finished second in both contests. Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Meghalaya didn't throw up any surprises, barring a slender victory margin in one seat within the farm heartland. The Ellenabad assembly bypoll in Haryana, which Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala had claimed would be a referendum on the farm agitation, saw a close contest between him and BJP. The margin of Chautala's victory declined from around 12,000 votes in the 2019 election to 6,375 in the bypoll. Former Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s detractor, Eatala Rajender, won the Huzurabad assembly seat for the seventh consecutive term on a BJP ticket. In Maharashtra, Congress won big against BJP to retain the Deglur (SC) assembly seat that fell vacant after the sitting MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar's death. His son Jitesh Antapurkar was the victor. Madhya Pradesh saw BJP scoring an emphatic victory in two of the three assembly seats along with Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency. BJP and Congress wrested a seat from each other that they hadn’t won in decades. While BJP bagged Jobat, Congress won Raigaon. In the NE states of Mizoram and Meghalaya, it was somewhat a zero-sum game for NDA allies. The Tuirial seat in Mizoram had BJP contesting against its NDA ally MNF, with the latter emerging victorious. Meghalaya saw all three NDA partners — BJP, NPP and UDP — in the fray for the Rajabala seat. CM Conrad Sangma's NPP won that seat.

---||India||Separate trials must for cross-cases, rules Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ruled that separate trials must be conducted for cross-cases lodged by two parties involved in an offence, even if the prosecution witnesses are the same for both sides, as law prohibits taking into consideration evidence in one case for the cross-case. Faulting the Madras HC for deciding two appeals arising from one incident and deciding it on the basis of evidence recorded in one case, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna said, “So far as the law for trial of the cross cases is concerned, each case has to be decided on its own merit and the evidence recorded in one case can’t be used in its cross case.” Justice Nath said, “Whatever evidence is available on the record of the case only that has to be considered. The only caution is that both trials should be conducted simultaneously or in case of the appeal, they should be heard simultaneously.” In a customs seizure case, there were two sets of accused and the trial court had tried them separately and acquitted the accused. However, when the revenue department filed appeals against acquittal, the HC had considered both appeals simultaneously and convicted the accused persons in both the cases based on the evidence in one of the two cases. Additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee argued that as the evidence is the same in both the cases, no prejudice can be alleged by the accused. Rejecting the argument and staying firm that each case has to be heard separately, the bench said, “Whether prejudice or not, the fact remains that the HC committed an error of law in dealing with the evidence of one trial for deciding both the appeals arising out of two separate trials.” The SC said, merely because the seven prosecution witnesses were the same in both the cases, it doesn’t mean that the evidence was identical and similar because in the oral testimony, the examination-in-chief and the cross examination are equally important and relevant. “Even if the examination-in-chief of all the seven witnesses in both the cases, although examined in different sequence, was the same, there could have been an element of some benefit accruing to the accused in each case depending upon the cross-examination which could have been conducted maybe by the same counsel or a different counsel,” it said. “The same witnesses could have deposed differently in different trials against different accused differently depending upon the complicity or/and culpability of such accused,” the SC said while remanding both the appeals to the HC for fresh consideration. The bench said culpability of any accused cannot be decided on the basis of any evidence, which was not recorded in his presence or his advocate’s presence and for which he did not get an opportunity of cross-examination, unless the case falls under exceptions of law, as noted above.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/separate-trials-must-for-cross-cases-rules-supreme-court/articleshow/87496869.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Most experts hail India’s 2070 pledge, say it’s transformative, equitable, just||NEW DELHI: PM Modi’s surprise announcement at the COP26 on Monday, committing India to a net-zero economy by 2070 and 50% renewables in the energy mix by 2030, was generally hailed by international experts as one of the key breakthroughs of the Glasgow conference although some expressed disappointment over the 50-year promise. Climate change expert Nicholas Stern called it a “very significant moment” for the summit. “This demonstrates real leadership… The rich world must respond to PM Modi’s challenge to deliver a strong increase in international climate finance,” he said, adding that it was a chance for India to show “it can deliver on both economic development and climate change”. While not many countries reacted to the announcement, UK PM Boris Johnson, representing the summit’s host government, welcomed the move. “India has today announced ambitious plans for half its energy to come from renewables by 2030. This will cut carbon emissions by a billion tonnes, contributing to a worldwide decade of delivery on climate change,” he tweeted. However, John Gummer, chair of the Climate Change Committee, a statutory body set up by the UK government, was quoted in the media as slamming India’s plans to reach net zero in 50 years’ time, saying it “really won’t do”. On the other hand, most experts said the commitment was “equitable and just” in the context of India’s current stage of development. Said Ulka Kelkar, climate director of the India chapter of the World Resources Institute, “If it is net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, I would say it’s on par with western commitments. The fair comparison, is not with the US and Europe as of today, but with the US and Europe of 20-30 years ago.” It wasn’t immediately clear in international circles whether the net-zero pledge by 2070 was for carbon emissions alone or for all greenhouse gases. “Country-wise net zero cannot be the same for all nations,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, who has advised the PMO. India’s target is “equitable and just,” he said. The Time magazine said climate advocates recognised that the 2070 target was further off than was ideal but it was potentially transformative for the world’s third-largest emitter (India) while Bloomberg noted that the net-zero target will give companies and investors some idea of the country’s long-term climate ambition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/most-experts-hail-indias-2070-pledge-say-its-transformative-equitable-just/articleshow/87496887.cms||---
---||World||US CDC advisers recommend Covid-19 vaccine for young children||Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday unanimously supported broad use of Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine in children ages 5 to 11, with shots potentially going into young arms as soon as Wednesday. They said the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of the vaccine. Much of their discussion stemmed from rare cases of heart inflammation that have been linked to the vaccine, particularly young men. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky must sign off on recommendations before the United States can begin administering the vaccine to children in the age group. The US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization of the vaccine in 5-11 year olds on Friday. The FDA authorized a 10-microgram dose of Pfizer's vaccine in young children. The original shot given to those age 12 and older is 30 micrograms. At the outset of the meeting Walensky said that pediatric hospitalizations had surged during the recent wave driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The risk from Covid-19 "is too high and too devastating to our children and far higher than for many other diseases for which we vaccinate children," she said. Walensky said school closures have had detrimental social and mental health impacts on children. "Pediatric vaccination has the power to help us change all of that," she said. The US government and Pfizer have already begun distributing the vaccine in preparation for a widespread rollout for children, many of whom are back in school for in-person learning. Earlier this week, the White House said the United States has enough supply of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for all 28 million children aged 5 to 11. While some children may be able to get their first shots as soon as Wednesday, the plans is for the US pediatric vaccine program to be running at full strength by next week, a Biden administration official said. Only a few other countries, including China, Cuba and the United Arab Emirates, have so far cleared Covid-19 vaccines for children in this age group and younger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-for-young-children/articleshow/87496993.cms||---

Considering the petition filed by Peter Myaliparambil, Justice N Nagaresh said it was a dangerous proposition and that someone may approach the court seeking removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s photograph from currency notes as it is their sweat and blood and doesn’t want the national leader’s face on the currencies. What would happen then, the court asked. Advocate Ajit Joy, who represented the petitioner, submitted that the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi was printed on currency notes as per the regulations of Reserve Bank of India whereas the prime minister’s photo was not fixed on vaccination certificates on the basis of any statutory provision. As the Centre sought time to file an affidavit informing their stance, the court has posted the case for hearing on November 23. Meanwhile, another bench of the Kerala HC on Tuesday said the Centre’s vaccination scheme has created two classes of citizens — those who received Covaxin and those who received Covishield. While the movement of those who received Covaxin is restricted, those who got Covishield can go anywhere, the court remarked while considering the plea of a man who had taken Covaxin and is now seeking a court directive to avail a third shot of a vaccine approved globally so that he can go to Saudi Arabia for employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/call-to-remove-pm-photo-from-vaccine-certificate-dangerous-hc/articleshow/87497057.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Student from Bengaluru held for post on liquor ban following Puneeth Rajkumar’s death||BENGALURU: The cybercrime police have arrested a 20-year-old student for posting a derogatory text on Instagram in relation to the ban on liquor sale after the death of actor Puneeth Rajkumar. The student, pursuing BSc in a private college in Andhra Pradesh, is a resident of North Bengaluru. He was picked up by police on Monday evening from his home and later arrested at night after confirmation that he had posted the messages, using his mobile phone. However, the student claimed that his message had been edited by miscreants, who added abusive words to original message. The student is said to have posted the message on Saturday night. The post had a picture of the accused holding a beer bottle inside a car. The message, in the now locked account, said: “Rajkumar cannot stop us.” However, the sentence also had some abusive words, which according to the accused, was put in by someone to frame him. When fans messaged him saying a police complaint has been lodged, accused student replied: “Aw-I am so scared.” “The student told us that he wanted to show that despite the ban of liquor across the city, he was capable of getting a beer. We are investigating whether the claim of his post being edited are true or not. But one thing is certain. He has used an abusive word in the original message,” an investigating officer said. According to police sources, the daughter of a Kannada film actor reacted first to the post, saying it was an inhuman act. Later, fans of Puneeth Rajkumar and others shared the post with politicians, police and city police commissioner Kamal Pant. On Monday night, Pant tweeted: “Accused is arrested and further legal action is being taken.” Booked under various sectionsThe accused has been booked under IPC Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) and the IT Act, 2000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/student-held-for-post-on-liquor-ban-following-puneeths-death/articleshow/87497159.cms||---

The team has shown that planets going around stars other than the Sun can be studied by observing polarisation of light and studying polarisation signatures using existing instruments. About a couple of decades ago, Sujan Sengupta, an IIA scientist suggested that the thermal radiation of hot young planets and the reflected light of planets orbiting other stars, known as extra-solar planets or exoplanets, would also be polarized and the measure of the polarization might unveil the chemical composition and other properties of the exoplanetary atmosphere. Subsequent confirmation of the prediction with the detection of polarization of many Brown Dwarfs — a kind of failed stars that have an atmosphere very similar to that of Jupiter — motivated researchers all over the world to build highly sensitive polarimeters and use polarimetric methods to probe exoplanetary environments.Recently, Aritra Chakrabarty, a postdoctoral researcher at IIA working with Sujan Sengupta, developed a detailed three-dimensional numerical method and simulated the polarization of exoplanets. Just like the Solar-planets, exoplanets are slightly oblate due to their rapid spin rotation.The research published in ‘The Astrophysical Journal’ says that scientists have developed a Python-based numerical code that incorporates a state-of-the-art planetary atmosphere model and employed all asymmetries of an exoplanet orbiting the parent star at different inclination angles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iia-team-develops-new-way-to-study-exoplanets/articleshow/87497160.cms||---

This Deepavali, she is lending a hand to her family business in designing and selling diyas. She says the business this year is better compared to 2020. “Last year, due to the pandemic, people did not venture out and we had close to no business. This year, we produced diyas keeping the previous scenario in mind. But surprisingly, the demand has increased,” she says, displaying unique designs of the lamps made from coconut shells. There are also hanging lamps that come with Lakshmi and Ganesha idols. Like Ramyashree, several local artisans are struggling to find a foothold in the market after a tough year, with an army of netizens batting for their cause. Many netizens are sharing addresses and landmarks of local artisans with pictures of their work and a recurring request of “not bargain”. A Twitter user, Astha Ojha tweeted: “Please don’t negotiate, pay what they deserve and brighten up their Diwali as well!” Anushree Dash, a netizen, who says she is the founder of ADiBha She Vision, an NGO for women, shared photos of herself shopping for diyas from a local vendor with the tweet: “Shop from #local vendors. Don’t bargain with them. Support their livelihood and be a part of their happiness.” A Twitter user @sarvamshivamaya also shared a video of an artisan Krishna Kembhavi, who displayed his diyas made of cow dung. In the video, Kembhavi is seen with a family member, Radha, and shows how his diyas are unbreakable and can float on water. “My cows stopped producing milk but I reuse the cow dung and cow urine I get from my cows. These diyas are among them, which we started making last year,” he says. Kembhavi adds the lightweight diyas (5 gms) are completely organic and even float on water. “Those interested can contact me (9480441134),” he says. Lokesh Narasimhamurthy, a hearing impaired and third-generation pottery maker, told TOI via text messages that he is skilled in pottery making, design and clay modelling design. His daughter Bhumika said his business has been only okay and they are expecting it to grow in the coming days. Twitter users also shared information about Deepavali lamps made by Karnataka’s self-help groups (National Livelihood Mission) that are even available on Amazon. IAS officer Manjushree N, the mission director of the National Livelihood Mission, government of Karnataka, tweeted the pictures of the earthen lamps. “NLM SHGs made Deepas are now available on Amazon in different combos. Can be searched as ‘Karnataka SHG made diyas’. Our support plays a vital role in strengthening our rural women.” Prema Nagesh, a resident of Jayanagar, said: “My kids showed me the importance of online ordering during the pandemic and I stayed indoors for our safety. But when we can step out, I want to make sure local vendors benefit.” Prema adds she has shopped for diyas worth Rs 4,000 from different sellers, which she will use for gifting as well as her own home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/buy-local-dont-bargain-with-vendors-appeal-netizens-ahead-of-deepavali/articleshow/87497162.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Palike misses second pothole deadline||Bengaluru: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has missed the second deadline it had set for itself to fill up potholes pockmarking roads across the city with disastrous consequences for motorists. Initially, the civic body set September 30 as the deadline for fixing potholes in Bengaluru. After citing rain as an excuse, the deadline was pushed by another 25 days. Now, a week later, the roads continue to be riddled with craters that have only become deeper and more menacing.Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner, had assured citizens that by October 10, the main roads and by October 20-25, ward roads would be freed of potholes. But nothing much has changed on ground.“Every time I ride from Jayanagar to Konanakunte, I feel my bones creaking,” said Kishore Sudhindra, a software employee. Kishore said that there are easily over 30 potholes on the 7-km stretch between his Jayanagar home and Konanakunte office.“Commuters using car are comparatively better off than us. We two-wheeler riders are more prone to accidents due to potholes as we end up running over craters or swerving suddenly to avoid them,” he added. Nandan Prakash, who used to cycle to work daily on the same stretch, said that he has now started taking the Metro as cycling has become difficult. “There are no roads to cycle, only potholes. Every other day, the cycle tyre would go flat. So I chose the Metro,” said Nandan, a design engineer. Chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, however, said that he did understand the troubles motorists were facing.Asked about the missed deadlines, Gupta said: “The deadline was set, but in Bengaluru where weather conditions are unpredictable, we cannot do much.”“The more worrisome thing is that our roads get damaged after it rains for a few days. I have been holding meetings with experts to see how we can bring about a permanent fix to this recurring problem,” he said.BWSSB and Bescom have taken up utility works on over 2,500-km of road and this is exacerbating the problem, explained the commissioner. In order to fix it, the BBMP chief has been holding zonal-level meetings with engineers of all ranks across civic agencies to work in cooperation and reduce citizen inconvenience. “I have informed the engineers of all agencies to give me a certificate of completion for their works and our engineers will inspect the same,” Gupta told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/palike-misses-second-pothole-deadline/articleshow/87497164.cms||Nithya Mandyam

A few are getting EV charging points for their small but growing number of students and staff using e-vehicles. “Not only are youngsters becoming climate-conscious and moving to cleaner sustainable solutions, they also want to try something new...EV fits in perfectly. The service providers want you to scan a code, take the vehicle and drop it off -- all these are attractive for youngsters. Moreover, they are cost-effective and fit their budgets. Every manufacturer designs products keeping in mind these youngsters,” said Pawan Mulukutla, director (electric mobility), World Resources Institute, an NGO.  Indian Institute of Science set up its off-grid, solar-based EV charging point in March this year. While the institute has EVs for both passengers and solid waste management, it is the latter that is using it daily as the number of students on campus is currently low. It is open to the public as well. “We are also undertaking a study to develop a dashboard on the EV charging infrastructure required for the city. It will include data like the optimal location, number of locations, what type of charging, among others. It will help agencies like Bescom and BBMP to take decisions and scale things up. Apart from the students, from the point of institute administration, they understand the importance of doing so. And these types of studies also will help them in upgrading the infrastructure,” said Ashish Verma, professor, transportation systems engineering. The campuses say they want to go green themselves and encourage those who are doing it. BNM Institute of Technology, which has 15 students and staff currently using it, says the interest among peers in electric vehicles is increasing. “We decided to come up with EV charging stations to encourage our students and faculty members to use EVs. The electric vehicle industry is booming, and this trend is being noticed among our students and faculty members too. There is also an increase in awareness about the adverse impact of fossil-fuel-based vehicles on the environment and the depleting fossil fuel reserves will soon create an energy crisis if we do not make the shift to EVs operating on green energy faster,” said SY Kulkarni, additional director, BNMIT, where preparations of setting up a charging point are under way. The soaring fuel prices also make students and staff look for alternatives. With awareness increasing, many are making the switch. “ This is a one-time investment and eco-friendly as well,” Bindu N, a fifth-semester engineering student, said. “Every accreditation body looks at how green your campus is. Apart from that, we all wanted to make some provision for the staff and students who are using EVs. They should not be discouraged from turning eco-friendly because of lack of infrastructure. Fuel prices are fluctuating so rapidly that they too are looking for alternatives,” said Ravishankar BV, the principal of BMS College of Engineering. The college has now one charging point, set up six months ago. Christ (deemed to be) University said it will also set up an EV charging point soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/e-vehicles-make-entry-into-campuses/articleshow/87497166.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Kengeri police have registered a case of theft against Hemanth, a resident of Mandya, based on a complaint filed by Kavitha P, an accountant. Kavitha told police that she resumed work around 8am and kept Rs 1.4 lakh, the previous day’s collection, in a room. Hemanth brought prasadam for her around 10.30am. She asked him to keep it in the room and gave him a key. Around 11.25am, she learnt that the money had gone missing, when the cash collector informed her that the door of the cash room was open. Hemanth reportedly feigned innocence and joined the others in searching for the money. Kavitha filed a theft case against an unknown person. Police learnt that only four people were inside the office when the incident took place and picked them up for interrogation. Hemanth confessed to his crime and police recovered the stolen money from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1-held-for-stealing-from-bescom-office/articleshow/87497167.cms||---

We were informed that the previous contractor had not given connections to any of the utilities, which is why the newly laid tiles on the pavement had to be dug up again.” Shopowners are currently using plywood planks to help shoppers cross the ditch and enter their establishments. They say they get the feeling that they are surrounded by a moat. Not only are the footpaths unfit for walking, but gravel and debris have been thrown onto the carriageway, inconveniencing vehicles.The president of Bangalore Commercial Association said, “After the work had nearly been completed on Commercial Street we were told that provisions for all the utilities were given, but none of the shops was given any connection. All shopowners on Commercial Street thought the provisions are pointless and connections to the utility must be given, which is why the work is currently being carried out.” Once the utilities have been connected to each individual shop, the tiles on the carriageway will also be replaced. “It would have saved a lot of the taxpayers’ money and everyone’s time if they had discussed the same with us before they had almost finished their work,” the association president said.Initially, when the project started, the shopowners were informed that the entire work would be completed in a span of 90 days. Nearly two years later, it is far from over.The secretary of Bangalore Commercial Association said, “All the work that was carried out in the past year and a half seem pointless today. During the first meeting, we were told this road will be built as per international standards. They told us it would not have any issues for the next 25 to 30 years, but didn’t they think that would be impossible considering they had not provided connection to the shops on the road?” The shopowners are worried that buyers will avoid visiting the street due to the mess and lack of parking. Also, cross roads linking Commercial Street to Veerapillai Street, Ibrahim Sahib Street and Kamaraj Road are currently being used to dump construction material and debris, making it difficult for vendors as well as shoppers.The shopowners blame Bengaluru Smart City Limited chief P Rajendra Cholan for their plight. The road was redeveloped under Smart City work. Cholan, however, did not respond to calls or messages from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/recently-relaid-comm-streetdug-up-again-traders-upset/articleshow/87497170.cms||---

Encouraged by the salubrious air, one of them took out a camera to take their pictures.“From nowhere, three policemen descended on the scene. They asked us for our driving licence and vehicle documents. We showed them what they asked for. Later, they asked us to come to Cubbon Park police station. They said they wanted to register a petty case against us for doing a photoshoot on Church Street,” Yashas said.The youngsters went to the police station. “We asked police what was wrong in doing a photoshoot on Church Street? If there is indeed such a ban, we would not have tried it,” Revant, one of the youths, said.The policemen said that thefts of valuables such as cameras and mobile phones were being reported on the street, and they had been directed by their superiors not to allow any photoshoot there and slap a petty case on those doing so. After many arguments and phone calls, police let the youths go without filing any case.When asked about the matter, DCP (central) MN Anucheth said, “Photoshoots are not banned anywhere. About police stopping the public from doing photoshoots on Church Street and threatening them with legal action, I will conduct an inquiry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/five-youngsters-clicking-photos-on-church-st-threatened-with-petty-case/articleshow/87497173.cms||---

The accident took place between 10.30pm and 11pm and passersby alerted jurisdictional police from Kengeri station who rushed to the spot. Based on the motorcycle licence plate, cops made futile attempt to identify the victim. “The bike was registered against an address in Begur. However, we did not come across the family of the victim at the address provided,” an investigating official said. The victim neither had a mobile phone with him, nor any documents like driving licence to establish his identity. Police suspect a heavy vehicle, mostly a truck, caused the accident. “We suspect that the vehicle rammed the victim’s bike from behind and then ran over him. Or else, the victim might have fallen down accidentally and the vehicle, which was coming from behind, mowed him,” police said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/motorist-mowed-down-on-nice-road/articleshow/87497175.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: After decade-long delay, Byappanahalli rail over bridge ready||BENGALURU: One of Bengaluru’s longest pending infrastructure projects is finally complete. The 810m-long rail over bridge (ROB) at Byappanahalli, which was proposed in 2010-11, touched the finish line after a delay of over a decade. Last month, minister for railways Ashwini Vaishnaw had said Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal (Byappanahalli third coaching terminal) will be opened only after connectivity issues are resolved. The Rs 314-crore Sir MV terminal which offers airport-like facilities and was ready in March 2021 is yet to be inaugurated. TOI had carried a series of articles regarding the delay of Byappanahalli ROB. The new facility will ensure connectivity between Sir MV terminal and Swami Vivekananda Metro Station on Old Madras Road. However, the two-lane wide structure is unlikely to reduce congestion. BBMP recently floated a tender for another two-lane ROB along this bridge. The Palike is planning to build an elevated rotary flyover at Maruthi Seva Nagar–IOC junction However, it is not clear when these two projects will be completed. South Western Railway officials confirmed that the structure is complete. “Only some finishing work and painting are pending,” said an official. However, BBMP is yet to complete road and drainage work on the approach road from Old Madras Road. While streetlights have been installed on the ROB, they are yet to be functional. SWR officials said work on the ROB was stopped in 2012 after Madras Engineers’ Group (Madras Sappers) refused permission to carry out construction work on its land. Work resumed only in 2019 after the defence ministry gave the nod. However, the project which was supposed to be completed in June 2020 missed a series of deadlines. SWR officials said ROB work faced several obstacles, including delay in getting permission from defence and shortage of workers due to the pandemic and lockdowns. SWR officials said they have already completed the subway below the ROB for two-wheelers and pedestrians. The facility will also provide better access to areas like Maruthi Seva Nagar and Old Byappanahalli to Old Madras Road. It will eliminate two level-crossing gates on theBengaluru-Chennai railway line, which sees frequent passenger and goods train movement. Many regular commuters said they are relieved now. “It’s better late than never. BBMP should complete the road work. The approach road is unsafe for commuters, especially for women at night. We want SWR to open this ROB without further delay,” said Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Old Byappanahalli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-decade-long-delay-byappanahalli-rob-ready/articleshow/87497178.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Teen from Bengaluru wins global award for work on mental health||BENGALURU: An 18-year-old girl from Bengaluru is among the 100 Rise Global Winners, an award funded by philanthropists Wendy and Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google. Kaavya Janaki Mundkur, a class 12 student of Inventure Academy, has been acknowledged for her work on mental health through her project Kara. As a queer teenager and swimmer who faced a physical condition in her leg since birth, Kaavya’s story is one of perseverance, integrity, empathy and calling, that helped her achieve the global recognition. “I am privileged. When people hear about a queer teen growing up in India, they expect to hear the story of a child who struggled for acceptance. I did not. I was lucky to be part of a family and school that readily accepted me. I can talk about my sexuality and mental health freely but for many others, that is not the case. Because of the stigma and abuse they are subjected to, they are at a higher risk of mental health. A big reason for my work with Project Kara is to use the privilege I have to help others,” she said. “As a queer teen, many people look at me as abnormal. In my interactions on misogyny and homophobia and the news I read, I fear for my safety constantly when I step out, which took a toll on my mental health. I want to use Project Kara to alleviate this strain not only for advocating equal rights and normalising our sexuality, but also by creating a space where we can have conversations on building a safe place,” she said. Kaavya added: “Things became difficult in my life because of my self-imposed stigma and internalised homophobia. But my family, school and friends kept me going. Nothing seemed difficult when I was with people. Only when I was alone did I start feeling low. That’s the power of conversation. We want Kara to be that community that will never make you feel alone.” Kara offers contacts of counsellors who specialise in adolescence mental health. “We hope to start funding the counselling because access to it becomes a problem due to financial status,” she added. Kaavya plans to focus either on public policy or education. “Public policy because I want to be an active hand in policy-making and implementing solutions that I am passionate about — mental health and LGBTQ rights, among others. Education because I believe I can continue discussions about the subjects I am passionate about and have the same impact on my students that my educators had on me,” she said. The award winners will receive a four-year, post-secondary scholarship at any accredited university, funding for their projects for public good and a fully funded, three-week residential summit with other members of the Rise Global Winners cohort. Kaavya’s parents are lawyers and she was raised in Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teen-wins-global-award-for-work-on-mental-health/articleshow/87497180.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||India||India’s new climate targets could mean emissions peaking after 2030||GLASGOW: India through its new climate action commitments has not only demonstrated its seriousness in responding to the climate crisis but also put the ball back in the court of affluent nations by shouldering more than its fair share of burdens and securing a diplomatic edge by pitching itself as a voice of developing countries seeking accountability from rich nations on their finance promises. Though more clarity on how India would achieve its goals may come through the country’s formal submission of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the fine-print of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech looks bolder than what appeared initially as it has clearly hinted that the country may try to peak its carbon emission after 2030 backed by a huge renewables push. Even as the announcement on ‘net zero’ by 2070 has become a centrepiece of commentary, the real objectives are the pledge to reduce carbon emission in absolute terms – with mitigation currently measured in reduction of carbon intensity (emission per unit of GDP) — and asking the global forum to track the progress on climate finance the way it is being done on climate mitigation (emission reduction). Nevertheless, there has always been an agreement among observers that the country could peak its emission during 2040-45. Modi on Monday announced India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030. It means the country would reduce 22% of greenhouse gases (GHG) in carbon equivalent from its total inventory in 2030. The country’s entire GHG inventory is currently less than 3 billion tonnes and it will be 4.5 billion tonnes in 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario. “It also sets the stage for carbon markets. In a way this means absolute emission reductions and this also means that India has set itself to commit to a peak in emissions without saying so explicitly,” said R R Rashmi, distinguished fellow, TERI and India’s former climate negotiator. As far as announcing the ‘net zero’ goal is concerned, India has successfully resisted the pressure from the developed countries to join the 2050 league and instead put it on 2070 timeline which in a way signals foreign and domestic investors who want to invest in manufacturing (Make in India) and development of green technologies in the country. It also indicates that nations with historic responsibilities must pay up. “In fact, by announcing these targets, India is not only walking its talk, it is literally running the talk — and recognising the urgent need to reduce GHG emissions and combat climate change. Going by our comparatively low contribution to global emissions, coupled with the fact that our economy needs to grow and meet the energy needs of millions of poor citizens, we did not need to make such an ambitious pledge. But these are a challenge to the already rich world to step up,” said Sunita Narain, environmentalist and director general of the New Delhi-based policy group, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Referring to the CSE analysis on the issue, she said, “As far as the net-zero 2070 is concerned, India’s target matches the commitment of the already industrialised. The fact is that the world must reach net-zero by 2050, which means that the OECD countries should get there by 2030 and China by 2040 (not in 2060 as announced by the country)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-new-climate-targets-could-mean-emissions-peaking-after-2030/articleshow/87497158.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Bengaluru||Only auction can ensure uniformity in leasing of municipal properties: HC||Bengaluru: Uniformity in allotment/leasing of shops and properties owned by municipal bodies can only be achieved by adopting a transparent procedure like public auction in which every citizen is permitted to participate, the high court said in a recent order.The observation was made while directing Arkalgud town panchayat in Hassan district to auction all the 112 shops under its control by issuing a fresh notification. The panchayat had put up 61 shops for auction and the rest were under occupation by way of lease.Partly allowing a batch of petitions filed by occupants of 38 shops, Justice M Nagaprasanna noted that the provisions of law have to be so construed so as to keep individuals’ or a class interest subordinate to larger public interest.“Public bodies have a right to put the properties belonging to them in auction and augment their income and deal with it in a manner more advantageous to them. Any direction not to hold auction or to renew the lease will lead to monopoly. If such a right is allowed, it would amount to nudging the other contenders. A few people cannot hold the entire town municipal council to ransom by getting into properties and dictating their terms. Therefore, it is always necessary that such rights are auctioned out by way of public auction,” the judge further observed while quashing the September 20, 2021 auction notification issued by the town panchayat seeking to auction 61 shops.The claim of 38 petitioners to extend their lease till 2024, however, was rejected by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-auction-can-ensure-uniformity-in-leasing-of-municipal-properties-hc/articleshow/87497182.cms||---

The company will raise Rs 5,000 crore through issuance of fresh shares and will have an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 2,460 crore from existing investors like private equity firm Carlyle, SoftBank Vision Fund and Times Internet. Other shareholders diluting their stake include founders Kapil Bharati, Mohit Tandon and Suraj Saharan. While Bharati is offloading about 7 million shares, the other two are selling about 11 million.

The financial data was accessed by business intelligence platform Tofler. The profit is due to a tight lid on costs the company put in place, which dropped 75% to Rs 682 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, from Rs 2,683 crore in the year before. Operating revenue had plunged 65% to Rs 689 crore, from about Rs 2,000 crore, due to the pandemic. “Due to the prevailing Covid pandemic circumstance and nationwide lockdown imposed by the government of India, the revenue of the company had been impacted severely,” Ola said in the report. Last year, during the first wave, Ola said that its revenue had nosedived 95%. Aggarwal said in September the company’s gross merchandise value (GMV) had crossed the pre-pandemic levels in the last week of August and recovery from the second wave had been three times faster compared to the first wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ola-sees-90cr-operating-profit-for-its-mobility-biz/articleshow/87497188.cms||---

---||Business||RBI governor asks banks not to let down their guard||MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday met with bank chiefs and asked them to remain vigilant to any emerging signs of vulnerabilities and take timely remedial measures to mitigate the risks. Even as Das acknowledged the resilience of the banking sector, the central bank sought to beef up pre-emptive action against weak banks by reworking its prompt corrective action (PCA) norms to enable supervisory intervention at the right time and use of lending restrictions as a tool for market discipline. The note of caution comes at a time when there is increased optimism in respect of the economy even as pandemic-related stress continues to be felt in some sectors. Bankers have started talking of recovery even as several countries in the world are going through a third phase of lockdowns. Das on Monday held separate meetings with the MDs and CEOs of public sector banks and some private banks through videoconferencing. He advised banks to take timely remedial measures to mitigate the risks and maintain the stability of not only the institutions themselves but also of the overall financial system. Several other matters, including credit flows, especially to micro and small enterprises, were also discussed during the meetings. Das sought feedback from bank chiefs on the outlook for stressed assets and measures for mitigation, pricing of risks and the collection efficiencies experienced by banks. He also asked banks about their engagement with fintech entities. This was the first meeting with banks after Das was granted a fresh three-year term by the government last week. The meeting was attended by RBI’s deputy governors M K Jain, M Rajeshwar Rao and T Rabi Sankar. The new norms for PCA come after most weak banks have exited the lending restrictions imposed by the central bank under its earlier framework for early corrective action. A record number of 11 banks were placed under PCA after banks saw a surge in bad loans following RBI’s asset quality review in 2016. “The PCA framework does not preclude the RBI from taking any other action as it deems fit at any time, in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the framework,” RBI said. Bankers said that in the past banks were placed under PCA based on their audited financial results and now the indications are that the RBI might impose the restrictions if it feels that they are required based on its supervision. On Tuesday, RBI deputy governor Jain said that the central bank was also focusing on governance reforms. He said that banks need to put in place governance standards to be worthy of public trust. “Being highly leveraged entities and with the interconnectedness, there must be a separation between ownership and management, so that they operate on professional lines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-governor-asks-banks-not-to-let-down-their-guard/articleshow/87495548.cms||---

In addition, the group entities held Rs 16,700 crore in cash and another Rs 21,000 crore of sale and resolution plans are pending final approval. “Effectively, lenders have got a 60% recovery from something that was a basket case,” said Kotak. “We had earlier given an estimate that the total resolution would be around Rs 61,000 crore (of total debt of around Rs 99,000 crore). We believe by March we should be around Rs 57,000 crore,” said Kotak. While close to 93% of the expected resolution would be achieved by the end of the financial year, the policymakers would need to take a call on how to deal with the remaining lot of 97 of 347 companies in the group. These included entities that have partnered with state governments. “The public interest board has done the hard work, having done 93% of the resolution. It is now for policymakers to take a call,” said Kotak at a briefing to provide an update on IL&FS. Kotak said that there would be four options. The first was to put in more hard work and persevere to get the best possible recoveries, the other options included putting in place an administrator to manage the remaining assets, liquidation or a fire sale of the companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-has-resolved-over-rs-52200cr-of-debt-kotak/articleshow/87495591.cms||---

On a day when Pratip Chaudhuri, former SBI chairman, was denied bail by a court in Rajasthan, more bankers expressed concern over the summary arrest of the senior banker. The IBA has said that it is going to seek an appointment with the Rajasthan chief minister it is also going to write to the chief secretary. The FIR had already been quashed by the Supreme Court. “I do not know the facts of the case but, based on what I have read, we really need to have a criminal justice system which protects bona fide actions by bankers for recovery of their money,” said veteran banker Uday Kotak. He added that there has to be a method by which that action has to be protected. Describing the arrest as an unfortunate incident, Union Bank MD & CEO Rajkiran Rai said that authorities must understand the banker’s perspective before taking such drastic action and it was not good that an arrest was done without inquiry. “It disturbs us that the former SBI chairman has got arrested for a decision that does not come to the chairman level,” said Rai. In an interview to CNBC, former chief of Punjab National Bank and IBA secretary Sunil Mehta said that the action will play a negative role on the morale of bankers as banks have to take many such decisions. He said that for every decision with respect to disposal of an NPA, there is a due process that is documented. He added that even Chaudhuri’s joining the board of the ARC would have been subsequent to a due process. Alchemist ARC has described the arrest as bizarre and said that Supreme Court had earlier quashed an FIR aimed at stymieing the sale of the hotel property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/more-bankers-express-concern-over-ex-sbi-chairmans-arrest/articleshow/87495565.cms||Mayur Shetty

Yellow metal worth Rs 372 crore or 750 kilogram was sold in Gujarat on these two auspicious occasions this year. For gold, this has been the best Diwali in last five years, said jewellers. Around 300 kg gold was traded across the state on Dhanteras, while the sales were about 450 kg on Pushya Nakshatra, which fell on October 28, shows estimates by India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA). “Muhurat gold sales increased 150% against an estimated 300 kg traded on last year's Pushya Nakshatra-Dhanteras festivals in Gujarat,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA. Pent-up demand, investors faith in gold as an asset class and many wedding occasions scheduled after Diwali have propelled gold sales during the ongoing Diwali festivities, said jewellers. Gold price settled at Rs 49,600 per 10 gram on Tuesday in the Ahmedabad market. “After a period of five years, gold demand in Gujarat is at this level. Sales volumes were largely driven by wedding jewellery purchases. Coins and bars purchases also caused an upswing in demand. Investors have kept their faith intact in gold, especially after leveraging on good returns on their investments during and after the pandemic. Therefore, people are investing in big numbers in anticipation of prices firming up in the coming months,” added Acharya. Jewellers suggest that that consumer sentiment overall remained positive as customers walked-in to buy light-weight jewellery including rings, earrings, light-weight neck chains and other trinkets. According to estimates, at least 100kg gold would have been traded in Ahmedabad alone on Dhanteras. Besides gold, demand for silver remained good too. Silver price settled at Rs 66,200 per kg in the Ahmedabad market on Tuesday. Several young buyers are coming out to buy both gold and silver jewellery as well as bullion, as they have realised the importance of saving up, suggest industry players. “Silver demand has opened up very well this festive season and young buyers have come out in huge numbers to purchase light-weight silver jewellery. It is not just light on the pocket but also comes with elegant designs. In fact, jewellers are launching their specialised collection of silver jewellery as well,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-regains-glitter-best-diwali-sales-in-5-yrs/articleshow/87495489.cms||Niyati Parikh

Ever heard of a cryptocurrency bearing the trademarks ‘Tata coin’ or ‘$Tata’? Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, was unsuccessful in its bid to seek a permanent injunction from the Delhi high court restraining Hakunamatata Tata Founders and others from using the trademark ‘Tata’ as part of the name under which the cryptocurrency was made available to the public or as part of their corporate or domain name. The domain names tatabonus.com and hakunamatata.finance that enabled the purchase and sale of the ‘Tata’ cryptocurrency were set up in June and May of 2021 respectively. The reason Tata Sons could not succeed is because it could not prove to the satisfaction of the court that the foreign parties (the defendants) intended to target India as a customer base. The defendants in this lawsuit, filed by Tata Sons with the Delhi high court, were companies based in the US and the UK with no India presence. They were located outside the sovereign borders of India and statutorily outside the reach of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In this backdrop, the “intention to target India as a customer base was of paramount importance” for Tata Sons to make its case. “The mere fact that the defendants’ cryptocurrency can be purchased by customers located in India and that, as a result, the plaintiff’s brand value may be diluted, even seen cumulatively, cannot in my view justify this court interfering with the defendants’ activities, or with its brand or mark,” held Justice C Hari Shankar. Apparently, the defendants’ cryptocurrency could be purchased — using the QR Code and the methodology indicated on the defendants’ website — by a customer located anywhere in the world. This factor therefore, too, cannot indicate any conscious targeting of the Indian customer base by the defendants. Nor do the websites or social media accounts prove any intent to target customers covered by the high court’s jurisdiction. “If at all they target customers, they target customers across the world,” the judge observed. Tata Sons didn’t respond to an emailed query on the issue. Sources told TOI that Tata Sons is considering to pursue this case in the UK court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-hc-relief-for-tatas-on-use-of-their-trademark-as-crypto-coin/articleshow/87495610.cms||Lubna Kably

The results were declared on Tuesday. While the RJD trailed in Kusheshwar Asthan throughout the day, the counting of votes in Tarapur produced a cliffhanger, as the the JD(U) and RJD candidates kept on overtaking each other till Sah secured 75,145 votes and lot to Rajiv Kumar Singh from JD(U), who polled 78,966 votes. RJD garnered 47,184 votes against 59,882 polled by Aman Bhushan Hazari of JD(U)in Kusheshwar Asthan. The RJD-led grand alliance’s belligerent partner Congress ended fourth at both places, ceding the third place to the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) candidates. In terms of immediate impact, the two parties played spoilsport for the RJD. Chirag failed to damage the stakes of the JD(U) of CM Nitish Kumar, as he had done at several other seats in the 2020 assembly election. When RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav claimed during the electioneering that his party candidates will win both the seats, he was only defying the time-tested political truism as, normally, the ruling party or combine wins a byelection, more so when the polling is not brisk. “I am not surprised by the results. Generally, the ruling party wins it,” CPI state secretariat member Ram Babu Kumar said. The three major Left parties – CPI(ML), CPI and CPM – had supported the RJD candidates and campaigned for them. “We thank voters who are the masters,” said a humbled Tejashwi, and added: “We strongly contested the two seats against the five-party combine (of the NDA). The RJD secured more votes than before.” Tejashwi’s claim like “securing more votes than before” is being seen as a poor consolation for his party by the observers, as the results also proved that the combined crowd-pulling capacity of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi could not dent the image of Nitish in the state. To add to that, the declaration by Tejashwi and Lalu that the Nitish government would fall after the results has ended up as a mere rhetorical flourish, observers noted. By corollary, as the observers felt, the JD(U) brass and Nitish would have a huge relief and position of strength, when they would bargain for seats with the BJP pertaining to the assembly elections in UP early next year. The JD(U) needs to win at least 13 assembly seats in UP on way to getting recognition as a national party, but whether the BJP would oblige and how many seats it would finally cede is a matter best left for the future. Meanwhile, it is the Congress that has been worsted to its tattered rags, but the party still thinks that if the RJD-Congress alliance had been intact, both the parties would have been the gainer. “However, the odd position of the Congress is that no one can take credit for what has happened. The only alternative left is to start rebuilding it from zero. We have ample time for it – three years before the Lok Sabha elections (2024) and four years before the 2025 assembly elections,” Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-magic-fails-to-work-for-rjd-in-state-assembly-bypolls/articleshow/87494619.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt wins case over trademark rights for ‘Sardar’||AHMEDABAD: The state government has asserted its trademark rights over the word ‘Sardar’ for the iron man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and forced an industrialist to change the name of one of his products. Gujarat government’s PSU, Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC), has last year sued one Dashrath Patel of Indian Agro Chemicals having its unit in Dholka GIDC for infringement of PSU’s trademark Sardar. The industrial unit had branded its fertilizer as ‘Sardar Seven Star’. As soon as GSFC came to know about this, it filed a trademark suit with the Ahmedabad rural court in Mirzapur in September 2020 claiming that it enjoys trademark rights over the word ‘Sardar’ for various fertilizer and chemical products because it has got a registered label since 1967. GSFC demanded that Indian Agro be ordered to stop the sale of its product under any name that uses the word Sardar and is deceptively similar to the registered trademark. It even sought Rs 1 crore damages for loss of reputation and goodwill with 12% interest per annum. Indian Agro immediately accepted GSFC’s claim and dropped the word Sardar from its product brand and changed it to Sarkar Seven Star. However, it felt that the use of the word ‘Sarkar’ could also land it in trouble, it stopped using the word Sarkar also. Last month, the company informed the court that it has already stopped using the disputed trademark and has done away with words – Sardar and Sarkar – and hence the court may not order it to pay any damages to GSFC. It also assured the court that it would not use these disputed trademarks for its products. In an order passed last week, special judge SSP Jain of commercial court accepted Indian Agro’s undertaking and the settlement between both the companies and put an end to the dispute. This was a second run-in for GSFC with any private industry for its assertion over the Sardar brand. A few years ago, it had dragged one Sardar Biochem Fertilizer to city court on this issue. But the company’s owner, Ashok Patel, was adamant regarding ownership of brand Sardar and put forth an argument that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel belongs to the Patidar community. Being a community member, he enjoys a right to use the word ‘Sardar’. Patel passed away during the pandemic last year and GSFC withdrew its case, said Patel’s advocate Samrat Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-govt-wins-case-over-trademark-rights-for-sardar/articleshow/87495509.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Patna||Voters once again repose faith in Nitish’s devpt model, says JD(U)||PATNA: By ensuring the victory of JD(U) candidates in both Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly bypolls, the voters have once again reposed faith in the development model of CM Nitish Kumar, JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha told TOI after the results were announced on Tuesday. “Our leader Nitish Kumar executed different kinds of development works across the state with the motto of ‘Development with Justice.’ The people have once again reposed their faith in the development model of Vikas Purush Nitish Kumar,” Kushwaha said. However, Nitish congratulated the public of Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur for ensuring victory of JD(U) candidates. “In democracy, people are the masters and they have pronounced their verdict,” Nitish said in a statement. With this triumph, the number of JD(U) MLAs in the 243-member assembly has once again reached 45. The party had won 43 seats in the 2020 assembly polls. Later, the lone BSP MLA, Zama Khan, and the only LJP MLA, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the JD(U). However, the party’s sitting MLAs Shashi Bhushan Hazari (Kusheshwar Asthan) and Mewalal Choudhary (Tarapur) died of Covid-19, leading to byelection in both the constituencies. In Kusheshwar Asthan, JD(U) fielded Shashi Bhushan’s son Aman Bhushan while in Tarapur, Rajiv Kumar Singh was made the party candidate as Mewalal’s son lives in the US and was not ready to contest the bypolls. “The victory of NDA-supported JD(U) candidates is the triumph of the policies and programmes of CM Nitish Kumar. It shows the people still have faith in the policies of Nitish,” JD(U)’s former state president and Rajya Sabha member Bashishtha Narain Singh said. “The bypoll results are also a lesson for those who believe in the politics of ‘Visarjan’ (immersion),” Singh said, in an oblique reference to the controversial statement of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who had said he (Lalu) would ensure the ‘Visarjan’ of CM Nitish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/voters-once-again-repose-faith-in-nitishs-devpt-model-says-jdu/articleshow/87494580.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Vijayawada||Cotton prices hit Rs 10,000, ride wave of low yield||AMARAVATI: Diwali has arrived a little earlier for cotton farmers as prices have touched Rs 10,000 per quintal against Rs 5,000 last year. The farmers are jubilant over the rising prices as they are likely to fetch decent profits in the next two months. Although unseasonal rains are worrying farmers in some places, a majority are relieved as they have sold their first pick of the yield during the current season. Sources said prevailing prices are the highest in the recent past and are likely to go up in the next few weeks depending on quality of the stock. Market analysts said reports about low yields from the cotton producing states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh due to heavy rains and cyclones are reported to have created demand for cotton from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Traders initially offered around Rs 6,500 per quintal at the beginning of the season last month and slowly increased prices. With more players joining the trade, prices jumped to Rs 10,000 per quintal in select markets, including Adoni in Kurnool district. Sources said the textile industry returning to full production levels after nearly two years is also a major reason for increased demand for cotton across the globe. Interestingly, the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has not launched procurement operations by setting up purchase centres anywhere in the state due to heavy demand for stocks from traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cotton-prices-hit-rs-10k-ride-wave-of-low-yield/articleshow/87494810.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Suicides linked to ‘illness’ rise as Covid hits wellbeing||VIJAYAWADA: In the wake of Covid-19, Andhra Pradesh has seen a huge spike in suicides owing to illnesses in 2020, according to the Accidental Deaths and Suicides of India (ADSI) 2020 report released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). As many as 2,238 persons ended their lives due to illness, accounting for 31% of the 7,043 suicides in Andhra Pradesh. ADSI data show that ‘family problems’ was the second major reason for suicides in the state, with a share of 26%. Compared to 2019, there has been a 21% increase in suicides due to illness as the reason and a 39% increase from 2018. While Covid-19 related suicides have not been categorised in the latest NCRB report, 76% of 2,238 deaths is left under the ‘other prolonged illnesses’ category. A total of 452 people ended their lives due to mental health issues, of which 26 had Aids and STDs, 17 due to cancer and 24 due to paralysis. Experts claim that the spike in suicides due to illness can be attributed to Covid-19 as several instances of suicides from government hospitals, quarantine centres and elderly persons were reported in 2020. “Some Covid-19 patients, who attempted suicide, were referred to me for counselling in the last one-and-a half-years and point to two main fears – the fear of paying hospital bills and the stigma associated with the disease,” RV Shekhar, a city-based clinical psychologist told TOI. A profession-wise analysis of suicide victims in 2020 shows that a majority (2,501) were daily wage earners with an income of less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. Self-employed and farmers ranked second and third, respectively. Student suicides saw a significant spike of 22% in the state. Of the 469 student suicides in AP, 100 students took the extreme step due to failure in an examination. Other reasons behind suicides in the state include bankruptcy, marriage-related issues, death of a dear person, love affairs, poverty and property disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/suicides-linked-to-illness-rise-as-covid-hits-wellbeing/articleshow/87494847.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of resident forums in New Town, and the Eco Park Police were informed and the news circulated in WhatsApp groups. Cops went to the spot to douse the fire. Last year, local resistance groups were formed in coordination with New Town Kolkata Development Authority and the police to prevent the burning of grass and biomass on open land which had caused a lot of air pollution, leading to the death of many birds in the area. Locals said the large vacant area surrounding the plot has seen the most frequent biomass burning incidents. “A coordinated approach along with NKDA, police, local NGOs and watch groups which was done last year can prevent the recurrence of this nuisance,” residents said. Biomass burning in New Town was rampant last year. The matter first came to light when a few Red Munia birds were killed and their nest gutted after some miscreants set the grass on fire at a plot opposite Eco Park.“Birds were killed last year due to the rampant biomass burning during last year’s winter. It also causes huge air pollution. We cannot let this happen again,” said NTFN chairperson Samaresh Das. Last year resistance groups were formed and awareness drives were conducted with volunteers keeping a constant watch in groups. NKDA also provided a water tanker to douse the fire whenever any such incident was reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stubble-burning-back-in-new-town/articleshow/87495251.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The rush was huge in the evening when buying something new is considered auspicious on Dhanteras. Automobile, electronic and electrical showrooms, jewellery shops, malls and supermarkets were open till late hours. There was a big rush at the jewellery shops in the city with gold in high demand. Madan Gupta, owner of a jewellery showroom on Boring Canal Road, said, “As we have offered discounts on making of gold, silver and diamond jewellery, the response was overwhelming. Many people who had placed order earlier received their jewellery on Dhanteras. More than 100 gold coins were sold.” Umesh Tikriwal, managing director of another showroom on Fraser Road, people bought idols, chains, pendants, coins, rings and jewellery sets. Some other jewellery shop owners said the sales increased almost threefold this time when compared to previous year. The president of state unit of Swarnkar Samaj Vikas and Shodh Sansthan (a national body of goldsmiths and jewellers), Arun Kumar Verma, said ornaments worth Rs 5 crore were booked in Patna ahead of Dhanteras. “The estimated sales in Patna till 11pm was Rs 11-12 crore,” he added. Many people queued up at electronic shops to exchange their old products with new ones. Shops selling electronic goods like television, refrigerator, home appliances, laptops, cellphones, washing machines, purifiers and other gadgets did brisk business. Yashovardhan Sinha, chairman-cum-managing director of an electronic company, said he was expecting sales of Rs 40-50 crore on Dhanteras at their 22 showrooms in Patna. Ashutosh Kumar, sales executive of an electronic showroom near Bandar Bagicha, said, “We sold more than 105 articles till 7pm. High-end cellphones and laptops were in high demand,” he said.

---||Patna||Use of fireworks on spl occasions in vogue since medieval times: Experts||PATNA: Though firecrackers have been banned in at least four districts, including Patna, during Diwali and Chhath festivals, historians and social scientists have varied accounts of the history of their use. But almost all of them agree that the use of fireworks in the Diwali celebration in India must have been prevailing since 1400AD, when gunpowder came in use in Indian warfare. Earlier, gunpowder was dubbed as “devil’s distillate”, as it terrified and fascinated onlookers with its flash and bang. Patna University (PU) ancient Indian history and archaeology department’s former head Jayadeo Mishra said fireworks and pyrotechnic shows existed as a form of royal entertainment in many medieval Indian kingdoms during festivals, events and special occasions like weddings. But at that time, they were probably quite expensive and hence commissioned mainly by the rulers for personal and citizen entertainment or by the economically well-to-do people, he said. Mishra further said when the Mughal empire was breathing its last and the British East India Company was establishing its roots in India, the gunpowder manufacturers started making fireworks also, the raw materials for which were always readily available in the country. By the end of the 18th century, however, its military use was phased out in favour of newer explosives like dynamite. Since then, the medieval technology’s principal use remained in the fabrication of fireworks, he said. Magadh University’s retired history teacher Asha Tripathy said, “The use of firecrackers became prevalent in the 19th century when it became a medium of pomp and show for the princely class and feudal landlords during Diwali. Subsequently, it became popular among masses as well and got integrated with the festival. The use of fireworks in a big way during the Diwali festival came into vogue after the 1950s with the establishment of many manufacturing units in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu near Sivakasi.” She further pointed out that with the increase in the population and economic prosperity of the Indian middle class, especially in the last three decades, and with ready supply coming in from the flourishing domestic industry, bursting of firecrackers only grew and never looked back. Even legislations enacted from time to time restricting the use of firecrackers during festivals failed to dampen the spirit, she added. Social activist Tilak Gandhi said the firework industry in India is worth more than Rs70,000 crore. It has been a prime contributor to the ever-increasing air pollution all around. Despite severe restrictions on the use of harmful poisonous chemicals in the firecrackers, the industries have been using them freely, endangering the lives of innocent people. Citing the recent observations of the Supreme Court, Gandhi said Diwali revellers should not be permitted to play with the lives of others in the guise of celebration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/use-of-fireworks-on-spl-occasions-in-vogue-since-medieval-times-experts/articleshow/87493364.cms||B K Mishra

Mayor Birendra Kumar alias Ganesh Paswan said additional workers have been pressed into service to ensure cleanliness at the Chhath ghats. “Necessary arrangements, such as installation of lights and carpeting, are being made at different ghats of the Falgu river. As water is available in the Falgu, kunds will not be made at the riverbank. When the riverbed is dry, the civic body makes kunds,” he said, adding small culverts would be made at the ghats where drain water is flowing. The mayor added one-way path would be made at each ghat with deputation of volunteers. “Parking arrangements for vehicles will also be made near the ghats,” he said. A Chhath devotee, Abha Kumari of Chhotki Delha locality, said, “Due to Covid restrictions, most devotees could not observe Chhath last year. Many offered ‘arghya’ to the Sun god at home. This year, the situation has improved following mass vaccination. Hence, people are making preparations to celebrate Chhath festival with traditional fervour.

The incentive was given under the Bihar Clean Fuel Scheme. The minister said the scheme was aimed at controlling vehicular pollution in urban areas and promoting clean fuel by giving incentives to commercial vehicles, including autorickshaws. She said the department was planning to convert all diesel and petrol-run three-wheelers in the city into CNG. The diesel and petrol-run autorickshaws would go off the roads in Patna and adjoining areas like Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif from March 31, 2022 onwards. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said about 75% diesel autorickshaws in Patna have been converted into CNG. “So far, Rs 1.14 crore has been paid to a total of 430 beneficiaries, including those who installed CNG kits or replaced their old vehicles with CNG powered three-wheelers. Incentives were distributed among 50 beneficiaries on Tuesday,” he said. Agarwal added as per the advisory of the Pollution Control Board, the operations of diesel-powered three-wheelers and old petrol-powered three-wheelers were adversely affecting the environment and air quality of Patna. “CNG-run autorickshaws will reduce pollution,” Agarwal said. He added, “Operation of electric and CNG-powered buses, autorickshaws and battery-operated three wheelers is being encouraged. There are 12 CNG stations in Patna and six more will be made operational by March next year.” State transport commissioner Seema Tripathi, additional secretary Sunny Sinha, joint secretary Pankaj Kumar, deputy secretary Shailendranath and officer-on-special duty Ajiv Vatsraj were present on this occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50-get-incentives-for-adopting-cleaner-fuel/articleshow/87494957.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Cos must keep staff in loop, be flexible to earn loyalty||By M MuneerEvery organisation considers its employees as the most valuable asset. They are integral to the success of the organisation. Else, they are just a waste of space and budget. Money, indeed, motivates most performers, but that isn’t going to buy loyalty. Here are a few potent motivators that have been successfully used by enterprises in times like now. They cost almost nothing, and pay for themselves quickly... * Recognition: This is not just about annual awards or an employee-of-the-month, that can be limiting. Consider a company-wide monthly MVP (most valuable performer) award that is based on suggestions from fellow employees. Factor in overall performance and attributes that are most important to the firm (for example, teamwork and problem-solving). * Field trips: Invite your top performers to attend client meetings or trade shows. The benefit? They can get to know the client and develop a better understanding of them. Plus, they can see the reality of the ‘glamorous’ trips that others take. * Be vulnerable: Share information on your company’s performance and your feelings about it as a boss. Show your staff how you made or lost money during the quarter and ask them for feedback. Some organisations take this a step further and share profit with the employees. * Allow for greatness: Giving your employee a chance to do something outstanding may be all they need. Top performers seek out opportunities to express themselves. Support them for excellence and allow them to make mistakes in the process. * Communicate: Whether by phone, paper, video, audio, or the internet — the more frequently you communicate on the state of the company, the more motivated employees will be. Quite often, we hear the gripe: “Management does not keep me in the loop. I feel like I don’t count.” * Flexibility: Providing employees with a flexible schedule that can accommodate their lifestyle can be very motivating and can differentiate your workplace from others. Understanding that an employee prefers a 30-hour week (at 30 hours of pay, of course) and accommodating that may win loyalty for life. A good friend and author of the ‘Maverick’, Ricardo Semler, had done several innovations in this area, including allowing employees to choose their boss, decide on their salary and work schedule, etc. * Time: Don’t underestimate your importance to employees. Taking time to celebrate successes or for small talk can be a memorable and motivating experience for them. Challenge yourself to have lunch with an employee instead of a fellow executive — you may have more fun. * Lead by example: Doing the ‘right thing’, being courageous and being loyal are qualities that we need to show in ourselves before we can ask others. When you show that character, it inspires the entire organisation to greater performance. * Let go: Letting go of difficult customers (or employees) can be very motivating to employees. It allows employees to know how much you value them or their efforts, it increases the value of your firm, and it also shows you are not willing to deal with unproductive relationships, whether customer or employee. * Eliminate internal competition: It is tough enough that your competitors are plotting your demise. Why should you contribute to the carnage with an incentive programme that pits employees against one another? * Speak up: Most corporate executives have little time to meet their obligations, let alone speak on behalf of the company to business clubs. Consider allowing key employees to represent you and speak. They will enjoy being an ambassador and may better empathise with your schedule’s demands. The final keys to motivation are more strategic. Try your best to motivate your employees to do the things that you are motivated by. In other words, if increasing company profits is your primary motivation, focus your efforts on motivating employees to increase profits. Any other motivation could work against yours (for example, motivating employees to grow sales even if not profitable). Be sincere. A vague “good job” or a plain “have a nice day” will mean little to any employee. Unless the “thank you” is heartfelt, it will eventually backfire when employees start to expect a thank you for no reason. Motivating employees can be rewarding and inexpensive when you are willing to pay the price of communicating and sharing your business information.

In his police complaint, Sumeetpal Singh Waraich, employee with a private life insurance firm, told the police that he was transferred to Chandigarh from Mumbai and he took the first floor of a house on rent in Sector 8, Panchkula. He said his household articles and a two-wheeler were in Mumbai, for which he searched for the movers and packers service on the internet and found a website, shiftindia.com. When he contacted the number given on the website on October 21, the person who answered introduced himself as Rajiv Kumar and assured that he would arrange a call from the company. A few minutes later, another person who introduced himself as Jitendera Singh, representative of Apollo Packers and Movers, called him and sent his Adhar card. Both of them agreed to pack and move all household articles from his Mumbai-based 3 BHK apartment, including his two-wheeler to Panchkula for Rs 53,000. The next day, one Sanjay, along with four labourers and the driver of a container truck reached his Mumbai address and packed all household articles in 88 packs in front of his mother. “They had even locked the truck with the lock provided by my mother with the assurance that it would be opened at my new address with the keys, which would remain in my mother’s custody as she was supposed to reach Panchkula on October 21,” the complainant said. After loading the articles later in the evening, he received a call from one Jitender, who asked for additional payment of Rs 59,000 to deliver the household articles safely. When the victim refused to pay more, the accused threatened and blackmailed him, saying that he would not deliver the articles, if he was not paid the amount demanded. On making inquiries, the complainant said he came to know that the container lock had been illegally opened at some godown in Bhiwandi (Thane) and the articles were transferred to another vehicle owned by one Mukesh Sharma, who represents EURO Movers and Packers. When the victim called Mukesh to track the consignment, he refused to share any information and later there was no trace of anyone. The victim approached the police and provided all the details, including quotation, invoice, mobile numbers of representatives and bank details of the money transfer. A case was registered under section 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC at Sector 7 police station. Further investigations are on. ASI Jasbir Singh, the investigation officer said, “We, along with cyber cell officials, are trying to trace the accused through their website and mobile number provided by the victim. Investigation is underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-loses-household-articles-cash-to-movers-packers-firm/articleshow/87495226.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

An estimated 3lakh eligible beneficiaries are yet to receive their first dose and majority of these are from zones having large number of Muslim population. Such special drives were initiated when around 5 lakh beneficiaries were found unvaccinated at the start of October. Over 50% of these are assume to be from Satranjipura, Mominpura, Ashi Nagar and Mangalwari zone. The NGO, which helped perform last rites of Covid bodies, supply oxygen cylinders and oximeters during peak of the second and first waves besides ration kits, has been successful in convincing reluctant community members to get inoculated. Siraj Ahmed, president of Nagpur district JuH, said Jamiat has a history of winning trust of people of the country. “Jamiat has a reputation of making well informed decisions. People know that we support a cause only in larger interest of society,” he said. Ahmed added that volunteers are advising the vaccine is a necessary medicine against Covid19. “We are not forcing anyone. Our volunteers request people not to believe those who are not qualified in medical field. All religious heads and ulemas have taken and there is no doubt about the vaccine,” he said. Comparisons are also drawn with polio drive. “Then also lot of rumours were spread but no one died or become impotent while the disease got eradicated,” Ahmed said. The JuH is buoyed by response it got in Gaddigodam, Sadar and Rathod Layout.”We would like to focus on more areas,” he said. The NGO volunteers also got queries about death from vaccine. “We remind them that life and death are in the hands of Allah. This way the get convinced,” he said. Mangalwari zonal medical officer Dr Ateequr Raheman Khan said in just seven camps over 1,000 people were jabbed. “Under the guidance of mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, additional commissioner Ram Joshi, chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, the NMC is reaching out to citizens. The NGO’s entry has a good impact and heavy rush has been witnessed during the camps,” he said. Dr Khan added that women too participated in good numbers. “Nearly all the 1,000 beneficaries took their first dose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-ngo-tie-up-proving-game-changer-in-vax-hesitancy-areas/articleshow/87495233.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Unity SFB — the name chosen by the partners Centrum and Bharat Pe for their banking venture — has been given a licence on the condition that they take over the failed Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank’s business. Centrum Financial Services executive director Inderjit Camotra — who was earlier with StanChart, ANZ and Citibank — has been named as the interim CEO. Shares of Centrum Capital, which holds 51% in Unity SFB, ended nearly 5% up at Rs 42 by close of Monday’s trade on the BSE. Bharat Pe Group will hold the balance 49%. Speaking to TOI, Centrum Group chairman Jaspal Bindra said that the bank will hit the ground running. “We are starting our business with a capital of Rs 1,100 crore and two lakh borrowers of Centrum who will now be borrowers of the bank. Initially, we will offer savings bank accounts, deposits, overdraft facilities and term loans and, in a few weeks, we will start offering cards,” said Bindra. He added that customers will be able to open digital accounts across India as soon as the IT platform is in place and the bank was waiting for a MICR number and other bank identification details to open its portal for customers. However, for physical distribution, the bank would wait for the amalgamation of PMC Bank to be finalised. “The bank will be a purely retail digital lending player and a subsidiary of Centrum Capital. Centrum’s wealth management business, housing finance, broking and investment banking business will continue to be outside Unity SFB,” said Bindra. Unity SFB was granted an “in-principle approval to set up a small finance bank”, announced in a press release on June 18 this year, under ‘Guidelines for on-tap licensing of small finance banks in the private sector’ dated December 5, 2019. The RBI had offered a small finance bank licence to fit and proper promoters who were willing to bring in capital and provide a resolution to customers of the failed PMC Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/unity-small-finance-bank-gets-final-nod/articleshow/87495552.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI’s panel seeks early sale of bad debts to ARCs||Mumbai: A panel constituted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed new norms for sale of loans by banks to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs). It has proposed the ARCs be allowed to float Sebi-registered Alternate Investment Funds to raise resources for facilitating restructuring of bad loans purchased by them. The new norms are aimed at enabling banks get rid of stressed loans in the early stage of default and nudge reluctant minority lenders into joining the sale. The norms also seek to appoint valuers for large-value loans that are sold. “The recommendations are timely and will help ARCs raise resources by tapping different categories of market participants eligible for investment in security receipts. Banks have also been incentivised for sale of NPA (non-performing asset) early with provision to spread loss over two years,” said UV ARC director Hari Hara Mishra. Among the proposed rules is a requirement that large loans and loans that have been in default for over two years should be considered for sale to ARCs. The committee has also recommended that final approval of the reserve price should be given by a high-level committee that has the power to approve the corresponding write-off of the loan To ensure debt aggregation, the panel has said that if 66% of lenders (by value) decide to accept an offer by an ARC, the same may be binding on the remaining lenders and it must be implemented within 60 days of approval by majority lenders (66%). If a lender fails to agree, it will be subjected to100% provisioning on the loan outstanding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-panel-seeks-early-sale-of-bad-debts-to-arcs/articleshow/87495578.cms||---

Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida attributes the low numbers to Goa’s good vaccination coverage. “People are not getting sick and as a result not testing,” she said. “People might be getting infected and spreading Covid-19, but they’re not getting sick from it and hence are not getting themselves tested,” she said, adding, “One or two highly comorbid persons who get infected could have severe outcomes,” she said. “Though we want to see more people vaccinated, we cannot force them. The government is only waiting for them to come forward,” the director of health services added. “Although a vaccinated person may not get sick from Covid-19, they could spread it to someone who is not vaccinated and can get sick. It’s important for everyone to keep their guard up. Any symptoms of vomiting,diarrhoea, fever and body ache must be taken seriously. The classic flu presentation of running nose and cough are now less seen among Covid-19 infected,” she said. The state now has 315 active cases and eight persons have recovered on Tuesday. North Goa’s weekly positivity rate was at 1.6%, double that of South Goa, which was at 0.8% for the week from October 26 to November 1. In North Goa, 41% of the positive cases and in South Goa 58% of the positive cases were detected through rapid antigen testing and the rest via RT-PCR testing. During the day, three more persons were hospitalised and 42 opted for home isolation. Among the two fatalities, one was a 78-year-old man from Penha de Franca, who died at Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, after 22 days of hospitalisation. He tested positive for Covid-19 on the day he was admitted and had symptom for eight days before his admission. The other was an 85-year-old woman who also passed away at GMC after eight days in hospital.

---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: No roads to 1,800 tribal villages in agency area||VISAKHAPATNAM: Six tribal villages on the hilltop areas of Rolugunta-Ravikamatam mandals in Vizag rural have started building a 5-km kaccha road on their own. Inspired by the stories of other tribal villagers laying roads by themselves, and vexed with the continuing apathy of government authorities, the tribals have already cleared bushes over a 2-km stretch in the forested area near Chalisingam. They plan to complete laying of the kachha road in 30-40 days. The six villages — Losingi, Kotta Losing, Peddagaruvu and Pitrugedda under Arla panchayat in Rolugunta manal, and Chalisingam and CK Padu under Ravikamatham mandal — have been asking authorities to lay a connectivity road of about 5km since long. The erstwhile TDP government had sanctioned Rs 3 crore for laying of a black top surface from YB Patnam to Chalisingam via Losingi. Though tenders were floated in 2018, no one picked up the tender. As of now, people of Chalisingam and Losingi villages use horses as mode of transport. Most of the hamlets have at least one horse each. “We use horses to transport rice and other food material as vehicles can’t be used in the hilly terrain. We also send farm produce such as paddy, cashew to local markets on horses,” said a villager from Chalisingam. In fact, nearly 1,800 out of 3,900 villages in Vizag rural and agency areas have road connectivity issues. “Though several newborn babies and pregnant women have lost their lives due to the delay in getting to the nearest hospital or health centre, only a few deaths come to light as most deaths go unreported due to the remote location of the villages,” tribal leader P Rama Rao Dora says. Though bike ambulances were introduced four years ago, in many cases even the two-wheeler ambulances fail to reach the villages as there is not even a kaccha road to connect the remote hamlets to the nearest road. The problem becomes particularly acute during the rainy season. “We have chalked out a plan to lay roads to about 1,800 habitations at an estimated cost of Rs 714 crore. The works will start soon,” ITDA project officer Ronanki Gopalakrishna told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/no-roads-to-1800-tribal-villages-in-agency-area/articleshow/87494926.cms||Siva G
---||Visakhapatnam||Identifying illegal crackers a challenge in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Supreme Court has allowed ‘green’ fireworks in areas where air quality is not poor, but execution remains a challenge for civic authorities. Speaking to TOI, regional fire officer, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), Niranjan Reddy said only the sale of green fireworks will be allowed. The civic body, police and revenue officials will take action against those selling non-green fireworks, he added. Fireworks traders said green crackers do not contain barium or other toxic chemicals, but the labelling on the packages does not offer information about the contents. A senior police officer in Vizag admitted that restricting the use of non-green fireworks is an uphill task. “We can restrict the sale of non-green crackers to some extent but it’s difficult to restrict these being burst as it is very tricky to determine whether the fireworks are green or not, he added,” he added. In Vijayawada, special teams formed by the police and civic authorities conducted searches at fireworks shops arranged at PWD grounds, and Makineni Basavapunnaiah (MB Stadium).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/identifying-illegal-crackers-a-challenge/articleshow/87494869.cms||Nalla.Babu

Six people were killed and 89 others injured in the six blasts which occurred one after another on a fixed interval of time. Vinod Singh, the eldest son of Raj Narayan Singh, one of the six victims, said the responsibility of the family came on him after his father’s death. “The terrorists had done a heinous crime by killing innocents. My father was involved in grazing cattle but he had gone to listen to Modi as he was fond of him,” Singh told TOI over phone on Tuesday. A special NIA court had on Monday awarded death sentence to four members of banned terror outfit SIMI for triggering the serial blasts. “I won’t lie that I had received Rs 10 lakh as compensation – Rs 5 lakh each from state government and the Centre – after my father’s death. Narendra Modi had also visited us at our village in Kamarji in Patna’s Gaurichak,” Singh said. Singh said his two younger brothers are in Army and one of them is posted near Line of Control. “My elder son has managed to secure job in railways,” he said. Asked about NIA court sentencing four terrorists to death, Singh said he was satisfied with the decision. “The rest five should also be hanged to death,” he added. Manish Srivastava, brother-in-law of another victim, Munna Srivastava of Badi Dhanesh in Hathua, Gopalganj, said all the terrorists involved in the serial blasts should have been awarded death penalty. “Munna had a four-year-old daughter. His wife, who had received Rs 10 lakh compensation, got married to someone else in Uttar Pradesh. She is not in touch with us now. BJP leaders arranged a job of private security guard for Munna’s younger brother Rajan Srivastava,” he said. Rajesh Kumar of Ahiyapur in Nalanda, Bindeshwari Choudhari of Bariyarpur in Begusarai, Vikash Singh of Rampur in Bhabhua and Bharat Ranjan of Simrahi in Supaul were the other four victims of the serial blasts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/serial-blasts-8-years-on-victims-kin-still-shocked/articleshow/87494533.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||HC stays holding of exams for appointment of headmasters||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday stayed holding of exams for appointment of headmasters in nationalised primary schools in the state till further orders. The rules formed for their appointment and service conditions have been challenged over mandatory condition of eight-year regular service experience for qualification and alleged ambiguity in English and Hindi versions of the law. Bihar National Primary School Headmaster (Appointment, Transfer, Disciplinary Action and Service Condition) Rules, 2021, was formed in August this year. Overall, creation of 40,158 posts of headmasters in nationalised primary schools was okayed by the state cabinet on September 7, 2021. Two separate writ petitions were filed in the high court by TET-STET Uttirn Niyojit Shikshak Sangh and TET Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh, which urged the court to declare Section 6(V)(A) of Rule as “ultra vires” under which minimum eight years of regular service experience is mandatory for qualifying as headmaster. Petitioners have argued that no such condition has been put for graduate teachers and they would be eligible for appointment only with their service confirmation. Petitioners have also urged the court that clarification be sought on Section 6 (IV) of the rules as its English and Hindi versions seem different. “The government should be directed that condition in Section 6 (IV) of English version that a candidate must have qualified TET in 2012 or onwards for appointment as headmaster should prevail,” they said. In Hindi, word ‘niyukt’ has been added in Section 6 (IV) and according to the petitioners, only those teachers appointed in 2012 or onwards with TET qualification would be eligible for the post of headmaster. The petitioners have urged the court that all basic-grade TET teachers be allowed to participate in selection process till disposal of the petitions. Appearing for state, advocate general Lalit Kishore submitted that the ambiguity in English and Hindi versions was due to typing error and it would be rectified. A counter affidavit on behalf of the state government was filed, but the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice PB Bajanthri remained dissatisfied with it. Counsels Mrityunjay Kumar, Arinjay Kumar, Kumar Shanu and Amrit Kumar appeared for the petitioners. After hearing both sides, the court directed state government to file another counter affidavit within four weeks. It will now hear the petitions on December 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-stays-holding-of-exams-for-appointment-of-headmasters/articleshow/87494564.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The agenda point was approved in the MC house meet on Tuesday. The MC will install 100 CCTV cameras at strategic locations frequented by women. The project, under Punjab Urban Local Bodies Surveillance Grid for Women Safety (PUNGRID), will be fully funded by the Central and state governments. The Central government will chip in 60% of the funds while the state government will pay 40% share, said mayor Amarjeet Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu. “Under the Nirbhaya scheme, the Central government is also providing some funds to the municipal corporations for this purpose. The MC has gone into ‘high action mode’ for the protection of women and is going to spend about Rs 4.5 crore for the purpose by investing additional funds in addition to the funds released by the Centre.” Mayor Sidhu expressed concern about rise in cases of crime against women despite the steps taken by the Punjab government for their protection. Even though women were working on an equal footing with men, they still had to face harassment and abuse, he said. In view of this situation, the Government of India had set up the Nirbhaya Fund through which it was proposed to upgrade surveillance infrastructure in cities for protection of women, he added. The mayor said that the police department had identified places likely to be prone to crime against women. A detailed project report has been prepared under which 100 cameras would be installed in Mohali city under first phase in Phases 7, 3B2 market and Phase 5 near ITI. There will be 80 fixed and 20 moving cameras costing Rs 4.50 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-to-set-up-100-cctv-cameras-at-4-locations-for-womens-safety/articleshow/87495254.cms||---

While the counting of votes will start at 8am on Tuesday at RJ&DJ College in Munger for Tararpur constituency, the same will be done at WITI, Ramnagar, in Darbhanga for Kusheshwar Asthan. The election commission has directed the district magistrate-cum-district election officer concerned to deploy central armed police personnel at the counting centres. Section 144 of CrPC has been invoked in the vicinity of the counting centres. While 49% of the voters had turned up in Kusheshwar Asthan, Tarapur recorded nearly 50% polling. The bypolls were necessitated following the death of JD(U) sitting MLAs Mewa Lal Choudhary (Tarapur) and Shashibhushan Hazari (Kusheshwar Asthan). Altogether 17 candidates — eight in Tarapur and nine in Kusheshwar Asthan — contested the byelection. The Congress, which had fought the 2020 assembly election as a grand alliance (GA) partner with RJD and the Left parties, fielded its candidates from the two seats. The Lok Janshakti Party led by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan also fielded its candidate. While the JD(U) victory will show people’s trust in the good governance under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD win is set to boost the morale of the opposition camp in Bihar. JD(U) fielded Rajiv Kumar Singh in Tarapur and Aman Bhushan Hazari from reserved seat of Kusheshwar Asthan, which his father had won thrice in a row. The RJD fielded Arun Kumar, a Vaishya, in Tarapur and Ganesh Bharti from Musahar community in Kusheshwar Asthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/arrangements-made-for-counting-of-votes-today/articleshow/87472485.cms||Ramashankar

According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, nearly 70 societies have taken its benefit in around a week’s time. On an average, 50 jabs, including both the doses, were administered at each society. Suryakant Devkar, the immunization officer of PMC, said, “The civic administration has come up with this initiative to make sure that people in need get the jabs. Some people want to get the vaccine but cannot avail it because of some problems. They are mostly senior citizens.” The on-call vaccination facility is provided at the ward office-level. The civic body sends vaccination vans with ambulance following a demand from a housing society. The doses are administered at the club house or the common room on its campus. Devkar said PMC’s only expectation was sizable number of beneficiaries at each society so that maximum people could benefit from the visit of civic vaccination team. PMC has urged the housing societies to contact the local ward offices. The ward medical officers across the 15 ward offices have been assigned with the task of coordinating the drive.  The PMC has been conducting drives for special target groups, including slum population, students applying for education abroad and government offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/on-call-vaccination-drive-gets-good-response-from-societies/articleshow/87495257.cms||---

Apparently, a section of the automated car-moving structure had collapsed, leaving vehicle owners anxious about their vehicles. No one was being allowed inside. Gautam Nagar resident Rajesh Saini claimed, “A portion of the car-lifting machinery gave way near the emergency exit of the building around 5pm.” While all facts couldn’t be confirmed because the facility was closed by South Delhi Municipal Corporation, mayor Mukesh Suryan announced, “A car-lifting rack got dismantled on the 8th floor of the parking lot’s tower No. 3. Our technical team has rushed to the site and I have ordered an investigation. The problems will be fixed tonight and the facility will be made operational as early as possible.” A police officer revealed late at night that three-four cars had been damaged in the incident. Harsha Vardhan, additional DCP (South), had earlier said that police received information about some accident regarding electrically operated, moveable floor plates coming apart and causing some damage to cars. Vardhan said, “No one was injured in the incident. The multi-level parking is now blocked and entry is barred till the technical inspection is completed.” Somnath Bharti, Malviya Nagar MLA, also visited the spot to assess the situation. Around 6pm, Amit had come as usual to take his car from the parking lot, to whom he pays Rs 1,200 as monthly fees. "I regularly drive to Delhi from Meerut and park here,” he said. He was told he couldn’t take out his car because of an accident inside the building. "I have been waiting for one-and-a-half hours and am being advised to leave in a cab," said Amit. Dharambir Sharma also claimed that his vehicle was inside the parking lot. "My uncle died recently and due to related rituals, I hadn’t left the house. I heard about the incident and was forced to come here," he said. But even after an hour, he hadn’t received satisfactory replies to his queries from the civic officials. The puzzle parking, inaugurated last November, uses moveable plates to shift cars to vacant parking slots on the different floors. A board outside the facility had this tariff information: "Rs 20 for one hour, Rs 100 for 24 hours, Rs 1,200 day pass monthly and Rs 2,000 for day and night pass monthly."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/part-of-automated-parking-lot-at-green-park-collapses/articleshow/87496056.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Block-level teams formed to monitor fever cases in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The public health department has formed block-level teams to monitor fever cases and oversee the preventive measures taken across the district. Continuous rain over the past few days has increased the possibility of a spread of communicable diseases. Each team comprising two medical officers, one nurse, two health inspectors and two sanitary workers has been instructed to make field visits to places across the district where fever cases were reported. Fever and dysentery are common symptoms of communicable diseases and immediate medical attention is required in such cases. “People are asked to drink boiled water, keep their surroundings clean and wash their hands frequently,” said P Aruna, deputy director of health services, Coimbatore. To prevent communicable diseases, washing hands after returning home and after using toilet is advisable. Vector-borne diseases are caused by animals and flies after they come in contact with decaying food items and garbage. “So, garbage should not be made to accumulate around houses,” she added. While rain is expected to continue for the next few weeks, people have been asked to ensure rainwater does not stagnate around their houses as it may become a breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/block-level-teams-formed-to-monitor-fever-cases-in-dist/articleshow/87495269.cms||---

The Pune airport was appraised in the category of ‘best airport by size’ and sub-category of an airport with passenger traffic between 5-15 million per annum, in the Asia Pacific region. The airport had started at the 154th rank in the January-March first quarter survey. “The number of passengers has been increasing and is at its peak presently. In the past few months, around 10 new flights have started. And with the airport presently operational 12 hours, it will feel the pressure. Things are expected to be in control after Diwali. Also, from December 1, the airport will be operational for 24 hours. Hopefully, the ranking will improve in the last quarter,” an airport official told TOI. During the third quarter, the city airport was operating for 12 hours — from 8am to 8pm every day — for runway repair work, and on an average, was handling more than 100 aircraft movements per day. The impact of the constrained operating conditions seems to have reflected in the outcome of the third quarter survey. The airport got negative marks in nearly all 33 parameters related to passenger services. In 20 parameters, the airport scored negative marks this time. Officials with the Marhatta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture said they met the airport director and divisional commissioner over issues related to the airport. “A set of 20 improvement areas have been highlighted; they also include runway extension and short haul international flights,” Sudhir Mehta, the president, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-slips-18-spots-to-78th-rank-in-service-quality-assessment/articleshow/87495284.cms||Joy Sengupta

It said such unilateral decisions were not acceptable and, instead, they had asked the university to write a strong letter to the government. In March, Delhi government had announced that COA would be affiliated with Ambedkar University Delhi as the college was facing various problems. As DU had not responded to the request of beginning the deaffiliation process, Directorate of Training and Technical Education wrote to the registrar on August 13 seeking a response. The six-member committee, which included the elected executive council members, said, “After considerable discussion on the issue, the committee strongly objects to the unilateral and arbitrary action taken by the Delhi cabinet regarding the merger of COA with Ambedkar University. Taking over colleges affiliated with University of Delhi by Delhi government unilaterally without following due processes and procedures, that too in contravention of the provisions envisaged under the act, statues and ordinances of the university, must be strongly objected to by the DU authorities.” Suggesting writing a strong letter opposing the decision, the committee stated, “Regarding the admission of candidates to various courses for the session 2021-22, the DU dean (admissions) is requested to take up the matter with COA.” COA is a one-of-its-kind college located at Tilak Marg in central Delhi. It was affiliated to DU’s Faculty of Music and Fine Arts in 1974. Apart from COA, the committee also looked into the deaffiliation of Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research. Its recommendations read, “The committee, after a lengthy discussion, strongly objected to the unilateral and arbitrary action taken by the authorities for its deaffiliation from Delhi University and formation of Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University without following the process and procedures laid down under the DU act, statues and ordinances.” Delhi government did not comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-panel-rejects-deaffiliation-of-college-of-art/articleshow/87496071.cms||Shradha Chettri

The arrival of two flocks of 20 birds, the largest and bulkiest of the geese, have thrilled bird lovers. “The name itself speaks about its late arrival. The birds are natives of the UK and Europe, and are the last of the species to migrate, but this year they have landed first,” says bird expert Nitin Marathe. With the onset of winter, migratory birds from the northern hemisphere and Europe are being seen in lakes in the region. Though the avians are being reported to be few in numbers, experts hope more flocks to arrive in the next 15 days, including the most-sought-after Bar-headed Geese (BHG) from Mongolia. “These birds travel thousands of kilometres crossing the Central Asian Flyway to reach lakes in the region. We expect their numbers to increase when the water recedes and some marsh is created at shores,” says Dr Anil Pimplapure, bird expert and founder of Central India Bird Academy (CIBA). “On Monday, I recorded a flock of 11 geese at Zilmili Lake in Birsi. The geese have also arrived in adjoining Paraswada and Bazartola lakes. Common Kestrel, a bird of prey species belonging to the group of the falcon family was also seen,” said Sharad Gajbhiye, an avid birdwatcher. Gondia dentist Dr Deepkisen Bisen said he recorded another flock of nine Greylag Geese on Tuesday. “We expect more birds to come. Last year, 22 birds were recorded. These birds arrive only in Gondia and stay till March,” he said. Another migratory prey bird Eurasian Hobby, a small slim falcon and long-distance migrant from Africa, Asia, and Europe, was recorded by Marathe near Ramtek and also near Kondhali. “Migratory birds like Redstart, Grey Wagtail and Garganey have arrived in the region. Though it is too early to tell about the numbers, once the first crop is harvested and the second crop like chana will be sown, we can expect Bar-headed Geese, which thrive on the tender shoots of chana (gram), will arrive by this month-end, and pochards and other ducks would also follow once the winter becomes harsh in the European and North Asian countries,” said Marathe. Garganey, a small dabbling duck from the UK, has been recorded by birdwatchers in Gorewada Lake. On the arrival of lesser number of migratory birds this time at Gorewada, Murali Manohar Naidu, a regular visitor to the lake, said, “This year, water level in Gorewada is less, which deprives food to diving ducks. Hence, these ducks are not seen in big numbers, though other local water bird species are there.” Marathe says, “Due to heavy rains till last month, many lakes like Chargaon, Paradgaon, Saiki, and others in the region are still filled to its brim and birds have been avoiding these water bodies. Birds like Bar-headed Geese need shore to rest, but the shores of many lakes are still underwater. Hence, we will have to wait.” Even as birdwatchers are keenly awaiting more number of migrants species, Marathe says, “Every year, the number of birds is shrinking due to change in crop pattern, illegal brick kilns near water bodies, huge construction activities like road works, illegal fishing, and rampant use of pesticides, etc.” Vinit Arora, a birdwatcher said, “Five years ago, there used to be around 6,000 Red-crested Pochards in Vena Lake on Amravati Road, but due to brick kilns near the lake and rampant fishing, there are none this year. Bird conservation is not the priority and hence it is not getting due attention from various agencies. During the Bird Week that will be celebrated from November 5-12, we should pledge to work for protecting these species.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/flying-past-migration-lag-greylag-geese-arrive-first/articleshow/87496085.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: November 15 new deadline to apply for electric-autos||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s transport department has received more than 16,000 applications for the registration of 4,261 electric autorickshaws and has now decided to extend the deadline till November 15 so that more people get a chance to apply. Out of the 4,261 e-autos for which registration has been opened, Delhi government has reserved 33% of the total registration, i.e. 1,406 for women applicants. “More than 16,000 applications for e-auto registrations were received till November 1 and more than 500 women drivers have already applied,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Though it is a satisfactory number, we are planning to create more awareness so that even more women drivers apply,” he said. Gahlot also took to social media to inform prospective applicants about the extension of the last date for applying on http://transport.delhi.gov.in. “This Diwali, let us all pledge to adopt non-polluting modes of transport,” he tweeted. Any person who has a valid driving license of light motor vehicle or three-Seater auto-rickshaws can apply for the registration of e-autos. The applicant should be a resident of Delhi and should have an Aadhaar card with a Delhi address. The Public Service Vehicle badge is not a mandatory requirement at the time of application, Delhi government had earlier said in a statement. However, the successful applicant will have to obtain a PSV badge within 45 days of the draw of allotment. The e-autos will be blue in colour in line with the electric buses soon to be inducted into Delhi Transport Corporation’s fleet. However, the e-autos registered by a woman would be pink in colour. Delhi government is providing a purchase incentive of Rs 30,000 per e-auto and the facility of loans with a 5% interest subvention through empanelled agencies, apart from exemption from registration fees and road tax under its Electric Vehicle Policy. The government is also developing public charging stations across the city as part of the policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nov-15-new-deadline-to-apply-for-e-autos/articleshow/87496677.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Kolkata||TMC scripts spectacular comeback in Dinhata, wins by 1,64,089 votes||Dinhata: Trinamool Congress’s Udayan Guha made a stunning turnaround in Cooch Behar’s Dinhata six months after he lost to BJP candidate and now Union minister of state Nisith Pramanik in the assembly polls by 57 votes. On Tuesday, Guha won the bypoll by a margin of 1,64,089 votes, which is 48,000 more than the total 1,15,978 votes TMC polled in the assembly elections. The figures point to a tectonic shift in the Dinhata voting pattern, hard to explain only by the BJP’s “terror” argument. BJP candidate Ashok Mandal even lost in his own polling booth and also in the booth where Pramanik cast his vote. Describing the landslide victory as a landmark, Guha said: “Dinhata has created a record in the state’s electoral history. People of Dinhata have decimated the BJP, sending out clear signals that there is no room for communal politics in this place. They have put an end to the writ run by Nisith Pramanik. The resounding victory has proved that Pramanik is a paper tiger.” Guha has even surpassed CPM Keshpur candidate Nandarani Dal’s 1,08,000 winning margin in 2001. But an outcome like this isn’t the first in this border seat. Dinhata that has been dwindling between extremes since 2014. TMC’s Renuka Sinha won the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat in 2014 by 38,000 votes. In 2016, Trinamool candidate Parthapratim Roy took the lead to 4.9 lakh votes before the party lost the seat to BJP in 2019. The results, however, have put a question mark on two important aspects of identity politics that BJP has been using to expand its support base in north Bengal. The Dinhata numbers show that BJP can’t take the Rajbanshi community and the refugees for granted because these two categories comprise a considerable part of the Dinhata population. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar had harped on these two points during campaigning, with specific reference to the attack on minorities in neighbouring Rangpur in Bangladesh, 185 km from Dinhata. Majumdar on Tuesday refused to take serious note of the Dinhata bypoll. “The victory margin is enough for people to understand what kind of bypolls it was,” he said. Yet, Majumdar’s claim doesn’t explain the BJP’s defeat. Sources say there has been a breakdown in the morale of party workers after the assembly polls. “Many organizers had to leave their home and hearth, take shelter in neighbouring Assam. They didn’t get adequate redress to join the fight again. Some left politics and a few joined TMC,” a BJP organizer said. Whatever the BJP version, livelihood issues like price rise and state schemes such as Kanyashree and Lakshmir Bhandar might have created an impact on voters more than BJP’s appeal to ‘sanatan dharma’ and attack on minorities in Bangladesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-scripts-spectacular-comeback-in-dinhata-wins-by-164089-votes/articleshow/87496088.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

However, for the state-run long-distance buses, the demand was touted to be overwhelming as most of the tickets to and from Trichy for the festival weekend were sold out. Private omnibus stand near Kalaiarangam hall in Trichy city was deserted as the movement between the city and Bengaluru has been poor this season. Operators said that the demand has come down since the IT professionals, who are more in numbers among the passengers using omnibuses, are still working from home. Even those, who have moved to their work locations post the relaxation, are using personal vehicles for carpooling along with their friends to return to their natives. “Not even 50% of our seats were filled for the Diwali weekend. Even as the ticket fare was priced as low as Rs 200, the demand is not picking up,” R Balakrishnan, president of Trichy district omnibus operators’ association said. Of the 250 odd private omnibuses in Trichy, only around 60 buses are being operated to Chennai since the demand is poor. While there are enquiries for tickets for Trichy-Chennai travel during the weekend, operators said that the demand was way lower than the pre-pandemic situation. Meanwhile, for SETC, the demand is satisfying. Of the 46 state-run buses operated, most of the fleets have filled their tickets, particularly during the weekend. “Last Diwali, there was a fear among the people. But, this time, as everything is relaxed, people are travelling,” a senior official with SETC Trichy said. Officials added that, usually, people would opt for private omnibuses only if the SETC buses were unavailable, and the movement was too high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/private-omnibuses-see-less-patronage-this-diwali-in-trichy/articleshow/87496075.cms||Deepak Karthik

She is hopeful of getting an MBBS seat in a government medical college. The girl, who lost her father last year, lives with her partially blind mother in the small village of 40 families. After a few months of training in a coaching centre with the help of good samaritans, the girl managed to clear NEET this year in her second attempt. Speaking to TOI, Sangavi said her father’s demise, which was a big loss, motivated her to clear the exam. She had scored less than 100 in NEET last year. “I nurtured the dream of becoming a doctor to help my village people as I have seen their pain and helplessness when they are afflicted by diseases. I am happy that I didn’t let my village down and cleared NEET. I wish I can secure a seat in a government medical college and get support from the government,” she said. She is not a school topper, but coming from such a social background and clearing NEET is an outstanding achievemnet, says Fredricks John of rotaract club of Personiv. Fredricks has been helping school dropouts in the village with basic education through weekend classes. He said most people from the village and Sangavi’s parents were all employees of nearby farms. She was put on residential coaching, but because of Covid lockdown, she had to return home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/first-tribal-girl-to-pass-class-xii-clears-neet/articleshow/87494389.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||As cases soar, EDMC spots 16 dengue red zones in Delhi||NEW DELHI: As dengue cases continue to rise in the national capital, municipal corporations are dealing with the worst dengue outbreak in the past three years. In total, more than 3,000 domestic breeding checkers have been pressed into action by all three corporations to control the outbreak. East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which has areas close to the river, has marked 16 areas as red zones where mosquito density is high.n“Intensive fogging has been added to the routine rounds and extra workers are deployed to check tanks, coolers, pots for water accumulation with mosquito larvae,” said Ajay Handa, additional medical health officer, EDMC. EDMC has deployed 830 people to manage the operations on the ground with 256 spray pumps, two big tankers, six small tankers for fogging. While the blame game continues among the councillors of AAP and BJP, six people have lost their lives due to dengue. “There is enough required amount of Cyphenothrin pesticide that is mixed with petroleum-based products like diesel or kerosene oil to spray areas. There is definitely a rise in the number of fogging demands so intensive measures are being taken,” said a high-ranking official in South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s public health department. SDMC has deployed 1,120 domestic breeding checkers with 1,200 spray pumps and 490 hand held fogging machines. The fumigation is carried in two shifts — 5am to 7am and then around the same time in the evening. EDMC says it is facng another major issue of patients coming from neighboring Uttar Pradesh with bogus addresses. “This creates a problem for us as we are unable to locate the exact place of residence to eliminate dengue mosquitos. Hospitals should have better process to verify the addresses” added Handa. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which has the highest number of cases — 371, also has the highest number of domestic breeding checkers, 1,533.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cases-soar-edmc-spots-16-dengue-red-zones/articleshow/87496680.cms||---

However, the traders claim they will hardly be able to make much profit this season because of thin margin due to hike in cost of crackers and shortage of several varieties. But they are hopeful that the hiked demand might help them sell off most of their purchased stocks. Customers are also unhappy over the increased prices of crackers. Moreover, unlike previous years this time only green crackers are available and their rates are on the higher side. Ashok Thapar, chairman of Ludhiana Wholesale Fireworks’ Association, said, “Since Monday evening, the demand and sale of crackers have got a push. A lot of customers have started visiting markets to make purchases, but it does not mean that the traders will be able to make huge profits. We are already operating on thin margins. On one side our cost of purchase has increased as compared with the last year and on the other, to attract customers we are giving a flat discount of 50%, which has further shrunk our margins. But more footfall has given us a glimmer of hope that most of our stocks might be sold. Going by the earlier response, we had given up the hope of even being able to sell half our stocks.”Vishal Shally, a cracker trader of the city, said, “Our investments in business this year have increased by 25% to 40%, as now only green crackers are being manufactured and these are costlier. The rate of a small flowerpot pack that was for Rs 55 last year is now being supplied to us at Rs 77. The small pack of sparklers that was available for Rs 38 costs Rs 49 now. Similarly, the pack of small rockets that was available for Rs 170 costs Rs 192. Unfortunately, despite this high increase in cost there has been a drop in our margins, as companies have decreased the MRPs. Customers too are buying fewer crackers due to the high price.”Chintu Kumar, another cracker trader, said, “The footfall in the cracker market has increased, but the situation is not favourable for us, as a lot of items like ground chakkar and fancy aerial varieties, which are in demand, are short in supply. This year the trend is more towards less noisy crackers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/demand-for-crackers-picks-up-but-traders-not-having-a-blast/articleshow/87494399.cms||Mohit Behl

Dagar did not corroborate Kaushal Chaudhary’s disclosure of contract killing on the behest of Armeniabased Gaurav Padial, said sources in Mohali CIA. On Tuesday, Mohali police managed to take police remand of the two gangsters, Amit Dagar and Kaushal Chaudhary to bring them face to face during interrogation. They are both on police remand till November 6. After nominating gangster Amit Dagar in the existing FIR against Kaushal Chaudhary, police will now interrogate the two gangsters side by side so that their disclosure statements can be corroborated. Sources in Mohali CIA said so far, they have both been blaming each other for engaging shooters to murder Vicky Middukhera on the behest of Armenia- based Gaurav Padial, handler of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Although the main shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and ‘Khabbu shooter’ (lefthanded shooter), as well as the other two gangsters who accompanied the shooters seen in CCTV footage, have been identified, police have so far failed to arrest them. Sources in CIA said that police teams have returned empty-handed whenever they went in search of the two shooters. However, Mohali police have been maintaining that their teams are working day and night to arrest the accused. Mohali SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are on right trail of the accused and soon they will be arrested.” After arresting Kaushal Chaudhary, one of the main conspirators in the killing of Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera, police have identified the second shooter seen in CCTV footage. Police said other sharpshooters of the Bhola gang involved in the Middukhera murder have also been identified. Apart from Rohit ‘Kartoost’ and Vijiya Malhe, four to five more sharp shooters are to be identified. Police said four shooters came to murder Middukhera, out of whom two executed the killings while the other two were waiting in a car nearby. Two of the shooters were from the Bhola-Latth gang and the other two were from Bambiha gang run by Gaurav Padial. On August 7, two assailants fired 12 bullets at Middukhera, killing him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-to-bring-gangsters-kaushal-dagar-face-to-face-for-interrogation/articleshow/87495329.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Nagpur||Staff throw stones at Gorewada zoo tiger to ensure show: Visitors||Nagpur: To ensure guaranteed tiger and leopard sightings to visitors at the Balasaheb Thackeray Gorewada International Zoological Park, the staff posted to monitor the animals are using new tricks, including throwing stones to bring the animals out of the grass and bushes. In one such incident, visitors from Bhopal, Mitali Chatterjee and Shreya Chatterjee, who were on a visit to the park on Tuesday, alleged that tigers sitting in the grassy bushes were forced out by the staff monitoring from outside the cage by hurling stones near them. “This is blatant violation of not only Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 but also Central Zoo Authority (CZA) norms,” said Mitali. “We were in the park around 1.30pm. The two tigers were not visible. When the tigers did not come out of the bushes, the guide, Nilesh Mendhe, called up a staffer on the service road outside the safari cage to push them out. We were shocked to see the staffer hurling 3-4 stones towards the tigers. This was done to give a good sighting of the animals,” said Shreya. However, park’s divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai denied the allegations. He said, “The staff posted on the service road is caring and it is hard to believe they threw stones at the tigers. The tourists are wrongly interpreting the incident. Many times, the animals don’t return to the night shelter and staff is posted to drive them towards the shelter.” Panchbhai said earlier there were many complaints from visitors disappointed by poor tiger sightings due to tall grass in the safari cages. “Our effort is to see that tourists enjoy maximum sightings in the Indian Safari spread over 125 hectares. The 25-hectare tiger safari is part of it and these days the two tigers have been mostly moving on the fringes. The guide and staff posted outside the cages coordinate to ensure sightings but that is not at the cost of teasing the animals.” Earlier, nature lover Pranay Ade of Nagpur had on October 5 lodged a complaint about his bad experience with forced tiger sightings for visitors. “The driver and guides even violate speed norms to oblige visitors to ensure tiger sightings. The guide was in constant touch with the ground staff to track the tigers and leopards. While doing so the feel of enjoying the forest visit is completely missed,” said Ade. One more visitor, Rushab Rathod, also of Nagpur, had shared a video wherein the driver speeded up as it was getting late. “The tigress was sitting on the road and the driver could have easily moved the bus without disturbing the animal. But the driver sped the vehicle, forcing the tigress to jump to the other side.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/staff-throw-stones-at-gorewada-zoo-tiger-to-ensure-show-visitors/articleshow/87496129.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The projects include the construction of four-laning with paved shoulder from Navelim to Cuncolim section, a 6.5km-stretch at a cost of Rs 270 crore, from the end of the Canacona bypass to Pollem, an 8km-stretch along the Goa-Karnataka border at a cost of Rs 175 crore, from Sanjivani sugar factory to Khandepar at a cost of Rs 200 crore, and from Ponda to Bhoma section at a cost of Rs 575 crore. Gadkari said that the first phase of the Zuari bridge will be inaugurated before December 15. He added that he has directed that the approach road be completed before December 10 and inaugurated. He also said that last year’s annual plan for Goa was Rs 2,000 crore, and it has been increased to Rs 5,000 crore. “We have given an additional Rs 3,000 crore,” he said. Gadkari held a review meeting of NH projects and presentation of highway works along with CM Pramod Sawant and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, among others. Gadkari said that till date, development work of over Rs 25,000 crore has been taken up in the state, including projects under Bharatmala and Sagarmala, like the Mandovi and Zuari bridges. Gadkari said that the quality of the Zauri bridge was good, and because the Chinese consultant was not able to get a visa to travel to India, there was some hindrance. “Sawant has written to the Union external affairs ministry to grant the visa, and I will write to the ministry. We want to remove all these hurdles and are hopeful that the bridge is completed as soon as possible,” he said. He also said that land acquired for a toll booth near Zuari bridge will be now utilised for roadside amenities including restaurants, a petrol pump, and gas station. “I have given instructions to create a good design,” he said, adding that on the new Zuari bridge, there will be a viewer gallery, a museum and a revolving restaurant. He also said that the state government has made available around 60 hectares of land, and this would be used for tourism activities and that locals can sell local products. “We have directed the issuance of the tender as soon as possible, and before December 15, we want to lay the foundation stone for the project and work for the viewer gallery will start, and it will become an attraction for tourists,” he said, adding that the tender for the observatory tower is in process. Gadkari also said that land acquisition for the road to Mopa airport has been completed. “We have to put this work on the fast track, and we will lay the foundation stone before December 15,” he said. The Union minister said that whatever issues existed in completing the Sada to Varnapuri road have been resolved, and that the port connectivity road would be inaugurated before December 15. Gadkari said that once the land acquisition is completed, the tender would be floated for construction of the Borim bridge||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-approves-four-4-lane-projects-in-goa-worth-rs-rs-1250cr/articleshow/87496113.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGI, international experts draw up guidelines for ocular tuberculosis||CHANDIGARH: In a first, a consensus guideline for tuberculosis in the eye--ocular tuberculosis-- has been developed. The principal investigator is from PGI and the guide has been prepared in collaboration with 14 countries and centres like Johns Hopkins and Harvard university. This shall enable doctors to start treatment for the disease on time and follow proper diagnostics. “When there is an inflammation in the eye, nobody knows if it is eye tuberculosis as we cannot get culture or sputum to test. Often, these patients were treated on steroids and kept on coming with the same problem,” said Prof Vishali Gupta, principal investigator of the global guideline from PGI. Diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis poses a significant challenge due to lack of gold standard tests and diagnostic criteria. Also, there is hardly any agreement among doctors to start anti-TB treatment. “We have 25 collaborating centres. Prior to developing the guidelines, we collected data of 975 patients. It was not easy to collect data across the globe due to the Data Protection Act,” said Prof Gupta. She added, “We had a closed door meeting in Chandigarh with top notch experts and came up with consensus guidelines as to what tests are necessary and when to diagnose and treat. This is the first such consolidated guideline for the world.” In the absence of such a compile document, even if an ophthalmologist diagnoses ocular TB, the pulmonologist would not agree to start treatment. With this document, pulmonologists can start treatment.“They say that the sputum is not positive and thus no TB drugs can be prescribed. But after these recommendations, the doctors have a guideline. Soon, we are coming up with an application where all this information can be placed and it will help doctors readily get the guidelines. It is being developed by me and a colleague from Singapore,” said Prof Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-a-first-pgi-intl-experts-draw-up-guidelines-for-ocular-tb-treatment/articleshow/87495355.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||India||Can’t hold officials in contempt for actions of subordinates: SC||NEW DELHI: More than four years after a senior bureaucrat from Assam died fighting for restoration of honour, the Supreme Court absolved him of contempt of court charges while deciding his 12-year-old appeal and ruled that higher officials cannot be hauled up for contempt of court for alleged disregard of court orders by his subordinate officers. A former chief executive officer of Assam Agricultural Produce Committee, Dr U N Bora, was convicted for contempt of court by the Gauhati High Court in 2009 for levying certain charges in alleged violation of HC orders. Bora had filed the appeal in 2009 in the SC. But, he died in 2017 and the proceedings against him abated in SC. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh faulted the HC for proceeding under Contempt of Court Act against Bora and others for the alleged lapses by certain subordinate officers, which too on scrutiny was found by the SC to be unfounded. Laying down a principle concerning the dreaded contempt of court process, the bench said, “Merely because a subordinate official acted in disregard of an order passed by the Court, a liability cannot be fastened on a higher official in the absence of knowledge... The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 explains a civil contempt to mean a willful disobedience of a decision of the Court. Therefore, what is relevant is the “wilful” disobedience. Knowledge acquires substantial importance qua a contempt order.” Writing the judgment, Justice Sundresh said on the reading of a court order, if two views are possible, then the bureaucrat cannot be faulted under contempt of court law for taking action in accordance with one of the two possible views. Contempt arises when there is proof beyond doubt about the alleged deliberate, conscious and intentional disregard for court orders, he said. “While dealing with a contempt petition, the Court is not expected to conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond the very judgment which was allegedly violated. The said principle has to be applied with more vigor when disputed questions of facts are involved and they were raised earlier but consciously not dealt with by creating a specific forum to decide the original proceedings,” the bench said. In the case in hand, the SC said it is the specific case of the appellants that they did not violate the directives of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-hold-officials-in-contempt-for-actions-of-subordinates-sc/articleshow/87497246.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolhapur||I am in favour of merger: Satej Patil||Kolhapur: District guardian minister Satej Patil is treading a cautious path over merger of fringe villages into the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) by asking pro-merger activists to initiate a dialogue with the villagers first. The pro-merger activists met the minister asking him to get the proposal merger of fringe villages in KMC approved by the state government. The merger plan has hit a roadblock for several decades due to stiff opposition from villagers. The last government, adopting a middle path, had set up the Kolhapur Urban Area Development Authority for development in fringe villages. However, the authority has been idle since it was formed owing to shortage of staff and funds. “Expansion of city limits is the need of hour. I want to say that I am in favour of merger. However, the pro-merger activists should engage in dialogue with the villagers. They should convince the villagers to agree for merger by letting them know the benefits. Once the first stage of engagement is done, I will call for a meeting to resolve the issue,” Patil said. Patil said the villagers should get the confidence that they will not loose anything if the villages are merged with the KMC. “The main concern was that of building permissions. Now, the gram panchayats have no right to grant building permissions. It is now with the development authority. Such doubts must be cleared first,” he added. Baba Indulkar, a pro-merger activist, said merger of 20 villages from fringe areas has been proposed recently by the KMC in a fresh proposal sent to the state government. However several villages are submitting petitions for non-inclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/i-am-in-favour-of-merger-satej-patil/articleshow/87493611.cms||---

Around 18 teams formed by the civic body at divisional level have altogether fined over 400 people, collecting a fine of Rs 80,000 during the last one week. The action is being taken in view of crowd gathering in markets due to Diwali. Although there has been a drop in new cases being reported in the city, threat of the third wave of the pandemic still looms large. Moreover, a section of people are not wearing masks while venturing out of their homes and this has become a matter of concern for the civic body. “If people do not wear masks and maintain social distancing, it could once again spark the outbreak of pandemic. Due to this we have started imposing monetary fines against erring residents who are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” an NMC official said. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said they have been appealing to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently with soaps or sanitizers. “There is a need to wear masks in public places to prevent spread of the infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-not-wearing-masks-face-nmc-music/articleshow/87493622.cms||Tushar Pawar

The reason for this is that these candidates will not be able to complete their internship if the exams are held as per this schedule, said sources. There has been a delay in undergraduate exams for medical students due to the Covid pandemic as a result of which they will not be able to complete the mandatory nine-month internship before the NEET-PG test. An association of medical students have written to NBE to postpone the exams. “The exams need to be rescheduled to July for candidates to complete their internship period on time,” according to sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/250-candidates-may-miss-out-on-pg-exams/articleshow/87495379.cms||---

The authority has decided at its recent meeting to rope in the Goa state biodiversity board (GSBB) to help raise awareness among businesses run along the state’s coastal stretches. “The authority considered the direction issued by the department of environment & climate change vide circular dated October 18, 2021, with respect to reduction in single-use plastic and felt that areas falling under CRZ should be free from single-use plastics,” the GCZMA has said. “The authority decided to hold a consultation workshop together with GSBB to stop usage of single-use plastic by commercial units falling under coastal zone regulation in a time-bound manner,” states the decision taken by the authority. Last month, the state environment department issued an order asking all government offices to curb the use of single-use plastic. Director Dashrath Redkar said in the directives that the initiative to reduce the use of single-use plastic should start with government offices. Redkar said that the use of products such as artificial flowers, banners, flags and pet water bottles should be discouraged, and instead, departments should opt for the eco-friendly alternatives of these products. As per a study conducted by Kochi-based Central marine fisheries research institute, Goa, on its 101km coastline, generates 41kg of beach litter per head, the highest in the country. The 2018 report states that every square meter of the beach sand contains 25.5g of plastic waste in Goa. “Plastic litters such as single-use carry bags, sachets of soft drinks, edible oils, detergents, beverages, cases of cosmetic, toothpaste, PET bottles, ice cream containers, etc, were found on Goa’s beaches,” stated the study. Plastic and other non-biodegradable synthetic materials are the common groups of marine debris responsible for degradation of marine habitats, as per the Kochi-based institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gczma-pushes-for-single-use-plastic-ban-in-coastal-areas/articleshow/87496126.cms||---

Aryaman Vyawahare with a score of 696 (out of 720) is the apparent city topper. TOI uses the word ‘probable’ because there is no official city-wise top three ranking available. The top three ranking is collated purely by information provided to TOI by coaching institutes or parents and students. With such a high score, Aryaman is guaranteed admission to a college of his choice. “I will be choosing KEM Hospital in Mumbai, and would like to specialize in surgery, either cardiac or neuro. My teachers at Wankhede Madam’s Academy helped me achieve this high score,” said Aryaman, whose both parents are doctors. The second probable topper is Atharva Wairagade, with a score of 691, followed by Parth Wankar with 685 marks. Anita Wankhede, who coached all three probable toppers, said, “This year things were different because physical classes were not allowed. So, we made special lecture videos and even started a portal where they could post their queries and our staff would reply quickly. I do believe that if physical classes were allowed, then those in the lower range could also have scored high.” This year’s student enrolment for NEET-UG was 1% more than last year. The exam was conducted in 202 cities, including Dubai and Kuwait, across almost 3,900 centres. NTA has provided All India Rank (AIR) to the candidates and the admitting authorities will draw merit list based on it for the seats of MBBS or BDS in their jurisdiction. When candidates apply to their state, they will mention their category as per state category list. State counselling authorities will accordingly make their merit list. The same is the case with the domicile. The result of NEET-UG 2021 has been declared on the basis of the qualifying criteria prescribed by the National Medical Commission (Medical Council of India and Dental Council of India), and on information submitted by candidates in their online application forms. NTA provided scanned copy of OMRs of all candidates, their responses, answer key and booklet code on the website in the candidate’s login accounts. Candidates were allowed to make challenges, which were duly addressed by NTA before preparation of results. The details and schedule of counselling would be available on the websites of ministry of health and family welfare, medical education directorates of states as applicable. The counselling would be conducted by the respective counselling authorities subject to prevailing rules and norms for admission in medical colleges or dental colleges under their ambit. Candidates are advised to be in touch with respective counselling authorities and institutions concerned for further details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neet-city-probable-topper-scored-696/720/articleshow/87495365.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The district judge, however, asked the woman to tender an unconditional apology to the judge against whom she made allegations. The court also imposed a cost of Rs 1,000 on the applicant and asked her to deposit the amount in district legal service authority by November 11. “We argued in the court on Tuesday that her allegations were derogatory and the withdrawal of application cannot be allowed like this. The court observed that the allegations made by the woman were baseless,” said advocate Hitesh Gupta, lawyer of one of the accused Ashok Jain. “The court also said that it could have initiated contempt proceedings against the woman but it has refrained from doing so as she has withdrawn her transfer application,” Gupta told TOI. They warned her to be cautious and not make such allegations against the court in future.  The woman, a 24-year-old law student, had on October 29 filed an application seeking transfer of the bail hearing of rape accused Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt from the court of additional district judge PT Patel to some other court. She had claimed in the application that the accused may be granted bail and they may harm her if they come out of jail. She added that she had no faith left in the additional district court. Gupta, however, said that the transfer application was done to prejudice the case as Jain’s bail hearing was on Monday.  The girl studying in a private university in Vadodara had filed a case of rape against Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt at Gotri police station in September this year. She had alleged that Jain, at whose CA firm she was interning, had spiked her drinks and raped her. In her complaint, she said Bhatt too raped her at her flat and threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed it to anyone. Jain is a prominent chartered accountant while Bhatt was trustee of a popular temple in Pavagadh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-draws-court-ire-for-baseless-allegations/articleshow/87494452.cms||---

Naresh Parekh, a garment shop owner, said he did brisk business during the past week and that there was still a huge rush of people to buy readymade garments and other clothes. “Covid ad an adverse impact on Diwali business last year. But the scenario has improved this year. There have been positive sentiments in the markets in view of the Diwali festival. Sales have increased a lot this Diwali and our business has reached pre-Covid levels,” said Parekh. “There has been a huge rush of people in the city markets for the past few days to make purchases for Diwali,” said Prafulla Sancheti, a trader. “I had come here with my family members for Diwali shopping by following Covid appropriate behaviour. Last one-and-a-half years were so bad for us due to the pandemic. But the scenario has improved as the cases have significantly reduced. This is a major relief for us,” said Sangita Thakre, a housewife. Meanwhile, Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has appealed to people to follow Covid safety protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distance at public and marketplaces to prevent a rise in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/diwali-bonuses-drive-festive-shoppers-to-nashik-city-markets/articleshow/87493631.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Amendments in farm laws challenged in HC||Ahmedabad: A PIL in the Gujarat high court has challenged the changes made by the state government in agricultural laws that govern the functioning of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs). The petition has been filed by former chairman of Khambha APMC, Premjibhai Senjaliya, through advocate Bhaumik Dholaria seeking removal of amended provisions by the state government in the Gujarat Agricultural Produce Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act in 2020. It contends that agriculturists and APMCs have been aggrieved with amendment of sections 4(A) of 11, 27A, 31ZB, 10(2), 49A and 42B of the Act, which are in violation of the constitutional provisions. The petitioner has stated that the restrictions imposed on and curtailment of powers of committees of APMC by new amendments have taken away the regulation of marking of agricultural produce in market areas and their control has been limited to market yards only. The committees cannot take any action in case of malpractice in market areas by traders or middlemen. The PIL complains that the amendments have placed a total ban with respect to the borrowing capacity of APMC, except with the previous sanction of the director. They have restricted the legal remedy in civil court against any malpractice, the PIL alleged. The petitioner has contended that before the amendment in 2020, APMC committees functioned very smoothly, but their functioning has been adversely hampered due to the new provisions. This has affected tthe constitution of committees. This has also impacted the income of APMCs which was being generated in the nature of cess to the taluka market committees, and this would lead to closure of all taluka APMCs. The PIL also pointed out that powers of licensing authority vested with local APMCs till now have been taken away and invested with the director at state level. Affairs have become unmanageable at the state level. This is an act of usurping powers from the taluka- and district-level APMCs to govt officials and clearly infringes fundamental rights of committees, which are constituted by farmers’ representatives. The PIL has also taken exception to the restrictions imposed on a chairman and vice-chairman of APMC for holding the office of two terms and for keeping them away from office for next two terms. It said that similar changes were brought by the state government in cooperative laws in 1981, but the high court had quashed them in 1984. The PIL is likely to come up for the hearing after Diwali vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amendments-in-farm-laws-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/87495394.cms||---

By evening, customers were seen thronging the shops. The first Dhanteras after a trail of gloom that Covid left has brought the glitter back, said gold traders. Both Dussehra and Dhanteras are marked as occasions to buy gold in India. After a lacklustre Dussehra last month, Dhanteras appeared to bring back happy days, said jewellers. Traders feel that the pent up demand of buyers finally came out. A section of jewellers, especially the smaller ones, however, reported limited buying even during Dhanteras. A proper estimate can only be made in a day or two, said trade sources. The yellow metal this year was cheaper by Rs 4,750 a tola — the standard measure of 10 grams as against last Dhanteras. An investor in one kg silver on the other hand gains Rs 1,000 odd, shows an analysis of figures compiled by the Sarafa Association. In the last five years, one tola of gold has become costlier by Rs 18,400 and one kg of silver has gone up by Rs 25,300. A tola and one kg are the standard measures for referring the price of gold and silver respectively. However, in percentage terms, gold and silver have given 74% and 60% returns in last five years respectively. Since pre-Covid 2019, gold has gone up by 24% and silver by 36%. Rajkumar Gupta of the Sarafa Association said finally things are at a satisfactory level, and can hoped to be improving. “The fear in the air is gone and people are coming out freely to buy gold. Rather, the rush has also led to a shortage of the metal as the demand has been more than expected,” said Nitin Khandelwal, director of the Gems and Jewellery Council based in Akola. Rajesh Thakker of M/s Dipti Jewellers, a wholesale firm in Akola, said the stock was cleared a day before. Heavy buying was seen in shops. Rajesh Rokde of M/s Rokde Jewellers in Nagpur said buying was beyond expectations. Buyers are also expected to take advantage of the lower rates of gold this Dhanteras. G V Iyer of M/s Apex Investment said he could sell sovereign gold bonds to the tune of 24 kgs when the window was open from November 25 to 29. Three other brokers whom TOI talked to however reported a negligible demand for the bonds. However, some brokers reported a steady demand for gold exchange traded funds (ETF) during the day. Sources requesting anonymity said these days rates of gold in the grey market is higher than the on-record sales. This is mainly because of the risks involved following hallmarking of gold ornaments. Hall marking enables tracing of the gold ornament’s movement till the individual buyer’s end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-gold-rush-lower-rates-this-dhanteras/articleshow/87496172.cms||Shishir Arya

Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Navjot Singh Sidhu fly to Kedarnath||CHANDIGARH: Amid reports of widening rift between chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, the party leadership on Tuesday made an attempt to make the two put up a united face, albeit in Uttarakhand as they flew together to pay obeisance at Kedarnath Temple. Accompanied by AICC incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary and speaker Rana K P Singh, Channi and Sidhu met with former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat in Dehradun before proceeding to the temple. This came a day after political drama amid reports that the Punjab government is likely to placate Sidhu by replacing advocate general (AG) A P S Deol, whose appointment had been questioned by him. The PCC chief had also made a veiled attack at his own party’s government, questioning the practice of offering freebies ahead of the elections while adding that claims that the state exchequer was full were a lie. Sidhu tweeted a picture with the caption, “Life is fragile, handle with prayer …. At Kedarnath, the heavenly abode of Lord Shiva ….Har Har Mahadev !” Life is fragile,handle with prayer …. At Kedarnath, the heavenly abode of Lord Shiva ….Har Har Mahadev ! https://t.co/z40FzVq8zq— Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) 1635841051000On Monday, Chaudhary had held meetings with party leaders, with the party high command realising the need for damage control to ensure that friction between the competing groups in the state unit does not escalate further. However, a section of Congress’s own leaders remain skeptical of the “united face” photo ops of Channi and Sidhu. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu tweeted, “United face” of Punjab congress… but why in Uttarakhand why not in Punjab…” Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar too took a jibe by tweeting, “‘Political’ Pilgrims But each one trying to appease a different deity.” Meanwhile, Rawat told media persons after meeting the Punjab leaders, “All is well in our Punjab unit now and everything is running smoothly. We had a challenge and we have overcome it. Everything is going smoothly; I am confident that this will continue and Harish Chaudhary is someone you can learn from.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/united-face-channi-sidhu-fly-to-kedarnath/articleshow/87496170.cms||---

Amarinder said, since he had announced earlier that he would be forming his own party, his team of lawyers was working on the process and had applied to the Election Commission of India for registration. The Election Commission has no objection to the proposed name, Punjab Lok Congress, he said. About the party symbol, Amarinder said, the Election Commission had given three symbols from which one was to be chosen. He said his party has also submitted three different symbols and the final symbol will be chosen from the set of six symbols, three suggested by the Election Commission and three proposed by the party. The party will be formally launched later. The policies, programmes, agenda and vision will be spelt out at the time of the launch of the party, Amarinder added. Not the first timeIt is not the first time that Amarinder will be launching a new political front. In 1984, he left the Congress and joined SAD to protest the Indian Army operation at the Golden Temple. Later, breaking away from the SAD in 1992, Amarinder formed his own political group called the SAD (Panthic), which did not make much of an impact. He then merged his political front with the Congress when he rejoined the party in 1997. Since then, Amarinder has been in the Congress. Last nail in Cong coffin: Punjab BJPPunjab BJP on Tuesday said Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation from the Congress was the last nail in the party’s coffin as he was one of the very few leaders in the party who had secular credentials and stood up over politics whenever national interests were at stake. The Congress had not yet learned from the past that Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar and Jagan Mohan Reddy defeated the Congress when they quit and floated their political parties, general secretary Subhash Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-lok-congress-amarinder-announces-name-of-his-new-party/articleshow/87496166.cms||---

Shailesh Nikam, taluka health officer of Nashik Zilla Parishad said, “On an average, 40,000 doses are administered in the rural areas daily. However, owing to the festive season, people may not come to take the vaccinations. Nonetheless, we have decided to continue with the vaccination process.” Nikam said that they would target the tribal population in the district. “A large number of tribals migrate to other places for work. Either they take up labour works in bigger cities or work at other people's farms in different districts or in other states. However, during festivals like Diwali, they return home for the celebrations. Hence, we have decided to target such a population for administering vaccines,” said Nikam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-zp-targets-10k-vaccines-daily/articleshow/87493629.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The victim was identified as A Murugan, 45, the third son of Arumugam alias Pulipandi from Bommaiyapuram. Police said the accused, Muniyasamy is the eldest of the five siblings but was not married as he was a mentally disturbed person. The man was living near his father’s house while his two younger brothers and sisters got married and were living elsewhere. Arumugam did not give Muniyasamy any share in the property as he did not have a family. He developed a grudge over his siblings over this.

---||Ahmedabad||Chip crisis: Cars miss Diwali bus in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: An optimistic consumer sentiment coupled with a decent demand for cars has not been enough for car dealers to rejoice this Diwali. Even as muhurat purchases led to 30,500 vehicle deliveries across Gujarat on Dhanteras, the sales were largely muted against demand as supply-side constraints were aplenty. Estimates by the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) suggest that a total of 24,000 two-wheelers in addition to 6,500 four-wheelers were delivered on Tuesday. However, sales remained an average 10% down against last year’s Dhanteras celebrated in the midst of the Covid pandemic. “Four-wheeler demand is good and certain brands have shown a minor growth. However, supply shortage has hampered festive season revenues for customers. Currently, dealers do not even need to roll out too many offers to woo customers. Yet, they are compelled to wait 2-8 months for delivery of vehicles,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, FADA, Gujarat region. Jinmay Shah, director (sales) at an Ahmedabad-based car dealership said, “Our sales have improved and overall consumer sentiment is positive. If it was not for the supply shortage, our sales would have easily doubled. However, customers are keeping faith since many of them made bookings on Dhanteras.” Supply-side constraints are expected to continue in coming months, suggest car dealers. In fact, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, in its recent regulatory filing, mentioned that the company facing an adverse impact in vehicle production in November at the SMG plant as well its facility at Manesar. Two-wheeler demand on the other hand has failed to pick up with cost of two-wheelers increasing and schools and colleges not resuming completely due to the Covid-19 situation, according to dealers. “Two-wheeler sales have declined by at least 10% as compared to last year due to many factors including costlier vehicles, but also a higher cost of ownership as fuel prices have increased dramatically,” Shah said. It may be noted that vehicle sales fared slightly better on Dhanteras as compared to 28,500 deliveries on Dussehra. However, this was due to improved supply late in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chip-crisis-cars-miss-diwali-bus/articleshow/87496185.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Goa||Goa: Eye on polls, politicians latch on to Narkasur competitions||Narkasur-vadh events are to Goa what Durga Puja pandals are to West Bengal. So even as West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s ‘Khela Hobe’ chants have begun reverberating across the political landscape of Goa, politicians of all hues have begun loosening their purse strings, more generously than in the past, to support the Narkasur competitions. Ossai Ossai! The game is on! Gone are the days when children grouped up and approached people in their neighbourhood for Narkasur donations. The exercise has now become very formal, wherein village youth groups submit a quotation to their local MLAs and political aspirants seeking financial assistance to build the effigy. And the politicians are more than willing to oblige — for the effigies are made only to participate in the Narkasur-vadh competitions sponsored or organised by the politicians themselves. With several lakhs up for grabs at every competition — and there are many such events across the state — the popularity of the event only soars higher with every passing year. Narakasur-vadh marks the day on which Krishna slayed the demon Narakasur. To mark this legend, in an event that is unique to Goa, giant effigies of Narakasur are erected, stuffed with firecrackers, and burnt at dawn on Narak Chaturdashi, a day before Diwali. “Traditionally, it has been a very low-key affair in Goa,” said Sarvanand Sawant Dessai of Shining Star sports and cultural club, Pongirwal, Curchorem, which has been organising the Narkasur-vadh competitions in Goa since 1984. “The effigies were small then and so was the prize money. From Rs 1,000 as the first prize in 1984, the event has taken on a gigantic form with the first prize now on offer being Rs 55,555. Groups vie to make larger-than-giant size effigies, Krishna images are now mandatory, and professionalism has entered the event like anything.” With professionalism replacing rustic craft in Narkasur-making, as financial implications set in, politicians were quick to leverage the situation. Donations from politicians have thus fuelled creativity and professionalism in modern-day Narkasur competitions. “Not only has it helped in keeping the tradition alive, the creative ways in which the legend is presented generates interest and awareness among the younger generation about our rich ancient history, values and culture,” explains Dessai. “Traditionally, Narkasur effigies would be prepared with waste material lying around in the houses, like cardboard, paper, hay, cloth rags, etc, and set on fire, symbolising the victory of good over evil. The houses would thus get tidy in preparation for Diwali, the festival of lights. Though the event has undergone a change in its manner and form with the changing times, creativity among the youth is finding an expression through such competitions.” While power minister Nilesh Cabral and Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar have been supporting grand Narkasur-vadh competitions in their respective home constituencies of Curchorem and Quepem over the last few years, PWD minister Deepak Pauskar hopped on the bandwagon this year by sponsoring an event in Sanvordem constituency — with handsome cash prizes up for grabs at all three places. For the Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai-sponsored Shree Krishna Vijayotsav competition in Fatorda, the first prize is Rs 1 lakh, with other attractive cash prizes. If the Kavlekar-backed Navyug Vikas Manch, Quepem, has on offer prize money of over Rs 4 lakhs, his wife, Savitri, who has made known her intentions of contesting from Sanguem, has organised a competition in Sanguem offering cash prizes worth over Rs 2 lakh. For the youth clubs, while the moolah from politicians gets the creative juices flowing, for the politicians, the event serves as a perfect platform for self-aggrandizement. Not everybody is convinced, though. “This is nothing but a pattern of politics to bribe the youth,” an aspiring youth leader from Panaji said. “Pan-Goa, it has become a trend for political parties to patronise the narkasur committees and lure voters. The donations are huge but have no constructive use since all the money goes up in flames.” Concurs Anil Gaonker, an electrical engineer who is aspiring to contest the 2022 assembly elections from Sanvordem: “By eulogising Narkasurs and wasting lakhs of rupees on such events, what are we trying to convey to the next generation? It would however make a world of difference if this kind of money is pooled together and utilised for skilling the youth.” Meanwhile, the beats of dhols and tashes have amplified in Goa’s townscape as youth groups rehearse their steps for the demon-slaying competition, setting the stage for a bigger battle of ballots just round the corner.

---||Coimbatore||Private schools to hike bus fare by 25%||Coimbatore: Parents may have to loosen their purse strings as private schools are planning to increase transportation charges collected from students, keeping in mind the rising fuel prices. Schools say they may increase the charges at least by 25%. While a few schools have reopened on Monday, many are planning to reopen from next week after Diwali holidays. Many schools were ready with their vehicles and made arrangements for drivers to operate the buses, but they find it difficult to run by collecting charges that existed before the pandemic. Samson Selladurai, principal of Nava Bharath International School, said about 75% of students in the school use the 11 school buses to reach school. “We charge about Rs 1,600 a month from a student as bus fees. But we cannot run the buses by collecting that charge with present fuel prices. So, a hike of 25% is expected,” he said. An administrator of Sai Vidya Niketan Matriculation School, Mathampalayam, said the school was encouraging the parents to pick up and drop their children and avoid school bus transportation. “In the last 18 months fuel prices were increased by 25%, so we have no option but to increase the transportation charges by 25%. We presently charge Rs 10,000 per year from a student and it may go up to Rs 12,500,” the administrator said, adding that the government must relax charges collected at the RTO offices and give concessions on the insurance charges for school vehicles that ranges from Rs 40,000 – Rs 60,000. Another principal said one of their buses has to run an extra 6km to pick up a student. “We cannot charge only that one student. We can compensate that as in some places we pick up 10-20 students. However, if the petrol prices cross Rs 110, we may have to increase the transportation charges by 30%,” the principal said. Last month, a total 1,226 school buses from across 230 private schools in the district were inspected by regional transport officers and officials from the district administration. Schools are in the process of deciding new drop points and pickup points for their buses and hiring support staffs to accompany children in the bus. Schools, which had asked drivers to get themselves employed elsewhere during the pandemic, are also expecting drivers to return to their old jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/private-schools-to-hike-bus-fare-by-25/articleshow/87495401.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Mentorship illumines Covid orphans’ future||Ahmedabad: They lost one or both their parents to Covid, and along with them, the person they could turn towards for guidance. Realising that the children may now need the guidance of a guardian to make important decision from choosing schools to handling the challenges of life, a few state-based NGOs have taken up a project to provide this guidance to the kids and teens in their formative years. Sanjay Tula of Vishwagram said that the initiative started with an informal survey among their network to see how many kids have lost one or both parents during the pandemic. “To our surprise, the figure was over 1,600. Out of the total, we decided to start with 400-500 based on their immediate requirement and socio-economic conditions,” he said. “The kids will be provided Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000 annually from Class 5 to college.” But financial aid is just one part, he said. “An important requirement is to ensure that the kids are shown direction. This Diwali, we started with sneh milan (meet-and-greet) events at various village levels to informally meet these kids, understand their requirements and how they can be supported. Some only have grandparents who also need hand-holding,” said Sanjay. Thus, Vishwagram and Swapath Trust along with other partners launched an initiative where taluka- and village-level network of teachers would ensure educational and other support. Rajesh Bhat of Swapath Trust said that the teachers would visit homes of the children at least three times annually and their schools at least 3-4 times a year. “Each teacher would look after 5-7 kids. The teachers will arrange for help for those who need support in terms of education,” said Bhat. NGO officials said that the need for hand-holding was felt more in remote areas compared to cities. “In some areas, youths go for only one stream or subject irrespective of their interests due to lack of guidance or understanding the opportunities ahead. Here, the role of a mentor is to make them aware of the different possibilities,” said Sanjay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mentorship-illumines-covid-orphans-future/articleshow/87496186.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Captain Amarinder Singh berates Sonia Gandhi, her kids in 7-page resignation letter||CHANDIGARH: Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh formally quit the Congress party and announced the name of his new political outfit – Punjab Lok Congress – on Tuesday. In a scathing seven-page resignation letter addressed to acting AICC president Sonia Gandhi, he accused the Gandhi family of a “midnight conspiracy” to oust him, adding that he was deeply hurt by Sonia’s conduct and that of her children Rahul and Priyanka. Describing Punjab PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as an “acolyte of Pakistani deep state,” Amarinder raised the issue of how Sidhu was appointed to the top party post in Punjab despite his long stint in the BJP. He highlighted how Congress had allied with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Nana Patole from the BJP and Revnath Reddy from the RSS had earlier been appointed as presidents of Maharashtra and Telangana party units, respectively. “Who is communal and who is therefore secular, it is for the people to judge,” he wrote. The former CM also described the former AICC incharge of Punjab affairs, Harish Rawat, as a “dubious individual.” Captain also alleged that many Congress MLAs and ministers were involved in illegal sand mining, adding that he would make the list of names public. Amarinder, who quit as the Punjab CM on July 28, described his anger and hurt on being subjected to the ignominy of a CLP meeting being convened in the dead of the night and that too through Twitter “at your and your children’s behest.” “I immediately realized that the intention was to belittle and humiliate this self-respecting old soldier. You called me at 10.15 am the next morning and asked me to resign. I did so without batting even an eyelid. However, the crude manner in which the whole operation was executed by the undertakers of the AICC left a very foul taste in the mouth,” he wrote, describing the move as a “third world emergency imposition kind of circus.” “Despite knowing me for the better part of my 52 years in public life and that too at a deeply personal level you never understood me or my character. You thought I was getting on in years and should be put to pasture. I am neither tired nor retired. I intend to soldier on and not fade away,” he added. ‘Cong MLAs, ministers involved in illegal mining’Accused of not acting against the sand mafia, Amarinder clarified, “As far as the issue of illegal sand mining was concerned, the offenders, unfortunately, were the substantive bulk of Congress MLAs and ministers, including an overwhelming number in the current government. One of my enduring regrets would remain as to why I did not take some of them to task. The thought that it would embarrass the party held me back. I do intend to make the list of these people public as this has been provided to me by the Govt of Punjab and state intelligence.” ‘NEARLY ALL PB MPs DIDN’T WANT SIDHU’Taking on Sidhu, Amarinder said he was patronised by Rahul and Priyanka and accused Sonia of turning a blind eye to his shenanigans. He also accused Harish Rawat, whom he described as “perhaps the most dubious individual I had the occasion to make the acquaintance of,” of aiding and abetting him. Highlighting that almost all the MPs from Punjab had unanimously advised against Sidhu’s elevation as the PPCC chief, Amarinder said he too had profound reservations due to the former cricketer’s ties with Pakistan. He wrote that Sidhu had publicly hugged the Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and prime minister Imran Khan, adding: “Khan and Bajwa are the people responsible for sending terrorists across the border to kill Indians. It may be noted that 82 of Punjabi soldiers have been martyred in Jammu and Kashmir since my government took over in 2017.” HIGHLIGHTS NEW GOVT’S INEXPERIENCE:Pointing out his experience of 10 years as a soldier and nine-and-a-half years as home minister of Punjab, Amarinder highlighted that Sonia had given control of the state to “inexperienced” people. “As the peace and security of my state and my country has always remained paramount in the priority of my things, I am quite concerned about the inexperienced hands you have handed over my state to,” he wrote and added: “It is beyond my comprehension as to how these inexperienced hands will handle the security situation in view of the massive influx of weapons you have handed over my state to.” ‘1ST TO OPPOSE FARM LAWS’Amarinder said he was the first to raise the issue of the Centre’s farm laws and called all farm unions for a meeting, then an all-party meeting, and convened a special legislative assembly session to rescind these enactments. “It is again I who supported and facilitated the farmers’ protests while simultaneously urging the Centre to lend a sympathetic ear to their just and genuine demands,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-captain-amarinder-singh-berates-sonia-gandhi-her-kids-in-7-page-resignation-letter/articleshow/87496182.cms||---

Flooded marketplaces, packed flights, trains, and buses and plentiful Diwali special events are the indicators of big Diwali this year. Festivities, which will be on peak from Wednesday, are going to be the most crucial period during the Covid-19 pandemic, said doctors. According to experts, this week and two weeks after Diwali will give us the final picture of whether the pandemic has become endemic or it’s still a chance of the proposed third wave.“It’s like the Genie is inside the bottle in spite of lot of mixing,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “Climatic conditions are not favorable now for intense transmission. So, it’s right time to celebrate. We must ensure that majority of us get both doses of vaccine. In fact, authorities should seriously think of the third dose now,” he added. Psychologists have suggested people to celebrate the festival will all fun and enthusiasm as they are big stress relievers. “Festivals play important role in Indian way of life. They refresh us, bring people closer and give much-needed psychological boost,” said Dr Prashant Chakkarwar adding that a good Diwali will help bringing people out from the feeling of uncertainty and fear. “The entire pandemic phase was full of psychological stress, financial uncertainty and sense of loss. Festive spirit will help many in recovering from it,” he said. Chest and lung specialists have told that using masks in Diwali will not only protect from virus, but also from pollution. “Diwali and pollution comes hand in hand. Excess smoke released from the crackers/fireworks on Diwali may lead to disasters for people with weak lungs. Using masks will give double protection to such people,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, HOD of Pulmonology Department of the Super Specialty Hospital. Pediatricians said that the festival will provide a good opportunity of learning social skills to children. “Urban kids have spent most of the time in last 18 months with their parents and in secured surrounding. Travel to native places for Diwali will give them the much needed change. Children are largely safe from infection. Hence, we must let them enjoy the festival,” said Dr Vijay Dhote, President of the Academy of Pediatricians (AOP), Nagpur. Eye specialists have suggested some valuable tips to have a safe Diwali while bursting crackers. “Eyes are the most sensitive part of our body and second most affected area after hands due to crackers. According to statistics, almost 60% of injuries happen because of the Diwali fireworks to the children and the bystanders. Thus, it is extremely important that you should take care of your eyes on Diwali,” said Dr Gopal S Arora, executive member of All India ophthalmic society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diwali-celebrations-will-be-turning-point-of-covid-doctors/articleshow/87495404.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||On the ground, NEERI stamp hard to be spotted on fireworks||Kolkata: From Behala and New Alipore in south Kolkata to Kumartuli, Dum Dum-Arjunpur in north and New Town Sulanguri, Jyotinagar in the east, firecrackers that did not have the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) stamp or QR code certifying them “green” were on sale in markets across the city. Cops had a trying time running from one makeshift stall to another to stop their sale in violation of the Supreme Court order and seized crackers in many places as well. In a quick trip around the city, TOI checked several such cracker sale points and found several fireworks that contained the word green. But none had the NEERI stamp that declared the contents green and less polluting than the conventional crackers. “I am selling only harmless sparklers, flower pots and charkis. They are environment friendly and do not make any noise. I don’t think I am doing anything illegal. I have had these stocks lying at my home for two years. What else am I supposed to do with it?” said a seller outside Gholesapur Market in Behala when TOI asked her why she was selling illegal fireworks. She, too, asked back a question. “Where will I get green crackers?” That is one answer that has not only eluded retailers but buyers aren't also aware of the places, from where the crackers that conform to the norms can be purchased. Another cracker seller at Taratala-New Alipore crossing, who refused to disclose his name, said the word “green” printed on the packet was enough proof for him to consider the contents green. That it did not have the NEERI stamp or QR code didn't cut any ice with him. “I had the stocks ready and a friend informed me that cracker sales have been allowed. So, I opened the shop on Tuesday. No one has objected so far,” said the man in his 40s, who also sells masks, newspapers and magazines. At Madanmohan Tala near Kumartuli, an elderly woman was found selling crackers on the street. “I don’t know about the legalities. We always sell crackers during this time of the year,” she said. The Supreme Court order on Tuesday allowed the sale and purchase of green firecrackers during Kali Puja-Diwali, Chhath and Jagaddhatri Puja, overriding a High Court order that had banned all forms of crackers, which made the police and state pollution board officials face the herculean task of ensuring that only permitted crackers are used.  All green fireworks are certified by CSIR-Neeri or NABL-accredited labs and each of these packets has a unique logo and a QR code. One can scan the code with the NEERI app to ascertain its authenticity. But members of the state fireworks association conceded that none of the crackers manufactured in Bengal had been certified by NEERI. They, however, claimed that most of them followed the parameters set for the non-polluting tag. Burrabazar Fireworks Traders’ Association joint secretary Santanu Dutta said, “The registered sellers are not selling crackers. But there are some poor hawkers, who have been driven against the wall and may have been selling them. We are sticking to the law.” As per data released by Bidhannagar and Kolkata Police, the banned crackers, weighing more than 4,000kg, have been seized in the last few days and 26 people have been arrested.

Commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta told TOI, “The Supreme Court has imposed a ban on the sale and supply of firecrackers through e-commerce websites. The order is binding on everyone and we are taking efforts to implement it.” The officer reiterated that the firecrackers should be purchased from licensed traders only. The police teams are trying to reach out to all the courier service providers to make them aware of the SC guidelines, so that there is no inadvertent flouting. In addition to this, those found violating the directives, will face a criminal case. An officer, who is part of the team formed to ensure implementation of order, said, “Practically there are certain limitations in screening every parcel that is entering the city. However, certain measures are being taken to ensure that such firecrackers do not make through.” Police said that there is a ban on use of series firecrackers as well as those containing barium salt and also the ones with high decibel sounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-keep-eye-on-online-sale-of-crackers/articleshow/87493652.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Further, around 50 among them are likely to be eligible under the 7.5% quota for government school students for MBBS seats.In Madurai district, around 500 students from government and aided schools who took the E-box course gave the NEET exam this year. Out of 288 government school students who gave the exam, 88 have cleared. Further, 13 students among them had scored above 200 marks. The top scorer among the government school students was BR Priyanka from Avvai Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School who scored 414 marks.

All top three scorers were all those gave the NEET exam for the first time.“We put in a lot of effort over the past one and a half years to train students. We conducted a lot of practice tests and despite challenges of being in Covid-19 pandemic, we were constantly in touch with students to guide them. Last year, the first mark was only around 300, so this year it is definitely an improvement. We are also definitely expecting more number of students to get medical seats this year under 7.5% quota,” said S Vennila Devi, co-ordinator for the government NEET E-box coaching. She added that details of students are being verified on whether they will qualify for the 7.5% quota for government school students and that they are expecting around 50 students at least to be eligible.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Be careful, 1st wave came after Diwali’||Ahmedabad: On the day that witnessed 30 new Covid cases in Gujarat and 5 in city, the officials of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) warned citizens about the consequences of throwing caution to the wind during Diwali festivities. “The pandemic has subsided considerably, but it’s not over yet. Recent images show people walking around without mask orm following social distancing norms. Last year, too, the cases were largely in control ahead of Navratri and Diwali. But we know that the first wave of Covid-19 came after Diwali last year,” said Dr Dilip Gadhavi. “We request citizens to follow protocols including sanitization, wearing masks, and maintaining a safe distance. We should not be complacent even if we are fully vaccinated.” He was speaking at the launch of ‘Doctor on Call’ initiative for Diwali 2021. Along with Ahmedabad Family Physicians’ Association (AFPA), the initiative would provide telephonic medical assistance to citizens from November 3 to 9. The numbers are available on AMA’s official website and social media pages. Dr Pragnesh Vachharajani, secretary of AFPA, said that this year they expect calls related to vector-borne diseases which are still high in the city along with respiratory issues, food poisoning, injuries and burns. “It’s the 12th year of the service and we get about 1,000 calls during the Diwali period when some doctors are not available. This year, instead of giving the specialists’ numbers, we have primarily given family physicians’ numbers – who, if needed can connect to specialists,” he said.  “The doctors will guide patients for best possible treatment. We have also created a WhatsApp group for faster coordination between doctors,” said Dr Hetal Shah, programme coordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/be-careful-1st-wave-came-after-diwali/articleshow/87496193.cms||---

While the guards insisted that the two youths — Ankit and Sonu — were not residents of Ace Platinum, police said Ankit had taken a flat there on rent. The latest episode of violent altercations between residents and guards is the third such to be reported in the city in the past two months, after similar clashes at Lotus Boulevard and Amrapali Sapphire. Around 10.30pm on Monday, Ankit and Sonu arrived at Ace Platinum in a WagonR and tried to enter through the main gate. Since their car did not have a parking sticker of the housing society, Anil and the other guards asked them to make a proper entry in the register. This, police said, angered Ankit. The society had recently changed the agency handling security in the compound and it was only on Monday that Anil and the others had taken over. According to the police, guards attached to the previous agency knew Ankit, which is why he never had to make any entry earlier while getting inside the society. The two youths had come to meet a resident at Ace Platinum. “They live nearby and had come to meet a resident. On Monday, they were stopped by Anil and asked to make an entry. But they abused him, and it snowballed into an assault,” said another guard. Two other youths from the neighbourhood allegedly joined Ankit and Sonu in assaulting Anil. A 35-second video shared widely on social media purportedly shows Ankit dragging Anil and raining blows on him. It is not clear if the two accused are residents of the society or not. The police, however, said that Ankit, originally from neighbouring Sakipur village, had taken a flat in Ace Platinum on rent and ran his business from there. “Sonu is a student and belongs to Makora village nearby,” said a police officer. The police have, however, lodged a non-cognizable report in the case .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-society-guard-thrashed-over-register-entry/articleshow/87496721.cms||Shikha Salaria

TOI had reported that the vaccination centre at Calangute has been shut. Vaccinations conducted at educational institutions, which were political requests, are expected to cease, with schools asking authorities to hand over their premises back to them. Vaccinations, however, will continue at permanent locations by health centres. The government plans to merge the Covid vaccination programme with its routine immunisation programme by next month where vaccinations are conducted on fixed days in the week only. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said centres that are not getting a good response will be gradually closed to give schools their premises back and so that routine immunisation and other national health programmes of vector-borne diseases, family planning, etc, are not neglected. “We want to finish vaccinating the target population as soon as possible,” he said. The state vaccinates an average of 5,000 persons each day, but at the mega vaccination drive on October 31 it managed to vaccinate over 14,000 persons. For most of the beneficiaries, it was their second dose. Statistics indicate that the state is unlikely to meet the deadline set by the chief minister of achieving 100% coverage of the second dose in Goa by November 15. The health department expected a much larger turnout considering it put in all its resources into the mega vaccination camp, taking vaccination down to health sub-centres and sending reminders to beneficiaries about their second dose that is due. Another mega vaccination camp on the lines of that held on October 31 is likely to be held on Sundays in November. The health department has stated that there are over 2 lakh persons yet to receive their second dose. During the second wave, 92% of those who died due to Covid-19 were unvaccinated. On Tuesday, another 4,500-odd persons were vaccinated, of which 562 beneficiaries took their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccination-centres-likely-to-shut-jabs-only-at-health-centres/articleshow/87496212.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Labs to unravel India’s lower Covid death rate||Pune: Scientists at four top institutes in Pune and Bengaluru will study the unique composition of skin and oral microorganisms of Indians, as well as their distinct immune responses, which could give clues about why the Covid death rate in India was relatively lower than among the European and American populations. Scientists spearheading the expansive study involving 800 volunteers said the relatively low Covid mortality in India perhaps had something to do with protection provided by the unique microbiota (community of micro organisms) on the skin, as well as in the oral and nasal cavities of Indians. The study will also assess the long-term immunity, up to nine months, after Covishield/Covaxin vaccination in healthy adults. “In-depth immunogenicity data will improve the ability to make public health decisions on need and timing for booster shots,” Dr Anand Kawade, lead principal investigator of the study from Pune-based KEM Hospital Research Centre told TOI. The other three institutions involved in the study are Pune-based Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore Baptist Hospital and St John’s Research Institute in Bangalore. On assessing the composition of skin and oral microbiome of volunteers before and nine months post-vaccination, Dr Kawade said, “Covid death rate in European and American populations is high in comparison to India. There are theories on distinct skin and mucosal microbiome as well as nutritional components in the Indian population. The study will thus characterise the microbiome in the saliva samples and skin of the 800 participants. The results can give clues on the role of this indigenous microbiome in protecting Indians from a greater number of Covid mortalities.” On the long-term immunity study, he said since Covaxin was an indigenous vaccine, there was a need for data on how long the immunity lasted after two doses of the vaccine. Dr Kawade said the study would also lay a special focus on T-Cell response after vaccination with Covishield and Covaxin. “This is the most important part of the study. Though antibody response post vaccination tends to diminish overtime, the T-cell response is a more durable source of protection. Memory B-cells remember the infection and can thus provide long-term protection,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-labs-to-unravel-indias-lower-covid-death-rate/articleshow/87496192.cms||Neha Madaan

A number of samples are collected for tests. What is the outcome of all the frenetic activity? After all the brouhaha surrounding Diwali food raids this year, the flying squads of the AMC’s health department collected some 394 samples since October 1. After a month, the AMC claims that only three samples turned out to be substandard! As the process goes, the AMC’s flying squads randomly enter eateries, provision stores, and food manufacturing units and collect samples of food found to be ‘suspicious’. These samples are then sent to AMC’s public health laboratory for testing. The results of October’s raids raise questions on the purpose of the AMC’s raids and its collection of food samples. On October 1, at the beginning of Navratri, the AMC collected 54 samples. On October 14, a day ahead of Dussehra, the health department squads made surprise visits to traditional snack outlets and took 55 samples of fafdas and jalebis. On October 16, the AMC collected 81 food samples. The teams also destroyed 332kg of food products found to be unfit for consumption on the same day. On October 25 the same set of flying squads struck yet again and collected 80 more food samples. On October 27, the department announced that during various checks its teams had collected 124 samples and destroyed 75kg of substandard food items in one week. The department also seized 2,018kg of food items worth Rs 3.52 lakh from four dairies. A senior AMC official told TOI, “The results of these samples are usually expected within two or three weeks.” When asked if food samples taken a day ahead of festivals will serve any purpose as Amdavadis are going to throng the same shops, the official did not have any answers. The samples that failed the test included a pack of fryums packed by a trader in Sarkhej, a fruit crush from a vada pav shop in Navrangpura, and rajagara flour from a farsan shop in Nikol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/full-platter-of-food-raids-only-3-bad-hits/articleshow/87496232.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

MNS district president Suhas Dashrathe alleged that the two overhead water tanks supplying water to affected areas were supplying water to “tanker mafias in an illegal manner.” “It is broad daylight robbery. The water meant for citizens of Aurangabad is sold to elements running tanker lobby. The water scarcity prompts citizens to purchase private tankers,” he said.The MNS has also criticised alleged slow pace of work for laying down new water pipeline for Aurangabad. When contacted, civic authorities, requesting anonymity, refuted charges of tanker mafia drawing water from overhead tanks.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: FDA raids sweet, snack makers ahead of Diwali||NAGPUR: The food and drugs administration (FDA) has undertaken a stringent drive against substandard and adulterated food materials, especially sweets, edible oil, namkeen, ‘mawa’ and ‘khoya’, as the festivity around Diwali is setting in. With sweets and snacks beginning to form a big part of socializing, city gastroenterologists too sounded a note of caution against overeating, and consuming foods compromised in quality and made in unhygienic surroundings. FDA assistant commissioner Abhay Deshpande said around 16 sweet shops had been inspected in the city so far as part of the drive. “11 sweet shops were found violating the FDA instructions of using the ‘best before’ label on each tray. Fines of Rs30,000 were collected from six shops, and another five were referred to adjudication by the joint commissioner,” said Deshpande, adding that the samples were sent to government analysts for examination. FDA also inspected around seven edible oil manufacturing units. “During our action on the edible oil makers, we have seized around 15,000 litres oil worth Rs22.5 lakh. We have also inspected five factories making namkeen and served them with improvement notices under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006,” said Deshpande. Urging citizens to be cautious about food quality this festive season, Deshpande said FDA’s campaign against adulteration, spurious colours, substandard material and spurious raw materials would continue. “If the collected samples are found unsafe and injurious to health, imprisonment up to three months and fine would be imposed. If substandard material is found, the adjudicating officer can slap Rs2-5 lakh fine depending upon severity and profitability,” the FDA official added. Meanwhile, gastroenterologist Dr Rachit Agarwal said quantity and quality of food must be wisely chosen during Diwali. “Use of certain types of oil and fat can aggravate cholesterol. One can develop fatty liver too due to overindulgence and poor quality of food, apart from gaining weight which can affect one’s lifestyle,” he said. Dr Agarwal added that issues like acidity, bloating and flatulence may crop up. “In general, adulterations trigger toxicity in the body in the long run,” he said, adding that home-cooked sweets are better than purchased ones. Another gastroenterologist Dr Samir Patil said excess of sweets can cause diarrhoea due to high protein and milk content. “Reflux symptoms with heart burn, bloating, belching, acidity, vomiting and so on can increase,” said Dr Patil, adding that high fat and salt content in namkeen are harmful, if it is consumed in excess. Dr Patil suggested keeping antacids handy during Diwali, but added that prolonged uneasiness should be referred to doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-cracks-whip-on-sweetmarts-namkeen-makers-before-diwali/articleshow/87495424.cms||Soumitra Bose

After searches last month, the I-T had issued a press note where it had said, “The search action has led to the identification of transactions by these business groups (builders) with a web of companies which, prima facie, appear to be suspicious.” It added, “A preliminary analysis of flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes etc. It has been observed that such suspicious flow of funds has taken place with the involvement of an influential family of Maharashtra.” I-T sources said the family referred to was Ajit Pawar’s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nariman-pt-offices-goa-resort-bought-with-tainted-funds-says-i-t/articleshow/87495442.cms||Vijay V Singh

Members of the outfit, through social media posts, are trying to reach out to a maximum number of farmers in the eight districts of Marathwada to ensure a big turnout. Leaders and activists of other farmers’ organisations are being requested to participate. Office-bearers of the Sanghatana said they are upset with the delay in compensation disbursal to the farmers, and the MSEDCL’s unusual proposal to the state sugar commissionerate to instruct the sugar mills to deduct the outstanding power bills from the sugar cane payments of the defaulting farmers. The protesting farmers will also press for the release of kharif crop insurance for 2020-2021, for Rs 50,000 per hectare compensation for all the crop losses, and for stopping the drive to cut the power supply of the farmers. Sanghatana’s youth leader Pooja More said: “Due to the excess and untimely rain, farmers in the state have been suffering for the second consecutive year. Even as the crop loss compensations of the past year are awaited, moves are being made to recover the outstanding power bills from farmers’ sugar cane payments pending with the mills.” She said a large number of farmers have started gathering before they start the journey towards Malegaon on Wednesday night. The farmers will mark Diwali on Thursday by staging a protest. Farmer leaders maintained that to mark their protest, farmers will eat bhakri-thesa in front of Bhuse’s house. “When rest of the citizens will be eating special delicacies prepared for Diwali, we will have jowar and bajra rotis with green chili chutney,” said Vaibhav Pawar, a farmer from Jalna who intends to join the protest. Till date, only the outstanding crop loans were deducted from the sugar cane bills, but this is the first time that such a proposal has been moved to recover power bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmers-being-mobilised-to-protest-in-front-of-bhuses-home-on-diwali/articleshow/87493698.cms||---

Most of the top 10 rankers from Gujarat had to battle Covid-19, not just from the lockdown restrictions point of view but they received some personal setback after they or their close family members tested positive for Covid-19 in the middle of their preparations for exams. Shlok Soni, who achieved AIR-60, was down with Covid-19 last year, while Prasham Shah, who bagged AIR-100, tested Covid-19 positive during the second wave in May this year. Gujarat state topper Hrutul Chhag, who scored 715 marks out of 720 in NEET UG, securing AIR-05 saw his uncle and aunt, with whom he resides in a joint family in Rajkot, battle with Covid-19 infection. For Adit Nair, who bagged AIR-118, Covid-19 struck him twice this year. In the case of Arsh Parikh with AIR-205, it was his mother who was infected with coronavirus twice. About 70,000 candidates from Gujarat had registered for the NEET exams this year. Candidates who cleared NEET are eligible for admission to MBBS, BDS, BAMS and other undergraduate medical and dental courses. The cut-off marks for medical colleges is expected to close higher this time as compared to last year, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neet-toppers-from-state-fought-covid-19-infection/articleshow/87495450.cms||---

After a long wait of five years, the Ludhiana municipal corporation has approved the annual maintenance charge (AMC) to HFCL, the company that had won the bid. Since 2016 when 1,400 cameras were installed at 159 sites in the city, the HFCL has been repairing them free of cost. There was no provision of annual maintenance charges, so the cameras that got burnt or damaged could not be replaced.Of the 1,400 CCTVs installed under the Smart City project, about 650 are functional. An official said, “In these five years, the company has been repairing the cameras and resolving technical issues at their own expenses. The cameras that got burnt or damaged were not replaced as the firm was not getting any maintenance charges. Recently, the Ludhiana Smart City Limited gave approval for the AMC.”“The tender was approved in 2019, but due to Covid-19 outbreak, the work of floating tenders stopped. The tender has been passed and HFCL won the bid. This month, the work on non-functional cameras will be started,” said the official, adding that many non-functional cameras were where the constructions work was going, and these places included Sherpur Chowk, Dhandari, mini secretariat crossing, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Bhai Bala Chowk and Aarti Chowk.

Once a customer agreed for the vehicle, Majeed would give his nod to other gang members to steal the particular vehicle. “The gang had carried out over 15 auto thefts in Jaipur alone. We had constituted a special team to follow the gang’s whereabouts,” Tomar said. Besides the duo, police have listed other accused as Maliram Meena (21), Pawan Meena (26), Abdul Aziz (54) and the police have also detained a minor in the case. Tomar said that in April alone, the accused had stolen as many as eight vehicles. Jaipur police said that auto theft cases were reported at Jhotwara, Bhankrota and Kardhani areas in the past several months. “We have learned that Maliram Meena was in touch with another vehicle lifter Narendra in jail. The latter was also a notorious vehicle lifter,” said an official. Meena struck a rapport with Muskan and her father. “Meena would click pictures of the targeted vehicles to the duo in Pali. They would send it to others. Once the deal was finalised, Abdul would give the nod to steal the vehicle,” the official added. The accused would deliver the stolen vehicle to Abdul in Pali. From there, Abdul and Muskan would sell it to customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/girl-father-among-five-held-for-vehicle-lifting/articleshow/87496225.cms||---

The doctors providing treatment to such patients are calling it ‘dengue-like illness’. Around 1,000 dengue cases have been reported in the past 10 days in the state. According to doctors, other viral fever cases are also spreading along with dengue. “In dengue-like illness, patients complain of rash, fever and in some cases, platelets drop. Sometimes in some viral infections platelets also drop,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur -I). Confirmed cases of dengue are much less in number as compared to viral fever which has dengue-like symptoms. Even in dengue-like illness, patients must get admitted for treatment. Doctors face difficulty in diagnosing dengue clinically as the symptoms are like dengue. “Elisa test is authentic and gold standard diagnostic tool for diagnosing dengue. Those who tested positive by Elisa are counted as dengue positive cases,” said a government doctor. However, doctors said that there is no specific medicine for dengue. “We provide symptomatic treatment in dengue cases like if a patient has fever, we give medicine for fever and if he has other complications, we provide patient treatment for complications, but there is no specific drug for treatment of dengue,” the doctor said. Besides, the health department is taking measures to prevent the spread of dengue in the state. The health department’s teams are visiting door-to-door to spread awareness on dengue and to conduct anti-larvae activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-with-ailments-similar-to-dengue-reach-hosps-for-tests/articleshow/87496249.cms||---

The BJP has hit back, with party leader Ashish Shelar alleging that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) may have helped Singh flee and could be “preparing ground for him to seek political asylum” in a western country. Raut said: “When a person serving on a post equivalent to the director general of police moves out of the country, he cannot do so without the support of the Union government. He has not absconded, but made to move out of the country.” Terming the arrest of former home minister Anil Deshmukh unethical, he said: “The central agencies have arrested Deshmukh based on Singh’s allegations. It is very unfortunate as his arrest is unethical.” Raut said that an investigation can be carried out on the basis of allegations, but Deshmukh was arrested on the first day of the ED inquiry. Anil Deshmukh arrested by ED after marathon questioning; blames Param Bir Singh for false accusationsShelar, however, claimed that the Sena-led MVA had a motive in helping Singh flee. “The MVA government must have helped Singh to go missing, because if he gets caught, he may reveal some work done for leaders of the ruling parties,” he alleged. “Considering the number of cases filed against Singh, it seems to be a strategy for preparing ground for the IPS officer to seek political asylum in a particular western country.

The Karumathampatti police said 35-year-old R Muneeswaran, a native of Thiruppuvanam in Sivaganga district, was removed from police service after he was arrested for stealing a mobile phone and a motorcycle in 2019. A police officer said Race Course police inspector Sujatha had arrested Muneeswaran last year for snatching gold chains from the mothers of two cops from the police recruitment school premises and lodged him in jail. “He, however, came out on bail a few months ago.” On Tuesday around 12.45am, the officer said, Muneeswaran and his accomplice had broken into the house of 38-year-old K Nirmala at Senthil Nagar, when she was away at her mother’s house nearby. “One of her neighbours noticed the burglars’ movement in the house and alerted all the residents in the area. They also called up the Karumathampatti police. When the burglars came out of the house with a laptop and digital camera, they tried to escape by jumping off the compound wall on seeing the nearby residents, who had surrounded the house. While they managed to catch Muneeswaran, his accomplice fled,” the officer said. The residents later handed over Muneeswaran to the Karumathampatti police, who registered a case and formed a special team to nab the escaped burglar. The officer said Muneeswaran was recruited as a cop and posted with the Tamil Nadu Special Police at Kovaipudur in the city in 2011. He was moved to the city armed reserve police force in 2017 and terminated from the service in December 2019 after he was caught in theft cases. “Muneeswaran subsequently became a construction worker and addicted to alcohol.

---||Kochi||No terror act by Swapna Prabha Suresh, Sarith PS & others, says Kerala HC||KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday granted bails to eight of the accused in ‘diplomatic gold smuggling’ case, including key accused Swapna Prabha Suresh and Sarith PS. A division bench of Justice K Vinod Chandran agreed with the contention of the accused and said the chargesheet, prima facie, does not disclose a terrorist act as defined under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA. The othere who got bail were 7th accused Mohammed Shafi P of Malappuram, 6th accused Jalal AM of Muvattupuzha, 10th accused Rabins Karikkanakudiyil Hameed of Ernakulam, 5th accused Ramees KT of Malappuram, 11th accused Sharafudeen KT of Malappuram, and 12th accused Mohammed Ali of Muvattupuzha. The accused were represented by senior advocates CC Thomas, S Sreekumar, and S Gopakumaran Nair and advocates Nireesh Mathew, Sooraj T Elenjickal, and Manu Tom Cheruvally. The accused had relied on a division bench’s judgment (Muhammed Shafi P vs NIA, Kochi of 2021) to contend that the offences alleged is only smuggling and UAPA is not attracted. Through the judgment, a division bench had held that smuggling of gold is covered by the provisions of the Customs Act and will not fall within the definition of ‘terrorist act’ under Section 15 of UAPA. As per the NIA case, Customs had seized 30.422kg of gold, worth Rs 14.82 crore, being smuggled through Trivandrum International Airport by camouflaging it as diplomatic baggage. Swapna and Sarith, using their connection with the UAE consulate, were accused of facilitating the smuggling. By large-scale smuggling of gold, the accused threatened the economic stability of the country and therefore committed a terrorist act. In the judgment, the court said, prima facie, there is nothing in the chargesheet to find the accused having indulged in a terrorist act other than mixing the narration of facts and allegations in the chargesheet with words such as “damage to economic security and stability of the country and terrorist activities”. The court directed their release upon executing a bond for Rs 25 lakh each with two solvent sureties each. The accused were also directed to deposit their passports with the special court, not to leave Kerala without the court’s permission, or try to influence witnesses directly or indirectly. The court began the judgment with poet and lyricist Ayyappa Paniker’s words in a popular song of 1992 from the movie ‘Cheppadi Vidya’ titled ‘Verumoru Moshtavayorenne Nee Kallannennu Vilichille’ and said the accused ihere are lamenting that ‘We are petty smugglers unduly labelled as terrorists’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-terror-act-by-swapna-sarith-others-says-hc/articleshow/87495487.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh entered into deals through web of companies: ED to court||MUMBAI: A few hours after the post-midnight arrest of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh (72), the Enforcement Directorate produced him before a special holiday court on Tuesday, stating he was the key person in the Rs 100 crore money laundering case and the agency needed to investigate a “foreign angle” in the case apart from establishing the money trail. Read AlsoMoney laundering case: Ex-Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh arrested by ED after over 12 hours of questioningFormer Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate late Monday night after over 12 hours of questioning at its office at Ballard Estate.The court remanded Deshmukh (72) in ED custody till November 6. The ED said Deshmukh has emerged as “the important cog in the wheel” and that he was the “prime beneficiary of the proceeds of crime.” The ED said his sustained interrogation is required to get to the bottom of nefarious deals entered into by the accused through a complex web of companies. Deshmukh, dressed in a white kurta pyjama, was produced in court at 12.30 pm. Opposing Deshmukh’s custody, his lawyer Vikram Choudhari told the court his client’s shoulder is dislocated and he needs constant support. He said Deshmukh had recovered from Covid in February, has a heart ailment and is suffering from hypertension. The court allowed his plea for home food and medicine during ED custody, advocate Aniket Nikam said. They denied Deshmukh had not co-operated with investigations. Anil Deshmukh arrested by ED after marathon questioning; blames Param Bir Singh for false accusationsThe ED’s remand said that with help of close associates, the Deshmukh family was indirectly controlling and managing business activities in various companies and laundering money by creating a complex web of transactions. The ED cited three instances to explain his modus operandi to convert unaccounted cash he received via illegal means into legitimate money through suspicious companies. “These entities appear a vehicle for conversion for cash into cheques through these benami transactions,” the ED’s remand plea submitted and argued by ASG Anil Singh said. The ED sought Deshmukh’s 14-day custody. In one of the instances, ED cited the statement of Samit Isaacs, who was director along with Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh in 3 companies. ED alleged that it was found they have purchased a company, Greenland Buildspace Pvt Ltd, with an underlying asset value of Rs 4.75 crore for only Rs 3.75 lakh from one Sanjay Kondawar. The ED said it was to be noted that the balance sheet of the company did not have any underlying liabilities at the time. ED’s investigations found payment for a Worli flat owned by Deshmukh in the name of wife Aarti was made entirely by cash in 2004, but the sale deed was done in February 2020 when he was home minister. Further, ED submitted Deshmukh’s family acquired 50% ownership of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd including its assets, land and shops, total book value of around Rs 5.34 crore by merely paying Rs 17.95 lakh, that too after a substantial gap. These properties were provisionally attached in July 2021 under the PMLA Act. A source said the currently market value of land owned by the company in Uran is worth several hundred crores. ED alleged that during his questioning on Monday, Deshmukh refused to co-operate and did not provide the required details, which led to his arrest. The ED stated that analysis of various bank accounts of entities allegedly utilised for the purpose of infusion of Deshmukh’s ill-gotten money reveals the money is flowing from companies indirectly controlled by his family members to companies directly controlled by his family and vice versa. The ED is investigating the money laundering case based on the CBI FIR where former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that state home minister (Deshmukh) had asked now-dismissed API Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. The ED remand stated Deshmukh, by virtue of his position as home minister, received Rs 4.7 crore, collected from orchestra bar owners and managers during the pandemic. Deshmukh’s CA, Sudhir Baheti, told ED he had introduced Delhi-based hawala operators to Hrishikesh. Rs 4.18 crore ( in various tranches) was received by the trust from the paper companies of the hawala operators in the garb of donation. The defence said those who made allegations are themselves embroiled in multiple cases and one person is nowhere to be found. The ED said in spite of summoning him several times, Deshmukh had never appeared. The media was not allowed entry into the court room due to “overcrowding”, the judge noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-to-court-deshmukh-entered-into-deals-through-web-of-cos/articleshow/87495486.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||India||J&K principal, official axed for terror ties||NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: The Jammu & Kashmir administration on Tuesday sacked two more government employees — a deputy superintendent of jails in J&K prison department and principal of a government school in Bijbehara — under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, citing their alleged terror links. DSP Feroz Ahmad Lone, according to J&K government sources, was working with terror commanders to send Kashmiri youths to Pakistan and POK for weapons training so that they could later be pushed back into Kashmir as Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists. Principal of Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Bijbehara, Anantnag Javid Ahmad Shah too was found to be a hardcore terror supporter who played adviser to Hurriyat and Jamaat e Islami (JeI) operatives in Bijbehara during the violent clashes that followed the killing of Hizb terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016, J&K government sources told TOI. Appointed in 2012 under Omar Abdullah government, DSP Lone was allegedly working for Riyaz Naikoo, the top Hizb commander who has since been killed. Investigation revealed that two youths — Danish Ghulam Lone of Litter, Pulwama and Sohail Ahmad Bhat of Dogripora, Pulwama — were recruited and asked by Riyaz Naikoo to meet his jailed associate, terrorist Ishaq Palla. Danish and Sohail reached Central Jail, Srinagar and informed Ishaq Palla about their arrival. However the jail staff refused to give permission to the two to meet Palla and ordered them to leave the jail premises. When Palla learnt this, he approached DSP Lone who after consulting him “misused his official position and assisted in issuance of pass in respect of both Danish and Sohail,” said a source. Lone went to the reception area himself and brought both Danish and Sohail inside the prison to meet Palla. “It was in this meeting that a criminal conspiracy was hatched to send the duo to Pakistan for arms training,” an official claimed, adding that both were, however, arrested before crossing over to the neighbouring country. An J&K government official said: “It is an open secret that prisons in J&K were being used as a ground for radicalisation and even sensational assassinations and terror plots were hatched from there prior to August 2019. The role of officers like Feroz Lone in facilitating such activities is what led to a complete breakdown of the prison system”. Javid, the school principal whose services were terminated on Tuesday, was initially appointed as a lecturer in 1989 when Farooq Abdullah was the chief minister, but later went on to become the principal of a government school for girls in Bijbehara. He has been a hardcore terrorist supporter and ardent sympathiser of Hurriyat and Jamat-e-Islami (JeI), claimed J&K government sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-principal-official-axed-for-terror-ties/articleshow/87497329.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SRK’s manager paid money to save Aryan, but it was returned, says D’Souza||Mumbai: Sam D’Souza, one of the persons mentioned in the affidavit submitted by Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the cruise drug bust case, has claimed in a television interview that Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, had paid money hoping to save the actor’s son Aryan from arrest, but the money was returned when they realised it was not possible. D’Souza, a businessman, alleged that Dadlani had handed over Rs 50 lakh to K P Gosavi, another witness in the same case, but when he realised that Gosavi was a “cheat”, he asked him to return the money to her. Sail, in his affidavit, had mentioned that Gosavi, Dadlani and D’Souza met early October 3 at Lower Parel. Sail, bodyguard to Gosavi, dropped him to his Vashi residence. Gosavi later asked Sail to pick up money from outside a hotel in Tardeo. A person arrived in a car and gave Sail two bags, which he took to D’Souza at Trident Hotel. D’Souza counted the money and said it was only Rs 38 lakh, the affidavit stated. Sail claimed to have overheard a co-nversation where Gosavi and others discussed demanding Rs 25 crore, of which Rs 8 crore was to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. “After much abuse and pr-essure, we managed to recover Rs 38 lakh from Gosavi, the rest we contributed and paid back to Dadlani and we understood that Gosavi was a cheat,” D’Souza told the TV channel. D’Souza clarified that Gosavi had saved Sail’s phone number as ‘SW’ and told him that he was under pressure from ‘SW’ (Sameer Wankhede). But, through Truecaller app, D’Souza realised it was Sail’s number. Clarifying that he had nothing to do with the October 2 raid, D’souza said he got a call from one Sunil Patil on October 1, who claimed to have some information about the party onboard the cruise ship the next day. “Patil asked me to connect him to the NCB. Hence, I called up Gosavi and connected the duo,” he claimed. D’Souza said he assumed that Gosavi had recorded Aryan’s voice note saying, “Papa, I am in NCB’s custody,” in his phone. Aryan told Gosavi to contact Dadlani and he is believed to have sent this voice note to her to reaffirm that he has access to the NCB office and was bargaining on behalf of an NCB official. D’Souza said he agreed to help only after Gosavi told him that no drugs were found on Aryan and he then sent a message to Dadlani through a contact. “I never absconded. I will file an affidavit in a day or two as unknown people have been calling me and visiting my house impersonating police and issuing threats,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-srks-manager-paid-money-to-save-aryan-but-it-was-returned-says-dsouza/articleshow/87495497.cms||Ahmed Ali

The drug was being smuggled in a truck from Raigarh in Odisha to Hindoli area in Bundi for sale between Rs 10,000 – Rs, 15,000 for a kilo. Bundi district SP Jai Yadav told TOI that they had received reports of illegal sale of drugs and ganja in the district that led to the arrest of these smugglers. The four accused were identified as Amerlal alias Amit (30) of Patna, Mahendra Meghwal (29), Bahadur Meena (22) and Raju Meghwal (19) of Hindoli police station area in Bundi. In the initial interrogation, it was learnt that Amerlal had purchased ganja in Raigarh for Rs. 2,000. He planned to sell it in Hindoli and other areas of Bundi district. Raju Meghwal gave the money for purchase of ganja, which they would sell between Rs. 10,000-Rs. 15,000 in local area. A trip by truck with illegal ganja would give them a profit of Rs. 1.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-of-ganja-smugglers-busted-in-bundi/articleshow/87496269.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘A’ grades missing for councillors at corporations||NEW DELHI: Out of the 265 councillors surveyed across the three municipal corporations, none of them scored an A grade (80-100% marks) in overall performance. This was revealed in a consolidated report released by NGO Praja Foundation based on data from April 2017 to March 2021. The NGO evaluated the councillors on issues raised, quality of issues raised, meetings attended to discuss public matters, questions raised based on residents’ complaints, criminal records, education and qualification. However, due to irregularities in fund allotment, the utilisation factor was not included in the report. The data was obtained from the municipal secretaries, engineering (planning) and accounts departments, Election Commission of India’s website and Delhi Police. One of the reasons for the decline in councillors’ overall performance was attendance. “Attendance in meetings gradually dropped from the first year to the third year of their term. The attendance for north corporation declined from 78.8% in 2017-18 to 73.4% in 2019-20, in South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) from 79.6% in 2017-18 to 72.4% in 2019-20, and in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) from 82.3% in 2017-18 to 72.6% in 2019-20,” said Nitai Mehta, managing trustee, Praja Foundation. “The drop in the fourth year could be attributed to meetings not being held physically because of the pandemic. Online meetings could have improved attendance considerably,” added Mehta. Even after completing four years in office, not a single councillor scored an A (between 80% and 100%) or B (less than 80% but more than or equal to 70%) in the “Quality of Issues Raised” parameter. “The overall average score in raising issues compared with citizens’ complaints was a mere 38.3%. Considering that the civic elections are scheduled next year, the report card holds a lot of importance for the general public,” said Yogesh Mishra, research and data head, Praja Foundation. EDMC councillor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said, “I have not seen the report. But when it comes to quality and quantity of questions, many want to raise them. However, due to the ruckus created in every meeting by the opposition unnecessarily, it becomes difficult to even continue the session.” Abhishek Dutt, the councillor from Andrews Ganj, said development takes place only when local representatives meet residents regularly and get their issues resolved by officials. “I’m thankful to the NGO for appreciating my hard work,” he added. Chhail Bihari Goswami, north corporation leader of the House, said he would only comment after going through the report. As far as the quantity of issues raised was concerned, 25% (69 out of 265) of councillors raised more than half the number (32,356) of total issues (62,184) between 2017 and 2021. “This reflects on the reluctance of councillors to execute their constitutional duties, which in turn impacts the quality of life of citizens,” said Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-grades-missing-for-councillors-at-corpns/articleshow/87516508.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Theatres wait for Diwali releases to run full house||Coimbatore: The state government’s decision to allow 100% occupancy in cinema halls from Monday hasn’t benefited the theatres in the city, as the number of viewers hasn’t seen a spike in the first two days. Theatre owners said they were awaiting star-studded movies such as ‘Annaatthe’ and ‘Enemy’ to hit the screens to pull the crowd. Both the movies are scheduled to be released for Diwali. Theatre managers said the movies in general weren’t drawing huge crowds for more than a week now. They said the recent releases such as ‘Doctor’ and ‘Aranmanai 3’ had received good response initially, but they were not drawing crowds any longer. “It has been more than three weeks since a crowd-puller movie has hit the screens. The number of people visiting theatres has dropped to new lows in the past week.” The scene wasn’t any different on Tuesday, when only a few people turnout to watch movies, that too only to kill time. P Benjamin, who visited KG Cinemas for a matinee, said he just wanted to check if there were any interesting movies. A native of Karamadai, he had come to the city for some work. He decided to watch a movie, as he had some spare time in-between. “Only Sivakarthikeyan-starrer ‘Doctor’ has attracted some crowd in the recent weeks. While only 50% of the occupancy was allowed, no other movie was screened with filling all the 50% seats. For the noon show today (Tuesday), we have sold only 40 tickets. On most of the days we are screening the movies only for the sake of it,” said manager of a prominent theatre in the city. N Sathaiah, supervisor, Shanthi Theatre, said they were betting big on movies such as Rajinikanth-starrer ‘Annaatthe’, and Vishal & Arya-starrer ‘Enemy’ to pull more crowd. “Tickets for ‘Annaatthe’ have already been sold out for Diwali and the subsequent days. We are all set to see fully crowded halls after a long time.” Theatre owners are also concerned about many good movies getting released on OTT platforms. One of the theatre owners in the city said Suriya-starrer ‘Jai Bhim’, which was released on an OTT platform, was received well by viewers. “Had it been released in theatres, it would have given tough competition to other films scheduled for Diwali. With only a few movies getting released on all the screens in the city, there will not be any crowd after four to five days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/theatres-wait-for-diwali-releases-to-run-full-house/articleshow/87495501.cms||V Devanathan
---||Ahmedabad||Man killed 45 yrs before his death to grab land||Ahmedabad: When Amrut Thakor, 39, accessed the revenue department’s website last year to check how land records had been digitized, the ground shook beneath his feet. Somebody else was shown as the owner of his ancestral land measuring 2,000 square metres in Uvarsad village of Koba. When Thakor made inquiries, he discovered that his distant relative Dinaji Chauhan had submitted an application to the district collector for the grant of ownership of the land. Thakor had submitted a plea last year to the special investigation team (SIT) of the district collectorate to probe into the fraud. The report revealed that Chauhan along with four others had forged documents to grab the land. Chauhan had forged the death certificate of Thakor’s father, Sanaji Thakor, to show that Sanaji had passed away in 1972. Sanaji had actually died 45 later, in 2017. Chauhan forged the death certificate to fraudulently establish that Sanaji had died without having any children and Chauhan, the grandson of Sanaji’s maternal aunt, was the only heir to the property. With the help of graphic designers, the accused submitted the document to revenue officers to construct the case that Sanaji had died even before marrying. On the basis of the inquiry report of the SIT, Adalaj police of Gandhinagar on Monday registered a case of forgery, cheating, breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy. The provisions of the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act have been invoked as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-killed-45-yrs-before-his-death-to-grab-land/articleshow/87495506.cms||---

Anil Acharya, attorney for complainant Magharam alias Meghraj, told TOI that a contempt case was filed against the two office bearers of UIT in September 2017 following a land dispute in which, despite the court's ban, the UIT initiated the auction process and published an advertisement in newspapers. The court had already ordered an interim injunction to maintain status quo and Gangashahar police was appointed the receiver of the disputed land, said Acharya. Instead of complying with the order, Jaiswal and Ranka initiated the auction process and an advertisement was published in newspapers in this regard. The contempt petition was filed before the court by Meghraj on October 4, 2017 against Jaiswal and Ranka, a BJP leader. On Tuesday, additional civil judge, No. 2, Bikaner, Hukmichand Gahnolia passed an order to punish Jaiswal and Ranka with one month civil imprisonment. Jaiswal was promoted to IAS cadre while being the UIT secretary in Bikaner and is currently posted as Dholpur collector. At the same time, the then trust chairman Ranka stepped down from the post after the Congress government came to power. Dholpur collector Jaiswal told TOI, “I have received information about the Bikaner court order; it is a bailabale offence. I will appeal against the court decision in this matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-month-jail-sentence-for-dholpur-collector/articleshow/87496301.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Teachers fear Gurukul Kangri University may lose ‘A’ NAAC accreditation due to internal rift||Haridwar: A team of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), a UGC body, will shortly visit Haridwar’s Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya for an assessment, as part of its evaluation of universities and colleges this year. Internal rift in the university may affect its current ‘A’ rating, fear stakeholders. A total of 125 cases are also pending against the university in court. Some recent decisions taken by vice-chancellor (VC) Roop Kishore Shastri proved to be unpopular with staff members. Services of some non-teaching staff were terminated, salaries of some teachers were deducted, leading to resentment. Shrawan Kumar Shama, a senior professor said, “There has been undue delay in promotion of teachers under career advancement scheme, for which applications were submitted in 2019 by over 20 teachers. About a dozen of them retired without getting promoted.” “Travelling allowance rules applicable to only Central government employees has caused monthly financial loss of Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 to university employees. Salaries of teachers working under the self-finance scheme (SFS) have arbitrarily been reduced or fixed. This has demotivated the employees. Their apathy is bound to negatively impact the NAAC assessment,” he said.  After 20 Group-D employees were terminated (as per government order, the university said), they moved to the high court and challenged the order. SFS teachers moved court too. In one case, the court ordered recovery money from a professor to be reduced from Rs 36,000 per month to rs 18,000 per month. However, the VC maintained that the recoverey amount is justified. A case of contempt of court was then registered against the VC. “The recovery from the teacher's salary was necessitated as he had taken salary for 13 years from the university as well as retirement benefits, including pension from the institution he served earlier,” the VC. The VC said that the employees' resentment is unjustified as the university has only taken measures over the last two years to “improve its academic and administrative standards” “Twenty new courses in the university and its Kanya Gurukul campus were introduced, teaching posts lying vacant for two decades were filled and appointment of 120 teaching and non-teaching staff are underway. Many teachers are working on important projects. Moreover, university land worth several crores, previously occupied by mafia, has now been freed,” he added. He also refuted all charges levelled against the university and attributed the delay in teachers' promotions to ambiguity in rules. "A letter has been sent to the UGC, seeking clarification and a response is awaited. No promotions in any of the three categories of assistant professors are pending as of now. As regards Group-D employees, outsourcing was done to comply with a specific state government order," he told TOI. “For SFS teachers, no clear rules existed. The university framed fresh rules and got these approved by the board of management (BoM), the highest university body, in 2020, and implemented these with immediate effect. As a result, certain benefits the teachers are getting were affected, not their salary,” Shastri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/teachers-fear-gurukul-kangri-university-may-lose-a-naac-accreditation-due-to-internal-rift/articleshow/87494649.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||Drug trade flourishing under BJP, alleges Cong||Nagpur: Drug trade is flourishing under the BJP’s patronage, alleged Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe here on Tuesday, citing recent drug bust at Mundra port in Gujarat and the much discussed Aryan Khan case. Addressing the media in Nagpur, Londhe said detailed investigation must be done as to why a witness in the drugs on the cruise case had visited Gujarat just before the raid by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). “Kiran Gosavi is a witness in the cruise drugs case, but he had visited Gujarat in a private car. This vehicle is registered in the name of one Ravindra Kadam, and we want an investigation into the identity of this person. We had sent some people to the address mentioned in the vehicle’s registration details, but did not find any Kadam residing there. More skeletons will tumble out of the cupboard if the connection between Kadam and NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who carried out the raid on the cruise liner, is probed,” he said. Citing the huge quantity of drugs that were seized at Mundra port, Londhe questioned why that investigation was taken over by the National Investigating Agency (NIA). “Initially, it was the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) which was looking into the case, but then the NIA took over. The NIA is under the home ministry and recently Amit Shah had said Gautam Adani (founder of Adani Group which owns Mundra port) is his friend,” said Londhe. When asked if his allegations against the BJP are a continuation of what NCP leader Nawab Malik has already pointed out, Londhe said, “We are doing this because we see a larger interest. The drugs which have already entered our country are a threat to the young generation and this needs to be stopped. We are talking about how drug peddlers are getting direct and indirect benefit because of their connection with the BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drug-trade-flourishing-under-bjp-alleges-cong/articleshow/87495519.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Private bus operators hike fares to cash in on Diwali rush||COIMBATORE: Private bus operators have increased the fare to the city from Chennai by anywhere between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 for airconditioned sleeper buses, as the demand has increased with people returning to their hometown in large numbers for Diwali. The bus fare to Chennai from the city has also shot up, with the people booking in advance to return to their workplace after the festival. While an airconditioned sleeper bus ticket was priced at anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 900, the fare has shot up to Rs 1,400-Rs 1700 now. Premium bus tickets are, meanwhile, sold at up to Rs 2,200. C Vimalraj, a resident of Ganapathypudur in the city, said a bus ticket to Chennai used to cost only Rs 800 on any normal days. “But now the fare has increased to Rs 1,500. Since only a few seats were available, I had no other option but to book the ticket. The price might go up if I book at the last minute.” People, who do not mind spending a few hundred rupees extra, are opting for air travel. They said compared to the premium bus fare, the flight ticket was higher only by around Rs 1,000. A private bus operator based in Gandhipuram said the festival time was an opportunity for them to make some money after incurring huge losses during the Covid-induced lockdown. “We hadn’t operated buses for months together during the lockdown. But we were forced to pay all the taxes. We can earn something only now.” A transport department official said they had already warned the bus operators against hiking the prices and asked them to stick to the prices that were fixed by the government. “Surprise inspections would be conducted and strict action would be taken against the erring bus operators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pvt-bus-operators-hike-fares-to-cash-in-on-diwali-rush/articleshow/87495511.cms||V Devanathan

Addressing a press conference at Bandra on Tuesday, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said it is not the party’s job to give Wankhede a character certificate. “We support NCB in its action against drugs ...Action must be initiated against those in possession of drugs like charas, ganja or even herbal tobacco irrespective of the quantity and the person involved,” he said. Accusing NCP’s Nawab Malik of being secretive and fabricating issues, Shelar said he has been making “revelations of past incidents” since Aryan Khan’s arrest. “Malik’s son-in-law was arrested for drug possession and was in jail for eight months. It is clear Malik knew about the deals and has violated his constitutional oath of office by not informing the governor...”  Shelar said ever since BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis threatened to “drop a bomb” against Malik, there has been a change in the latter’s tone and body language.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-distances-itself-from-row-over-ncb-officer-wankhede/articleshow/87495517.cms||---
---||Delhi||Subsidy limit for first 1,000 e-cars reached, says Gahlot||New Delhi: Transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Wednesday said since the launch of Delhi government’s Electric Vehicle (EV) policy in August last year, the first 1,000 electric cars registered in Delhi had been provided subsidy and more than Rs10 crore disbursed to 700 e-cars already. The share of electric cars in annual car sales was 0.1% when the EV policy was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 7. To promote EVs, a purchase incentive of Rs10,000/kWh of battery capacity was provided with a maximum limit of Rs 1.5 lakh per e-car. “Delhi government has neither withdrawn nor stopped the EV subsidy on four-wheelers. The subsidy, as mandated under the Delhi EV policy, is only applicable for the first 1,000 e-cars, and we’ve already reached the limit,” Gahlot said in a statement. “The department has disbursed Rs 10.47 crore for 700 e-cars. It will soon publish a list of all registered 1,000 cars that are eligible for subsidy,” he added. As part of the policy, Delhi government provides Rs 30,000 purchase incentive for average e-two-wheeler with 2kWh battery and Rs 30,000 as purchase incentive for e-autorickshaws, e-rickshaws, e-carriers etc. Apart from this, the government also provides Rs 5,000 incentive for scrapping old two-wheelers for an electric one and a 100% subsidy for the purchase of charging equipment up to Rs 6,000 per charging point under the EV policy. In the statement, Gahlot clarified the exact line from the EV policy, which reads — “A purchase incentive of Rs 10,000/kWh of battery capacity shall be provided per electric four-wheeler (subject to a maximum incentive of Rs1,50,000 per vehicle) to the registered owners of the first 1,000 e-cars to be registered in Delhi after the issuance of this policy.” Delhi government aims that electric vehicle shall contribute to 25% of the newly registered vehicles across Delhi by 2024, and total 5 lakh electric vehicles in Delhi in the next four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/subsidy-limit-for-first-1000-e-cars-reached-says-gahlot/articleshow/87516553.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Heavy rainfall throws life out of gear in city||Coimbatore: Heavy rain pounded the city on Monday night, submerging many roads and subways. Residents who had stepped out for various reasons had a tough time reaching their houses, as it rained continuously for more than four hours starting from 7.30pm. City roads were filled with rainwater, which hit the traffic flow. As vehicles moved at a snail’s pace, traffic snarls were a common sight on the waterlogged roads on Monday night. Some roads remained submerged on Tuesday too, adding to the woes of commuters. While the fire and rescue services personnel were kept on high alert throughout the night, corporation workers worked tirelessly to drain out the water from the roads. The city witnessed intermittent rain on Tuesday as well. A tree was uprooted in a rain-related calamity on Race Course Road on Monday night. Corporation workers were quick to remove the tree from the road and restore vehicular movement. The Selvapuram bypass road was submerged after the Ukkadam Periakulam lake overflowed. Narikurava Colony at Kovaipudur and Avinashi flyover underpass were also flooded with rainwater, throwing life out of gear. “Traffic movement often came to a standstill in and around Avinashi Road,” said a source with the city corporation. As per the meteorological department, the district had recorded 300.3mm rainfall for the 24 hours that ended at 8am on Tuesday. Coimbatore south received the highest rainfall of 52mm, followed by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University area (51mm), Sulur and Pollachi (35mm each), Mettupalayam (29mm), airport area (26mm), Chinnakalar (19mm), PN Palayam (14.20mm) and Aliyar (11mm). Annur, Valparai and Cincona areas received only less than 10mm rain. According to the data available with the agriculture department, the district has received good rainfall so far this year, compared to last year. The district has recorded an average rainfall of 515.2mm till October 31 this year, against 368.27mm in the comparable period last year. With the recent showers, the district has received an average rainfall of 534.6mm so far this year. In October alone, the district has received 177.5mm rainfall this year. An official said the district had received 34.7mm more rain than usual in October. Last year, the district had received only 82mm rain in October. “With two more months to go, the district is all set to get more rainfall this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rainfall-throws-life-out-of-gear-in-city/articleshow/87495535.cms||V Devanathan
---||Noida||Sent home or hidden in stalls, crackers dodge ban in NCR||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Some are taking orders on WhatsApp and delivering them at the doorstep. Some have them stashed among diyas and Diwali decor on sale at stalls, to be revealed only to “trusted” customers. For those looking hard enough, getting firecrackers is not that tough in Noida and Ghaziabad, never mind the complete ban on their sale and use across Delhi-NCR. They are on offer from several traders in the industrial areas of Muradnagar and Loni in Ghaziabad and stores in places like Nithari and Nevada in Noida. A man selling Diwali items from a stall at Sector 22 in Noida admitted he had crackers, too, a disclosure he only makes to those who persist beyond his initial denials. “I have a few packets on the counter. But they are hidden behind colourful puja items in such a way that they are not easy to spot,” he said. Most of the stock, he added, was old because Covid and the lockdowns had led to a pileup. Fresh crackers have been sourced from Bulandshahr, Loni and Aligarh. “The usual cracker market no longer exists. We also don’t order in bulk, like we did earlier from south India (Sivakasi). There are a few manufacturers in Loni who supply small quantities. Since crackers are not readily available in the market, customers are not very choosy about brands and quality,” said a trader at Shahdara in Ghaziabad. The sales, while clandestine since no licences have been issued, have also been slow, registering marginal pickups this season during Karva Chauth and the day India played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup. Cracker traders have jacked up prices, charging 20-25% above the MRP. Procurement through networks on instant messaging apps like WhatsApp has helped dodge the ban to an extent, several traders TOI spoke to said on Tuesday. “There are dealers who are accepting orders on WhatsApp. If the order seems genuine, the retailers are asked to pay 25% of the amount as advance. The stock is carefully concealed and brought to NCR in trucks. It is either delivered at the doorstep of the customer or at a place of their choice,” a dealer said. Where stalls are selling crackers, they are off mostly the main thoroughfare. For instance, those set up in Nevada, Nithari and Chauda in Noida have winding dirt roads leading to them. Similarly, stalls in Loni and Muradnagar are also in rural settings. However, some sold crackers openly on internal roads of some residential sectors in Noida as well as Atta market. A trader said despite the crackdown because of air pollution, there’s demand for crackers in NCR. “Ban or no ban, there will always be a section of people who will burst crackers,” said a seller in Ghaziabad.  R K Singh, the Ghaziabad DM, said even green crackers couldn’t be allowed in Ghaziabad because AQI was in the ‘very poor’ range.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sent-home-or-hidden-in-stalls-crackers-dodge-ban-in-ncr/articleshow/87496793.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Kochi||Demand to remove PM Narendra Modi’s pic a dangerous proposal: Kerala HC||KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday said the demand for removing prime minister Narendra Modi’s photo from vaccination certificates is a dangerous proposal. Considering the petition filed by Peter Myaliparambil, Justice N Nagaresh said it is a dangerous proposition and that someone may approach the court tomorrow seeking removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s picture from currency notes as it is their sweat and blood and doesn’t want the national leader’s face on the currencies. What would happen then, the court asked. Advocate Ajit Joy, who represented the petitioner, submitted that the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi was printed on currency notes as per the regulations of Reserve Bank of India whereas the prime minister’s photo was not fixed on vaccination certificates on the basis of any statutory provision. As the central government sought time to file an affidavit informing their stance, the court has posted the case for hearing on November 23. Two classes of citizens: HCMeanwhile, another bench of the high court on Tuesday said the vaccination scheme of the Centre has created two classes of citizens. Justice PV Kunhikrishnan was considering the plea of a man who had taken Covaxin and is now seeking a court directive to avail a third shot of a vaccine approved globally so that he can go to Saudi Arabia for employment. The court said the Centre’s vaccination scheme has resulted in two classes of citizens – those who received Covaxin and those who received Covishield. While the movement of those who received Covaxin is restricted, those who got Covishield can go anywhere, the court remarked. Seeking the Centre’s response on the plea, the court has scheduled a hearing on November 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/demand-to-remove-pms-pic-a-dangerous-proposal-hc/articleshow/87495520.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Prove my underworld links or say sorry, Maharashtra minister challenges Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: A day after BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged that Nawab Malik had links with the underworld, the NCP skill development minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday launched a frontal attack against the former chief minister, saying “no one has guts to point fingers at him”. “I am challenging Fadnavis; he must prove [links with the underworld] or tender an apology,” said Malik. “I have been in public life for more than four decades and a resident of Mumbai for 62 years, but till date no one has cast aspersions on my character. Fadnavis said he will burst crackers after Diwali, I am saying, why wait, do it as early as possible,” he added. Malik said that if he does have links with the underworld, then Fadnavis should have conducted a probe against him when he was CM and made the evidence public. Instead, Malik said, Fadnavis maintained a discreet silence, now suddenly he is making allegations after a photograph of his wife Amruta with an alleged drug peddler, Jaideep Rana, has surfaced. Malik further claimed during the tenure of Fadnavis, lavish parties were organised in a five-star hotel in central Mumbai. “I am told the ticket for each table was worth Rs 15 lakh, while the total party cost was Rs 15 crore. If Fadnavis has the courage, he can find out who were the organisers of these parties. I have specific information that a relative of Fadnavis was found in a leading five-star hotel. I have the CCTV footage; I will release it at the appropriate time,” he said. Reiterating that Narcotics Control Bureau zonal director Sameer Wankhede had secured the central government job on the basis of a forged documents, Malik claimed: “My information is that Wankhede submitted documents to National Scheduled Caste Commission chairman Vijay Sampla, which will be forwarded to the state government. These documents will be verified by the caste scrutiny committee.” Targeting Wankhede on his alleged expensive taste, Malik claimed that it is difficult to believe that a government employee can afford such costly clothes. “I am told his shirt is worth Rs 50,000 and trousers Rs 1 lakh.” Rubbishing Malik’s allegations, Wankhede said: “He has no knowledge, these are just rumours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prove-my-underworld-links-or-say-sorry-malik-challenges-fadnavis/articleshow/87495522.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Dehradun||Public drinking in vehicles a big menace in Doon||Dehradun: For the past 41 years, Sunil Kumar has been running an eatery near Shahanshahi Ashram on the Rajpur road. Known as the ‘Hathi’ chai shop, the place is quite popular with locals and tourists alike. However, for the past few months, Kumar has been grappling with a problem he is unable to deal with -- public consumption of alcohol. “My family has been running this outlet since 1976. I took over in 1980. It has been our privilege to serve tea and snacks to anyone who visits us but an increase in revenue is not worth the hassle of dealing with drunk people, which has become a commonplace, especially over the weekends. If this trend continues, we will lose our regular clientele,” Kumar said. Eateries all along the Old Mussoorie road have been dealing with the same problem. Locals claim that during evening hours, cars are seen parked along roadsides, with people indulging in liquor and sometimes even drugs. “Several two-wheelers are parked in this area at night. Youngsters are often seen consuming alcohol, which is a nuisance. We have also seen fights break out between groups here,” said Nishant Malik, a resident of Jakhan, where queues of people, mainly students, are seen outside a liquor shop. Students from several colleges and universities on the city outskirts also frequent these places. Vehicles are parked every 100-200 metres. “There are several rules to keep students from venturing out. But they somehowmanage to go out. We can’t control them or what they do once they are outside the campus,” said a security guard of an engineering college along the Old Mussoorie road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/public-drinking-in-vehicles-a-big-menace-in-doon/articleshow/87494677.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Goa||Low marigold prices take shine out of Diwali for farmers||Panaji: While there is an air of joy with the upcoming Diwali festivities, for marigold farmers, there is little reason to rejoice. The orange flowers, used extensively during this season, are selling at just Rs 100 per kg this year. While on one hand, local marigold crops have been damaged due to rain, an abundance of flowers coming in from neighbouring states is adding to farmers’ woes. “Last year, owing to pandemic restrictions limiting interstate transport, local farmers were able to monetise on flower crops. However, this year, not only have flowers from other states been imported, but the quantity of flowers has also increased. We are, therefore, not able to quote a profitable price,” said Udaysingh Rane, a farmer from Advoi, Sattari. Rane grew 650 marigold plants this year and harvested 10,000 flowers since Dussehra. “The government must intervene and involve the horticulture corporation to decide upon a fixed price so that we get the rates we deserve,” he said. Marigolds are easy to grow in Goa’s favourable soil conditions and the flowers have a longer shelf life compared to other flowers. Keri-based flower farmer Gurudas Majhik had grown 1,300 marigold plants this year, but almost 50% of them were ruined due to the extended rainfall season. “I have reduced the rates to Rs 60 per kg in an effort to sell the crop. Until last year, I was able to quote Rs 170 per kg,” he said. Besides the regular yellow marigold, this year some farmers also ventured into growing red marigolds that have yielded well. Prakash Paryekar, a farmer from Pali said, “Of the 600 crops that I grew this year, 300 were red marigold crops, all of which survived, while the yellow marigolds got infected with a plant disease.” Meanwhile, retail sellers may net a profit by hiking prices to last minute customers. “We are currently selling the flowers for Rs 130 per kg and Rs 50 per metre. However, at the last moment, prices are likely to go up to Rs 200 on the day of the festival,” a flower vendor from Panaji market said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-marigold-prices-take-shine-out-of-diwali-for-farmers/articleshow/87496311.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Kochi||Anupama S Chandran’s plea: Kerala high court declines urgent interference||KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday declined to urgently interfere with the habeas plea of former SFI leader Anupama S Chandran to locate her baby that was allegedly given for adoption by her parents without her knowledge. A division bench led by Justice K Vinod Chandran pointed out that the matter is pending before the family court at Thiruvananthapuram and asked whether the baby can be said to be under illegal detention in such circumstances. The court also asked whether it should interfere on the plea at this stage. The court has posted the case for a hearing on Wednesday to take a final decision. As per the petition, the baby was born on October 19 last year and her parents had surrendered the baby to Ammathottil run by Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (KSCCW) while she was in isolation due to Covid-19. The baby was reportedly given in adoption out of the state. Anupama’s father PS Jayachandran was a CPM local leader when the alleged incident occurred. Through the petition, Anupama has alleged that her signatures were obtained by her parents on some documents in the name of selling ancestral property around the time of her sister’s marriage. Those documents are suspected to have been misused by her parents to give away her baby for adoption, the petition said. She also alleged that KSCCW failed to comply with the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act regarding the surrender of an abandoned child. She has alleged that KSCCW aided, abetted, and conspired to isolate the baby from her. Despite filing a complaint before police, no action was taken, as per the petition. The station house officer conspired with her parents to hide details of the child from her and prevented all possibilities to find her child, Anupama has alleged. Further, the petition said a police complaint was filed in April this year, but an FIR was lodged only on October 18, after she went public with the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anupamas-plea-high-court-declines-urgent-interference/articleshow/87495550.cms||---

With this, the Congress tally in the state assembly rose to 108, while that of BJP fell by one to 71. Newcomer Preeti Shaktawat defeated Rashtriya Loktantrik Party’s (RLP) Udailal Dangi in Vallabhnagar and ex-MLA Nagraj Meena defeated independent Thawarchand Damor in Dhariawad. The BJP stood at third and fourth positions in Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar, respectively. The BJP candidate in Vallabhnagar, Himmat Jhala, failed to secure even his election deposit. The bypoll victory has brought the ruling Congress closer to winning three Rajya Sabha seats out of the four to be contested in April 2022. Both the winning candidates maintained the lead from round one, and the real contest was for the second and third spot in both the seats. In Vallabhnagar, RLP’s Udailal Dangi and Janta Sena Randhir Singh Bhinder, who contested as an independent candidate, were leading each other till the 20th round. Bhinder finally finished below Dangi by a thin margin of 1,459 votes. Similarly, in Dhariwad, independent candidate Thawarchand, who rebelled from BTP, sealed the defeat of BJP candidate Khet Singh Meena. Meanwhile, Preeti secured more votes than her late husband and former MLA Gajendra Singh Shaktawat. She got 35.9% of the votes while her husband had received 33.28% in 2018 polls, indicating a strong sympathy wave in the assembly. Dangi maintained his vote share compared with 2018. He got 24.82% vote share in 2018 but registered a marginal dip at 24.65% this time. The biggest damage was to Bhinder whose vote share fell from 33.28% in 2018 to 23.94% in 2021. In Dhariawad, the winning candidate, Nagraj, secured a less than 2% rise in his vote share from 37.38% in 2018 to 39.16%. The BJP share fell from 49.65% to 26.08% for the same period, showing the damage caused by Thawarchand who secured 28.66% votes as an independent candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-wins-both-bypoll-seatsin-raj-gives-bjp-a-thrashing/articleshow/87496316.cms||---

The PA had fled with the documents pertaining to the matter after learning about Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) action. ASP (ACB-Jalore) Mahveer Singh Ranawat said that PA Gajendra Kumar fled on Monday evening after the ACB caught SDM Masingaram Jangid. “On Tuesday morning, he had come to Ahore to keep an eye on the activities of the ACB. But based on his mobile location, we tracked him and arrested him with the file,” said Ranawat. He said that Jangid’s PA also demanded money separately from the complainant for final clearance of the file. “When the complainant said that he has already finalised the deal with the SDM, the PA said that he also needed to be paid something separately,” Ranawat. “The SDM had demanded Rs 50,000 as bribe from the complainant’s sister for issuing the orders of land mutation. On negotiation, the SDM left it to the complainant after which the complainant pleaded that his sister was a widow,” said Ranawat. During verification, the SDM called the complainant to his official residence with money on Monday evening after office hours and was caught red-handed while accepting the money. Interestingly, Jangid had been inducted into government service as patwari. It was the first posting of Jangid after promotion as RAS officer in 2019. He had deliberately revoked the mutation case without giving any reason and had been forcing the complainant for money to resolve the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/ras-officer-and-pa-held-for-accepting-rs-40k-bribe-in-jalore/articleshow/87496312.cms||---

Talking to TOI, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Paper Bag Manufacturers Association (TNPBMA) S K Ramasamy said the paper bag manufacturing industry comes under small and medium industries category. More than 200 industries are functioning in Pollachi, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Udumalpet, Chennimalai, Namakkal, Trichy, Madurai and Chennai. “More than 20,000 workers are dependent on this industry and 5,000 merchants are involved in the retail sales across the state,” he said. Ramasamy said they were using ‘craft’ paper as raw material for the bags. It was sold for Rs 35 per kilo in 2017, Rs 40 in 2020 when the GST stood at 12%. “After revision of GST to 18%, now the same paper is sold for Rs 55 per kilo,” he said. The production cost would increase if the price of craft paper increases, he added. Ramasamy said 36X54cm sized cover (100 nos) was sold for Rs 200 when the GST was 12%. “The same cover is now sold for Rs 270 after the GST increased to 18%,” he said. “Our customers refuse to the covers at the new rate even after we explain to them about the GST hike,” he added. The association on Tuesday petitioned finance minister Nirmala Seetharaman seeking GST exemption . “We have also sent a petition to chief minister M K Stalin to take this issue to the Union government,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/exempt-craft-papers-from-gst-centre-told/articleshow/87495539.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As part of a pre-announced agitation, senior BJP leaders Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Anil Bonde protested outside the chief minister (CM)’s official residence in Nagpur. Bawankule said, “Over a thousand farmers had come here under the leadership of Bonde, but the police chased them away. Our farmers are getting treated as if we are under the Mughal or British rule. When Devendra Fadnavis was the state CM, never did any farmer have to wait for financial help in times of need.” MLC Girish Vyas said, “Farmers are going through a tough time but the state government is not giving them financial assistance. The government wants to disconnect power supply to defaulting farmers, who are struggling to make ends meet. For farmers, this will be a black Diwali and it is the state government that is responsible for this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-protests-negligence-over-farmers-issue/articleshow/87495555.cms||---

The antibody cocktail drug has been found effective in prevention of severe symptoms that could lead to hospitalisation and death in Covid-19 patients. The decision came after the Centre told states that it was still reviewing the therapy and is yet to make it a part of the national treatment guidelines. On Tuesday, the Centre’s technical advisory committee for Covid management held a discussion on treatment protocols, where the use of monoclonal antibodies was talked about in detail. “We will wait to get clear directions from the Centre and won’t make any purchase now. We hear the therapy is effective, but its use is largely restricted to the private sector for now,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner of National Health Mission, who attended the meeting. The monoclonal antibodies cost Rs 1.2 lakh a vial, said officials. The state government has made a provision of Rs 300 crore to buy 60,000 doses, which Ramaswami said can be used to place orders as soon as there is a decision at the Centre. The drug is mainly recommended for mild to moderate patients who reach hospitals early. In Maharashtra, since over 70-75% Covid patients fall under the mild to moderate category, the state is worried that the demand could be enormous. The state Covid task force recently told the government the drug is scientifically safe and effective for certain categories. “We recommend it for high-risk people who reach the hospital within 72 hours to five days (of symptoms showing up). It doesn’t have much use later,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the task force. Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, also a member of the task force, said not all mild and moderate patients qualify for it. “It’s suited for unvaccinated people who have comorbidities of age and underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease, among others,” he said. Incidentally, the BMC is prepared to buy 5,000 vials if the third wave comes. Private hospitals in the city are using monoclonal antibodies since May. Among civic-run hospitals, SevenHills in Andheri that got nearly 3,000 doses under CSR has given it to more than 600 patients. Nagvekar said while talking of cost, it must be considered that the drug reduces hospital stay to 4-5 days and cuts use of Remdesivir and steroids. The drug is now given on an OPD basis as well. The drug contains two monoclonal antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab, which are lab-engineered proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight Sars-Cov-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-nod-from-centre-state-puts-off-antibody-cocktail-purchase/articleshow/87495560.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Transport dept drive against commercial vehicles from November 10||JAIPUR: The transport and road safety department will run a campaign from November 10 to 15 against private vehicles which operate from near bus stands in the state for commercial purpose. During this campaign, the focus will be on buses and jeeps used by private operators. District administrations have also been asked to formulate a plan to conduct a check of all the vehicles. According to the order, this campaign is being conducted to prevent road accidents. The number of road accidents in Rajasthan decreased marginally from 2019 to 2020 with more than 22,000 crashes resulting in 10,563 deaths two years back. In 2020, the number of road accidents came down to 19,114 with 9,250 deaths. Road safety experts opined that this was essentially due to lockdown. However, they also claimed that more than 15,000 accidents have already been reported in this year from January to August and the road accidents analysis scheme notified recently by the transport department will help in bringing down this figure, especially on national highways. “We keep coming across videos of buses which are overloaded or where passengers sit on the roof of the vehicles. To prevent this, we have planned a campaign and all vehicles used by private operators for commercial purposed will be checked for violation of rules,” said an official. The percentage of accidents on national highways (NH) in 2019 was 37% out of the total crashes even though they comprise only 4% of the total road length. In 2020 also, the number of road accidents on NH were 5,764 out of the total number. The department has also formed a road safety scheme and the in-depth analysis, after the occurrence of a road accident, it shall be required by the joint inspection team to inspect the site within the next 24 hours to have scientific analysis of causes of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-drive-against-commercial-vehicles-from-nov-10/articleshow/87496318.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Farmers having ‘Black Diwali’ but MVA more concerned about drug peddlers: BJP MLC||Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) party is more concerned about the Aryan Khan case rather than the plight of poor Vidarbha farmers, alleged Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) MLC Girish Vyas on Tuesday. “The MVA government used police force today to crush a peaceful, symbolic agitation of farmers,” he added. BJP Nagpur district and Gramin Kisan Aghadi staged a protest against the MVA government with ‘Black Diwali’ posters in front of the chief minister (CM)’s official residence ‘Ramgiri’ in Civil Lines on Tuesday. Vyas added that a cabinet minister in the MVA government was concerned about Aryan Khan. “This shows they are more concerned about drug peddlers and least bothered about poor farmers. We strongly protest such attitude of the government,” he said. A large number of police personnel were present at the venue where farmers led by former state agriculture minister Anil Bonde were supposed to gherao CM’s house to mark a symbolic Black Diwali for farmers. Their main demand was that the Maharashtra government should stop cutting power supply and restore the lines that they have cut. Also, the farmers should immediately get the compensation promised by the state government, which hasn’t been paid yet. Cops tried to prevent a bullock cart brought by Lawa farmer Dilip Ingle, carrying samples of the failed crops at the andolan site. Vyas argued with the police and asked the farmer to park the bullock cart exactly infront of Ramgiri, so that “the plight of the farmers directly reaches the CM, who has hardly visited this region or enquired about the farmers’ condition.” Later, the cops led by DCP Vinita Sahu and police inspector Choudhari did not allow BJP workers to carry out their andolan and detained all, and as a precautionary measure, cordoned off the entrance of Ramgiri by posting heavy police force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/farmers-having-black-diwali-but-mva-more-concerned-about-drug-peddlers-bjp-mlc/articleshow/87514552.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||E-mobility project: Govt revives JV with HESS||T’puram: Government has revived the collaboration between KSRTC, Kerala Automobiles Ltd (KAL) and Swiss automobile manufacturer HESS AG for its e-mobility project. The project that was originally planned for manufacturing and purchasing 3,000 electric buses from the firm was put on the backburner after the opposition alleged corruption towards the end of the previous LDF government’s tenure. On the basis of the decision to revive the project to form a JV company with HESS, KSRTC and KAL, an official communique was sent to the MDs of KSRTC and KAL by principal secretary (transport) KR Jyothilal on Oct 25 (accessed by TOI), that stated that a meeting will be chaired by the chief minister to review the project’s progress. The minutes of an official meeting convened on Feb 17 last year between government representatives, the then consultants of the e-mobility project PricewaterhouseCoopers and HESS AG had revealed that government was all set to ink an MoU with the Swiss firm then. The meeting was convened by the then chief secretary in which the transport secretary, five representatives of PWC, representatives of HESS and cantonal councillor of Switzerland Susan Von Sury had participated. As per the minutes, an MoU was planned to be signed by the end of April 2020 after following all formalities. After the matter came out, the government came up with a clarification that it had not entered into an agreement with HESS. However, the minutes of the meeting showed that a decision had been taken to sign an MoU with HESS and the signing was only a formality. The government decided to go ahead with purchase of 3,000 e-buses at an estimated cost of Rs 6,000 crore from the Swiss firm ignoring the opinion of the state-level task force on e-mobility it had constituted. As per the minutes of the first meeting of the task force chaired by the then principal adviser to the Union railway minister Ashok Jhunjhunwala on Dec 16, 2017, e-bus efforts of the state would be watched closely by the world as there are actually no real models available for study and adoption. “…e-buses have been deployed mainly in China and the rest of the efforts are tentative pilot programmes. There are no clear-cut deployment models available for study and adoption,” the minutes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/e-mobility-project-govt-revives-jv-with-hess/articleshow/87495577.cms||KP Saikiran

Forest officials recently carried out a land survey in the area and sent eviction notices to encroachers, Rahul Patil, deputy conservator, said. “The shades were constructed by local builders on the land over the last few years. They had even marked the compound wall around some of the sheds. We have removed all illegal structures during the drive,” Patil added. Some forest areas in the Pune range are open. Due to rapid expansion of the city, many people encroach on open areas of the forest department, said officials. “We are taking anti-encroachment drive regularly and removing such structures in surrounding areas of the city,” added Patil. Mahesh Sanas, forest officer, Pune range, said, “The market value of these 17 gunthas of land is in crores.” The forest department has hundreds of acres of land on the outskirts. Maximum of them in 23 villages that have newly merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, said officials. “The PMC had given us funds to fence some pockets of our land in Taljai hill, Kothrud, etc. Now, we will again approach the PMC for funds to secure our land pockets in the 23 villages,” said Patil. However, a section of environmentalists and activists said the department needs to carry out a comprehensive survey of land pockets near these villages and protect them from encroachment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/encroachments-removed-on-mohammadwadi-land/articleshow/87472806.cms||---

In October last year, airlines had carried only around 52 lakh domestic passengers, 70% lower than the month this year. It’s not a just comparison, though, as only Dussehra fell in October last year while Diwali was in November. In October 2019, Dussehra and Diwali were celebrated in the same month and airlines carried about 1.2 crore passengers. This October then, airlines carried only 27% fewer passengers than what they did in October 2019, the last pre-Covid festive month. The domestic passenger traffic growth this October is outstanding, given that in September, airlines transported about 69 lakh fliers. In August, the number was 65 lakh. An airline official, requesting anonymity, said: “Indian domestic passenger traffic is likely to cross the 1 crore passenger per month mark by the year-end. We expect December to bring higher passenger volumes as revenge travel will pick up in the last week.” The negative aspect of the October growth was that it was “sinusoid” with weekend peaks and weekday troughs. Passenger traffic peaked from Friday through Sunday and then commenced a dip, falling deepest on Tuesdays. “For November weekends, we don’t expect similar peaks though. So it remains to be seen whether November numbers will beat October passenger traffic number,” the airline source added. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has approved over 22,000 flights for the airline winter schedule, which runs from October 31, 2021 to March 26, 2022. The 2019 winter schedule had about 23,000 flights. Last month, the government allowed airlines to operate to their full pre-Covid capacity on the domestic sector. “We expect the passenger loads to drop in November as compared to October,” the airline source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mumbai-outstanding-oct-for-domestic-airlines-as-88l-fly-for-dussehra-and-diwali/articleshow/87495570.cms||---

The boy’s family has been unwilling to record his statements under Section 164 of the CrPC and has told the police that the minor was emotionally and mentally down and could record his statements only after a couple of days. The Bharatpur police had put up a notice at the locked house of the minor boy to be present for recording his statement.  “We have informed the police that my son is emotionally and mentally down and is presently unwell. We have sought three days' time to get our statements recorded,” the boy’s mother said. Meanwhile, the police went to the house of suspended district judge Singh for interrogation. SP Bishnoi said a detailed report on the matter had been sent to the high court and the arrest, if it occurs, would be completed as per the guidelines. The mother of the boy has also written to the investigating officer stating that after lodging the FIR, the boy was intimidated and was going through mental and emotional breakdown. “We have taken the boy to a safer place.

On the occasion of Dhanteras on Tuesday, people were seen thronging Walled City and other markets to buy crackers. Traders said since afternoon, they witnessed a steady footfall of customers and hoped that the sale of firecrackers would gain momentum from Wednesday. Several shopkeepers were seen selling firecrackers manufactured in 2020. The government had given conditional permission on sale of firecrackers with a specific indication to sell only green firecrackers having sound less than 100 decibels. “Green firecrackers have a limited number of varieties. For items like atom bomb, Ganga Jamuna and many others, you have to get Sivakasi manufactured items which are not tagged as green crackers. We are just catering to the need of customers,” said a wholesale dealer of firecrackers at Walled City market. Also, customers were not very keen to purchase green firecrackers. “When I was a kid, bursting of firecrackers used to start a week prior to Diwali. Now it is just a one-day affair. So, I have got firecrackers having lights and sound both,” said Nikhilesh Agarwal, who was seen selecting crackers at a wholesale shop at Kishanpole Bazaar. Mustafa Saeed, a wholesale dealer of firecrackers at Hawa Mahal market, said a sudden rise in the number of customers was seen on Tuesday. “If we have to compare it with previous years, the interest in bursting firecrackers has certainly gone down. However, we have started witnessing good number of customers on Tuesday. Hopefully the sale will further gain momentum on Wednesday,” Saeed added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-throng-city-markets-to-buy-crackers-bizmen-upbeat/articleshow/87496323.cms||---

These vans will help people to test food items on the spot and for collecting samples from remote areas. The vans will be deployed at four different divisions — Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Ajmer. The state already has five such mobile food testing labs, which were provided by Food Safety and Standard Authority of India in 2019-20. They are deployed in Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Bharatpur and Bikaner. Since Kota and Ajmer did not have any mobile food labs, the state government has decided to deploy new mobile labs there. Though Jaipur and Jodhpur divisions already have one mobile food lab each, the health department has deployed one each mobile lab in the two divisions because of extra workload. The estimated cost of each mobile food lab is Rs 41 lakh. “The mobile food labs will provide on spot report of tests of the items purchased by customers and sold by the trader,” said Sharma. The mobile food lab is equipped with milk analyser, digital refractometer, digital multimeter, autoclave machine, rapid pathogen detection kit, diagnostic reader and frying oil monitor. These machines will help getting test the quality of milk, mawa, ghee, paneer, spices and other such products spot analysis will be done. Sharma said any customer can get the test done of food products by paying a reasonable fee. The report will be made available within 25 to 30 minutes. If the product is found to be of unsafe, misbrand or substandard, quality action is taken under food safety and standard Act. Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director (rural health), said now the state has 20 food labs including nine mobile ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-more-mobile-food-testing-labs-launched/articleshow/87496320.cms||---

---||India||Bypoll results may trigger changes in Himachal, Rajasthan BJP units||NEW DELHI: A few months ahead of the assembly polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, BJP on Tuesday had a mixed bag of results in the bypolls, with severe setbacks in Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, triggering talk of changes in the organisation and leadership of the two states. Defeats in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan cast a shadow on party’s clean sweep of byelections in Assam and the northeast, an odd-defying victory in Telangana, successes in Bihar and MP and a better-than expected performance in alliance with Dushyant Chautala in Ellenabad in Haryana where it has been relentlessly targeted by protesting farmers. Read AlsoBypoll battle: TMC sweeps Bengal, BJP+ Assam, Congress HimachalA clean sweep of five seats in Assam and a string of setbacks in Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, where it cumulatively failed to retain six constituencies, on Tuesday marked a bittersweet judgment day for BJP in byelections to 30 assembly and three Lok Sabha vacancies. While BJPRajya Sabha MP and BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said the bypoll results indicate his party’s expansion across the country as it has consolidated its presence in north east and has also won in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. “Party’s mass base under the leadership of prime minister Narendra Modi is expanding steadily… We have won in Assam, other north east states, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Telengana and Bihar,” Baluni said and added that almost half of the seats, where by polls were held, had been won by the party. He, however, said the party's performance in states like West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have not been as per expectations, which will be reviewed by the party leadership. The BJP not only lost the two bypolls in Rajasthan, its candidates stood third and fourth in the Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar segments. The embarrassment contrasted starkly with party's smart performance in the panchayat polls and civil polls and instantly trained the spotlight on former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's differences with her factional rivals like state unit chief Satish Punia, as well as central leadership's reluctance to settle the issue one way or the other. Vasundhara Raje has been inactive since her defeat in the assembly polls. Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur was under adverse spotlight after the party lost the by-poll for Mandi Lok Sabha and the three assembly seats. In the by-poll for Mandi Lok Sabha seat , which fell vacant after the death of BJP's Ramswaroop Sharma, party's candidate, Kargil hero Kushal Thakur lost narrowly to Congress's Pratibha Singh, wife of the former CM Virbhandra Singh who died in July. During the run up the party had appeared apprehensive because of the respect that the late CM enjoyed across the spectrum. However, the party also lost the Jubbal -Kotakhai assembly seat to Congress which also held on to Fatehpur and Arki. The result can revive demand for the replacement of Thakur who was entrusted with the reins because of the shock defeat of the CM candidate, Prem Kumar Dhumal. Thakur, according to reports, blamed the setback on price rise. However, this may not save him from coming under intense scrutiny because Dhumal loyalists were, in any case, arrayed against him and because the national party chief J P Nadda also belongs to Himachal Pradesh. The party, however, drew comfort from its victory in Telangana where its candidate, Eatala Rajender, a popular finance minister who crossed over from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti, prevailed in a contest which had seen the Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao pulling out all stops. Coming after its strong performance in the Hyderabad civic polls, the victory will strongly help consolidate BJP as the main opponent, much to Congress's detriment. Party scored off Congress also in Madhya Pradesh where it retained the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat and wrested Joba from its chief opponent. The victory comes as a respite for Shivraj Singh Chauhan who is having to deal with dissidence. In Haryana's Ellenabad, it should be pleased with the performance of its ally deputy CM Dushyant Singh Chautala's JJP who squared off against his estranged uncle Abhay Chautala and grandfather Om Prakash Chautala. Although Abhay Chautala regained the seat, the only one he had won in the assembly polls , he had quit to express solidarity with farm protests, his margin dipped significantly. Congress finished third. BJP's ally JDU's success in the two by-elections in Bihar came against arch rival Lalu Prasad who had personally campaigned. The challenge helped consolidate NDA ranks and the result will insulate the NDA coalition against an aggressive RJD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bypoll-results-may-trigger-changes-in-himachal-pradesh-and-rajasthan-bjp/articleshow/87497334.cms||Akhilesh Singh

We have requested the forensic authorities at the Sassoon General Hospital to give us an opinion on the death of Shalini Baban Sonawane (70). Viscera has been preserved for further chemical analysis,” said inspector Pramod Waghmare of the Sinhagad road police station. “The woman had sustained a head injury. As of now, there is no headway in the case. We are still collecting more information from the local residents and others known to her. Sonawane has made a will of her property and divided it among her children,” he said. Sonawane was found murdered in the living room of her 1BHK flat around 10pm on Saturday. The police said the assailant(s) had used a heavy and blunt object to bludgeon the elderly woman. Her son, Virat (39), who stays in an adjoining building, was first to notice her lying injured and motionless when he visited her flat around 10pm on Saturday. Virat, a technician with a city hospital, called the police control room and later lodged a complaint. Waghmare said, “Right now, our focus is on the theft. We are probing why the suspects did not steal the ornaments she was wearing. Also, there was some cash in the house that was untouched.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-yet-to-find-any-clue-in-murder-of-senior-citizen/articleshow/87472817.cms||---

He said special drones would be used to keep an eye on market roads. Drones will be connected with the city police’s control room to receive real-time video access. Besides drones, cops on horses, also known as the mounted units, will keep a guard over narrow alleys all through the night. Talking to TOI, Zaidi said a team of senior police officials have been deployed in Walled City markets to deal with encroachments that often cause traffic congestions. “Interceptor vehicles and traffic surveillance teams (TSTs) have been deployed across all major areas of the city to facilitate safe and seamless movement of vehicular traffic,” Zaidi said, adding that city commandos units of Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) will be posted at important places to avert any armed threat. He added that two armed cops from each police station of Jaipur will be on patrolling all through the festival season. “Additional deployment has been already been moved to help local police,” Zaidi said. About 500 reserved police personnel have been moved to aide Jaipur police for Diwali law and order tasks. Of these 500, 250 cops will be sent for traffic duties. “We have also posted our cops at high-rise buildings to keep a close vigil from above. Fixed pickets are being set up across the city to help citizens,” Zaidi said. Jaipur police have also directed all SHOs to ensure that beat patrolling is undertaken more stringently ahead of Diwali. Zaidi said that all police units are being briefed regularly about the security protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/500-extra-policemen-drones-to-monitor-city-roads-on-diwali/articleshow/87496333.cms||---

Around 1.4kg gold was seized from senior AI cabin crew member Amod Samant during security check at the airport. The gold was found concealed in his bag as bangles covered with insulation tape and CISF personnel picked it up during an x-ray scan. The gold and the accused were handed over to Customs. During interrogation, it was found that Samant arrived at Cial on Saturday as flight attendant on AI’s London-Kochi flight. He stayed at a hotel in Palarivattom and was scheduled to fly to Mumbai on Sunday when he was intercepted. Though Samant told customs that the gold was handed over to him by someone in Kochi, the agency suspects it was smuggled from the UK. If so, somebody inside the airport helped him to get the gold out. On Sunday, Customs had seized 5.064kg of gold from seven passengers, including Samant. Sources said the seized gold was worth Rs 2 crore. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-to-further-probe-ai-staffs-smuggling-bid/articleshow/87495609.cms||---

The minister had called the meeting with Sikh farmers to address problems related to paddy procurement and also to settle the October 3 violence case in which his son, Ashish, is the main accused in the killing of four farmers and a journalist during a farmers’ protest that day. Ashish is in jail and the case is being investigated by a special investigation team (SIT). Sources said Mishra had informed the farmers on Monday about the meeting. On Tuesday morning, leaders of the Sikh community held an emergency meeting at a gurdwara and asked farmers of the area to skip the meeting. “We have unanimously decided not to go to his house for the meeting. We have nothing to do with him. He may try to lure our farmers by offering a higher price for their paddy, but he should remember that he cannot compensate for the lives lost in the October 3 incident. If any member of the Sikh community keeps any relationship with Mishra or his family the entire Sikh Samaj will boycott that person,” said Jasbir Singh Virk, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangthan. TOI tried to contact Mishtra over phone for his reaction but his number was not reachable. Gurpej Singh, a Sikh farmer whose nephew, Lovepreet, was mowed down by a vehicle belonging to the Union minister, said, “The minister had sent an invitation through their men for a meeting to settle the case and arrive at a compromise. They also offered support in crop procurement.” Another farmer, who did not wish to be named, said, “No action has been taken against him yet. We did not attend the meeting called by him after a call by leaders of the Sikh community." Asked if such meetings are allowed while investigation in the case is pending, a senior SIT member told TOI, “Our work is to investigate the case. We have provided security to all the witnesses. If anyone faces any threat or any pressure is being put on him/her, then he/she may give a complaint in writing to us or to the local police. Appropriate action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-farmers-refuse-to-attend-meet-called-by-union-minister-mishra/articleshow/87494751.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

They are adamant they won’t celebrate the festival of lights without the chief minister as they light diyas in his name. CM Yogi has been celebrating Diwali with Vantangias as Gorakhpur MP and head of Gorakshpeeth. While the villagers are decorating the village to welcome CM Yogi, the administration is also making preparations for theChief Minister’s visit. “We are like Ahalya waiting for our Lord Ram. All credit for our celebrating Diwali goes to Maharaj ji (CM Yogi),” said 70-year-old villager Chhotku. Another villager Ram Gulab, said, “As soon as Maharaj ji became CM, he gave revenue village status to our village. The development is not limited to Tinkonia number 3 but the change can be seen in 23 Vantangia villages in Gorakhpur and Maharajganj.” “We now have houses, roads, power supply, water, school, streetlights, Anganwadi centre and RO water machine and all this has happened in the last 4.5 years. Our 380 families got Antyodaya cards, 423 families got houses and there are 458 toilets in the village. 600 people got MNREGS job cards. We are getting benefits of various schemes,” he added. Educationist and social worker Ashok Srivastav said, “Vantangia people are the naked truth of years of suppression and exploitation in east UP from Gorakhpur-Kushinagar to Lakhimpur Kheri. Around 100 years before independence, the British started using these people for cleaning and developing forests and called them Tangya farmers, who later came to be known as Vantangias. Due to neglect of previous governments, Vantangias remained homeless, jobless and deprived of all basic amenities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vantangiyas-light-diyas-in-yogis-name-on-diwali/articleshow/87496344.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Use vans, offer flexi timing, 6 vax laggard Maharashtra districts told||MUMBAI: Six districts pulled up by the Centre for low coverage of the first dose of Covid vaccine have been asked by the state government to offer flexible timings, use mobile vaccination vans and carry out intensive awareness campaigns two days before special drives are to be carried out. The Centre identified 48 districts in the country that have not vaccinated even 50% of their adult population with a single shot. Six districts with the poor coverage from Maharashtra were Aurangabad (46.5%), Nandurbar (46.9%), Buldhana (47.6%), Hingoli (47.8%), Nanded (48.4%) and Akola (49.3%). As per state figures, though, these districts have crossed 50% coverage but remain under 55%. The national average for single dose vaccination is 78% while the state average is 74%. PM Narendra Modi is set to hold a review meeting with officials from these six districts on Wednesday. State officials held several pow-wows. “We have decided on some strategies to increase the coverage in these districts depending on local factors and situations. We have been persuading them to increase coverage even before the Centre pointed out their performances,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner National Health Mission. Ramaswami said the districts have been primarily told to offer flexible timings, either early in the morning or late in the evening. In many of these places, the harvesting season is on and people are on the fields for a long time. The reasons differed from one district to another, he explained. “Aurangabad, for instance, was hit by incessant rain for months. Aurangabad, Buldhana and Akola also have a sizeable Muslim population that is reluctant to get vaccinated. Efforts are being made here to rope in religious and political leaders,” he said. In Nandurbar, which has the lowest coverage in the state, the geographical conditions combined with lack of awareness among the predominant tribal population has been the primary challenge. Local activists said the state needs to adopt a more aggressive approach to reach the remotest parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-use-vans-offer-flexi-timing-6-vax-laggard-districts-told/articleshow/87495601.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Cyber expert Mukesh Choudhary advised people not to click on links embedded in promotional messages, often sent through bulk SMS and WhatsApp. “Scammers often reap a windfall during the festive season by setting up dummy shopping portals. People should be very careful of suspicious websites that mimic original shopping portals,” he said. Choudhary said that people who have no prior experience in online shopping should rely on cash-on-delivery options instead of giving credit or debit card credentials. “When you are paying online, please make sure that the shopping portals have a correct name. If there is any spelling error, it is likely to be a dummy portal,” Choudhary said. A senior police official told TOI that scammers have been using emails and messages to launch phishing attacks, especially during the festive season. “A lot of people shop online during the festive season. Therefore, it is very important to ascertain that you are shopping from a genuine website,” the official said. The police and cyber experts said that people should ignore any unverified message or email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyber-experts-cops-warn-of-online-scams-during-festival-of-lights/articleshow/87496345.cms||---

These buses were part of the central government granted 237 buses under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Of these, five buses had already been discarded following accidental fire incidents. Currently, the NMC has a fleet of over 433 vehicles comprising 232 standard, 150 midi, 45 mini and six electric buses, which were procured from the funds allocated by the state government to operate women-only ferries. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B is expected to take a decision on DIMTS proposal in the steering committee meeting to be held on November 9. Sources, however, slammed the DIMTS for bypassing the official procedure by directly submitting the proposal to the additional commissioner Deepak Meena. “Any proposal pertaining to any policy decision related to city bus operations needs to be tabled before the transport committee. No such proposal was tabled before the panel,” said transport committee chairman Jitendra Kukde. The official also revealed that the 54 standard buses proposed to be discarded are operational and pointed out that the NMC has already converted 70 diesel-run standard buses into CNG. Besides, the conversion of the remaining 162 buses into CNG is on the cards. The senior official said that already life of 70 CNG-run standard buses has increased by five years. The scrapping of 54 buses will reduce the Aapli Bus fleet strength and this might affect smooth operations of the city bus service on many routes. Kukde said: “For discarding 54 buses, the NMC will have to replace them with either electric or any other eco-friendly vehicles.” The cost of an electric bus is approximately Rs1.50 crore and for replacing 54 buses, the civic body will require around Rs70 crore. With the current financial situation, it will be very difficult for the NMC to arrange funds for this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-scrap-54-aapli-buses/articleshow/87495606.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Cotton rates at an all-time high but no bonus for Vid’s farmers||Nagpur: Anup Chavan at Bod Bodhan village of Yavatmal has grown cotton in 25 acres this season. With prices for raw cotton touching an all-time high of over Rs 8,000 a quintal, Chavan says he would just be able to break-even. Bod Bodhan was also infamous for suicides. Along with other farmers he is planning a protest against delay in payment of state government compensation for losses due to rains. The trend has also left traders puzzled. A high demand of yarn due to a pent up demand for garments is being quoted as the reason for high cotton prices. Traders also point out at speculation in the international market as a reason, fearing a correction. Amid the frenzy, farmers in Vidarbha say the record high hardly brings a bonanza for them. Extended rains have brought down the yield. So, if international factors have pushed rates for cotton, the main crop of the region, it may only save farmers from another crisis, say sources. Chavan says he expects to yield not more than 3 quintals an acre from his 25-acre farm. At Rs 8,000 a quintal, he stands to get Rs 24,000 from each acre, just enough to cover the expenses. Last year he yield 10 quintals from an acre. Selling at Rs 5,800/quintal got him Rs 58,000. “The soyabean yield is higher but the rates are moderate,” he says. Chavan says he hopes to harvest around 10 quintals of soyabean from 15 acres. The rates are at Rs 3,500 a quintal, he said. He is waiting for prices to improve and hold on to the stock. However, the net results from both cotton and soyabean are not very encouraging, he says. Ganesh Nanote of Nimbarna village in Akola said his yield has come down to 6 quintals as against 10 last year. The high rates will only get him a couple of thousand more. Soyabean is better this year and he hopes that his net earnings from the crop may be higher by Rs 5,000 an acre. However, the final tally comes out to be same as 2020, he says. Arun Sekshasria of M/s DD Cotton, an export firm, said the increase in cotton prices has been purely fueled by speculation. There is not much export demand for the commodity. Vinay Kotak, director of Kotak Ginning and Pressing at Mumbai, said the rally is due to a mix of speculation and fundamental. There are reports of pent up demand after Covid. There is also an increased fund-based buying in the exchanges. A demand resistance has been created due to high prices and a correction appears to be imminent Veteran farm activist Vijay Jawandhia said rates of cotton bales in India are almost at part with the international level. This rules out any competitive advantage for exports. Back in Yavatmal, Sahebrao Pawar says the cotton yield is too less to last very long. Even the cost of cotton plucking has gone up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cotton-rates-at-an-all-time-high-but-no-bonus-for-vids-farmers/articleshow/87495612.cms||Shishir Arya

Despite conferring an official tag, no focused conservation initiatives were initiated and the butterfly is threatened by the rapid decline of its sole larval host plant Mullilam (Zanthoxylum rhetsa). Now, conservationists in Malabar have started a campaign for mass planting of the thorny host tree of Buddha Mayuri by collecting its seedlings from wherever it is available for distribution. Kannur-based Malabar Awareness and Rescue Centre for Wildlife (MARC) started a campaign on Nov 1 (Kerala Piravi Day) to observe the entire month as Mullilam Conservation Month to save the state’s official butterfly. “Mullilam trees, which used to be common in Malabar, were felled indiscriminately from private lands and house compounds as people felt that the tree was of no use commercially. But, the tree is the lone larval host tree of Buddha Mayuri butterflies that lay eggs on the leaves in trees’ upper branches and the larvae feed on the leaves. The destruction of Mullilam trees could lead to a dip in this butterfly’s population and there is a need for mass planting of this tree,” said butterfly expert VC Balakrishnan. He said that a group of conservationists are also working towards a butterfly corridor across Kerala by having a string of butterfly groves where six larval host plants of 13 butterflies are planted and raised along the Western Ghats. Conservationist associated with MARC, Mahesh Das said people were felling Mullilam trees unaware that its destruction could endanger the state’s official butterfly. “Mullilam trees are fast disappearing from home compounds as people don't see any purpose in growing them and because they are thorny. If the trend continues it could seriously impact the population of this butterfly which depends on the tree as a larval host. The seedlings of the tree are hard to find; but within two days of our campaign we have been getting calls from people who offered seedlings and promised that they would conserve the trees. We got 35 seedlings,” he said, adding that they were planning to provide Mullilam trees to all schools in Kannur and surrounding areas initially. Wildlife biologist and secretary of MARC Roshnath Ramesh said that while butterfly surveys are generally focused on the number of species, they should be monitoring butterfly abundance to understand population trends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/campaign-afoot-to-save-states-official-butterfly/articleshow/87495621.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congress created history in bypolls, says CM Ashok Gehlot||Jaipur: The assembly bypoll results that saw Congress win both the seats in Rajasthan on Tuesday are bound to affect the prospects of top state leaders in Congress as well as BJP. The Congress recorded an impressive victory even as former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot stayed away from ‘active’ campaigning, while the BJP paid a price for leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria’s ‘obstinacy’ and communication gap in its state and central leadership in the selection of party candidates. Dhariawad was a BJP seat since 2013 but the Congress captured it, while retaining Vallabhnagar, on Tuesday. BJP finished third in Dhariawad and fourth in Vallabhnagar. The results would bolster chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s claim that there is no anti-incumbency against his government in Rajasthan and that the ruling Congress stands chances of retaining power in the state elections two years later.  Of the eight assembly bypolls held in the past three years, the Congress has won six, while BJP and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) have won one each. During the previous BJP government rule (2013-18) also, eight bypolls were held, of which Congress won six despite being in the opposition, which indicated an anti-incumbency then. In the panchayat polls, held in Alwar and Dholpur just before the present bypolls, Congress comfortably defeated BJP. “This has happened for the first time in Rajasthan’s history,” Gehlot tweeted commenting on the Congress victory in 12 of the 16 bypolls since 2014, on Tuesday. In the latest bypolls held at Dhariawad in Pratapgarh district and Vallabhnagar in Udaipur district, chief minister Gehlot campaigned aggressively by holding four election rallies in the two constituencies, besides addressing two nomination rallies. Pilot attended just the nomination rallies. “I was constantly in touch with our party leaders and workers campaigning in both the constituencies. It was the collective force that has yielded the emphatic victory for the Congress,” Pilot told TOI. Vallabhnagar winner Preeti Shaktawat is widow of ex-MLA Gajendra Singh Shaktawat, who was a staunch Pilot loyalist and participated in the rebellion against Gehlot last year. To ensure Congress victory, Gehlot stationed his confidant and former employees’ union leader Dharmendra Rathore in the two adjoining constituencies for ground-level election management and kept taking feedbacks on day-to-day basis. For the Scheduled Tribe dominated Dhariawad, Arjun Singh Bamaniya was made minister in-charge for the polls, while for Rajput dominated Vallabhnagar, fiery orator Pratap Singh Khachariyawas was sent to campaign. The BJP, on the other hand, appeared divided right from the selection of its candidates. Leader of opposition Kataria doggedly opposed the entry of Vallabhnagar’s ex-MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder back into the party despite the latter consistently garnering more votes than BJP in the past three elections. Bhinder was supported by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, while Kataria insisted on fielding Udailal Dangi. Kataria opposed even Bhinder’s wife, who was in BJP, for the nomination. In its eagerness to displease neither Raje nor Kataria, BJP picked up a new face, who ultimately finished fourth in Vallabhnagar. Bhinder, meanwhile, continued to prove his stronghold as he trailed behind the combined force of Dangi supporters in BJP and RLP by around 1300 votes only. Dangi has now lost two successive polls, while Bhinder won the seat twice in the past—once for BJP in 2003 (the only time the saffron party won it since 1952). In Dhariawad too, the BJP faltered by denying nomination to late MLA Guatam Lal Meena’s son Kanhaiya Lal despite a sympathy wave in his favour. On not getting the party ticket, Kanhaiya initially rebelled. Gehlot’s masterstroke of visiting Meena’s bereaved family during the campaign widened the gap between Kanhaiya’s supporters and BJP, which ultimately finished third after an independent here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-created-history-in-bypolls-cm/articleshow/87496352.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

The melee in the markets and long traffic queues hardly gave any hints of any pandemic, if one were to overlook masks on faces. Kailash Mittal, president of Jaipur Sarafa Traders Committee, said people were willing to spend a little more on things which were not necessary. “This shows that people are feeling good about the situation and the impact of pandemic on human psyche is almost non-existent now.” Mittal said Dhanteras buying will be 10% more than what was witnessed in 2019, before Covid hit the world. After the government offered a slew of reliefs for conversion land obtaining patas, the real estate market has also seen an increase in deals. Rajendra Singh Pachar, secretary of Credai-Rajasthan, said, “The recent policies of the government have contributed to the positive outlook in the real estate sector. There is an increase in the demand for plots and houses. Secondly, people were a little apprehensive about a third wave. Since the chances of the resurgence of the virus are receding, people are taking investment decisions and real estate has benefitted majorly.” Automobile dealers said that the demand has outstripped supply. Aditya Kasliwal, a leading automobile dealer in the city said, “The waiting period for various brands has increased from six weeks to three months. It has been a good Diwali for the auto sector except for the fact that the supply constraints have dragged down the growth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhanteras-brings-back-glitter-traders-witness-brisk-business/articleshow/87496358.cms||---

He said Delhi Police and SDMs have been instructed to observe a 24-hour vigil to prevent pollution caused by firecrackers, with special attention to the border area of Delhi. He added that so far, 12,957 kg of crackers have been seized by police and 32 people have been booked under the anti-cracker campaign. Rai said, “Delhi Police and SDM have been directed to be vigilant 24x7 to check the pollution caused by firecrackers, by stopping their purchase, sale and burning. A special vigilance campaign would be run in the border area of the city so that there is no illegal purchase, sale, movement, and storage of firecrackers anywhere. In this context, instructions have been issued to Delhi Police and SDM on behalf of DPCC on Tuesday.” Delhi government started the ‘Patakhe Nahi, Diye Jalao’ campaign on October 27 and appealed to people to celebrate the festival with earthen lamps. “If there is news of buying, selling and burning of firecrackers anywhere within the whole of Delhi, Delhi Police can be informed by calling 112 number. SDMs are also a part of this drive,” said Rai. The minister appealed to the people of Delhi to celebrate Diwali by lighting diyas. “Diwali is celebrated with diyas and pollution is spread by firecrackers. We have to celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm, but with the same responsibility we have to stop pollution. This pollution can be stopped only when all Delhiites will contribute towards saving the environment by becoming a pollution warrior,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/24x7-vigil-to-check-pollution-by-crackers-rai/articleshow/87496822.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya spectacle for Ram’s homecoming||LUCKNOW: Amid the glitter of 9 lakh diyas on the last Deepotsav in Ayodhya before the UP assembly elections due early next year, the temple town is likely to set the political discourse on the festival of lights. The address of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Deepotsav on Wednesday is likely to revolve around Hindutva and politics. A laser show was organised on the banks of Saryu on TuesdayA lot has already been said about Lord Ram and ‘Ram Bhakts’ (devotees of Ram) in the recent past. Most of the political parties have either kicked off their poll campaign from Ayodhya or have been talking about the deity and the temple town. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra had kickstarted the series of ‘prabuddh sammelans’, focusing on Brahmins, from Ayodhya. Invoking the deity, he had said that Ram is not the copyright of the BJP and he belonged to everyone. Similarly, Aam Admi Party (AAP) leaders have also been to Ayodhya on several occasions. After AAP’s Sanjay Singh, Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal had recently visited Ayodhya and attended the ‘aarti’ at Saryu Ghat. Politics notwithstanding, Deepotsav will hog limelight otherwise too because of the sheer number of diyas that would be lit on Wednesday. Around 9 lakh diyas will be lit this time breaking the last year’s record of 6 lakh earthen lamps. Officials in Ayodhya said a team from the Guinness Book of World Records has already reached the temple town. As many as 12,000 volunteers have been pressed into service to light diyas. Each volunteer has been assigned the task of lighting 75 diyas. The temple town became the hub of activities after the Supreme Court paved way for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. On August 5, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the construction of Ram temple at the spot which remained a disputed site for over five centuries. The BJP, which had been promising the construction of a grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya in all its manifestos, has been claiming it to be a big victory. However, months before the UP polls, opposition parties are finding it difficult to stay away from Hindutva agenda. During his recent visit to Lucknow, Union home minister Amit Shah had strongly propped up the Hindutva agenda by claiming that the BJP ended the centuries’ old dispute around Ram temple in Ayodhya and Yogi Adityanath would carry forward the party’s agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amid-sparkle-yogi-may-set-tone-for-polls/articleshow/87496354.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Delhi||Delhi: HKV tomb complex on path to repair amid Covid-19 challenges||NEW DELHI: Work on the restoration of Bagh-e-Alam ka Gumbad, a Lodhi-era monument in the heart of Deer Park in Hauz Khas Village, began in 2017. But it was stalled for various reasons, among them the Covid-19 pandemic. A visit to the monument recently showed some labourers working on the tomb walls. The dome is in disrepair and work on that has yet to begin, but the restorers seemed confident of finishing the project in three months. Getting the restoration of the tomb complex under way wasn’t easy due to jurisdiction issues. As Archaeological Survey of India conservationist Misbah Noorie explained, “The work began in September. And while we have no shortage of workers for the project, we faced the challenge of Bagh-e-Alam being an ASI site that sits on Delhi Development Authority land. There were difficulties in getting some permissions, for instance for trucks to carry repair materials into Deer Park.” According to the conservationists, two portions of the structure — the dome and the walls of a mosque abutting the monument — will take the most care. The structure built with grey stone ashlars follows the pattern of square Lodhi tombs. Its facades present a semblance of being three-storey tall. It has a beautifully carved finial made of red sandstone and marble but it is visible only from a certain distance or from the roof of the monument. Historian and author Swapna Liddle said, “The dome and finial at Bagh-e-Alam have often got damaged by vegetation growing there. I am so glad ASI is finally going to restore the monument’s magnificent dome.” While ASI claimed the restoration would be completed in around three months, there still appeared to be a lot of work remaining when TOI visited the site. There were only a few labourers around and the supervisor shrugged his shoulders and mumbled something about ‘shortage of workers’. An ASI restorer, however, was optimistic. “There are a few tasks we will have to be extremely careful about,” the conservator said. “When repairing the gumbad, its inner circles carrying paintings from the Lodhi era will have to be protected, but we have a plan ready. On the outer walls, pigeons have made nests and we have to clean and level them.” The grilles of the gateway are also to be repaired. The six arched windows, which add to the geometric appeal of the monument, have to be looked at too. There is an inscription on the tomb that says it is the resting place of Shaikh Shihab-ud-din Taj Khan and was built in 1501-02. “The name Bagh-e-Alam ka Gumbad is evidently a later one,” said a historian. “With time, people forgot the real history of the tomb and begun to use the popular name that was actually related to the garden surrounding the tomb.” Bagh-e-Alam ka Gumbad is a monument that is under ASI’s protection. It has stood at Hauz Khas since the reign of Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517), though the original roof of the mosque that also provided cover to the three tombs has long collapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hkv-tomb-complex-on-path-to-repair-amid-covid-19-challenges/articleshow/87516615.cms||Zumbish
---||Lucknow||‘Hotels, better connectivity will propel Ayodhya tourism’||Lucknow: The construction of the Ram Temple has generated immense interest in the ancient city of Ayodhya but it may take a few years before it joins the league of heritage and spiritual destinations like Varanasi, Prayagraj and Mathura. Tour operators visiting the city at the behest of the state government ahead of the Deepotsav have pointed out that the development of hotels, better connectivity, regulated temple visits and sanitation are crucial in propelling Ayodhya as a city of repute on the tourism map. On Tuesday, a team of 40 tour operators and travel bloggers visited Hanumangarhi, Ramjanmabhoomi, Kanak Bhawan and Saryu Ghat to get a sense of what Ayodhya has to offer to tourists. The state government has elaborate plans of developing the city as a major tourist attraction. “We have already been promoting the sector among tourists for a while now. Till now it was a city for pilgrims and devotees but now tourists also want to visit. However, it is important to retain the old world charm of the city. Old structures should not be demolished to modernise the city. People don’t want to just visit the temple but also experience the old world charm, the local culture, its people,” said Ravi Gosain, the vice-president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. RK Arora of Sona Travels in Delhi said that several more hotels were needed in the area, since people had to otherwise stay in Lucknow and travel 2.5 hours to visit Ayodhya. Proposing that Ayodhya should be made into a two-night destination, Arora said that a sector incorporating Lucknow, Ayodhya, Varanasi and Prayagraj should be developed, especially as Varanasi and Prayagraj are also linked to Khajuraho. Relating how a lot of queries regarding Ayodhya had started pouring in from south India, from where a massive number of donations have also come for the construction of the temple, Ramananda of Hammock Leisure Holidays from Bengaluru said that it did not matter to people that the Ram Temple was still under construction as they believe in the sanctity of the city. Manoj Matta of Oriental Vacations and Journeys Pvt Ltd said that stepping foot in the Ramjanmabhoomi was more important than actually seeing the temple since there were several temples already present in the city. Prateek Hira, CEO of Tornos, said that Ayodhya has always been a tourist destination and not dependent on the Ram Temple. A festival is celebrated in the city, he said, 365 days of the year. “Now because of the hype around the temple, even normal tourists and not just devotees are getting attracted to it. There is massive scope around here like the presence of Chhaapia, the birthplace of Swami Narayanan of the Swaminath Temple, which is 40km away. Patanjali was born in neighbouring Gonda. There is a famous mazaar here and Guru Nanak is believed to have visited Ayodhya. Swami Vivekanand has also stayed here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hotels-better-connectivity-will-propel-ayodhya-tourism/articleshow/87496360.cms||Neha Lalchandani

With heaps of garbage dotting Sarai-based solid waste management plant, the corporation will float a fresh tender so that the waste is disposed of daily. The firm was awarded the contract about six months ago and has done nothing to manage waste ever since. While the district generates 180 metric tonnes of waste every day, it is able to treat only 80 metric tonnes. Municipal commissioner, Haridwar, Dayanand Sarswati, told TOI, “Garbage is being collected on a regular basis, the problem is at the disposal end. We sent notices to the firm, but it did not respond. Ultimately, we had to cancel the contract. Currently, we have around 1.15 lakh metric tonnes waste at Sarai-based plant and for its speedy disposal, we are floating a fresh tender for the plant operation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-mc-cancels-contract-of-pvt-firm-over-poor-waste-management/articleshow/87494772.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Delhi||For two days from Diwali, you may breathe severely bad air in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The air quality in the city is expected to remain at the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category even in a zero-firecracker scenario on November 4 (Diwali) and November 5, predicts System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body of the Union earth sciences ministry. However, the air is likely to slide to the ‘severe’ category even with just 50% of the firecracker emissions of 2019. The analysis is based on two scenarios: first, that no firecrackers are burst due to the ban imposed by Delhi government on the Delhi high court’s direction, and second, that firecracker emission touches 50% of the 2019 Diwali level. “In the zero-firecracker emission scenario, PM2.5 is predicted to be in the upper end of ‘very poor’ during November 4-6. However, even if there are additional firecrackers emissions measuring 50% of the level in 2019, the AQI may reach the ‘severe’ category from November 4 night onwards and remain so until November 5,” said SAFAR. The prediction is for slight improvement on November 6, but with fluctuation between the high end of ‘very poor’ and the ‘severe’ ranges. This is mainly due to the coinciding of three critical factors with a peak PM2.5 surpassing 300 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5. Track the pollution level in your cityThe three factors — favourable stubble emission transporting wind speed and direction, calm local weather conditions and shallow inversion layer height that traps pollutants and any firecracker emissions — are predicted to act together and impact air quality on Diwali and the day after. The peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1am and 6am on November 4-5. According to SAFAR’s analysis, the impact of harvest stubble burning is expected to increase significantly from November 4 onwards due to transport level winds reaching Delhi from the north-west where stubble burning hot spots are located. “The stubble fire share in Delhi’s PM2.5 is forecast to be 20-40% during November 4-6 if the fire counts are assumed to be similar to last year’s. The peak share, 40%, will be recorded on November 5 if the number of farm fires are assumed to be 4,000 as expected,” the forecasting body said. SAFAR warned that even a small increment in the local additional emissions due to firecrackers would likely have a significant impact during November 4-6 and could put the AQI in ‘severe’ category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-two-days-from-diwali-you-may-breathe-severely-bad-air/articleshow/87496826.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan bypolls: Regional parties make mark, Bhartiya Tribal Party suffers||JAIPUR: The four-year-old Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP), once projected as the emerging political party in the notified tribal belts, has been decimated in the assembly polls in tribal-dominated Dhariawad (Pratapgarh). The vertical divide between its state and Centre leaders over the selection of a candidate resulted in the party’s official candidate getting just 1.28% of the total votes polled, while the party’s rebel candidate, Thawarchand Damor, secured 28.66% votes and finished second, ahead of the BJP. Taking a U-turn from acting against BTP leaders for supporting the rebel candidate, state party chief Vela Ram Ghogra told TOI, “Damor is from our party and was the first choice. However, due to some confusion and technical reasons, he was not able to get the party symbol on time. The matter will be resolved soon.” He ruled out any strict action against party leaders including its MLA Chorasi Rajkumar Roat who had openly supported the rebel candidate. “Those who voted for Damor are the ones who have faith in BTP and supported our cause of tribal first,” said Ghogra. TOI repeatedly called Roat for his comment but was unavailable. BTP has two MLAs in the state assembly (the other being Ramprasad Dindor from Sagwara) in their maiden elections in 2018. In Vallabhnagar, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) capitalised on the divide between BJP leaders. RLP fielded BJP rebel Udailal Dangi and finished second. Dangi’s voting percentage remained the same as what he had secured in 2018 indicating his grip on voters irrespective of change in the party. Interestingly, he campaigned against BJP in the Centre and Congress in the state to emerge second. Riding on the performance, Nagaur MP and RLP founder Hanuman Beniwal said his party had a successful launch in Mewar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/regional-parties-make-mark-bhartiya-tribal-party-suffers/articleshow/87496363.cms||Shoeb Khan

In Mumbai, cases and deaths stayed low, but the city again got the dubious rank of having the highest active cases in the state after Pune and Thane held that slot for months. On Tuesday, Mumbai added 225 cases, the lowest in 70 days. Deaths continued to be under five (3) for the fourth day in a row. Active cases for the state as well as the city slid to 15,485 and 4,250, respectively, which is likely to be the lowest in nearly one-and-half years. A state report said Mumbai accounted for nearly 29% of them, followed by Pune (20.6%) and Ahmednagar (12%). The state registered 1,078 new cases after the numbers fell to 809 the previous day. The count of fatalities jumped to 48 on Tuesday from 10 on Monday, which state officials attributed to a lag in reporting. Of the 48 deaths, 17 were from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and 16 from Pune division. Positive cases have mainly come from MMR (434), Pune circle (336) and Nashik (196). Mumbai saw one of its lowest vaccination turnouts on Tuesday as merely 32,739 people came out to take the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-cases-225-lowest-in-70-days/articleshow/87495623.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Bus runs over monkey in Dudhwa, owner fined Rs 2.5 lakh||BAREILLY: A bus owner was slapped a hefty fine of Rs 2.5 lakh after the vehicle ran over a monkey in the core forest area of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR). Forest officials said the driver tried to flee but was detained and the bus impounded after the incident that happened on Monday. They said the bus was speeding at 70 kmph on a stretch where the permissible limit is 40 kmph. The vehicle was released only after the owner paid the fine. According to the forest department, the bus belongs to a local transporter and it operates between Palia and Gola town in the district several times a day. On the 10km stretch that passes through the core forest area, all heavy vehicles are checked and drivers are advised to maintain a speed of 30km per hour. Normally, workers deployed at checkposts, both at the entrance and exit points, keep tabs on vehicles passing through the forest. A paper slip is issued at the entry point to heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, etc. Drivers are then advised to cross the forest within 22 minutes. This way, the speed of each vehicle can be monitored, said Manoj Kashyap, range officer. Elaborating further, he said, “There is just a provision of fine as the accident was reported on a state highway and the wild animal didn’t fall under schedule-1. Otherwise, we would have arrested the driver and sent him to jail. The fine varies from vehicle to vehicle.” Deputy director, DTR, buffer, Kailash Prakash told TOI, “A fine of Rs 2.50 lakh was imposed on the bus owner. The driver tried to flee but our staff managed to stop the vehicle. He was detained and the bus impounded. Our advice for those zooming past forested areas is to follow the speed limit and keep in mind the fact that they are transgressing into wild animals’ territory.” In the past two years, eight crocodiles were killed by overspeeding vehicles in various forest areas of Lakhimpur Kheri district. A young tigress was also killed in a road accident near the buffer area of the reserve on Gola-Lakhimpur state highway in November. In July 2020, a fine of Rs 4.5 lakh was imposed on a Gujarat-based tourist bus company for mowing down a spotted deer in the same forest range. Also, a Delhi-bound tempo traveller was fined Rs 2 lakh for mowing down a monkey in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bus-runs-over-monkey-in-dudhwa-owner-fined-rs-2-5l/articleshow/87494769.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The town’s borders have been sealed and vehicular entry banned, barring VIP and official cars, which need to be parked a km from Ram Katha Park, where the main Deepotsav event will be organised on Wednesday. Special duty officers have been deployed to ensure safe passage of ambulances. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey, said, “A seven-layer security apparatus is in place from outer to inner circles of the town. Police, special operation group and special security force have been deployed to fortify Ayodhya. We have also deployed several cops in civvies to check security and send intelligence inputs. Forty boats with life-saving equipment have been stationed at Saryu ghats,” he said. On Tuesday, a rehearsal was held of the grand Shobha Yatra, which will be flagged off on Wednesday from Saket College grounds at 10am by deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and wind its way to Ramkatha Park via Hanumangarhi, Tulsi Udyan at 2pm.

The judge observed that the custody of the accused was not imperative in the case. Those who got the anticipatory bail are Anupama's parents Jayachandran and Smitha James, sister Anju, her husband Arun, Jayachandran’s friends Ramesh and former corporation councillor Anilkumar. The court cited the applicants’ lack of criminal antecedents for granting bail. Also, it would be improper to suspect that they would go underground. Though the prosecution said the accused may try to influence witnesses, the court said such possibilities can be prevented by giving them strict instructions. If at all they are to be arrested, they should be let off on bail upon the guarantee of Rs 1 lakh or the individual guarantee of two people, the court ordered. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/anupamas-parents-get-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/87495630.cms||---

A district-level event is scheduled in Haldwani on November 9 and another in Nainital the next day. This year’s theme is ‘tourism’, meant to reassure tourists that the hill state is safe to visit again. The events have been planned by Kumaon divisional manager Sushil Kumar, along with Nainital’s DIG, district magistrate, SSP and the managing director of Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), along with other administrative officials. The divisional commissioner and district magistrate said that the cities of Haldwani and Nainital will be cleaned and beautified ahead of the foundation day events. “District development authorities in Nainital and Haldwani have been told to clean, paint roads and complete other beautification works before the foundation day. Lampposts that have been defunct for a long will be fixed in three to four days,” Kumar said, adding that his team had visited prominent tourist spots for an on-site inspection. Nainital DM Dheeraj Garbiyal also said that authorities had been asked to tidy up the cities before the events. “I have instructed the executive officer of the municipal corporation to get the city cleaned, fix lights and replace old life jackets on the boats on Naini Lake.” The DM said that the 116 roads which were blocked by landslides have now been opened and tourists can visit the Himalayas again. He said that the programme aims to create a positive atmosphere for tourists so they come to the state again, as it had been reeling from twin challenges of the pandemic and repeated natural calamities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/preparations-in-full-swing-for-state-foundation-day-themed-tourism-this-yr/articleshow/87494777.cms||---

Started on July 4, 1964, the cinema hall was shut down as it faced tough competition from the multiplex cinemas. The cinema hall will showcase Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Sooryavanshi’. People in Jaipur and those in cinema trade are happy with this announcement. Film distributors of the state believe that if this single-screen survives then it would pave way for others to restart the operations. Gem cinema was inaugurated by the then chief minister Mohal Lal Sukhadia and Congress leader Ramniwas Mirdha on July 3, 1964. The next day it was dedicated to the public. However, in 2005 the cinema had stopped its operations. “We have not changed anything and have kept everything intact. I would say we have restored it. We were planning to start it much early, but the pandemic derailed our plans. I hope people would have the same experience they had earlier till 2005. Ever since I said that we I have been getting calls from many people who shared their nostalgia,” said Sudhir Kasliwal, owner of the cinema hall. For two decades, from 1970s to 90s when the film shows were houseful, several actors like Dharmendra and Shahrukh Khan had visited the hall. Kasliwal has ensured that going to a movie hall does not become an extravagant affair for the masses. “Our tickets are priced between Rs 100 and Rs 200 for dress circle, noble circle and the box. The aim is to make it affordable for every cinema lover in town.” Kasliwal reminisced, “I remember that during the time of ‘Gadar’ we would get bulk bookings for families and friends.” Welcoming the announcement, Raj Bansal, a leading film distributor of Rajasthan, said, “It is a good beginning. I hope that this will show way to other single screens to reopen. Experience of watching a movie at a single screen hall with a capacity of more than 1,100 audiences is always better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gem-cinema-to-start-operations-again-after-16-yrs/articleshow/87496365.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Metrolite runs into rough weather before ride starts||NEW DELHI: Even though a decision on exactly which sections of the proposed Metrolite corridor will be at surface, elevated or underground level is pending, voices of concerns have started emanating from the ground. The 19km corridor, connecting Kirti Nagar to Dwarka exhibition-cum-convention centre (ECC) in Sector 25, will pass through the bustling commercial area of Kirti Nagar, which has wholesale timbre, furniture, plastic and marble markets thronged by thousands of visitors. Though Metrolite is a rail-based system, too, it has lower carrying capacity than Delhi Metro. But it also costs 40% of a Metro system. Earlier last year, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) submitted detailed project reports for two proposed Metrolite corridors — Rithala to Narela (21.7km) and Kirti Nagar to Dwarka ECC – to the Delhi government for approval. DMRC didn’t comment on the status of the project and exactly how much of the corridor would be at grade and how much elevated or underground. The traders of the Kirti Nagar area, however, are concerned that if the corridor is built on the existing road, it will badly affect their business. Rohit Raj Verma, president of Plastic Traders’ Association in Kirti Nagar, said though the details were sketchy at the moment, it appeared that the system would be like a tram on a dedicated corridor in the middle of the road with traffic on either side. He said this would result in intersections getting closed and crossing over wouldn’t be possible, though there was an industrial area on one side and commercial activities on both sides. “This area has three major commercial activities — furniture, marble and plastic — built over a long period of time, and this kind of a project would affect them,” Verma claimed. “Since land is limited, they would have to acquire land on either side of the road,” he pointed out. “Also, the project would take at least two to three years, which means the road would be inaccessible and no business can survive.” There is also a lot of confusion over whether the corridor would be elevated or on the surface, said Inderjit Singh, who has been running a furniture wholesale business in the area for the past 30 years. “If it is created on the road surface, all three wholesale businesses would be destroyed,” a worried Singh said. “With a fenced corridor, the road will be completely destroyed as it will get congested and loading and unloading of goods won’t be possible,” he claimed. Gagan Gandhi, an advocate representing the interests of the main road market associations, said the introduction of Metrolite in Kirti Nagar would certainly affect the interest of stakeholders as their businesses would be hampered by the significant loss of revenue. “This situation shall prevail as most of the customers would avoid visiting the overcrowded and heavily congested market for a considerable period of time,” he added. In a letter to DMRC, Gandhi has prayed on behalf of the associations that an alternate route be considered to prevent the loss of business, employment and revenue to the state exchequer without any benefit to the passengers on the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metrolite-runs-into-rough-weather-before-ride-starts/articleshow/87516625.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Pune||Maharashtra mops up record Rs 3,000 crore from property registrations this October||PUNE: High value property registrations this October have helped the department of registration and stamps achieve this year’s highest revenue collection of Rs 3,129 crore— also beating the Rs 2,234 crore mopped up during the same month in a pre-pandemic 2019. From the registration of high value properties to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA)-registered non-agricultural (NA) plots and land deals, the increase in revenue for October 2021 is a reflection of a boom in the realty sector, said a state registration department official. Other than good revenue collection, there has also been a nearly 5.75% upswing in registrations as compared to the previous month, he added. “After Dussehra, there has been a steady rise in registrations with a concentration on high value properties in the middle income group (MIG) and high income group (HIG) segments and land deals. This is slowly increasing and reflects a boom in the realty sector. The trend is also evident with the stamp duty collection in October 2021, despite no additional sops such as stamp duty waiver like last year,” said Shravan Hardikar, inspector general of registration and stamps. “Last year, the collection had touched Rs 4,000-Rs 6,000 crore due to stamp duty waiver. But there were no sops in this financial year. The earnings in October 2021 could well be by far the highest collection for a month where there were no sops announced by the state government,” he said. Maximum registrations were seen in metros such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. Districts such as Raigad, Thane and Nashik too witnessed increased registrations, said Hardikar. Amravati, Aurangabad and Solapur also witnessed an encouraging number of property registrations and revenue collection last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-mops-up-record-rs-3k-cr-from-property-registrations-this-oct/articleshow/87495632.cms||Nisha Nambiar

DMC finally resumed operations on Tuesday afternoon after the protesters were assured that their grievances would be addressed. Several locals gathered at the DMC office on Monday afternoon, bringing work to a halt. The employees left their posts, and offices were locked up. Work related to health issues, taxation, certificate procurement, etc, stopped for a day-and-a-half. “I had come to pay my house tax but the office was closed because of the protest,” said Subhash Verma, a resident of Dilaram Chowk on Tuesday. "Even when the streetlights work, there have been maintenance issues. We had filed a complaint eight days back, but the problem was not addressed and even after assurance by corporation officials,” said Bhupendra Kathait, city councillor. “The work for maintenance of streetlights has been handed over to a third-party company. There were some issues that locals faced. They had registered their grievances with us.

---||Pune||Local economy in Oct nears pre-pandemic levels: Study||Pune: The monthly economic and employment survey by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA), a regular feature since the outbreak of Covid-19, has revealed that the city and regional economy recovered substantially in October almost to the pre-pandemic levels. Over 150 firms in both the services and manufacturing sector participated in the survey that revealed that the local employment levels in October reached 91%, a marked increase over 87% recorded in September. Production levels also increased, albeit slightly slower, to 90%, over 88% in September. The figures were the highest since the MCCIA started conducting the survey in April 2020. The MCCIA added that the recovery in production levels would have been higher in October, but for the supply constraints that were hampering a number of segments, especially the automobile sector that was hit by the shortage of semiconductor chips and crucial metals. “The festive season has augured well for the economy of Pune region. Our journey of recovery continues. For the first time since April 2020, the recovery of industry and services, including formal and informal MSMEs, has crossed 90%,” MCCIA president Sudhir Mehta said. Larger units continued their recovery in October up to 95%, while micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises, both in services and manufacturing, recorded encouraging recovery signs during the month in production. Small enterprises, for example, recovered to 89% of the pre-pandemic levels. The relaxation of restrictions on segments of the services sector, such as entertainment, food and beverage and hospitality, also contributed to the recovery in October, MCCIA added. Also noticed in the survey, and in the broader economy, has been the continued formalization of the economy and the shrinking of the informal economy, reflected in the increase in goods and services tax (GST) collections. However, the MCCIA added that formalization came with caveats. “A lot of the economy in recent times has been formalized, at the cost of the informal economy that also employs a lot of people.

Abhay Lodha, a director, who is also named in the case, said, the company now plans to file a contempt of court plea against the bank. The bank had declared the company a wilful defaulter. However, a status quo had been granted on the classification of Topworth Steels as a willful defaulter. Yet IDBI Bank, one of the consortium lenders, went ahead and filed a complaint with the CBI on the basis of its classification of the company as a wilful defaulter. The CBI has registered a case against the directors directors, said Lodha. The court order shared with TOI by Lodha reads that both the parties have to maintain a status quo till a decision on the notice of the motion. The order was dated June 7, 2020. The next hearing was slated on June 19, 2020. Lodha, however, said the hearing was not held on that date. In any case the matter remains pending before the court, he said. The order was made in a petition filed by the company against the consortium of buyers by the company. Topworth had moved the CBI against declaration of wilful defaulter. Lodha claimed that the action was in violation of the court order. The status quo meant that neither of the party could go ahead further. Even after declaring the company as a wilful defaulter, the bank had to stop any further action till the matter was decided in the court. Even the company was supposed to withhold any action against the bank till then, said Lodha. Lodha said the loan was taken for working capital needs. However, a slump in the rates of steel led to losses. The losses were due to business reasons and the company could not repay the loan. The IDBI in its complaint has accused the company of misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. Banks, after the forensic audit of loan accounts, can declare a borrower as a wilful defaulter. The cases are also referred to CBI for further action. The case relates to the company’s business in Raipur, in Chhattisgarh. The Topworth Group has its presence in Vidarbha. It also has a plant at Umred under a different company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/topworth-case-directors-say-will-file-a-case-against-idbi-bank/articleshow/87495634.cms||Shishir Arya

As many as 456 teachers across the state are about to benefit from the training programme organised by KITE. KITE has already deployed free software-based screen reader applications like Orca in the school computers so that teachers with visual impairment would be able to overcome their limitations with the help of technology. Apart from this, special ICT training is provided to all visually-impaired teachers on a regular basis. G-Suite has been used by the general education department as a preferred platform for conducting online classes. As part of this, teachers and more than 10 lakh students from class 8 to 10 have been given login IDs. Training sessions for higher secondary teachers are also about to begin this week, said KITE authorities on Monday. General education minister V Sivankutty who visited a training session at the school for visually challenged at Vazhuthacaud here has agreed to the demand that visually-impaired teachers should be granted more time to complete the training programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/g-suite-training-begins-for-teachers/articleshow/87495649.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||4 mths of pain ends in no gain for KCR’s pointsman||Hyderabad: When Eatala Rajender quit the party and later as an MLA in June, the TRS leadership sent Karimnagar district minister Gangula Kamalakar to Huzurabad to keep the party flock together. Kamalakar managed the party affairs for some time before TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao decided to fall back on his troubleshooter, nephew and finance minister T Harish Rao to not only boost the party cadre morale but also ensure defeat of his once trusted lieutenant and party rebel Eatala. Once he was made Huzurabad election in-charge, Harish Rao wasted no time. He plunged into action immediately. He camped there for over four months. He held several meetings with local leaders and sat with people pleading for their vote to party candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav. He even gave the party plenary a miss so that he would be in the thick of things. A man known for his good oratory and poll management skills, Harish was expected to do miracles in the by-election which was touted as a stepping board for both the TRS and BJP in the 2023 assembly polls. But, it wasn’t to be. Making a last ditch attempt to lure the voters, the minister even assured them of turning Huzurabad into another Karimnagar, 40 km away, and Siddipet which he represents in the assembly. He also vowed to get a medical college, 2-BHK houses sanctioned and several developmental works if voters elect Gellu Srinivas. During the last leg of his campaign, Harish mainly focused on the rising petrol, diesel and gas cylinder prices. Despite going all out against Eatala and BJP, luck didn’t smile on Harish Rao. “The party chief gives Harish Rao important tasks as he puts in 100 per cent effort. Harish is also known as a hard taskmaster since Telangana statehood movement days. Some times, he delivers and some times, it does not work out as we desire,” a TRS general secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-mths-of-pain-ends-in-no-gain-for-kcrs-pointsman/articleshow/87495661.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Meanwhile, TRS working president KT Rama Rao said that there was nothing much to read in the result and that TRS was not unduly worried about the result. “In last 20 years, TRS has seen many highs and lows. This one election result will not be of much significance or consequence.” KTR lauded TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas for putting up a tough fight and appreciated efforts of ministers T Harish Rao, Koppula Eshwar and Gangula Kamalakar, other party leaders and cadre.. “I appeal to all TRS workers to work with increased resolve to forge ahead in future battles,” KTR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harish-accepts-verdict-ktr-downplays-loss/articleshow/87495659.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Large gatherings and slogan shoutings do not fetch votes. Despite over two lakh crowd attending a public meeting organised by then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao as part of campaign for his son PV Ranga Rao in Warangal, Congress lost the election then,” said Marri Shashidhar Reddy.

---||Pune||Drop in temperature, crackers to leave Pune with bad air this week||PUNE: The city’s air quality index (AQI) is set to deteriorate to very poor on Friday and Saturday as the temperatures drop in Pune.  An Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) -System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) has put out the forecast for Diwali. Track the pollution level in your cityThe report said that since Diwali falls in November this year when winter-like conditions have already set in, a 50% additional firecracker scenario projection shows that Pune’s AQI will deteriorate to ‘poor’ on November 4 and ‘very poor’ on November 5. The India Meteorological Department has said there are chances of light rain in Pune around Diwali which may further deteriorate the air quality, Gufran Beig, founder project director of SAFAR told TOI. “Only sufficient rain is believed to wash away pollutants, while a drizzle can make it worse,” he said. If the rain is sufficient, then pollutants may wash off and air quality could become a little better. “When there is a drizzle during cooler temperatures, the scant rain is insufficient to wash off the pollutants that are hanging in the air. There is an increase in humidity during such times, causing water molecules to stay suspended in the air. The pollution particulate matter can thus stay hung on these water molecules for a longer period of time,” he said. The Air Quality Forecast for Diwali 2021 period for Pune issued by IITM is based on the indigenously developed SAFAR-Air Quality Forecasting Framework. The forecast is based on two model scenarios: additional firecracker emissions being ‘nil’ and additional firecracker emissions being 50% of 2019 emissions. These projected emissions are in addition to standard background emissions. Because of current low temperatures (the minimum temperature is around 18-19˚C), the mixing layer height of the atmosphere is likely to be low. Winds, which are mostly easterly winds, are expected to be calm, leading to accumulation of pollutants and hence faster deterioration of the air quality around Diwali. However, if no fire crackers are burned (nill scenario) then AQI will remain in the moderate category during the entire period, the forecast said. A recent IITM study in the international journal Urban Climate had linked black carbon-rich particles to be strongly associated with Covid-19 spread. “As per the paper, when pollution consists of black carbon particles, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can piggyback on these particles and spread via them. During firecracker burning, a lot of black carbon is emitted. High black carbon emissions during Diwali could thus be a cause of concern for the spread of the Covid-19 virus ,” Beig added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drop-in-temperature-crackers-to-leave-pune-with-bad-air-this-week/articleshow/87494806.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||40% of Lucknow citizens are fully vaccinated against Covid||LUCKNOW: With 7,255 people taking the second shot of the Covid vaccine on Tuesday, at least 40% eligible population of Lucknow is now fully vaccinated with the two doses. Overall, 12,152 people, including 4,897 first dose beneficiaries, were jabbed at 151 centres. After this, now 15 lakh people of the total 37.4 lakh adult population of Lucknow have completed their two doses, while 16.3 lakh have been partially vaccinated with a dose and are waiting for the gap period to be over to get the second. However, a close look at data reveals that the proportion of fully or partially vaccinated people in the 60 years and above category is comparatively less, although the vaccination of elderly had started on March 1, much before those younger. TimesViewHealth authorities must run a vaccine awareness campaign dedicated to the elderly. Teams can also be deployed to call those senior citizens who have missed their second dose to find out the reason and address their issues. Some centres can also be reserved for 60 years and above category.As per data, there are 4.7 lakh elderly in Lucknow. Of these, about 3.7 lakh (78.7%) have taken one or both shots. In comparison, 91.8% of about 7.4 lakh people in the 45-59 years category have been covered partially or fully. Similarly, of the 25.3 lakh in the 18-44 years’ category, about 20.6 lakh (81.4%) have taken one or both doses. Officers said this could be because many in this population are suffering from comorbidities and are on medication, making them ineligible for vaccination. Prof Vinita Shukla, nodal officer for vaccination at RMLIMS, said, “In rural areas, we see lack of awareness among elderly. There are also cases where elderly are dependent on family members for vaccination.” 26 more dengue cases recorded:As many as 26 more dengue cases, including six serious ones, were recorded in the city on Tuesday. The serious patients were admitted to hospitals - two each in SPM Civil Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and Lokbandhu Hospital-as their blood platelet count had dropped below 20,000. Health officials said platelets were transfused in three of the serious patients to stabilize them, while the other three are being monitored. The 20 remaining patients are recuperating at home. The city this year has recorded 1,085 dengue cases so far since January, of which 95% (1024) have come in the past two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/40-of-citizens-are-fully-vaccinated-against-covid/articleshow/87496380.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Chapati roller, lookalike of TRS’ car, manages to win 2,000 votes||HYDERABAD: The ‘chapati roller’ (rolling pin) has done it again. The roti maker, which looks strikingly similar to TRS’ car, secured 1,921 votes in Tuesday’s outcome. Though the lookalike symbol did not hurt the ruling TRS much unlike the Dubbak 2020 verdict where the TRS lost the by-election to the BJP by a margin of just around 1,000 votes, Siliveru Srikanth of Praja Ekta Party, who was allotted the chapati roller, still managed to bag a healthy fifth position in the vote tally. Balmoor Venkat of Congress came third with 3,014 votes, while independent candidate Kante Sayanna got 1,942 votes. NOTA secured 1,036 votes. In all, 30 candidates had contested in the bypolls. Independent candidate Bandaru Nagaraju did the unthinkable in the Dubbak assembly by-election last year when he finished fourth after bagging 3,570 votes. Nagaraju did not campaign and yet got the votes as his roti maker symbol was very similar to TRS’ car. No wonder, 20 candidates – both independents and those from smaller parties – demanded that they be allotted symbols like roti maker, road roller, auto, tractor, etc., as all these symbols look like TRS’. Sayanna, who contested on a diamond symbol, said seven years after Telangana came into being following the sacrifices of thousands of activists and student leaders, only a few leaders were reaping the benefits. Sayanna, a regular feature in the elections, had earlier entered the fray from Nagarjunasagar. He had even contested against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in Gajwel constituency and bagged 3,353 votes in 2018 elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chapati-roller-lookalike-of-trs-car-manages-to-win-2k-votes/articleshow/87495679.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypolls: No luck November continues for TRS||HYDERABAD: November doesn’t appear to be a happy month for the ruling TRS as the party suffered a setback in a by-election yet again. It was in November 2020, the TRS had lost the Dubbak assembly constituency to the BJP in a bypoll. And this November was no different as Huzurabad result came as a rude shock to the pink party. Despite the party leadership working out poll-eve strategies, leaders campaigning for five months, deputing three ministers — T Harish Rao, Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar — and dangling several sops to lure Huzurabad voters, Tuesday’s outcome came as a disappointment to the TRS. Though the party denied linking Dalit Bandhu’s launch to the polls, the scheme did not help gain much votes, especially in Shalapally where the scheme was taken up as a pilot project. Analysing the reasons for TRS’s defeat, political analyst professor K Nageshwar said two to three major factors contributed for the victory of BJP and its candidate Eatala Rajender. “The first reason is people did not believe the allegations levelled against Eatala by the ruling party and saw him as a victim. Secondly, Congress votes have substantially transferred to Eatala in this poll,” he said. “Thirdly, CM KCR focused too much on Eatala’s defeat by raking up the issue of non-development of the constituency. The fact is the TRS in 2018 had asked the people to vote for development (read Eatala) in the constituency,” professor Nageshwar pointed out. Political analyst S Surender said though parties indulged in distribution of cash and liquor during the polling, people elected the candidate whom they had faith. Apart from launching a trenchant attack on Eatala during the campaigning, the TRS leaders attacked the BJP government at the Centre for hike in fuel and gas cylinder rates. “Despite making all the noise against the rising prices and leaving no stone unturned to upstage Eatala, voters preferred the local man who they thought would serve them better,” a senior analyst said. Soon after Etala was sacked from the cabinet and he quit from the assembly, the TRS made its moves and saw to it that all the leaders close to him would sail with the party. Minister Kamalakar held a series of meetings with sarpanches, councillors, municipal chairpersons and other elected representatives in the constituency to wean them away from Eatala. Not one to take things lying down after Eatala made charges against him, KCR even sent his pointsman, finance minister Harish Rao, who camped in the constituency for over four months, including skipping the recent plenary of the party, to teach Eatala a lesson. But, the chief minister’s ‘Mission Huzurabad’ to oust Eatala from his fiefdom from where he was elected six times as a legislator was a failure. To negate Eatala’s popularity, TRS took up various developmental activities in the constituency right from constructing roads, sanctioning projects and laying foundation stones for bhavans of various communities. All this, however, did not fetch the votes for the TRS. TRS leaders said the results of this by-election will certainly have a bearing on the 2023 assembly elections if the leadership does not take corrective measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-luck-november-continues-for-trs/articleshow/87495653.cms||Koride Mahesh

He demanded the TRS government to implement Dalit Bandhu scheme in the constituency, which was stalled by the Election Commission before the election, and extend it to all constituencies in the state. “Schemes similar to Dalit Bandhu should be implemented for BCs, minorities and STs and weaker sections immediately,” Rajender told the media after receiving the election certificate from the returning officer. He along with his wife Jamuna, party leader G Vivek and others reached the counting centre SRR College on Tuesday night. The ex-minister, who got counting updates and monitored from Huzurabad reached Karimnagar in the evening. He declared that people had taught K Chandrasekhar Rao, a big lesson through this election though the ruling party distributed Rs 10,000 per vote and liquor to the voters. He also alleged that police and election officers also helped the TRS. “As assured by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, I demand the government provide financial assistance to the people, who want to construct 2-BHK on their land. The government should also release a notification for recruitment and release Rs 3,116 unemployment allowance to the youth, purchase paddy without any restrictions and reduction of age to 57 years for pensions as announced during the Huzurabad elections,” he said. He said people have shown maturity in the election without succumbing to sops. “This is the only election probably in the country where ruling party resorted to all types of irregularities and harassed me. People staged dharna for want of cash for vote,” he said. He said BJP had given 65 representations to EC on issues and asked for a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-to-focus-on-key-issues-pushes-trs-on-promises/articleshow/87495668.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Congress' vote share falls to all-time low in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: The leadership change has done little to end Congress’ losing streak in the state. The team led by new state president A Revanth Reddy failed to revive the electoral prospects of the party, with Balmoor Venkat getting about 3,000 votes which was less than 2 per cent of total votes in a constituency with traditional Congress vote blocks. It was a massive drop for Congress from three years ago when its candidate P Kaushik Reddy (now in TRS) had polled over 61,000 votes with a vote share of 34.6 per cent. In the 2009 assembly polls, Congress’ V Krishna Mohan Rao polled 41,717 (28.5 per cent) and in 2014 K Sudarshan Reddy got 38,278 votes (23.5 per cent). Even in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress’ Ponnam Prabhakar polled 43,690 votes (30 per cent) in Huzurabad constituency in 2009, got 46,867 votes (26.8 per cent) in 2014 and 46,689 votes (29.8 per cent) in 2019. Congress hasn’t won Huzurabad in the past 30 years, but the abysmal vote share was a new low for the party. The loss has put a question mark over party’s future in Telangana in the face of a resurgent BJP, which beat TRS in Dubbak bypoll and came up with a stunning performance in GHMC elections. “It was a half-hearted approach by the party leadership which did not hold even one public meeting in Huzurabad, while huge public meetings were held in Adilabad, Gajwel, Raviryala and Mahbubnnagar. Also, the Congress did not work as hard as it did in Dubbak and Nagarjunasagar,” Congress MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said. On talk in political circles that Congress had no choice but to indirectly support Eatala as “an enemy of the enemy is a friend,” Komatireddy denied having made such comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-vote-share-falls-to-all-time-low-in-huzurabad/articleshow/87495690.cms||Roushan Ali

A Diwali tradition indigenous to the city, it refers to a Hindustani classical music programme at sunrise on the main day of the festival. This year, such programmes will be held at Tilak Smarak Mandir in Sadashiv Peth, Yeshwantrao Chavan Natyagruha in Kothrud, Balgandharva Rangmandir, and Ganesh Kala Krida Sankul. Sarod player Anupam Joshi, who is performing at a closed concert on November 6, said, “The pandemic has not ruined the spirit of the city for celebrations. Diwali pahat is a tradition that continues.” The concept started in 1992 and has spread to Nashik and Mumbai. Over the last 30 years it has developed into a tradition for the people of Pune to start the main Diwali day by attending these cultural events. Pradip Halasgikar, from All India Radio, said, “We used to broadcast Diwali pahat organised by AIR. The concert in Pune would be broadcast to all stations such as Nashik, Mumbai, Solapur, Kolhapur and others. This year, we could not organise it as there was a delay in the clarification on the Covid guidelines.” He said he would attend a Diwali pahat along with his family this year. Mohini Kulkarni from Sadashiv Peth said, “Every year, we meet our extended family members and friends at the pahat where we wish each other and enjoy concert together. This family tradition was started by my in-laws, carried on through our generation and passed on to the next. My daughter who married in 2019 will also be attending the pahat with her family.” Sanjay Deo from Gokhalenagar said, “The pahat starts with bhakti sangeet and a prayer, which is the right way to start any festival. We are vaccinated and can safely attend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auditoriums-to-host-diwali-pahat-programmes-after-last-years-lull/articleshow/87494833.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Industry federation CAIT expected gold sales to cross a record Rs 7,500 crore nationwide. Tuesday’s rate for 22-carat gold was Rs 46,740 per 10 gm and 24 carat Rs 47,740. In Mumbai, mahurat customers flocked to buy small items of jewellery while wedding buyers chose high value ornaments. After a series of idle festive seasons, jewellers were so busy they declined to speak until close of business hours. As the day wore on, the sale of gold coins outstripped jewellery in parts of the city, which is unusual given the surfeit of upcoming weddings. Typically, ornaments fare better than bullion during the marriage season. The trend towards coins indicates that Mumbaikars are once again relying on pure gold as an investment. Festive shopping continued up to 10.30pm given customer preference for the evening mahurat. Nitin Khandelwal, past president of the All India Gem and Jewellery Council (GJC), said, “Traders nationwide are very pleased. We had kept our expectations low since the pandemic is still not fully behind us, but the robust demand has surprised us. In fact our store ran out of gold coins in the evening and we quickly sourced more stock.” Khandelwal said the auspicious mahurat of Guru Pushya yog, which fell last Thursday, also saw brisk buying sentiment. “It took 25% of the load off Dhanteras,” he said. Ashok Gajera, director of Laxmi Diamonds, wholesale diamantaire at Bharat Diamond Bourse, said Diwali had seen a good start. “Jewellery has been a solid stable investment. Our sales are 40% higher this season.” Zaveri Bazar goldsmith Kanaya Kakad said, “People were buying coins ranging from 2-10 gm. There were large queues in Zaveri Bazar.” Exuberance brimmed over in the tone of goldsmith Sanjay Kothari of Palak Jewellers, Borivli. He said, “After such a prolonged period, trade is finally looking up.” Similar feelings were echoed by Mehul Suru, manager of Om Alankar Jewellers nearby, who said “the ratio of coins to ornaments was 70:30”. In Andheri Lokhandwala, KAJ Jewellers also reported that coins fared better in the same proportion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-strong-demand-for-gold-coins-in-city-brings-glitter-to-dhanteras-mahurat/articleshow/87495658.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The efficacy and adequacy of the pollution-control measures were being monitored by a dedicated team, said a senior company official. In recent years, Delhi has experienced severe air pollution in November and December when wind speeds reduce. This period also coincides with stubble burning in adjoining states, vehicular pollution, etc. The engineering company has put up a wind breaking wall around the entire 3km periphery of the site. A source said the barrier wall controls air currents and prevents erosion by obstructing the wind near the ground and stops the soil from blowing off-site. Eight anti-smog guns have been installed at vantage points, which spray fine droplets of water over the site. This not only helps dust particles settle down, but also wets the ground to avoid creation of any further dust due to digging and other construction activities. Four water tankers have been provided for periodic sprinkling of water so that dust levels are within limits despite heavy vehicular movement. Care is also being taken to limit dust pollution from stone cutting and grinding works. The stone slabs are made wet before cutting or grinding to control dust generation. In addition, cutting machine enclosures have been made to limit the area of this activity. Water jet machines are used for cutting stone. An automatic wheel washing facility has been made at the exit gate and more will be installed in the weeks to come. The wheels of trucks and other vehicles leaving the site are cleaned to prevent mud, slurry and other pollutants from ending up on roads. Excavated earth is properly covered before being transported. Heaps of excavated earth are stacked with agricultural nets to prevent dust from rising in the air. To maintain air quality, the company is carrying out ambient air monitoring through an NABL-accredited agency. Pocket monitoring meters are being used for daily checks. Reviews are conducted periodically and improvisation done based on feedback from stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-work-on-with-pollution-guards/articleshow/87495660.cms||Prabhakar Sinha

Green crackers are being sold only at 40% of the shops, while the rest are selling traditional ones leftover from last year, TOI found in a reality check on Tuesday. The president of Aishbagh Fireworks Traders’ Association Mithun Jha said, “Green crackers don’t contain aluminium, barium, potassium nitrate or carbon. That makes them eco-friendly. Green crackers are 30% less polluting compared to traditional ones. Barium nitrate is responsible for heavy smoke and emissions and green crackers contain less or no barium at all. Noise pollution is also lower in green crackers as their capacity is 110-125 decibels in comparison to 160 decibels from regular ones. “However, for all their advantages, these eco-friendly firecrackers are more expensive than the regular ones, hence many people do not prefer them. As a result, some shopkeepers acquire them in an authorised manner for sale,” said another trader. Police teams are continuously checking the firecracker markets, but some shopkeepers are still taking the risk. TOI conducted the reality check in Aishbagh, Babuganj, Sadar, Alambagh, Aashiana, Munshipulia, Bhootnath and DAV College. It found that the number of stalls selling green crackers was lower than those selling traditional ones. All markets had adequate fire safety measures though. “I could not sell a lot of crackers last year, which is why I am selling the leftovers this time. I have a variety of small non-green crackers like phuljhadi, chakri and anar. People are demanding parachutes as well,” said Shivam Yadav, a shopkeeper near Munshipulia Zia, a shopkeeper at Babuganj market, said, “The price of green crackers is more than that of normal ones. For instance, a pack of 12 eco-friendly rockets can cost Rs 1,300-Rs 1,500, as compared to a normal pack which will cost Rs 800 to Rs 1,000, depending on the brand.” “I bought a variety of crackers this year because I could not celebrate last year due to the pandemic. As green crackers were very expensive, I bought the traditional ones,” said Ashutosh Rajpoot, who was shopping in Alambagh. Narhi resident Anukrati Shukla said, “I live close to the zoo. I always buy crackers that don’t disturb animals. This time, I will switch to green crackers.” Raman Rathore, who owns a cracker shop in Sadar, said, “We are trying to promote green crackers, but demand is low.” Vijay Vaish, another firecracker shop owner, said, “I have all kinds of green crackers but most customers look for budget- friendly choices. There are inexpensive green crackers too but customers are not wellinformed about them.” (With inputs from Godhooli Shama, Himanshu Singh & Vartika Sonakia)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/warning-fails-to-put-lid-on-non-green-crackers-sale/articleshow/87496396.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Pune||Property registration revenue crosses Rs 3,000 crore in Maharashtra in October, highest this fiscal||PUNE: High-value property registrations this October have helped the state registration department garner this year’s highest revenue collection of Rs3,129 crore, which is also higher than the Rs2,234 crore earning during the same month in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. From registration of high-value properties to the RERA-registered non-agricultural (NA) plots and land deals, the increase in revenue for October 2021 is a reflection of a boom in the realty sector, an official in the state registration department said. Besides the good revenue collection, there has also been an upswing in registrations of nearly 5.75% as compared to the previous month, the official added. “After Dasara, there has been a steady rise in registrations with the concentration more on high-value property registrations in the middle income group (MIG) and high income group (HIG) segments and land deals. This is slowly increasing and also reflecting a boom in the realty market. The trend is also evident with the stamp duty collection in October 2021, where there was no additional sops such as stamp duty waiver like last year,” Inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR) Shravan Hardikar said. “Last year, the collection had touched Rs4,000-Rs 6,000 crore due to the stamp duty waiver. But there were no sops in this financial year. The earnings in October 2021 could well be by far the highest collection for a month, where there are no sops announced by the state government,” he said. Maximum registrations were seen in metros such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. Districts such as Raigad, Thane and Nashik also witnessed increased registrations, Hardikar said. Amravati, Aurangabad and Solapur too witnessed an encouraging number of property registration and revenue collection last month. Developers said the healthy growth in the residential property registrations volume was a sign of the market recovering. State Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) president Sunil Furde told TOI that there was a consistent increase in registrations in the past few months. “This demonstrated that there is buoyancy in the realty sector despite the rollback of the government’s stamp duty waiver,” he said. From September to December last year, the stamp duty was reduced by 3%. From January 1 to March 2021, it was reduced by 2%. Property observers felt that after the receding of the second wave of the Covid pandemic and the relaxations in the restrictions, there has been a steady increase in terms of property registration and revenue collection. “The steady growth has led to a new lease of life to the residential market and developers are preparing for a stellar festive period,” a property consultant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-property-registration-revenue-crosses-rs3k-cr-in-oct-highest-this-fiscal/articleshow/87494851.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Coming out of the gloom that prevailed due to Covid, city markets got back their sheen with people making their way to jewellery stores. Jewellers said that the majority of the people took home minimalistic jewellery like gold studs, slim chains with a pendant, diamond bracelets, solitaire rings, silver trinkets like anklets and trendy light weight jewellery. However, those purchasing jewellery for weddings went for intricately crafted gold and Meenakari pieces. TimesViewDiwali is an auspicious occasion when we pray for prosperity and well being of all. Our actions should also reflect this. While celebrating and bursting crackers, we must take all safety precautions and ensure no or minimum inconvenience to others and least damage to environment.The shining gems and precious metals, along with decorated automobile showrooms, attracted the people from all walks of life. Jyoti Dwivedi, a homemaker, said, “I bought a pair of gold earrings along with a set of Lakshmi Ganesha idols made in pure silver for this Diwali. I had only bought a small silver glass last year due to Covid crisis but this year I decided to get the idols.” “I bought two silver coins for Dhanteras this year,” said SK Singh, a customer at a jewellery shop in Gole Market. Shikha Verma, a customer at a local automobile showroom said, “I pre-booked a scooter from my first pay last month and I received it today. Getting the scooter of my choice that too with my own hard-earned money on Dhanteras was a lifetime experience.” Roadside utensil kiosks and stores too witnessed heavy rush till late night with people busy buying utensils in silver and brass. “Utensils and buying brooms are considered very auspicious. I bought certain items made of brass as well,” said Shikha Arora of Aashiana. Pragya, a resident of Jankipuram Extension, said that she was waiting for Dhanteras shopping after the Covid lull. She stepped out of the house today after four months to see the dazzle of the market.

---||Delhi||Delhi: A year on, Diwali is back for Tihar inmates||NEW DELHI: Diwali will be a gala day for inmates of three jail complexes. Last year, the Covid-19 pandemic put paid to any celebrations among the prisoners, but this year around the 18,000 inmates of the jails at Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini can have a celebratory day. “Last year, due to Covid, we curtailed inter-ward movement of the inmates to check transmission of the disease. This year, we will allow the celebrations, but with pandemic guidelines strictly followed," an officer revealed. Sandeep Goel, director-general, Tihar jail, said the sale of sweets, candles and diyas made by prisoners saw an increase. "Apart from selling these products through Tihar Haat, these will also be sold internally in the three prison complexes through the jail canteens. Staff and inmates love sweets and purchase them," Goel said. The prison has logged sales of Rs 20.3 lakh this year against Rs 12 lakh in 2020. Elaborating on the celebrations, the officer said sweets and a celebratory meal will be served to inmates on Diwali on Thursday. “The jails will be decorated with flowers and rangoli will be made. Diyas and candles will be lit in the evening,” the officer said According to prison officers, musical and cultural programmes are also planned, with inmates also participating. "The prisoners will sing motivational songs and similar music will be played on the jail FM radio," one officer said. Another officer said that due to the pandemic, the prisons had stopped the visits of NGO members who were helping the inmates in pursuing vocational courses. “A few months ago, we decided to allow them back. They are now helping the prisoners in their courses, also assisting them in making candles and wax diyas,” he said. Not only did the coronavirus curtail Diwali celebrations last year, but it also impacted the education of the prisoners with the enrolment in different in-prison courses declining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-year-on-diwali-is-back-for-tihar-inmates/articleshow/87495672.cms||Abhay Singh

Corporators said lakes were full but no one knows where the water is going. Opposition party corporators alleged that water supply in some areas was being tampered with to ruin the image of the corporator in that ward. Congress corporator and opposition party leader Ravi Raja said in Sion Koliwada there have been water-related problems since October 16. “I was told the issue would be resolved before Diwali, but nothing happened. It seems like someone is deliberately tampering with water supply in my area,” said Raja, alleging that engineers in F North tampered with water supply. Times ViewWater shortage is a sensitive issue and local corporators are generally the first to face the brunt. With civic polls around the corner, corporators are edgy and do not want to upset supporters. BMC must ensure supply is not affected when lakes received bountiful rainfall this year.He was supported by corporators across party lines. Education committee chairman Sandhya Doshi (Shiv Sena) said she was flooded with messages from people not receiving proper supply in Borivli. “Diwali is here. We have no answer to give people. This is putting back all work we did in the last 4.5 years as corporators as people are bound to remember problems they are facing now,” said Doshi. NCP party leader in BMC Rakhi Jadhav said it appears purposely to tarnish the image of some corporators. Additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said he did not have details about the problem in Sion Koliwada but admitted the situation was good in lakes. The civic committee meeting was later adjourned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-netas-fume-as-lakes-full-but-parts-of-city-dry/articleshow/87495678.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Sparks fly as GHMC razes illegal shops after HC fiat||HYDERABAD: Tension prevailed at Garden Towers in First Lancer area, under Humayun Nagar police station limits, after Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials carried out demolition of illegal structures as per the high court order on Tuesday. Police registered three cases against some people for obstructing the demolition activity and even setting the material at the site on fire to allegedly trigger communal tension. In compliance with the order of the high court, GHMC officials demolished seven commercial shops built around a religious structure. While the demolition was on, Sha Jahangiruddin Siddiqui of First Lancer allegedly set fire to a few articles in the vicinity of the disputed property. “The accused also set ablaze a car of a local person and it suffered partial damage,” joint commissioner AR Srinivas said. Police immediately alerted the fire department and the flames were doused quickly. Police also used mild force to disperse the mob gathered at the scene. Aggrieved with the alleged illegal construction of Jahangiruddin, a residents welfare association had approached the high court, which recently directed GHMC to raze the illegal structures and asked police to give protection for the demolition work. “We have registered three separate cases against the accused under Section 153A of the IPC for Promoting enmity between different groups, under Section 353 for assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty and also for setting the car of a private person on fire,” the joint commissioner said.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government issues final warning to school teachers||LUCKNOW: Issuing final warning to primary school teachers, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked them to either upload their academic records, including the marksheets and certificates of high school, intermediate and graduation, on the Manav Sampada portal or face the music. In a fresh directive, the basic education department has asked all basic shiksha adhikaris (BSAs) to release salary of only those teachers who have uploaded their high school marksheets and certificates on Manav Sampada portal, an online database of teachers created for digitisation of records. Since September 2019, teachers are being repeatedly asked to upload their educational documents online but 100% compliance has not been achieved yet. In the order, additional project director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rohit Tripathi said since teachers had their own login, they could have easily uploaded the documents. “Non-compliance of repeated orders shows lax attitude of teachers,” said Tripathi’s letter to the basic shiksha adhikaris. The directives to stop salary of teachers who fail to upload their high school marksheet and certificate is based on a September 18 status report of documents uploaded on the portal. The report, prepared by the directorate of basic education, shows that around 20% of assistant teachers and head masters are yet to upload one or more academic records on the portal. Over 27% shiksha mitras have not uploaded documents, the status report said. In figures, over 9,000 assistant teachers of primary schools and 3,500 head teachers in primary schools/assistant teachers in junior schools are yet to upload their high school marksheet. The number of assistant teachers in primary school and head teachers (primary level) who have not uploaded their high school certificates is over 15,000 and 7,000, respectively. In Lucknow, out of 3,003 assistant teachers in primary schools, 2,872 have uploaded their high school marksheet and 2,777 have uploaded their high school certificate. Among 1,977 head teachers (primary school)/assistant teachers (junior school) in Lucknow, 1,915 and 1,786, respectively, have uploaded their high school marksheets and certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-teachers-issued-final-warning/articleshow/87496407.cms||---
---||Delhi||Daily farm fire count may touch 3,500 now||NEW DELHI: After the number of farm fires in the neighbouring states proved lower this October than last year, the harvest remnant burning is set to surge in the first fortnight of November and the daily fire count is expected to be around 3,500. However, the higher number of fires, according to experts, doesn’t translate into air quality deterioration because of other factors like wind speed and wind direction. Data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the Union earth sciences ministry’s forecasting body, shows 25,380 effective farm fires in the states in Delhi’s neighbourhood between October 5 and November 2. SAFAR had listed 77,118 farm fires in 2020, 53,275 in 2019 and 60,132 between October 5 and December 5 last year. Because the farmers started burning rice harvest remnants later than usual because of the extended monsoon season, the satellite imagery shows only now the farm fires spreading to other areas. “Earlier this season, stubble burning was predominantly noted in the Majha region (Amritsar and Tarn Taran) in Punjab. But in the last few days, fires have also been observed in the Malwa region in Punjab, across Sangrur, Patiala, Firozpur, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Faridkot and Bathinda districts,” said L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water. “In Haryana, the fires are mostly seen in the districts of Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Jind and Fatehabad. In the last two days, 2,500-3,500 fires were reported in these states every day.” Kurinji said the Punjab and Haryana governments should ensure the farmers in these hotspots timely access to stubble management options to curb burning of crop residue. SAFAR’s founder and project director Gufran Beig said, “The daily average of fire count in the first week of November is 4,000. However, high fire counts do not directly impact the air quality severely if the wind direction and speed are not favourable for transportation of pollutants from the burning sites to Delhi. Local wind speed also affects the impact of stubble burning in the PM2.5 level.” This is evident from SAFAR records. The highest single-day fire count was on November 5, 2019, when 5,300 fires were noted. Yet the share of the fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 10%. In contrast, though there were only 2,190 farm fires on November 5, 2018, they formed 58% of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollutants that day because the wind direction and speed were good for transporting the pollutants. Kurinji added, “The farm fires are expected to continue in the coming days. The north-westerly winds, reduced wind speeds and lower temperatures coupled with local emissions will worsen air quality in Delhi-NCR. Cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain will have to execute pre-emptive measures to keep pollution levels under check."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-farm-fire-count-may-touch-3500-now/articleshow/87495687.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Patna||Bettiah CO held for taking Rs2.5 lakh bribe||PATNA: The Vigilance Investigation Bureau on Tuesday arrested Bettiah circle officer (CO) Shyamakant Prasad while allegedly accepting Rs2.5 lakh as bribe at his residence at Kamalnath Nagar of Bettiah town in West Champaran. Prasad’s superannuation is due after six months. Later, the bureau sleuths conducted a thorough search of his house, which yielded gold jewellery weighing at least 938gm and 3.2kg of silver ornaments worth more than Rs50.1 lakh besides Rs10.5 lakh in cash. Seven deeds of land in West and East Champaran, passbooks of six bank accounts, a bank locker and documents showing investments in 16 life insurance policies were also recovered. The bureau has started the process to get his bank accounts freezed. The action was taken on a complaint lodged by one Vijay Kumar Gupta of Lauria against Prasad for demanding bribe. The allegations were found true and the bureau lodged an FIR against Prasad on Monday. The trap team was led by DSP Arun Paswan while search team was led by DSP Surendra Kumar Mauar. As per bureau sources, the CO failed to give any satisfactory reply or produce document to prove the legitimacy of cash recovered from his residence. Sources said Gupta owns four kattha land in Lauria since 1987, but one Shakeela Khatoon recently claimed her ownership over the plot. “She approached the CO and submitted an application that the mutation and tax receipts should be in her name. Gupta was getting some minor construction work done on his land around a month back when the woman reached there with police and got it stopped,” a senior bureau officer said. He said the CO passed an order prohibiting any work on the said land. “Following this, Gupta approached Prasad showing his land ownership. The CO then asked Gupta to pay him Rs2.5 lakh as bribe to settle the dispute in his favour,” he said. Sources said when the bureau sleuths asked his wife to hand over the keys of the locker in her name in Bank of Baroda, she made an excuse that it had got displaced. “Later, they got the locker sealed,” he said. Sources said the bureau will initiate a disproportionate assets (DA) inquiry against the CO. They said if Prasad’s movable and immovable properties are found disproportionate, a separate FIR would be registered against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-co-held-for-taking-rs2-5l-bribe/articleshow/87494876.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Streets full on dhanteras, but sales don’t match numbers||NEW DELHI: Dariba Kalan, Old Delhi’s historic jewellery market, witnessed a rise in footfall this Dhanteras compared with the empty streets seen last year, but jewellers say sales were a meagre 30% of the pre-Covid days. “The market used to be overcrowded during Dhanteras in the pre-pandemic days. We were excited with the 50% rise in footfall since Monday. Compared with last year, it seemed very promising for sales to shopkeepers. But on Tuesday, when sales usually increase, we saw a very slow pace,” said Paras Jain, the owner of Jain and Sons, a 32-year-old shop at Dariba Kalan. Meanwhile, traders have high hopes from the Diwali festive rush and matrimonial events to recover from the long pandemic-generated losses. “The lockdown in April this year put brakes on the economy for about six months. On Diwali, Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) estimates a business of about Rs 5,000 crore,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairman of CTI. “We are taking all necessary precautions to manage the crowd in the market. It seems the loss caused by the lockdown may be compensated to some extent,” said Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders’ Association. A few jewellers claimed that due to the pedestrianisation of Chandni Chowk, buyers were being compelled to get down from their vehicles at Red Fort and walk to Dariba Kalan. This had allegedly discouraged those who bought jewellery in bulk from coming there due to fear of robbery. The owners of Rehman Jewellers, CBS Jewellers, Shri Adinath Jewellers, Sindhi Hira Jewellers, Rajat Enterprises and other shops shared a similar experience. “While this Dhanteras we saw an increase in the number of customers compared with last year, the changed scenario has discouraged us from introducing new trends of gold and silver ornaments and introducing new collections Dariba Kalan is famous for,” said a jeweller. The jewellers said that Covid-19 had not just hit the economy and affected purchasing capacity, but also changed people’s lifestyles and made them minimalists. According to them, this was another reason why many strolling in the decked-up market did not end up buying anything. They further claimed that many buyers from the new generation were more attracted towards artificial jewellery. At another heritage market, Kinari Bazar, sales of laces and borders had not picked up despite the Dhanteras rush. However, most shopkeepers had opted to introduce Diwali specific decor products, like diyas, flowers and fashionable lighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/streets-full-on-dhanteras-but-sales-dont-match-numbers/articleshow/87495719.cms||Zumbish

---||Kochi||Kerala records ‘unusual’ amount of rainfall this year||KOCHI: It has been a year of ‘unusual’ rainfall record for Kerala as it received high excess rains even in ‘minimum-rain’ months. Apart from being a ‘wet’ October, the rainfall received is a new record of total rainfall received in this month in the last 121 years, looking at rainfall data of the IMD from 1901 onwards. This year, the state received 589.9mm (58.9cm) of rainfall in October, a 94% excess. The normal rainfall is 303.4mm. The previous highest was in 1999 when the state received 566mm in October. While 2018 and 2019 saw August receiving the highest rainfall, in 2020, September received the highest rainfall of 601mm and till date, October remains the highest. This year began with the highest rainfall recorded in January. Normal rainfall for January is 8.4 mm, but this year the state received 105.5mm, which is the highest-ever since 1896 when the state received over 100mm rainfall. While the southwest monsoon officially ended on Oct 24, rainfall has been deficient in the main monsoon months of June and July. “We have been seeing a shift in the monsoon intensity months. This year has been a record of sorts with two districts recording their highest rainfall in October. Pathanamthitta and Palakkad have recorded the highest-ever rainfall since 1999. Pathanamthitta received the largest excess rainfall this month at 148%, getting 866.9mm against a normal of 792.2mm. Similarly, with Palakkad getting 130% large excess rains at 575.2mm to a normal of 446.8 mm,” said Rajeevan K, meteorologist, Kerala state disaster management authority (KSMDA). He said that Kottayam, Kozhikode and Malappuram have also recorded very high rainfall, closer to the previous-highest recorded. “When one looks at the total rainfall received, it is very high. But these rains are not in the months that are conducive to the farmers. Also, sudden intense rainfall accompanied by strong winds, thunderstorms and lightning have become a regular pattern in our warning system,” he added. Since 2018, there have been a series of publications on the Kerala rainfall pattern, indicating that increase in sea-surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea is triggering more cyclonic activity on the west coast impacting the weather systems in Kerala. A series of studies by researchers at Advanced Center for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR), Cochin University, has indicated that the west coast is prone to massive flooding, both from a moderate to high-intensity rain spell that follows a prolonged wet period and from events such as a cloudburst that pours enormous amounts of precipitation in a very short period. It said that heavy precipitation in a short duration brings runoff water beyond the capacity of the rivers, and the sloping topography from high land Western Ghats to low-lying west coast accelerates the rush of flooding waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-records-unusual-amount-of-rainfall-this-year/articleshow/87495733.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Lucknow||Appointments in government being done without ‘sifarish’, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Asserting that his government is committed to ensuring a clean system of governance, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said new recruitments in different departments are being done without any ‘ sifarish’ (recommendation) and discrimination. Addressing a programme for distribution of appointment letters to assistant engineers in the housing and urban planning department, Yogi said, “The government is keeping a close vigil on the state public service commission and selection boards while allowing them to work independently.” “This has ensured complete transparency in the overall recruitment process,” he added. Of the total 46 newly-appointed assistant engineers, the CM gave letters to 33 of them. They will be deputed in 29 development authorities and other associated utilities of the housing department. The CM said that the newly-appointed engineers were from different districts and various backgrounds. He maintained that 4.5 lakh recruitments in different departments in the last fourand-a-half years were done in a “transparent” manner and nobody could raise a finger at even a single appointment. Cautioning the newly-appointed engineers not to indulge in corruption, Yogi referred to his government’s decisions of getting corrupt officials arrested and dismissed from service or giving them forced retirement. He said the state was poised to become the country’s biggest economy if government employees worked in a transparent manner. Yogi said his government brought in changes in various development authorities from where a large number of complaints had been originating. “That could have been done under the previous governments but they were only interested in corrupt practices and were not working for people’s welfare,” he said, adding that a “corrupt system” was bringing “infamy” to the state government. The CM claimed that the number of youth who got employment during his tenure were many times higher than those done between 2002 and 2017. “The state government expects the new appointees to work honestly and contribute in timely implementation of projects,” he said, while referring to Metro rail projects which are being overseen by the department of housing and urban planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-appointments-in-govt-being-done-without-sifarish/articleshow/87496423.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh hopes Diwali will end ‘misrule’ in UP||Lucknow: Extending his greetings on Dhanteras, Diwali and Govardhan Puja, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday wished people of the state safe, healthy and happy festivities. He said festivals of India shed light on the importance of harmony, peace, mutual cooperation and carry a message of love and amity. Akhikesh said all Indian festivals are an occasion to send a message of tranquillity and resolve to lead the society and the nation towards the light of prosperity. In an official release, the SP chief said the faulty policies of BJP has pushed the farmers, unemployed youths and poor people towards a bleak future and expressed confidence that Diwali — the festival of lights — will lighten up lilves of people and end misrule in the state. Earlier in the day, addressing party workers, Akhilesh attacked the ruling BJP for shifting goalposts and misleading the people .“The BJP has failed to fulfil the promises it had made in their Sankalp Patra (manifesto) like double the income of farmers, provide jobs to unemployed youths and laptops to students,” he said, adding: “Now they have started believing that 2022 assembly polls in UP are actually the elections that are slated to be held in 2024 and hence trying to mislead people.” He said farmers are feeling helpless as their paddy is lying unsold. Government has fixed Rs 1,940 per quintal for paddy but has not set-up enough procurement centres to purchase the produce of the farmers. As a result, farmers are compelled to sell their produce at much lower rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-hopes-diwali-will-end-misrule-in-up/articleshow/87496434.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Kalaben Delkar wins Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Shiv Sena's 1st Lok Sabha seat outside Maharashtra||MUMBAI: In its first ever Lok Sabha win outside Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena won the by-election to the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat on Tuesday. Kalaben Delkar, the widow of former MP Mohan Delkar, won the seat with a margin of 51,269 votes. Kalaben defeated BJP candidate Mahesh Gavit. Mohan was an independent MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli who committed suicide in Mumbai in February. Kalaben joined the Shiv Sena recently. She dedicated her victory to the people of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Kalaben polled 1,18,035 votes and Gavit bagged 66,766 votes. Voting for the seat, which is part of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, took place on October 30. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who was the one of the party’s key election managers, said this was the Sena’s first step outside Maharashtra. “First step outside Maharashtra, giant leap towards Delhi via Dadra Nagar Haveli!” he tweeted soon after the results along with the photo of his with chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. The Sena had made the contest a prestige issue and decided to take the BJP head-on. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray last week urged voters to end the BJP “dictatorship”. While the Shiv Sena has contested many elections outside Maharashtra, it has never won a Lok Sabha constituency outside the state. With this by-election victory, the Shiv Sena now has 19 MPs in the Lok Sabha. “Heartiest congratulations to Smt Kalaben Delkar ji, Shiv Sena’s newly elected Member of Parliament to the Lok Sabha from Dadra & Nagar Haveli. I humbly thank all the karyakartas for their efforts and the citizens for their faith to ensure this huge win. A special mention for the resolve of Smt Kalaben Delkar ji to contest the elections and win so as to give voice to her constituency. And of-course to Sanjay Raut ji’s efforts with Anil Desai ji, Abhinav Delkar and all those who campaigned for the Shiv Sena in the elections,” Aaditya Thackeray tweeted. Mohan Delkar, a seven-time MP, was found dead inside a room at Hotel Sea Green South in Marine Drive on February 22. The police said he had ended his life by hanging himself from the ceiling fan, and had also left behind a 14-page suicide note accusing government officials and others of forcing him to take the drastic step. There was a buzz that Kalaben or her son, Abhinav, would contest the by-election on a BJP ticket. But the two joined the Shiv Sena, which made its first foray in the union territory. Raut had played a key role in getting them into the Shiv Sena. Mohan Delkar had won six consecutive elections from the constituency between 1989 and 2009. He won the 1989, 1991 and 1996 elections as a Congress candidate and the 1998 election with the BJP. He won the 1999 and 2004 elections as an independent and a BNP candidate. He rejoined the Congress and unsuccessfully contested in 2009 and 2014. He won the seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as an independent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delkar-wins-dadra-sena-1st-ls-seat-outside-state/articleshow/87495737.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Goa||Tourists get bail in Anjuna parking attendant’s death||Panaji: While granting bail to five tourists from Karnataka in the death of Sagar Naik, a parking attendant, a Mapusa court observed that the deceased and his associates were the aggressors. “From a perusal of CCTV footage it appears more that the applicants (tourists) herein were defending themselves against the assault by the victim and his associates. The fact that the chronic heart condition of the deceased was precipitated by his assault on the applicants and their family members, cannot be held against the applicants,” the court held. The court stated there was nothing in the say of the investigating officer to directly implicate any of the tourists in Naik’s death apart from the fact that they were involved in a scuffle with the deceased. “I find that the footage corroborates the complaint of Manjula Subramanya, wherein she is seen pleading by holding the legs of one of the assailants, who were mercilessly beating her family members and the applicants herein with ribs, danda and sticks, slaps, fist blows and kicks,” the court held. Merely because the postmortem report indicates that the cause of death of Naik was “acute myocardial infarction as a result of chronic occlusive coronary artery disease precipitated due to stimulation of the autonomic nervous system in a person with simple body surface injuries,” that cannot mean that the applicants had caused the death, the court stated. Advocate Manguirish Usgaonkar, representing the tourists, submitted that they stopped their vehicle on the side of the road near the chapel on their way to Anjuna beach to check a diesel leak and while tightening the diesel pipe, a car driver started shouting at them to move their vehicle ahead when one of the tourists asked him to wait five minutes. It was submitted to the court that the driver became furious and began assaulting one of the tourists, Varun, with a wooden stick and then with his screwdriver which he snatched from him. The public intervened and the car driver said he would “show them when they go to the parking area”. At the parking area the man was there again and began assaulting them with a wooden stick. On seeing this incident, all of the tourists alighted from the vehicle. However, another 7 to 8 persons joined them and began assaulting the applicants with wooden sticks, slaps, kicks and fist blows. One of the women held the legs of the car driver pleading with him not to assault them, it was submitted to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourists-get-bail-in-anjuna-parking-attendants-death/articleshow/87495738.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Lucknow||Ayodhya all set to witness another glittering Diwali||LUCKNOW: A day before the celebration of Diwali in the form of Deepotsav in Ayodhya, the temple town was buzzing with excitement and anticipation on Tuesday. More than 12,000 volunteers spent the day decorating the ghats of the Saryu river with nine lakh diyas which will be lit on Chhoti Diwali on Wednesday in an attempt to break the previous record of six lakh diyas illuminated last year. On Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Governor Anandiben Patel, Union minister for culture and tourism GK Reddy and several other ministers and seers will welcome actors playing the role of Ram, Sita and Laxman as they returned to Ayodhya after the end of 14 years exile. An official from the UP tourism department said the actors will arrive in a chopper symbolising the Pushpak Viman and then travel by chariots to the main venue where their ‘rajya abhishek’ will be done by the dignitaries. The event will conclude with the lighting of diyas along the ghats and across the city, followed by a laser show and cultural programmes, the official said. A massive cleanliness drive started in Ayodhya early on Tuesday where major roads like the one in front of Hamumangarhi and the ghats were cleaned up, followed by a procession by jhankis or tableaus in which people dressed as characters from the Ramayan were travelling. Most of the city was barricaded by early morning and a huge police presence ensured a slightly tense atmosphere. On the ghats, around 12,000 volunteers, including students from 15 degree colleges, five inter colleges, 44 NGOs and 35 departments of the university, placed diyas and drew rangoli. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dispatched diyas made of cow dung for Ayodhya which will also be lit. On Wednesday, the volunteers will place the cotton wicks and oil in the diyas and have them ready for the Deepotsav at 6.15pm,” said Professor Shailendra Verma, who was overseeing the arrangements. Local MLA Ved Prakash said that celebrations would be held at all major crossings in the city which would be lit up with diyas, lights and decorated with rangoli. Locals took up the work of organising programmes at the crossings with several hosting various cultural programmes on Tuesday. “For those who cannot visit the main celebrations on Wednesday, LED screens will be set up across the city to allow them to participate virtually,” he said. Tuesday, when a high volume of devotees is present in the city to pray at the Hanumangarhi temple, saw a massive rush on the road outside. Most residents were excited about Wednesday and also relieved at the return of visitors post Covid. “We had celebrated Deepotsav last year too but it was just after the first wave of Covid and there were fewer people then. Since then, the second wave also hit us and business has been affected massively. It is such a relief seeing people return, especially now that construction of the Ram Temple is also starting,” said Arun Gupta, a sweetshop owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-all-set-to-witness-another-glittering-diwali/articleshow/87496440.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cong retains its bastion Deglur||Aurangabad: Congress candidate Jitesh Antapurkar registered a thumping win by a margin of 41,933 votes against Subhash Sabne of BJP in the byelection for Deglur assembly seat from Nanded district on Tuesday. BJP was hoping to repeat its win in Pandharpur against the MVA. Jitesh, the son of deceased sitting Congress MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar, secured 1,08,840 votes compared to the 66,907 votes garnered by Sabne. Uttam Ingole of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) bagged 11,348 votes for the third place. Jitesh, a 30-year-old civil engineer, benefited from a sympathy wave after the death of his father of Covid-19 complications on April 9. “My victory margin underlines how much people of Deglur loved my father. With the baton getting passed on to me now, I will fulfil my father’s dream of developing the constituency and addressing public issues,” he said. Sabne, a former Shiv Sena MLA, had lost to Raosaheb Antapurkar in the 2019 assembly election from Deglur by over 22,000 votes. The swelling of the margin this election was evidence of the sympathy factor in favour of the Antapurkars, said observers. Jitesh’s election was fought under the leadership of former chief minister Ashok Chavan and saw the MVA partners keeping the BJP at bay. Chavan, who had to step down as chief minister in 2010, was written off by many after his defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The outcome of Deglur has now cemented his clout in Nanded. Chavan credited the MVA partners for the success. “People of Deglur have offered tribute to late Antapurkar by making Congress victorious. The opposition is taking efforts to dislodge the MVA government, but mandate given by voters shows that people are against BJP,” he said. Chavan said he got a congratulatory call from CM Uddhav Thackeray. “I, too, congratulated him for Sena’s success in Lok Sabha bypoll for Dadra and Nagar Haveli,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cong-retains-its-bastion-deglur/articleshow/87495752.cms||Prasad Joshi

He was speaking at a function held at Gaondongrim panchayat to allot grass cutters to 40 beneficiaries from Gaondongrim and Cotigao. Zonal agriculture office, Canacona, has procured 40 grass cutters through a 90% subsidy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. A grass cutter cost Rs 30,000, but under the scheme, the beneficiaries will have to pay only Rs 3,000 each. Earlier, a beneficiary had to pay the entire cost of the equipment and the government would reimburse later. Now, a beneficiary is required to pay only 10%of the machine cost while the government pays the balance amount to the seller, an agriculture officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/40-canacona-ryots-get-grass-cutters-at-90-subsidy/articleshow/87495745.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Two-time SP MLA Subhash Pasi defects to BJP; SP sacks legislator, wife||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party MLA from Saidpur reserved seat in Ghazipur, Subhash Pasi, switched over BJP on Tuesday, in what came as a shot in the arm for the saffron party. It was also in a way a revenge on the Akhilesh Yadav-led outfit which inducted BJP's MLA from Siapur Sadar, Rajesh Rathore, a few days ago. The SP was quick to expel Pasi from the party on charges of "anti-party activities". Pasi and his wife Rina, who was the national general secretary of the Samajwadi Party Mahila Sabha, joined the BJP at the party headquarters in Lucknow in the presence of state unit chief Swatantra Dev Singh. Samajwadi Party MLA Subhash Pasi joined BJP in the presence of BJP President Swatantra Dev Singh in Lucknow on TuesdayPasi's joining will surely strengthen the party," Singh said. Around a dozen district-level functionaries from Mayawati's BSP in Unnao, too, joined the BJP. Speculations have been rife about Pasi's defection to BJP after his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi and then CM Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. With a business in Mumbai, Subhash happens to be originally from Malviya Nagar Nagar Panchayat in Saidpur. His wife Reena Pasi has also been the chairperson of Ghazipur Zila Panchayat. Pasi has cut his teeth in politics in Mumbai when he joined Congress and worked with the party MPs Sunil Dutt and Priya Dutt's election campaign teams. It was Congress which sent him to UP to contest the assembly election from Saidpur in 2007. But he lost and by next elections in 2012, had joined the SP. He won the 2012 and 2017 polls on the SP ticket. UP BJP president categoric lly flayed the opposition of denting the identity of India. "They were afraid of going to the temple and sporting a 'tilak' just for the sake of a vote bank through minority appeasement," he said. Singh categorically slammed the Akhilesh for his comment comparing Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder MA Jinnah with Vallabhbbhai Patel. Subhash is considered to wield significant influence among non-Jatav Dalits and other backward castes in and around Ghazipur. Political analysts consider him a good catch for the BJP after SBSP chief OP Rajbhar desereted the NDA ranks to join hands with the SP. Even at the peak of the saffron wave in the 2017 UP assembly elections, Pasi had defeated BJP candidate Vidya Sagar Sonkar by a margin of nearly 9,000 votes. Sonkar, who is currently BJP MLC, had been elected to Lok Sabha from Saidpur seat in 1996. Pasi had won the Saidpur assembly seat in 2012 assembly elections, when SP had stormed to power with an absolute majority first time. Saidpur seat was not a reserved seat before 2012. In 2007 assembly elections, BSP's Dinanath Pandey had defeated BJP's Mahendra Nath Pandey, Chandauli MP and Union minister for heavy industries. Pandey, a native of Ghazipur, had won the Saidpur seat twice in 1991 and 1996. SP inducted rebel BSP leaders Indrajeet Saroj and RK Chaudhary, both Pasis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-time-sp-mla-pasi-defects-to-bjp-sp-sacks-legislator-wife/articleshow/87496450.cms||Pankaj Shah

Chandrasekhar, Paul and eight others were chargesheeted under MCOCA, apart from IPC sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy, extortion, cheating and forgery. MCOCA was invoked against Joel, Deepak, Pradeep, Dharam Singh Meena, Avtar Singh, Kamlesh Kothari, Arun Muthu and Mohan Raj. The three accused against whom MCOCA was not invoked were Avinash Kumar, DS Batra and the manager of RBL Bank, Connaught Place Branch, Komal Poddar. On August 10, TOI was the first to report the biggest-ever extortion case in Delhi in terms of the amount of money and Chandrasekhar’s arrest in the case. It was also the first to report the enforcement directorate (ED) starting a parallel probe. On August 23, ED had seized 16 high-end cars, a luxurious beachfront bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and 2kg of gold. After Chandrasekhar was arrested from Rohini jail along with two others, EOW arrested Poddar and two of his associates, Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula, for allegedly facilitating and laundering money. The next to be arrested were jail officials. Last month, Hawala Avtar Singh alias Dolly Kochar was arrested by EOW after it emerged that he had laundered over Rs 100 crore of the siphoned off money. Singh was an associate of another suspect named Deepak Ramnani already arrested in the case. Ramnani laundered the money for Chandrasekhar for a 7% commission through Singh, police said in the chargesheet. The money was laundered in cash and through shell companies in Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, apart from Hong Kong and other foreign locations. In July, Special Cell of Delhi Police filed an FIR on the complaint given by the wife of a billionaire businessman, who was in jail. In her complaint, the victim said she had received a call in June last year wherein the caller introduced himself as a secretary in the Union ministry of law and proposed to help her in securing bail for her husband. This person demanded Rs 200 crore for getting the work done and conveyed the modalities regarding delivery of money. However, the victim realised that she had been duped as her husband didn’t get any legal relief. When she refused to pay up, she was threatened with dire consequences and made to cough up more cash. The conman was using number spoofing through an app called “Crazy Call” to impersonate high-ranking government officials. Chandrasekhar would call the targets to strike deals and the victims would see the numbers on the screen as desired by him. In one of the last calls to a victim, he had impersonated the law secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conman-12-others-charged-in-rs-200-crore-extortion-case/articleshow/87495755.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: CCTV shows child not molested, but hurt in fall, say cops||HYDERABAD: Soon after the family of an 18-month-old girl alleged that she was sexually assaulted in Golconda area on Monday night while playing, police verified CCTV footage and ruled out sexual assault. Joint commissioner AR Srinivas confirmed there was no sexual assault and that they have initiated steps to close the case after informing the family of the girl. Golconda police registered a case earlier after the girl’s grandmother filed a complaint. The family members alleged that she was sexually assaulted by an unidentified person while playing in the neighbourhood. Police immediately swung into action and verified the CCTV footage in the area. Police found out that while playing on a scooter parked near her house, the girl fell on the open foot rest and sustained an injury. On Monday night, the toddler went towards the neighbouring house of her maternal uncle to play with other children. A little later, her grandmother found her crying in the lane near their house. As the girl had some injuries on her private parts, her parents shifted her to a nearby private hospital for treatment. She was later referred to Niloufer Children’s Hospital. “We received information from the hospital authorities about the injured girl. Based on the complaint of the grandmother, we registered a case under relevant sections of law,” Golconda inspector K Chandrasekhar Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-cctv-shows-child-not-molested-but-hurt-in-fall-say-cops/articleshow/87495751.cms||---

---||Goa||Activists red flag changes to forest conservation act||Panaji: Central government’s proposed amendments to the Forest (conservation) Act (FCA), 1980, including a one-time relaxation for 250sqm residential units in private forests, has triggered indignation among citizens and environmentalists who fear further fragmentation of the green zones. The Union environment ministry had notified a letter dated October 2 with an attached consultation paper (CP) for proposed changes seeking public comments and suggestions up to November 1. The process of identifying forest areas under private ownership has a long history. In an order dated December 12, 1996, the Supreme Court had directed that all states identify areas of private forests and demarcate them for protection. Nearly 25 years later, the state has dragged its feet over executing the order. The delay — activists view it as deliberate — in demarcation of an estimated 200sqkm of private forest areas has emboldened owners to strip large swathes of such land over the years. Various government-appointed committees have identified areas of private forests, but process of verification and demarcation has been slow and many areas have been left out, activists alleged. The ministry has observed that the FCA’s applicability by courts to private land has caused “resentment and resistance” among these owners. “Identification of such land is subjective and arbitrary to some extent,” the CP notes. Through an amendment, the ministry seeks to define the scope of application of the act in an objective manner. Environmentalists have not taken kindly to the ministry’s criticism on the private forests issue. “The ministry’s observation is shocking, as it is the apex court that had issued the order. The criticism can only be at the behest of speculative interests bent upon destroying forests for short-term gains while local communities protect the forests,” Abhijit Prabhudesai of Rainbow Warriorssaid. Others point out that state governments have set up expert committees and worked out criteria for identification of private forests. “These criteria are quite verifiable. In Goa, for example, plots of minimum of 5ha in private lands with natural vegetation, canopy density of 40% and above, and 75% of forestry species are identified as private forests,” Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation stated. The Centre’s proposal to allow construction of structures for bona fide purposes, including “forest protection measures” and “residential units” is viewed as a move to remove private forests from the FCA’s ambit. “FCA cannot be diluted to enable private profit at the cost of forests,” Prabhudesai said. The proposal will open the floodgates to partitioning of land, which private parties are adept at, Goa Foundation stated in its memorandum. “It is vague. 250sqm of what area? 1,000 sqm? One or 10 hectares? Impact would differ,” Alvares said. The amendments are against the spirit of SC’s decision, which apply the meaning of forest under FCA to any area recorded as forest in government records, regardless of ownership. “The amendments are also in violation of SC’s December 1996 order,” Avertino Miranda of Goa Green Brigade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/activists-red-flag-changes-to-forest-conservation-act/articleshow/87495758.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Delhi||JNU VC can’t appoint chairpersons, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has stepped in to restrain nine chairpersons appointed by the vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) from taking any major decisions or carrying out selections concerning the university’s centres. “We are (prima facie) of the view that respondent no 2 (VC) is not vested with the power to appoint chairpersons of centres/special centres. The statute confers the power of appointment on the executive council. Thus, clearly the appointment of chairpersons of centres/special centres by VC is, as is evident at this stage, without authority,” a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh observed in a recent order. It was hearing a plea by one of the professors, Atul Sood, challenging the approval granted by the executive council to the nine appointments made by the VC, after the latter took a decision. Sood maintained that the VC has no authority to carry out such appointments and take approval later from the EC. Seeing merit in the petition, the court noted that a “plain reading” of the provision related to JNU’s governance would show that the power to appoint chairpersons of centres/special centres is “expressly conferred upon the executive council, and not VC”. The court elaborated that “the VC can exercise the powers, where immediate action is required on account of an emergent situation, which then is reported to the concerned authority (authority which would have dealt with matter in the ordinary course) for obtaining its approval.” But when JNU's standing counsel Monika Arora the VC claimed these appointments were under the “emergent situation” category the bench found the argument “tenuous” and gave an interim order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-vc-cant-appoint-chairpersons-says-hc/articleshow/87495769.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||‘Important cog,’ says ED, gets Anil Deshmukh custody till November 6||MUMBAI: A few hours after the post-midnight arrest of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh (72), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) produced him before a special holiday court on Tuesday, stating he was the key person in the Rs 100 crore money laundering case and the agency needed to investigate a “foreign angle” in the case apart from establishing the money trail. The court remanded Deshmukh (72) in ED custody till November 6. The ED said Deshmukh has emerged as “the important cog in the wheel” and that he was the “prime beneficiary of the proceeds of crime.” The ED said his sustained interrogation is required to get to the bottom of nefarious deals entered into by the accused through a complex web of companies. Deshmukh was produced in court at 12.30 pm. Opposing Deshmukh’s custody, his lawyer Vikram Choudhari told the court his client’s shoulder is dislocated and he needs constant support. He said Deshmukh had recovered from Covid in February, has a heart ailment and is suffering from hypertension. The court allowed his plea for home food and medicine during ED custody, advocate Aniket Nikam said. They denied Deshmukh had not co-operated with investigations. The ED’s remand said that with help of close associates, the Deshmukh family was indirectly controlling and managing business activities in various companies and laundering money by creating a complex web of transactions. The ED cited three instances to explain his modus operandi to convert unaccounted cash he received via illegal means into legitimate money through suspicious companies. “These entities appear a vehicle for conversion for cash into cheques through these benami transactions,” the ED’s remand plea submitted and argued by ASG Anil Singh said. The ED sought Deshmukh’s 14-day custody. The defence said those who made allegations are themselves embroiled in multiple cases and one person is nowhere to be found. The ED said in spite of summoning him several times, Deshmukh had never appeared.The media was not allowed entry into the court room due to “overcrowding”, the judge noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/important-cog-says-ed-gets-anil-deshmukh-custody-till-november-6/articleshow/87497376.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||Delay in communication of bail orders should be addressed on war footing: Justice Chandrachud||Prayagraj: Supreme Court Judge, Justice DY Chandrachud, said here on Tuesday that the delay in the communication of bail orders should be addressed on war footing because this touches upon human liberty of every undertrial or even a convict who has got suspension of sentence under the law. Justice Chandrachud was speaking at the inauguration of virtual courts and e-sewa kendra at Allahabad high court and district court on Monday through virtual mode. Justice Chandrachud is the chairperson of the e-committee of the Supreme Court. He further pointed out one of the initiatives, which Chief Justice S Muralidhar has launched at the Orissa high court, is the e-custody certificate, so that every undertrial and every convict who is undergoing the sentence of imprisonment would have an e-custody certificate tagged to them. “That certificate will give us all the requisite data with regard to that particular undertrial or convict, right from initial remand to the subsequent progress of each case. This will also help us in ensuring that bail orders are communicated as soon as they are made, from the place they are communicated, to the jails for immediate implementation,” he said. In the Aryan Khan case, his release from the prison was delayed after HC granted him bail as surety formalities took additional time. While explaining importance of the e-seva kendras, Justice Chandrachud that it would provide under one roof all services, which we provide under the e-courts project, accessible in every establishment of the district judiciary so that lawyers, litigants who seek to find information can easily avail of those services, whether it is providing certified copy or e-payment of court fees or e-filing or video-conferencing. While explaining the importance of virtual courts, he said, “The virtual court is equally a matter of utmost importance. To give you an example, virtual courts have now been set up across the country in 12 states for adjudicating traffic challans. Across the country, 99.43 lakh cases have been completed. Fines have been collected for 18.35 lakh cases. Total fine collected is over 119 crores of rupees. About 98,000 violators chose to contest the case”. “Now you can imagine that for a common citizen who has a traffic challan, to spend a day away from daily wages and to go to court to pay for the traffic challan is not productive. On the other hand, if virtual courts are dovetailed with a nationalised bank where challans can be paid electronically, it is a win-win situation for the citizen. It is extremely productive for the court. Those judges, who were dealing with this work till now will deal with other cases also, where their involvement is really required and not these ministerial cases, which are really a waste of time for the judge and which can be easily done with the use of technology”, he continued. “More than 2.95 crore criminal cases are pending in the district judiciary of the country of which 77.5% cases are more than one year old. Many criminal cases are pending as the accused remain absconding for years. For example, the oldest sessions court case in UP where the accused is absconding is sessions trial 64 of 1976 at Gorakhpur! We know as judges that the major reasons for delay in disposal of criminal cases is the fact that the accused remain absconding, particularly after bail is granted, and secondly, due to non-appearance of official witnesses during the course of the criminal trial for recording evidence. We can use information and communications technology here also. This is what we are working on presently in the E committee of the Supreme Court”, Justice Chandrachud shared. “Second, as regards the absence of official witnesses, I think we have to make a beginning where at least the testimony of official witnesses is recorded in all criminal trials across the board, unless the judge thinks otherwise, through video-conferencing platform. Taking these baby steps would go a long way in assuaging some of the concerns which we have today”, told Justice Chandrachud. “This is a very exciting time we are living in, a time for change, gives us a real opportunity to change our system”, asserted Justice Chandrachud. Others present on this occasion were Chief Justice of Allahabad high court Rajesh Bindal, Justice SP Kesarwani, the chairman of Computerization of Digitigation Committee of Allahabad HC and other members of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delay-in-communication-of-bail-orders-should-be-addressed-on-war-footing-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/87496457.cms||---

It also caused landslip at Thorad Mala, Kurumboyil near Balussery where a house was damaged. Heavy rain also led to waterlogging at Adivaram town and low-lying areas at Kuttiady, Kavilumpara and Kayakkodi. The waterlogging at Adivaram town caused traffic disruptions on Kozhikode-Wayanad national highway for an hour in the afternoon. The landslide at Velluvankunnu dumped rocks and soil along with some trees on Kuttiady Ghat road (Thottilpalam-Wayanad road) at 4pm. Water gushed through the road and a surge in Poothampara River caused waterlogging in many houses along its banks. Ten families were shifted to a relief camp at Poothampara School. Several vehicles were stranded on the Ghat road for hours. Traffic on Ghat road was partially restored around 7pm. But, collector N Tej Lohit Reddy has issued orders banning non-essential vehicular traffic on Thottilpalam-Wayanad road at night. According to officials, the bitumen tarring of the Ghat road was damaged at many places and there are chances of rocks and trees falling onto the road if the rain persisted. The heavy rains at Thamarassery Ghat caused water logging at houses in Adivaram and Pottikai and houses along the banks of the river in the afternoon. The landslip at Thorad Mala damaged the house of Jamalidheen at Ward 2 of Panangad grama panchayat. The nearby areas also witnessed flash floods. Kozhikode administration urged people, especially those in hilly areas, to exercise a vigil following the continuous heavy rain and the orange alert sounded for the district on Wednesday and Thursday.

However, cases of children suffering from viral fever and dengue-like symptoms continue to surface. In the last three months, over 5000 dengue cases have been reported in Firozabad. According to the college authorities, the special OPD for children has been shut down due to staff crunch. The cases of viral fever and dengue started increasing in Firozabad in August. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Firozabad on August 30 to take stock of the situation. He ordered for sending teams of health department officials, doctors and para medical staffers from other districts for better treatment of the patients and containment of the vector-borne diseases. Health department on the local level had also hired doctors on a two-month contract. With an increasing number of fatalities among children, the Firozabad medical college had set up a special OPD for children in the new building premises. The initiative brought much relief for the parents suffering at the government hospital for treatment of children. On October 31, the contract of 30 doctors ended. Besides, doctors sent from other districts had returned to their duty stations earlier this month. Following staff crunch, the medical college administration closed the special pediatric OPD on Monday. Firozabad medical college principal Dr Sangeeta Aneja said, “Doctors from other districts have returned and the contract of staff hired at local level has also ended. Arrangements have been made to treat patients with the staff available at present. The pediatric OPD started in September has been closed as the number of cases have declined. Regular OPD is being organised at room number 36 of the 100-bed hospital."

The ayurveda doctors have already been treating category A patients in Ayurveda hospitals and Ayur Raksha clinics. The order issued by health secretary Rajan Khobragade said that an action plan outlining approved Ayurveda strategies for preventing, mitigating and rehabilitating Covid-19 has been revised to incorporate category B Covid patients under isolation at home/common first line treatment centre or district Covid care centres. The order categorically states that severe patients with ‘red flag signs’ and other serious symptoms (category C) as notified by the health department are not to be treated under Ayurveda medication. The treatment choice shall be decided by the patient by giving their written consent. The treatment shall be imparted in the respective system of medical institutions and treating doctors shall do the treatment management of patients. The orders are in the light of the guidelines issued by the Ayush ministry which have been outlined in the national clinical management protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga. The health department had asked the state ayurveda Covid response cell (SACRC) to submit its recommendations based on which the new order has been issued. As on date, the category A patients are being treated under Bheshajam protocol for treatment of mild Covid symptoms. Doctors under the Ayush department have categorised treatment in the Ayur Raksha clinics. Sukhayushyam (preventive medicine for above 60), Amritham (quarantine patients, Bheshajam (Covid category A) and Punarjani (post-Covid health issues) are the main treatment methods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ayurveda-doctors-can-now-treat-covid-category-b-patients/articleshow/87495804.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Poll star Sanjat Raut rises as Shiv Sena wins Dadra, Nagar Haveli LS bypoll||MUMBAI: He is known as a fiery spokesperson and an ace editor, and now Sanjat Raut has earned a name as a master poll strategist too. After the Shiv Sena win in the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha by-election, Raut has cemented his place as the face of the Sena outside the state. “First step outside Maharashtra, giant leap towards Delhi via Dadra Nagar Haveli!” Raut tweeted soon after the results along with a photo of his with CM and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. Insiders say Raut scripted the bypoll win, right from getting the widow and son of deceased MP Mohan Delkar into the Sena to planning the poll campaign. The past few years, Raut has been a key networking player for the Sena in New Delhi. He has pushed the Sena’s view in not just Parliament but also meetings with opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee, among others. From organising Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya to leading the party campaign in Goa and Karnataka, he has been pushing the Sena to spread outside the state. Sena seniors credit Raut for Kalaben Delkar’s win. They say that though there was buzz that Kalaben or her son, Abhinav, would contest on a BJP ticket, the two finally joined the Sena, which made its first foray in the union territory. Raut played a key role in their joining the Shiv Sena. “We had tried very hard to go beyond Maharashtra and we needed one win. This is the biggest win in the history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli as the margin is over 50,000,” Raut said. The Saamna executive editor was a key architect of the MVA government in November 2019. His daily press conferences and acerbic attacks on the BJP were appreciated by not just the Sena but the NCP too. “Sanjay Raut has been in form since the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections results. For all practical purposes he was the architect and face of the MVA till the government was formed. Even after that he is the strongest anti-BJP voice in the MVA. While he was always a good orator, writer and sharp spokesperson, he was not an electioneer. But with the Dadra and Nagar Haveli win, he has now proved himself as a poll strategist,” an observer said. Raut was camping in Dadra and Nagar Haveli for weeks prior to the polls. While environment minister Aaditya Thackeray congratulated Kalaben, he made a special mention for Raut in a tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-poll-star-raut-rises-as-sena-looks-north/articleshow/87495800.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The society said 241 students might get admission in MBBS course. Of them, 48 students had secured more than 500 marks in NEET. “I am thrilled beyond words at the thought of becoming a doctor,” said D Spandana, who bagged all-India 949 rank in the SC Category. Another student, S Archana, who secured all-India 1021 rank in the SC category, said that her uncle’s death due to blood cancer motivated her to become a doctor. “My father’s brother died of blood cancer because we couldn’t afford to provide the required treatment to him due to abject poverty. It was a very painful experience for a poor family like us. I will specialise in oncology and help the needy poor cancer patients,” she added. TSWREIS secretary Ronald Rose said that while 135social welfare students joined the MBBS course last year, this year 241 students were likely to get admission in MBBS and many more students might get BDS seats as well. “What social welfare residential students achieved is not an ordinary feat given their humble family backgrounds,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/241-social-welfare-students-likely-to-bag-mbbs-seats/articleshow/87495784.cms||---
---||Agra||Family meets trio jailed for allegedly cheering Pak win in T-20 sedition case||Agra: After spending over a week under anxiety and stress, a family member of one of the three students from Kashmir, who were arrested on charges of sedition for allegedly cheering Pakistan’s win over India in a recent T-20 World Cup match, finally met the trio in Agra's central jail on Monday. The meeting, which lasted over one-and-a-half hours, was described by the 22-year-old student’s uncle as “satisfying”. Talking to TOI, the uncle said, “It was difficult to see him and his friends behind bars, but we were relieved after talking to all of them and knowing that they were not being tortured.” “We were apprehensive of the general animosity that existed against our children, as they were attacked by lawyers and members of a right-wing organisation in the court after their arrests and even lawyers in Agra had refused to take up their cases,” said the uncle, adding that his nephew had told him that they were being “treated well” in the jail. The family members of the two other students also arrived in Agra on Tuesday and are expected to meet them soon after getting their Covid-negative test reports. Superintendent of Agra district jail, P D Salonia, said, “We are taking care of the security of the undertrial students and are not involving them in any work in order to restrict their movement and interaction with other inmates.” He told TOI that undertrial prisoners can voluntarily do work and earn wages, but in this particular case, the three are not allowed to do so because of security reasons. The students have been allowed to wear their own clothes, as jail uniforms are only for convicted prisoners. All three had received their clothes yesterday through a relative of one of the students, said jail authorities. The student’s uncle said that the trio had signed their 'vakalatnamas' on Monday and the same had been handed over to their lawyer, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi. He is also fighting the case of 26-year-old PhD scholar Atiq-ur Rehman, alongside two others -- Masood Ahmad and Mohammad Alam. The three, along with journalist Siddique Kappan, were arrested while going to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit rape and murder victim in Hathras and were slapped with charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act. Chaturvedi told TOI that he will file an application in court on Wednesday for legal remedies in the matter. “The charges imposed against the civil engineering students do not have merit as the three did not raise any anti-national slogans. The college authorities also denied such allegations and the Whatsapp chat was not a group chat. It was a personal chat,” he said, adding that sedition charges were added only after the office of the chief minister tweeted, and not at the time of registering the FIR. The students deserve a fair trial, the lawyer said. TOI had earlier reported that B S Kushwaha, director (academics) at RBS Engineering Technical Institute, where the students studied, had said that the students — two of whom are aged 20 and the other 21 — did not shout pro-Pakistan slogans. The college had, however, suspended the students, reacting to allegations that they had said and posted things favouring Pakistan on social media. The student's uncle told TOI that the three were worried about their career. “They were stressed about their future and I was unable to assure them anything at this moment,” he said, adding that he was scared of how their family will be “judged” by others once he returns to Kashmir. “His family is expecting that I will get him back with me, but that’s not going to happen,” he said. The three, studying under the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme for J&K students, were booked on October 26 under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity) and 505 (1)(B) (intent to cause fear to the public), along with section 66-F of the Information Technology Act (cyber terrorism, which is an offence punishable with life sentence) for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans and sending similar WhatsApp messages. A day later, charges of sedition were added to the FIR,based on a complaint filed by a BJP youth worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/family-meets-trio-jailed-for-allegedly-cheering-pak-win-in-t-20-sedition-case/articleshow/87494968.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to the complaint, Chandan Singh said his pregnant wife Deepa (33) had been admitted to Vasundhara Hospital & Fertility Research Centre on Monday for delivery. “The hospital staff earlier said everything was normal and she had to deliver twins.

But some 10-15 minutes later, they said that both the children had died and the condition of Deepa was not fine either,” said the complaint. Singh said sometime later, he was given information about his wife’s death also with no satisfactory reason as to how and where the situation turned so fatal. He also cited the administration of wrong antibiotic injection by the medical staff to his wife, which turned out fatal for her. SHO Likhmaram said that the case has been filed on the complaint of victim’s husband and postmortem of the victim was done by a medical board.

Abdul Ishaam, 26, Safwan, 29, Mohammed Thousif, 30, Abdul Khader Sinan, 30, Mohammed Fazal, 32, Arshad, 34, and Mujahidur Rehaman, 23, were arrested in Mangaluru. Police seized 210 grams of gold including chains valued at Rs 10 lakh, as well as 7 two-wheelers. Cops are still looking for gold ornaments and more than five two-wheelers used by the accused. The accused are involved in 13 chain snatching cases, five attempted chain snatching cases, three bike theft cases, and two robbery cases reported at the police station limits of Bajpe, Mangaluru North, Barke, Kavoor, Urva, Mangaluru East, and Ullal. On Tuesday, city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that teams of nearly 60 police personnel, including ACPs of the Central and North sub-divisions PA Hegde and Mahesh Kumar, have been working diligently on these cases under the supervision of DCPs Hariram Shankar and BP Dinesh Kumar. A local mechanic is said to have trained the accused to steal locked two-wheelers that were parked. Obtaining CCTV footage was also difficult, and the majority of the offences were reported in the Kavoor, Malemar, Chilimbi, Dongerkery, Kadri, and Bejai areas. The arrest of one of the accused by Bajpe inspector Sandesh was crucial in the case. According to DCP (law and order) Hariram Shankar, the majority of the cases were reported after 7pm, and the accused used a number of tactics to avoid detection. Detailing, including mapping of areas where the offence was reported aided in detection, he said. Two more suspects are believed to be abroad. Meanwhile, preliminary investigations have revealed that the stolen gold was sold to three jewellery stores in Bantwal, and action will be taken against them by police. The commissioner also announced a cash prize for the team.  The accused have been charged with a variety of offences, including assault on police. Among them, Abdul Ishaam is charged in 21 cases, including 12 in connection with the anti-CAA protests. Abdul Khader Sinan is facing two charges: assault and rioting and the Arms Act violation. Meanwhile, Mohammed Thousif has been charged with violating the Arms Act, and Mohammed Fazal is a suspect in cases filed at the Bantwal rural, Mangaluru rural, and Kankanady town police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/seven-involved-in-24-cases-of-chain-snatching-robbery-arrested/articleshow/87494056.cms||---

When Britishers had thought that the struggle would be over after hanging three activists — Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev — lakhs of Indians disproved it by jumping into the struggle. We can still claim that three martyrs are alive in the hearts of crores of Indians,” he said.“We are planning on setting up a national martyrs’ book library and have appealed to the Union government to help with funds. If we don’t get required help, we will do it with the help of Bhagat Singh Brigade. We have preserved the jail diary authored by Bhagat Singh when he spent 116 days in jail and it’s published in English and Marathi. It has to be published in Kannada too,” he added. Sadashivanand Swami of Shivanand Math, Gadag said the Britishers hanged the trio a day prior to the schedule to avoid riots in the country. “However, their thought turned wrong as each and every youth of the country stood against them,” he added.Grandson of Veer Savarkar Satyaki Savarkar, MLC S V Sankanur and others were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/history-has-ignored-many-martyrs-bhagat-singhs-kin/articleshow/87494068.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The builder had filed a pre-arrest bail application, and Justice S P Tavade, vacation judge at the HC, on Monday said it appears that the court had not extended the interim order earlier, and that a bench had recused itself on October 27. The HC said the interim order has not been in force since October 18. Senior counsel Niteen Pradhan submitted that Punamiya was admitted in hospital and police are trying to arrest him. But Shekhar Jagtap, counsel appearing for the state, submitted that Punamiya was not in serious condition. He submitted medical papers dated October 29, which declared the patient fit for discharge. The HC said no efforts were made on Punamiya’s behalf to seek extension earlier and, hence, it opined that the order, which has already come to end, cannot be extended without any cause.

These students are enrolled in different courses and come from 90 self-financed private colleges. According to the university administration, these colleges have not deposited the examination fee collected from students to the varsity despite several notices . The examination controller of the university, A K Yadav, said, "Results will be declared only after these defaulter institutes clear their pending dues." Student organisation Samajwadi Chatra Sabha's leader Ravi Yadav said, "Colleges take examination fees from students at the time of admission. Withholding the results of students because these colleges didn't clear their dues is unfair. Strict action should be taken against owners of these private colleges." Former student union president of Agra University, Gaurav Sharma, said, "It is unjust to make students suffer for the malpractices of colleges. Affiliation of all such colleges should be cancelled and an FIR for cheating should be registered against the management of these institutes." According to student leaders, the Agra University administration has been unable to recover the examination fees from private colleges for the past several years. Convocation ceremonies have been conducted without issuing marksheets and degree certificates to all students. In 2016, the university's senior assistant professor, Satyendra Singh, was shot dead as he raised objections and made efforts to initiate strict action against university-affiliated private colleges for not depositing examination fees collected from the students||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/exam-fees-not-deposited-agra-univ-puts-results-of-32k-students-on-hold/articleshow/87494974.cms||Deepak Lavania

Chennai, too, recently received a dedicated pet crematorium. Suma Nayak, trustee of the Animal Care Trust (ACT), stated, “A few years ago, we demanded the a crematorium for pet and community animals under the Smart City Project. We recently requested that the MCC reserve land at an existing crematorium (Hindu Rudra Bhoomi) in Padav village. The land had also been inspected by officials. We only asked for about ten cents of land for the animal crematorium. We were pushing for this after a volunteer, Sujir Ganesh Nayak, offered to donate an eco-friendly cremation furnace for pets if the MCC identifies land and takes responsibility for maintaining it.” Suma explained that the furnace, which is gaining popularity in Kerala, is made out of coconut shells. Currently, most pets are buried in private properties, and a people living in flats end up handing over the remains to waste collectors. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the deputy commissioner, and other prominent officers in the district are all in favour of setting up an animal crematorium, she said, adding that they will take up the issue with deputy commissioner K V Rajendra and MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar. Mayor Premananda Shetty stated that the proposal was rejected because none of the members supported it. “However, this does not imply that we do not provide a dignified burial for animals. MCC officials have responded to calls on several occasions when people have reached out to them. People can contact the officials concerned for assistance with the burial of pets or community animals. We will ensure a respectful farewell,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mcc-rejects-crematorium-for-pets-activists-look-for-alternatives/articleshow/87494088.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

They are adamant they won’t celebrate the festival of lights without the CM as they light diyas in his name. CM Yogi has been celebrating Diwali with Vantangia people as MP from Gorakhpur and the head of Gorakshpeeth. While the villagers are decorating the village to welcome CM Yogi on the festival, the administration is also making preparations for the CM’s visit. “We are like Ahilya waiting for our ‘Ram’, Yogi Baba, for 100 years as good days have come for us. Today we are celebrating Diwali in jungle and all credit goes to Maharaj ji (CM Yogi),” said 70-year-old villager Chhotku. Another villager Ram Gulab, said, “In 2009 Yogi Baba dealt with a case for us as when he was constructing a temporary school (now Hindu Vidyapeeth). The school was termed as illegal by the forest department and an FIR was lodged against the work. In 2010, CM Yogi struggled for us and as soon as he became the CM , he gave revenue village status to our village. The development is not limited to Tinkonia number 3 but the change could be seen in 23 Vantangia villages in Gorakhpur-Maharajganj.” “In past 4.5 years, we now have houses, roads, power supply, water, school, street lights, Anganbadi center and RO water machine. 380 families have an Antyodaya card in the village of 4.5 hundred and 423 families got house and there are 458 personal toilets in the village. 600 people got a MGNREGA job card. People are getting the benefits of various schemes,” said the villager. Describing the history of the Vantangia community, Ashok Srivastav, educationist and social worker says, “Vantangia people are naked truth of years of suppression and exploitation in east UP region from Gorakhpur-Kushinagar to Lakhimpur Kheri. Around 100 years before independence, the British Government started using people for cleaning and developing forests, these people were called Tangya farmers and later a cult of Vantangia was developed. Due to neglect of previous governments, Vantangias became homeless and jobless and remained deprived of basic amenities, after independence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/all-credit-for-diwali-celebrations-in-jungle-goes-to-maharaj-ji/articleshow/87496502.cms||Arjumand Bano

The Vice-President inaugurated the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations on the theme of “spirit of freedom struggle: way forward”, organised by Damodaram Sanjivayya Law University in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday. Speaking on this occasion, Naidu said that the cost of the legal process should not become an impediment to the common man to access justice. “We need to find ways to address huge pendency and inordinate delays in court cases as timeliness is crucial to rendering justice. While fully leveraging alternative dispute redressal mechanisms, there is a need to avoid frequent adjournments of cases. Information Technology should also be optimally used to ensure speedier justice to the people,” said Naidu. “India has been a victim of invasions from the Greeks to the British. Several waves of invaders committed atrocities beyond description. The British traders started their business in a modest way with the imperial firman of the emperor Jahangir, authorising the East India Company to open depots. In the next 200 years, they colonised India and established their rule. As they say, the rest is history. The history of the loot and plunder which the British indulged in, can never be forgotten,” said Naidu. Naidu said that in the Vizag region, there were many stalwarts – from the great revolutionary Alluri Sita Rama Raju to Gouthu Latchanna. “They fought valiantly against the British,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/v-p-calls-to-make-justice-accessible/articleshow/87494984.cms||---

The results were announced on Tuesday. Chief minister Nitish Kumar congratulated both his party candidates on their victory. “People are supreme in a democracy,” he said. In Kusheshwar Asthan, Aman Bhushan Hazari defeated RJD’s Ganesh Bharti by 12,698 votes by garnering 59,409 votes against 46,891 polled by his nearest rival. The seat had fallen vacant after the death of Aman’s father Shashi Bhushan Hazari, who had won in 2020 by a smaller margin. Anju Devi of Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) finished third with 5,623 votes, ahead of Congress’s Atirek Kumar, who got 5,602 votes. Atirek is the son of former MLA Ashok Ram. In Tarapur, it was a tough fight between JD(U) candidate Rajeev Kumar Singh and RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah till the final round. But Rajeev defeated Arun with a margin of 3,821 votes by polling 78,966 votes against RJD nominee’s 75,45 votes. The Congress had fielded Rajesh Kumar Mishra, who polled only 3,670 votes and finished fourth after LJP(Ram Vilas) candidate Kumar Chandan, who got 5,350 votes. The bypoll in Tarapur was held following the death of JD(U) MLA Mewalal Choudhary. The RJD was desperate to wrest both the seats from NDA partner JD(U) and even ignored its ally Congress’s claim on Kusheshwar Asthan seat, which forced the grand old party to announce snapping of its ties with the party led by Lalu Prasad, who flew down from Delhi and campaigned in both the constituencies despite his poor health. Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who was camping in Darbhanga to monitor the counting of votes, told reporters that the JD(U) nominee got sympathy votes but he honours the people’s mandate. “We remained in the match till last over in Tarapur,” the former cricketer said. Referring to Kusheshwar Asthan, Tejashwi said RJD contested from there for the first time and performed well. The then Janata Dal had contested this seat in 1995. “Haar jeet to chunav mein hota rahta hai,” he asserted while emphasizing that the RJD was still the single largest party in the state with 75 MLAs. But Tejashwi’s elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav senior party leaders, including RJD state chief Jagadanand Singh and MLC Sunil Singh, for the defeat. Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras said the results proved that Lalu was no more a force in Bihar. In a veiled attack on Congress and his nephew Chirag Paswan, Paras said, “Neither Congress nor the Chirag-led faction of LJP was in the contest. People have voted for development,” he asserted. JD(U) minister Sanjay Jha said the people have reposed faith in CM Nitish’s good goverenance and development plank. JD(U) spokesperson Nikhil Mandal took a jibe at Tejashwi and tweeted, “Kuchh mitha ho jaye (let us have some sweets).” BJP minister Ram Surat Kumar said it’ time for Lalu to take rest at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-retains-kusheshwar-asthan-tarapur-assembly-seats/articleshow/87494987.cms||Ramashankar

The Hyderabad police has limited the timings for bursting firecrackers on Diwali between 8 pm and 10 pm. Notices have also been issued to all police personnel working under Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda police station limits to ensure this rule is adhered to. “If residents find anybody bursting banned firecrackers or not adhering to the permissible time-limit, they can contact the nearest police station and raise a complaint. We will take action against those violating the Supreme Court (SC) orders,” said A R Srinivas, deputy commissioner of police (west zone). In a meeting with firecracker sellers at the west zone office, cops also briefed them about the SC guidelines and the do’s and don’ts on selling of crackers. The SC had recently banned bursting of firecrackers saying it causes pollution. However, it later clarified that there is no blanket ban and only those containing Barium salts are prohibited. Following the apex court orders, the GHMC has permitted only green firecrackers within its limits. “On Diwali day, all deputy commissioners in various zones have been instructed to track the usage of banned firecrackers in their respective areas. Anybody found using banned firecrackers will face penalty as SC has strictly prohibited the sale and use of firecrackers,” said a GHMC official. Unlike the last few years, awareness among people about green crackers is higher this time, say traders who have observed a decent sale of over 50 per cent this year. “An increasing number of people are enquiring about green firecrackers. The demand is very high for sparklers and rockets. People aren’t too keen on buying fancy items or those producing very loud noise,” said Ramesh Rao, a trader from East Marredpally. he expects the sales to pick up over the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/civic-body-police-teams-to-act-tough-against-violators-of-firecracker-norms/articleshow/87495815.cms||---

Everyone is doing fantastic business with conversion rates (number of customers making purchases) going up to 90-95% this year as compared to the abysmal levels last year when people only made token purchases,” said Avinash Gupta, director, All India Gems & Jewellery Domestic Council. Jewellers pointed out that though last year Dhanteras spanned two days, the festive mood was missing as many negative factors like Covid-19, floods and high gold prices weighed heavily on customer sentiment. But this year, with rising vaccination numbers people have gained the confidence to come out and shop in large numbers, setting cash registers ringing again. This year customers began trooping in right from the weekend in the run-up to Dhanteras to pre-book their orders or even make purchases, said PK Siraj, regional manager, Malabar Gold. PMJ Jewellers chairman Kushal K Jain pointed out that for the last two years people had been putting off purchases due to the negative sentiments on account of Covid-19 and high gold prices but this year monsoon too has been good. Darshan Gupta, partner, Mangatrai Jewellers, said footfalls were very good as compared to last year. “Walk-ins were very good in the morning and evening, except the lull in the afternoon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dhanteras-glitters-as-customers-flock-jewellery-stores-again/articleshow/87495817.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Eve, who started playing cricket, was the captain of Ernakulam District Cricket Association Secretary’s XI girls’ team at that time and had been selected to Under-16 girls’ (U-16) state team selection camp. The only condition she put forward was that she should be able to play cricket in the UK and her father Joseph Varghese, an ex-Indian Navy officer, and mother Nisha Joseph, kept their promise by enrolling her at Luton Town & Indians Cricket Club in May. Over the last seven months, Eve played several matches for the U-13 teams in Cricket East comprising Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire counties. Her performance was rewarded as she became the first Malayali girl to be selected to Sunrisers Regional Emerging Player Programme, launched by England Cricket Board (ECB) to find young talents and nurture them for the national team. Eve qualified rigorous trials and is now ready to train under the programme for the next one year with the aim of getting into the England national team. “I never thought I would get selected by Sunrisers as I did not get time to practice for trials, which had started 12 months before my arrival in the UK. My experience in playing for U-19, U-16 teams in Ernakulam helped me a lot. It was a bit difficult but I am happy that I made it. I want to play for England,” Eve said. Eve started her journey by playing for the club’s women’s team. Eve’s opportunity to play for Northampton County U-13 Girls’ Cricket Team came after a string of performances for the club’s women’s team, U-13 Boys’ Team, and the U-15 Boys’ Team. She was performing with the boys’ team since the club didn’t have an exclusive team for girls. “She has been named Northampton County’s top run scorer and best batter in U-13 category, winning five awards altogether. Seeing her performance, Sunrisers selector asked her to do trials and she qualified. The Sunrisers programme is ECB’s 10-point action plan for transforming England’s Women’s and Girls’ Cricket. Eve is now being selected for the U-18 team and she is the youngest player. Eve, who is into music too, is a drummer, guitarist and even plays the keyboard.

---||Kolkata||No firecracker is green minus NEERI stamp, PCB tells cops||Kolkata: The state pollution control board has expressly told the Kolkata Police commissioner and top cops in other police commissionerates and districts that only fireworks certified by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) should be considered green crackers and all other fireworks are banned for use during Kali Puja-Diwali and other festivals and celebrations that follow. The Supreme Court, while allowing use of green crackers on Monday, had warned that no other form of polluting crackers should be used. The authenticity of NEERI-certified green crackers can be checked by using NEERI app to scan the QR code on cracker packets. The PCB missive comes in the wake of claims by a section of cracker manufacturers and traders in the state that green crackers are being manufactured here though they do not have the NEERI certification. Manufacturers and traders have even moved the police to grant the green tag to 10 types of firecrackers, including sparklers, charkas and flowerpots, and even proposed a mini-green firecracker mela at Sovabazar where all fireworks sold will have the prefix green to denote that they are green crackers. The police have not yet granted permission to the fair. Green activists like Sabuj Mancha convenor Naba Dutta has warned that unless checked with a firm hand, violations will be rampant as no green cracker is manufactured in the state. “Our control room will be operational from Wednesday evening. There will be a number of mobile squads that will roam around on the basis of the complaint received by the WBPCB,” WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra said. PCB has also requested district police to monitor its website to know the ambient air quality and not just be vigilant about sound pollution as the apex court had made it abundantly clear that if the ambient air quality plunged to poor level, even green fireworks would be banned. Till now, Kolkata Police has lodged 13 FIRs and seized around 4,000kgs of banned firecrackers. “So far, police have not come across green crackers during the seizures,” said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. There are reports of illegal firecrackers being sold locally in various neighbourhoods of the city including Beniapukur, Behala Pathakpara, New Alipore, Madanmohantala and Tallah. At Parnasree, cops seized 20kgs of loose crackers. Similar seizures were made from the Topsia-Kasba-Tiljala belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-firecracker-is-green-minus-neeri-stamp-pcb-tells-cops/articleshow/87494995.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Kali Puja, Diwali bring AQI down from moderate to poor||KOLKATA: When the Supreme Court allowed green fireworks during the festivals, it also issued an important rider. If the ambient air quality dipped from moderate to poor, even green crackers would be banned. In the five years prior to the pandemic, the air quality index (AQI) has turned from moderate to severe on Kali Puja-Diwali night and then remained poor for months due to the onset of winter. Track the pollution level in your cityAn AQI of 101 to 200 is considered moderate; 201 to 300 poor; 301 to 400 very poor and above 500 severe. Diwali day in 2020, when there was a blanket on fireworks, the ambient air had stayed moderate, resulting in the air quality staying moderate even after Diwali. WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra pointed out that it should be parents who should encourage children to celebrate Diwali in a manner that does not pollute. “Letting your child light fireworks is exposing her or him to toxic fumes and fine particulate matter,” he cautioned. A day prior to Diwali in 2019, the PM2.5 count was 28.2µg/m3 A day after Diwali night, it shot up more than 100% to 58.9µg/m3. This year, Diwali is happening late in the year when thermal inversion will have a greater role to play in trapping the pollutants low in the atmosphere and keeping it there for the rest of the season. The PM2.5 concentration in the city’s air after 2019 Diwali rose so sharply that breathing was as bad as smoking eight cigarettes. In 2018, it was worse post Diwali the air was as bad as smoking 12.5 cigarettes. These are the 24 hours average of PM2.5 concentration (not air quality index). Hourly concentration figures were much higher. Hourly PM2.5 count shot past 700µg/m3 in 2019 Diwali. In 2018, it zoomed past 1100µg/m3. Environment activist Soumendra Ghosh pointed out that the piling up of particulate load in the lower strata of the atmosphere pushes the city’s pollution level beyond even Delhi. “PM2.5 plays havoc with vital organs. Air pollution kills more people worldwide each year than does AIDS, malaria, diabetes or tuberculosis,” said Arup Haldar, a senior pulmonologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kali-puja-diwali-bring-aqi-down-from-moderate-to-poor/articleshow/87494999.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The cash-strapped farmers say they cannot afford to celebrate Diwali. There are some 45 lakh sugarcane growers in UP who sell their crop to the 119 sugar mills in the state. Of these, 50 mills are yet to clear their dues even as the new crushing season has begun. Farmers have blamed the government for failing to get the mills to clear their dues. To make ends meet, many are now being compelled to sell their sugarcane crop to kolluhs and crushers at Rs 260 per quintal, which is Rs 90 less than the state supported price. Talking with TOI, Sheeshpal Singh, a farmer of Mohammadpur Mandawali village, said, “We are associated with the Bilai sugar mill. It owes Rs 4 lakh to me. I have only 50 bigha of agricultural land. We are dependent only on sugarcane crop. Diwali is round the corner and I am in a fix on how to meet the expenses.” Farmer leader Shoorveer Singh from Gangdaspur village slammed the government for crowing about clearing cane dues in time. “But the reality is different. It is very hard to afford the expenses of the upcoming festivals -- Diwali, Bhaiya Dooj and Ganga snan. The new crushing season has begun but old dues are still pending. The government should tighten the noose on defaulter sugar mills,” he added. Digambar Singh, mandal president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said, “Our outfit is continuously raising the issue but to no avail. We are going to launch an agitation soon." National president of the Azad Kisan Union Rajendra Singh said, “We had staged a dharna at Bilai sugar mill recently. Shivpal Yadav, leader of the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party, had also joined us. The authorities assured us that the dues would be cleared soon. If the dues are not paid, we will sit on a dharna again."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/with-rs-3900cr-cane-dues-pending-farmers-stare-at-a-dark-diwali/articleshow/87495004.cms||Harveer Dabas

Third-time lucky, Suryatapa Santra, who will turn 20 tomorrow, has come 5,476th on the NEET merit list, a rank that will secure her a seat at a medical college in Kolkata. Suryatapa from East Midnapore’s Chandipur was among the 2019 Higher Secondary toppers. After scoring 97.4% in HS in 2019, her first attempt at NEET got her a score of 1.7 lakh. “At my mother’s prodding, I took admission in chemistry honours at Jadavpur University the next year. But I kept preparing for NEET and in 2020, I got a 72,000 rank. I didn’t want to give up on my dreams and so, took the test one more time,” she said. But back home, financial hardship had begun. Even before the pandemic struck, her father, Swapan, lost his shop to a road extension project in Chandipur. Though a graduate, all that Swapan could get were odd jobs but even those doors were shut due to Covid. Her mother, Sudakshina, a post-graduate, too, lost her teacher’s job at a local private school, which was shut down. Sauryatapa has been mostly studying on the state’s Kanyashree grant. But she was lucky to find unexpected help from benefactors, who were moved by her drive to be a doctor and serve the poor.  By coincidence, she met former SSKM doctor Amiya Maiti, who runs a private medical training institute, Rainbow, in Lake Gardens. Maiti said, “I was moved by her determination. We provided her with books, study material and coaching. Her 2021 rank is likely to find her a place in a Kolkata medical college. But medical studies have expenses. She might need more help to pursue her dream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/third-time-lucky-teen-achieves-neet-dream-despite-cov-financial-distress/articleshow/87495835.cms||---

The UPCA assured them that medical facilities would be at their doorstep. A team of specialized doctors and paramedical staff would be at Green Park to handle any medical issue of the two teams. The administration is already complying with Covid protocol and a chief medical officer level official would be also there with the team. During the inspection of the ground and pavilion, the visiting team asked which dressing room was likely to be allotted to the New Zealand team. Khanna stated that it had not been decided and that it was not a major issue as they would get whichever they would like. After witnessing the sitting place and other facilities at the New pavilion, both members appeared satisfied. The members thereafter inspected the ground and wickets.

Renuka Chowdhury was declared dead when her son Abhay took her to SSKM Hospital. Preliminary post-mortem report said she had died due to smothering around midnight. Joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma confirmed the post-mortem findings and added: “Necessary probe is on”. DCP (South) Akash Magharia said all angles were being probed given the fact that the victim was found bleeding. Later in the day, cops detained Doodhkumar Dhal, a former driver of the family, from Dankuni. Abhay, in his statement to police, said he found the death suspicious due to the bleeding and mentioned that his mother’s bedroom door was open. Police sources also said that a few valuables belonging to the victim and a mobile phone were missing from the bedroom. Several people who work in the building are being questioned. Police have also sought a detailed opinion of forensic experts on the likely reason that may have led to the smothering. According to police sources, Renuka lived with her son Abhay — a chartered accountant — in this apartment. A full-time servant-cum-attendant stays with them and sleeps at the servant quarters. Other family members, including Abhay’s brother, are settled in the US. At the time the incident was reported, the attendant was reportedly sleeping in the servant quarters. “It was around 5.45am that Abhay, who is also an office-bearer of the apartment residents’ association, had gone up to the terrace to play badminton and complete his daily exercises. When he came down, he went to check on his mother as usual,” said an investigating officer. “I went to play on the terrace. I came back around 7.30am and called out for my mother. Mother was alone in the house and I was not getting any response. Worried, I went to her room and found her lying there. Blood was oozing out through the nose. It looks like someone from outside had entered the house,” Abhay alleged. “There was no forced entry into the house,” said a detective department officer. The apartment is under CCTV surveillance. The police have seized CCTV footage. “There are two people who were seen moving on the ninth floor at night. These two had stayed on the floor slightly longer than usual. One among them is a driver, who is also an old-timer in the building,” an officer said, refusing to say anything on the other person. The residents of the apartment did not talk to media. Reporters were stopped outside the main gate by the police. DCP Magharia, DCP (DD-Special) Debasmita Das, joint commissioner Sharma, along with Shakespeare Sarani police, the homicide squad and forensic teams are investigating the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/91-yr-old-woman-smothered-at-central-kol-high-rise-former-driver-detained/articleshow/87495003.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The HC bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti granted 10 days time to the CBI to prove its bonafides in the case, failing which they will either refer the matter to Supreme Court or constitute a SIT independent of the CBI. Expressing displeasure over social media intermediaries for not taking action in appropriate time, the bench asked them if it’s not their responsibility to remove abusive content immediately after investigating agencies registered a crime and reported the same to the companies to take down the content. The observation came after N Ashwani Kumar, the standing counsel for high court’s registrar general, told the bench that social media intermediaries removed abusive content posted by Prabhakar only after the registrar general’s letter. P Subash, the counsel for CBI, told the court that a red corner notice has been issued against Prabhakar and the investigation agency has been trying to arrest him by coordinating with diplomatic channels and Interpol. Subash and the investigating officer requested for more time to coordinate with international agencies. Considering their request, the court granted 10 days to show progress in the case.

His inspiration to become a doctor came from ‘The Good Doctor,’ an American medical drama television series he enjoyed watching. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Jashan, a student of Aakash Institute, who completed his PU from Mount Carmel Central School, said that he desired to become a medical professional after completing his matriculation. “I started to prepare from class 11 itself, and my family, and most importantly my mother Anitha, supported my dream. The family, college, friends and the coaching institute supported me even during the lockdown due to Covid-19. I never expected to bag a rank, but wanted to perform well in the test,” said Jashan. He kept some time to spend with his family and friends, amidst the hectic preparations for the NEET. “I was never completely cut off from the outer world to focus on studies, but reserved a good amount of time to be with my family and friends, which played a crucial role to achieve this feat.” On his advice to NEET aspirants, Jashan asked candidates not to study for the sake of the test only, but to gain knowledge. Though he scored 99.1 percentile in the JEE Main 2021, he was determined to become a surgeon or cardiologist, and introduce a new method of healthcare which will be based on affordability and judicious application of medicines. He wants to get admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, (AIIMS), New Delhi. Jashan secured AIR 20 at Aakash National Talent Hunt Exam (ANTHE), a national level scholarship exam for school students. Jashan also scored well in the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) 2020, a scholarship programme funded by the department of science and technology of the government of India. Jashan’s mother is a science teacher, from whom he realized that concentration was important for academic success, which would only come when he developed an interest in the subject. His family hails from Punjab, and they settled in Mangaluru for educational purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/tv-show-inspires-neet-topper-to-excel/articleshow/87494130.cms||---

The relatives took the dead body to his native village for performing his last rites, but as soon as police came to know about it, they reached the village and took the body in their custody and sent it for the post-mortem examination. The last rites will take place only after the post-mortem examination, said police officials. Retired inspector Dinesh Tripathi, a resident of Prayagraj, who has been posted in Kanpur for a long time, resided in Chakeri police station area. He had employed the girl’s father in his house as a caretaker. On August 11, 2020, he allegedly raped the 11-year-old daughter of the caretaker. The girl in her statement given in the court alleged that the retired inspector had raped her four times in the past, and the retired inspector has been in jail since then. The 42-year-old father of the victim, however, died on Monday evening. The victim's family, which originally belongs to a village in Sarsaul area of the district, took the body to its native village for performing the last rites. On coming to know about the incident, the Chakeri police reached the village, took the dead body in their possession and sent it for the post-mortem examination. The family members of the rape victim however claimed that the victim’s father, who has been unwell for the past several days, died due to excessive drinking. ACP Cantonment Mrigank Shekhar Pathak told reporters that further action will be taken on the basis of the post-mortem report. "The Chakeri police reached the native village on late Monday night, took the dead body into their custody and later dispatched it for the post-mortem examination," police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/rape-survivors-father-dies-mysteriously-body-sent-for-post-mortem/articleshow/87496549.cms||---
---||Mumbai||It’s about sustainable development too, says Bombay HC; allows 3 jetties in Coastal Regulation Zone-I||MUMBAI: Allowing construction of three jetties in the ecologically sensitive Coastal Regulation Zone I areas in Palghar and Thane, the Bombay high court observed that it is not a zone where all activity is halted. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Kulkarni’s October 29 verdict came on three petitions by Maharashtra Maritime Board to set up a passenger jetty and allied facilities at Kelwa and Kharekuran in Palghar and a Ro-Ro jetty at Kharwadashri in Thane. The Board sought HC’s permission in view of a September 2018 order imposing a freeze on destruction of mangroves and mandating its permission for any work in such zone. The proposed works fall in CRZ-I near mangroves zone. The petition said the passenger jetty at Kelwa will benefit residents of Palghar district and provide convenient and eco-friendly travel option for people staying in the areas near Boisar Industrial Area. It will also boost tourism in and around Kelwa beach in Maharashtra’s largest fishing zone which also has temples and forts. The judges disagreed with senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani for Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG) that merely because construction of jetty falls in a buffer zone of 50 metres along mangrove area it would amount to a prohibited activity. They agreed with the Board’s advocate Saket Mone that construction of a jetty is a permissible activity under CRZ 2011 notification that permits activities directly related to waterfront or needing foreshore facilities. The judges said the notification’s object is not merely protecting the environment but also, while doing so, promoting sustainable development. “Thus, CRZ-I cannot be interpreted to mean a zone which freezes every activity,” Justice Kulkarni wrote for the bench, adding that such reading of the notification would render nugatory activities specifically permitted in CRZ-I. Mone said there would be no destruction of mangroves and this is also noted by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and State Environment Impact Assessment Authority. At Kharwadshri, some 72 mangrove trees are required to be diverted and MCZMA has directed to replant five times the number if destroyed. The judges referred to HC orders allowing jetties at places like Borivli and Gorai, Ghodbunder, Belapur and Manori having considered the importance of the public project. The judges said the Board is also entitled to the exception carved in HC’s 2018 order “where the court finds it necessary for public good and in public interest.” They upheld permissions by MCZMA and SEIAA, and allowed the Board to “proceed with its public utility project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-its-about-sustainable-devpt-too-says-hc-allows-3-jetties-in-crz-i/articleshow/87495921.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Supreme Court stayed the counselling process till the next hearing (on November 16) in pleas challenging a government decision to apply OBC and EWS quotas to all-India medical seats. In a letter to Chief Justice of India, Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association appealed for the hearing to be expedited and start the admission process soon. “With a delay in admissions of first year students, workload has shifted to current batches of students in three-year MD/MS courses. Not just PG aspirants, whose academic year is delayed by over six months, but doctors in current batches are overburdened with Covid and non-Covid work,” said federation president Dr Manish from Delhi. Times ViewAny new changes in the admission process should be introduced well in advance and not at the eleventh hour. With the OBC and EWS reservations applied to all-India quota seats in medical admissions, qualified students are also unsure about getting seats of their choice. As the matter is pending in court, students waiting admissions for six months are worried about further delays.“After results of final year exams were announced, most successful candidates were relieved from duties... some joined as senior residents in parent institutions. Thus, healthcare institutions are being managed by current batches of second and third year resident doctors... This is a precarious situation, considering that current batches have been dealing with the pandemic since the beginning and are overburdened,” the federation letter stated. First year aspirants from general category want the court to decide soon on validity of OBC and EWS quotas in medical all-India quota seats as many colleges will be left with no open category seats after implementation of new quotas. “Many doctors, working and supporting family, rely on stipends. Uncertainty over seats is getting exhausting,” said a first year aspirant, Dr Zubin Driver. PG students or resident doctors form bulk of the healthcare workforce which worked during the first and second waves of Covid. NEET-PG for admissions to these MD/MS courses are held in January every year, but this year, it was pushed to April 18, and due to second wave was further pushed to September. Exams were held, and results were announced. But government’s last-minute decision to implement the OBC and EWS quotas in all-India quota seats for undergraduate and PG medical and dental seats was opposed by aspirants, who challenged it. The circular was issued on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pg-med-admissions-delayed-doctors-make-appeal-to-cji/articleshow/87495929.cms||Yogita Rao

Baghpat, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Delhi and Faridabad show the index value of prominent pollutant PM 2.5 hovering between 300 and 400. Other NCR districts, too, recorded toxic air and fell into the 'poor' category with AQI ranging between 200 and 300. These include Bulandshahr, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Moradabad and Agra. The AQI in Agra was recorded at 300 on Tuesday and 327 ('very poor' category) a day earlier. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 is 'satisfactory'; 101 and 200 'moderate'; 201 and 300 'poor'; 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Track the pollution level in your cityHealth experts have cautioned morning walkers against venturing out early in the day. "The air in late evening and early morning is highly toxic during winter. AQI turns 'poor' during the winter as the air becomes heavy and suspended PM10 and PM 2.5 cause breathing discomfort to most people. They should go for a walk only when the sun is out because pollution decreases after the sun rises. Windy days are still better as fast-moving air takes away toxic pollutants," said Meerut-based physician, Dr Harish Mohan Rastogi. Agra-based environmental activist Debashish Bhattacharya attributed the pollution in the city to burning of garbage. He said around 800 metric tonnes of garbage is dumped daily and during the festive season, it increases to around 1,400 metric tonnes a day. Besides, vehicular pollution also contributes majorly to air pollution. "Garbage burning should be stopped and roads should be sprinkled with water to settle down dust particles," he said. Notably, the UP government has banned sale and use of firecrackers in all towns and cities where ambient air quality falls under 'poor' and 'above' category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/very-poor-aqi-turns-ncr-towns-toxic-before-diwali/articleshow/87495085.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Delhi||Delhi govt restarts free coaching scheme for underprivileged||NEW DELHI: Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Tuesday announced reopening of applications under Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana. Under this scheme, meritorious students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, CLAT, civil services, banking, railways, SSC among others. If a student from a family earning less than Rs 8 lakh per annum is talented and wants to prepare for competitive examinations, they will no longer have to face the hurdles of poverty, Gautam said. “AAP government will provide them free coaching and also provide a stipend of Rs 2,500 to the beneficiary students so that they do not face problems in their commute. It is a dream of CM Arvind Kejriwal that even the poorest of poor kids who aspire to do something big in their life, receive assistance and support in fulfilling their dreams,” Gautam said at a press conference. The scheme is quite popular. “In recent years, it has been observed that the kids who receive coaching are able to do well in such exams compared with others who don’t receive coaching. It was a challenge before Delhi to bring a positive change, just like it did in education and health, in supporting the financially disadvantaged kids who are talented, hard-working and want to fulfil their dreams. The parents of these kids do not have the financial means to support them in the pursuit of their dreams, to pay for their coaching,” Gautam said. Initially, the scheme was created from the SC/ST funds to support the kids belonging to the SC and ST communities. In 2018 and 2019, around 5,000 kids were given the coaching they required and many of them were able to clear engineering, medical and CLAT entrance tests. “We felt that the benefits of this scheme be extended to the kids belonging to OBC, and general category kids who fall under EWS. The government needs to step up for them, and hence, we decided to make this scheme broader,” the minister said. The scheme was put on hold in 2020 due to Covid. “Now, 15,000 talented kids of Delhi can enrol themselves in the 46 empanelled institutes and be coached for engineering, medical, judicial, civil services, banking, railways and other entrance exams. The government has made arrangements for re-opening of offline coaching classes along with the schools. Very soon, their classes will commence,” Gautam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-restarts-free-coaching-scheme-for-underprivileged-after-covid-stop/articleshow/87496542.cms||AlokKNMishra

While these deaths will be recorded and eventually addressed as accidents, it is clear what caused them — government apathy. “There are hundreds of roads filled with potholes all over the city. Every year, accidents, including fatal ones, happen during the monsoon because of bad roads. It is high time the concerned engineers and contractors are booked for negligence,” said K Kathiresan, an activist. Officials claimed their monsoon-preparedness work began a month ago. However, dangers like dilapidated buildings and live wires, whose faults could be exacerbated during the monsoon, lurk unaddressed. Potholes, live wires and tree falls are behind several accidents during the monsoon, especially in interior roads. “In our neighbourhood, the road leading from the bus stand is full of potholes. Every day, at least 10 motorists fall while trying to cross the road as they are not aware of the potholes,” said R Veera Raghavan of Thilakar Avenue, Madipakkam. This issue is not confined to just Thilakar Avenue. Pruning trees is another important pre-monsoon activity as it can prevent snapping of power lines. Tangedco engineers said there have been several instances of trees snapping power lines when they fall due to heavy rain. As the lines snap, live wires are submerged in the stagnant water below making it difficult to zero in on them. “Trees near power lines are dangerous. When a tree grows close to a power line, it can create shock hazards, power outages, and fires. Snapped or downed power lines can hurt or kill people, even if they do not spark or hum,” said an engineer. A corporation official said zonal teams were told to survey dilapidated buildings in their jurisdiction and move occupants to a safer place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/deaths-not-due-to-accidents-but-government-apathy/articleshow/87495089.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

BJP was hoping to repeat its Pandharpur success against the MVA. Jitesh, the son of deceased sitting Congress MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar, secured 1,08,840 votes, against 66,907 votes garnered by Sabne, show official data. Uttam Ingole of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) could fetch only 11,348 votes to be placed third. Jitesh, 30-year-old civil engineer, had a lot of sympathy due to his father’s demise due to post-Covid complications on April 9. “My victory margin underlines how much people of Deglur loved my father. With the baton getting passed on to me now, I will fulfil my father’s dream of developing the constituency and addressing public issues,” he said. Sabne, a former Shiv Sena MLA, had lost to Raosaheb Antapurkar in 2019 assembly election from Deglur by over 22,000 votes. The margin has increased this election. The poll, which was fought under the leadership of Congress veteran and former chief minister Ashok Chavan, saw the MVA partners keeping BJP at bay. Chavan, who had to step down as chief minister in 2010, was written off by many after his defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha election. Addressing the media, Chavan credited MVA partners for the success. “People of Deglur have offered tribute to late Antapurkar by making Congress victorious. The Opposition is making efforts to dislodge the MVA government, but mandate given by voters shows that people are against BJP,” he said, adding he received a congratulatory call from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cong-holds-on-to-bastion-in-nanded-bjp-fails-to-repeat-pandharpur-win/articleshow/87493393.cms||Prasad Joshi

Besides the graves of Britishers and the Jews, the 179 years old cemetery has 68 graves of soldiers slain in WW-I and WW-II. The cemetery was built with Gothic style tombstones in the British era. People from different parts of the country as well as abroad come to the cemetery to pay tributes to the departed souls. Maureen Gosse (76), who has come all the way from London to visit her father OE Clement’s grave, told TOI, “My heart is always in Jhansi and whenever I come here I spend a lot of time at this place as it gives me peace”. The cemeteryhas a rich historical background. It had been in a dilapidated condition for years before its maintenance was taken over voluntarily by an aged woman MR Cantum lovingly known as Aunt Peggy who also rests here. She with her relentless efforts revived the place with the financial help given by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. People from all over the world visit here round the year. After Aunt Peggy died at the age of 96 in 2016, the work of supervision has been taken over by Claudette Hats, who is also the treasurer of the maintenance society. Hars single-handedly looks after the maintenance on a daily basis.  Talking to TOI, Claudette said, “I am trying to carry on the legacy of Aunt Peggy.

---||Chennai||Bad roads claim lives of 520 Chennai motorists in six years||CHENNAI: Northeast monsoon 2021 is just setting in, but it has exposed the myriad of potholes on city roads, which have claimed one life in just two days The death of a software engineer, who came under the wheels of an MTC bus on Monday after hitting a crater on Anna Salai, was caught on CCTV camera providing irrefutable evidence that the pothole led to his death. The state highways department, which maintains this road, filed a police complaint against a private telecommunication firm for digging the road without its permission and shoddy patchwork. The firm was authorised to finish work before the first week of October., but it suddenly dug the road on Sunday without informing police, a senior official from the department said. Even in the 100m radius of the accident spot, road cuts, cracks, and potholes were left unattended as on Tuesday evening. Arterial roads in the city, including Poonamallee High Road, Chennai-Thiruvallur Highway and Perambur High Road, are riddled with potholes. According to official data, there are at least 11,000 roads with potholes in Chennai. This means every third road in the city is pothole-ridden. Over the past six years, potholes, which are formed due to such road cuts, pipe leaks and water penetration, have caused 2,320 accidents in the city. About 520 people died in these accidents, caused primarily due to official negligence. The proportion of bitumen, which is used for laying the top surface of the road, is inadequate. And with quality compromised to reduce construction cost, cracks develop when water seeps through the porous top surface. When these cracks are left unattended, they emerge as potholes, said David Manohar, a civic rights’ activist from Arappor Iyakkam. “Ideally all government agencies should have finished their monsoon-related work before the rain began and closed all pits or road cuts. But even today we see open trenches across roads,” said K Senthil, a resident-activist from Porur. In response, the highway official said local engineers regularly address such cracks and road design failures. “It is an ongoing process,” he said on condition of anonymity. “When the government is collecting road tax, disciplinary action should be taken against erring officials,” Manohar said. R Srinivasan, an advocate at the Madras high court, said officials can be booked under Sections 304, 336, 288 of the Indian Penal Code for negligence. There are also provisions in the new Motor Vehicle Act, 2019, to penalise such authorities. They can be jailed for three years or made to pay a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh, he added. States like Kerala, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have booked officials and road contractors under these provisions. But Tamil Nadu is yet to implement the new act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bad-roads-claim-lives-of-520-chennai-motorists-in-six-years/articleshow/87495103.cms||Ram Sundaram

As the city’s markets were decorated for Dhanteras, the first day of the festival, showrooms of vehicles, electronic goods, jewellery stores, and shops selling utensils, dry fruits, sweets, firecrackers, witnessed a heavy turnout of customers during the entire day. Since Dhanteras is for two days, owing to the overlapping of the tithi as per the Hindu calendar, shopkeepers are expecting even higher footfall as customers would be coming for purchase on Wednesday too. Falling in line with various other commodities, the bullion market too, which registered loss during lockdown, has returned with a bang. On Tuesday, a large number of people were seen in various shops, purchasing jewellery. Be it the huge, decked up showrooms of Civil Lines and Katra or the traditional shops at ‘sarafa mandi’ of Mahajani tola in the Old City, there were handsome purchases made by denizens. “Gold (22 carat) was at Rs 46,750 per 10 gram and silver was at Rs 66,800 per kg and we are happy that as compared to last year, customers did turn up in large numbers. There were many who purchased the ornaments for the forthcoming marriage season as well,” said Rajat Chaddha, owner of a jewellery store at Civil Lines. Compared to last year, despite the high rate of both gold and silver, there has been an increase in sales as the festival of Teej is also coming, he added. There was a lot of enthusiasm seen among the masses in making purchases for Diwali. Markets were decorated with stalls selling idols of Lord Ganesha-Lakshmi, selling lai-lava (puffed rice), toys made of sugar, decorative items of ceramic etc. The utensil market too witnessed heavy turnout of customers. Shops had decorated utensils made of copper, brass, steel and aluminum and other metal too. Market at thatheri bazar, the city’s largest utensil market, and the shops selling pottery are all expecting high sales from two days of Dhanteras. “There is a tradition of shopping on dhanteras and hence we are expecting that customers will come in large numbers on Wednesday too”, said Neeraj Jaiswal, a shopkeeper of Preetam Nagar. Besides, there is an option to buy crockery and electronic products for the kitchen too. Several shops had decorated crockery items in front of their shops to attract the customers. Along with this, non-stick utensils were also in great demand. Similarly, there was a huge crowd in the shops selling sweets and dealing in selling vehicles and electronic goods. Several of the shopkeepers and wholesalers had come out with heavy discounts to lure the customers and the same had a positive effect too. According to Pundit Anil Mishra, the puja muhurat for Dhanteras was from 06.17 pm to 08.11 pm. “Lakshmi puja on Dhanteras is ideally done during pradosh kaal that lasts for two hours and 24 minutes," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/markets-witness-pre-covid-buzz-on-dhanteras-register-heavy-footfalls/articleshow/87496576.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana breathe easy, Himachal continues to reel under Covid||Chandigarh: The Covid-19 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down in Himachal Pradesh even when the novel coronavirus spread appears to be well in control in most parts of the region and the the country. The hill state features on the list of a few select states currently having a combination of both relatively high infection rate and positive growth. Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Mizoram and West Bengal are on the list too. As per the latest two-week report released by Cambridge Judge Business School and National Institute of Economic and Social Research, working with Health Systems Transformation Platform in India, Himachal posted growth in cases during the two-week period from October 17 to 30. During the period, a positive growth trajectory was recorded between 0.1% to 5.2%. Among the states and UTs with high infection incidence and growth in daily cases, HP was the lone state to have recorded positive growth on a maximum of 13 days. At the national level, the trend of new Covid cases is likely to fall in two week’s time. However, in Himachal, the daily caseload is expected to mount. As per the forecast, the state will continue to report daily cases above 200, crossing the 250 mark on November 12. The daily heavy case count of the state has pushed the R-value — rate at which Covid-19 or any other infection spreads — to over 1, which is higher than the national average of 0.91. Election related activities in Mandi parliamentary constituency and three other assembly constituencies and the influx of tourists in the state are being said to be the reason for the rising number of cases. The current situation in Himachal has left the health experts in Punjab and Haryana worried as there are chances of cases spilling over due to the geographic proximity of the three states. As per the data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), as many as 971 samples have so far been tested positive for different variants of concern. Of total samples, 330 found positive for the fast-spreading highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.6.172) of Covid-19. Himachal accounts for 1.4% of the total variant of concerns detected in the country. Contrary to the situation in Himachal Pradesh, the pandemic has slowed down in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. The daily caseload of both states has been below 50 for the past many weeks. There were only 115 active cases in Haryana and 247 in Punjab as of November 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-breathe-easy-himachal-continues-to-reel-under-covid/articleshow/87495937.cms||Vinod Kumar

At present, Nashik-based Halcon, a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Container Corporation of India (Concor), is involved in exporting various agricultural and horticulture products from Nashik. Also, a bulk of the products are sent to Mumbai from where they are exported overseas — either by air or by cargo ships. Nashik also sends around 700 tonnes of vegetables to Mumbai and Gujarat daily. According to the Halcon officials, if the connectivity for air cargo increases, transportation costs will reduce. This will be beneficial for the farmers. Jayant Sanap, a Nashik-based vegetable and fruit exporter, said, Nashik is known for producing grapes and vegetables at a large scale. Sending vegetables and fruits via road to the Northeastern states becomes difficult as the products are perishable. “Transporting these products by road has also become much costlier due to the rising fuel prices. Therefore, if grapes and other vegetables from Nashik are transported via air cargo to the Northeastern states, it will be a boon for farmers and traders,” said Sanap. Nashik will get access to major domestic markets across the country due to its inclusion in the Krishi UDAN 2.0. This will indirectly benefit both farmers, as well as, the traders, added Sanap. Chandrashekhar Bari, a senior official of Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB) said there is a limitation to sending vegetables to remote parts of the country as the products are perishable. However, farmers and traders will now be able to send vegetables and fruits across the country due to the inclusion of the Ozar airport in the Krishi UDAN 2.0 plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/krishi-udan-scheme-to-benefit-farmers-exporters/articleshow/87493410.cms||Tushar Pawar

Introduced by an NGO, Retirement India Foundation which provides tiffins to elderly people at a nominal cost of Rs 1, the gift hamper of these eco-friendly Diyas is providing additional financial help to the poor elderly persons of the Sangam city. “To keep the senior citizens engaged in some creative work and at the same time providing them an opportunity to earn for themselves, the foundation has introduced a novel concept of training them in making ‘Panchgavya Deepak’ at their homes. Sourced from south India and trained on hand held molding machines, these senior citizen groups can produce a few thousand ‘Gau-Diyas’,” informed director of the NGO, Raaj Gulati. The NGO purchased these specially made eco-friendly and ‘healthy’ Diyas from these poor elderly and packed them in a gift pack of 21 Diyas. Our NGO and many of the families in the city purchased this gift pack and gifted the same to their loved ones this Diwali, he added. “After assessing the feedback of our initiative, called ‘hamare diye, aapke liye’ (our lamps for you), our NGO plans to provide a global on-line market to products from these senior citizen groups which would make them more self-reliant”, said Gulati. He further added that ‘Panchgavya’ is a mixture used in traditional Hindu rituals that is prepared by mixing five ingredients. The three direct constituents are cow dung, urine, and milk while the other two are derived products including curd and ghee. These are mixed in proper ratio and then allowed to ferment. The material thus prepared is put in a molding machine, giving shape to beautiful Diyas. “Panchgavya Diya is a chemical free formulation with no charcoal or carbon footprints. The Diya also burns out and this Panchgavya composition promotes oxygen generation and also produces a phenomenal amount of beneficial gases that fight pollution effectively. The residue is used as manure in garden”, said Gulati. The society must come forward to support and improve the quality of life of our senior citizens. He said providing food to these senior citizens is not a charity but part of our ‘Dharma’, establishing home-chef cooking units of housewives is a way of women economic empowerment and providing petty tasks to able senior citizens is an opportunity for them to have graceful earning and living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/panchgavya-deepak-gift-packs-in-high-demand-to-help-elderly/articleshow/87496586.cms||---

Nine depots from Nanded, six from Latur, two from Parbhani and one from Osmanabad were affected due to the strike. MSRTC spokesperson said a total of 37 depots across Maharashtra remained closed as staffers struck work. “Both Marathwada and Nagpur divisions of the MSRTC had 16 depots each that were impacted due to the strike. In all, 213 depots were operating as usual,” the spokesperson said, adding that no coercive action has been taken against any agitating staffer yet. In a formal appeal to the MSRTC staffers, who are observing the strike, state transport minister Anil Parab requested them to resume their duties in public interest. “The MSRTC is lifeline for common people of Maharashtra and the same should deliver its services smoothly especially during the current festive season,” Parab has said, adding that fresh round of talks would be held with agitating workers unions after Diwali to discuss pending demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/16-msrtc-depots-in-marathwada-observe-strike/articleshow/87493414.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Clay crackers return with a bang||Vadodara: The eco-friendly crackers they made sold like hot cakes a couple of decades ago. But after Chinese firecrackers invaded the markets, the clay crackers they made went out of fashion, hitting dozens of potter families who made them in Vadodara hard. But the centuries-old clay crackers are all set to make a comeback with a blast this Diwali festival. After nearly two decades, thousands of clay crackers have been made by the potter families in Kumbharwada in the old city area this year. “We had stopped making clay crackers many years ago as their demand dropped considerably due to the advent of Chinese and local crackers made out of paper. We have been losing considerable income during Diwali for years. But this Diwali, we made clay crackers as we got good orders,” said Raman Prajapati, a potter staying in the Kumbharwada area of the walled city.  “The demand for clay crackers is on the rise and we hope this sets the tone for revival of this product that our community has been making for centuries now,” Prajapati added.  Pramukh Parivar Foundation, a city-based NGO, ordered thousands of clay firecrackers including flowerpots and fire-wheels this year. “The firecrackers made out of clay are eco-friendly and very safe. They never explode or leave behind paper waste, so we decided to revive these crackers that have been a part of our traditions for many centuries. We have kept a stall to sell these crackers at low rates and their sale is on the rise,” said Nital Gandhi, president, Pramukh Parivar Foundation.  “Also, the revival of clay crackers will give employment to many families as well as promote the local products,” Gandhi told TOI.  Hitesh Prajapati, president of Vadodara Prajapati Community, said, “Dozens of potter families from our community used to make clay crackers and the tradition continued for three centuries. Unfortunately the art was lost due to advent of imported crackers. But I am glad that this Diwali clay crackers are back in demand. The potters will earn good money and sustain their families apart from reviving our tradition,” Hitesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/clay-crackers-return-with-a-bang/articleshow/87495123.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NEET score format revised, new ‘all-India rank’ added||Mumbai: After students were confused over NEET scorecards displaying two ranks against their names, National Testing Agency (NTA) had to revise the format slightly to differentiate the two. Candidates were told to download the scorecard again if they wanted. Even as students downloaded their scorecards on Monday, after NTA announced the NEET-UG results, students noticed that their ‘all-India rank for counselling’ in two columns differed. For instance, a student found her rank was 20097 in one column and in the other it was 20098; another student’s ranks in two columns differed by four positions. In a statement on Tuesday evening, NTA clarified that the rank mentioned in the first column was without tie-breaking criteria of age. “However, since for the purpose of counselling, unique ranks are required, the second ‘all-India rank for counselling’ also took into account the tie-breaking criteria of age,” In view of this, in place of the first ‘all-India rank for counselling’, a new field ‘NEET all-India rank’ has been mentioned for more clarity, said the NTA statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neet-score-format-revised-new-all-india-rank-added/articleshow/87495945.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Can’t deny PDS foodgrains for not linking Aadhaar: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Expressing anguish that around 85 tribals in Thane district are being denied supplies under the public distribution system (PDS) for want of linking of their Aadhaar cards with the system, while “the fortunate” await Diwali in joyous anticipation, Bombay high court directed Murbad tehsildar and other authorities to distribute foodgrains to them by November 4. “We are unable to find any logic, reason or rationale for denying the benefits of distribution of foodgrains…over certain technical grounds” to three persons who petitioned the court and 82 others similarly placed, said the HC bench of Justices P B Varale and Madhav Jamdar in its October 29 interim order. The state is at liberty to verify their ration cards, said the HC and placed the matter next on December 1 for the state to file its reply. The HC said, “It is a disheartening situation when we, the fortunate, are awaiting as the festive season is approaching and the festival of lights would spread joy and happiness...here are the petitioners, who are the members of the marginalized section in general and tribals in particular, who have approached this court on a grievance that they are deprived of the basic requirement of human life, that is food, only on account that the state machinery is not technically equipped to give them the benefits flowing from the scheme formulated and floated by the Union of India and to be implemented and executed by the respective states.” The reason for such deprivation to some, the state informed, was that their Aadhaar cards were “linked to a different place” than the address on the card. The HC said they are tribals and the majority of them are not literate. The practice followed is that a ration cardholder goes to the PDS shop and the shop owners, at his request, link the card to the system and if a mistake is committed by the shop owner, it can be no reason to deny ration cardholder foodgrains under the benevolent schemes, said the HC. A state government circular of 2016 states that to receive the benefits of PDS, it is a prerequisite that the Aadhaar card of each member of the family enlisted in the ration card, must have been linked in the RCMS portal. But the HC said that the circular is “clearly in contrast” with a central notification of 2017 which states that Aadhaar card is just one of the identification cards to ensure foodgrain supply, a ration card also entitles its holder to receive the benefits. The HC gave interim dire-ctions to the authorities to distribute foodgrains to the petitioners and tribal beneficiaries of Murbad taluka under the PDS as well as provisions of NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-deny-pds-foodgrains-for-not-linking-aadhaar-bombay-hc/articleshow/87495960.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: NCM chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura says Centre ready for reconciliation||JALANDHAR: National Commission for Minorities (NCM) chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura has given a call for reconciliation within Punjab and with the Union government for resolution of issues of the state while stating that the Centre is ready for the “hug”. “Let’s resolve issues by talking to the Centre like Nelson Mandela; the Centre is ready for the hug. Let’s get together for treating ourselves for the psychology of fear, hate, doubts and for progress of Punjab,” posted Lalpura on his Facebook on 55th anniversary of Punjab on Monday. He summed up what happened in the state in the last 55 years, how it was wronged or how things went wrong within and emphasising corrective measures for reconciliation within Punjab also. He also posed questions about things going wrong in the past and present. Lalpura has not only justified the demand for Punjabi Suba and accused the Congress of going back on its promise on the issue, which led to communal division, but also taken position on a few issues from the past which does not match with positions taken by BJP or Jan Sangh, its earlier avatar. “Socially there is not any gap between Khalsa and grooming ground for Khalsa (apparently hinting towards Sehajdhari tradition through which non-Sikhs especially Hindus would become Sikhs) but religiously we are facing heat of divisive agenda thrown at us by British and foreigners and taking advantage of this those with foreign background are active for conversion. This allegation is being levelled by those who are responsible for propagation of religion. Why there were not efforts to strengthen communal ties,” he posted. Recently Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh had said that Christian missionaries were running a campaign in the border belt for forced conversions for the last few years. He also referred to a pro-cigarette-beedi-smoking march in Amritsar to counter the demand for holy city status for Amritsar (in early 1980s), stating that it reflected mental hollowness. “Ironically, like the advocacy for smoking of cigarette-beedi now hate-filled people consider ban on burning of paddy straw as oppression. Why can’t crop straw be put to good use like Japan or other paddy growing countries,” he has posted. Though he has termed reorganisation of Punjab was another division of ‘Des Punjab’, he argued that if other states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat could have been reorganised on linguistic basis, demand for Punjabi Suba was also justified but the Congress backing off from its promises created divisions among Punjabis. He has also mentioned that in place of Punjabi uniting for their mother tongue, the language was divided on communal basis and Punjabi speaking areas became parts of Haryana, Himachal and Chandigarh and people there longed for reading and writing Punjabi. He has also flagged poor state of Punjabi language in Punjab. He has also argued that the morcha for Anandpur Sahib declaration of 1978, meant for rights of Punjab, also got divided on communal lines in place of becoming champion of Punjab and Punjabiyat. Pro-smoking march & Jan Sangh stance:As NCM chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura referred to the pro-cigarette smoking march, then Amritsar SSP Gurbachan Jagat, who later remained BSF director General, had clearly mentioned in an article last year that this march was taken out in last week of May 1981 and was led by then BJP MLA Harbans Lal Khanna. Khanna was killed by militants in April 1984. BJP’s earlier avatar Jan Sangh also remained strongly opposed to demand of Punjabi suba till last.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ncm-chairman-calls-for-negotiations-says-centre-ready-for-hug/articleshow/87495946.cms||IP Singh

The corporation’s move follows the death of a software engineer due to a crater on Anna Salai on Monday. The civic body also directed zonal engineers to inspect all roads with craters and rectify them in a week’s time. They were told to barricade locations where storm water drain or Metrowater work is underway. All digging must be stopped and concrete can be laid only in locations where roads have been milled and drain location dug, the civic body said. “Wherever work has been completed, roads should be levelled. We will conduct inspections daily,” a senior corporation official told TOI. Chief engineer (general) S Rajendiran said zonal officials were asked to figure out how the pothole was formed. “If it is due to a road cut, then a wet mix is poured into it as a temporary measure. In locations where the pothole is due to roads being worn out or its age, a cold mix is poured. In other locations, at least gravel and debris should be used to make the road even,” he said. Roads in Royapuram (1,628 roads), Thiru Vi Ka Nagar (1,051), Anna Nagar (1,010) and Adyar (1,140) zones have the most potholes. Most roads in civic body limits were laid in the past three years. However, a lot of roads were dug up for laying drains and telecommunication cables. In some locations, it was done without the knowledge of corporation officials. Companies undertaking cable laying must get permission form the civic body and pay a sum for road cut restoration, which is usually used for patch work or to relay the road. The civic body has about Rs 5 crore in this fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corporation-to-cover-up-potholes-after-techies-death/articleshow/87495118.cms||Komal Gautham

Fadnavis said he will burst crackers after Diwali, I am saying, why wait, do it as early as possible,” he added. Malik said that if he does have links with the underworld, then Fadnavis should have conducted a probe against him when he was CM and made the evidence public. Instead, Malik said, Fadnavis maintained a discreet silence, now suddenly he is making allegations after a photograph of his wife Amruta with an alleged drug peddler, Jaideep Rana, has surfaced. Malik further claimed during the tenure of Fadnavis, lavish parties were organised in a five-star hotel in central Mumbai. Targeting Wankhede on his alleged expensive taste, Malik claimed that it is difficult to believe that a government employee can afford such costly clothes. “I am told his shirt is worth Rs 50,000 and trousers Rs 1 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/malik-challenges-fadnavis-to-prove-his-links-with-underworld/articleshow/87497447.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The birdhouse was inaugurated on Monday by district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. The civic body will be providing around 25kg grain every day for the birds in the garden. Birds are losing their natural habitat due to urbanisation. In a bid to provide shelter to the birds, the civic body has started the initiative of building the birdhouse. It has over 800 nests and may accommodate more than 4,000 birds, said the NMC officials. This is the first such project in the city and is expected to help increase the number of birds. The birdhouse will be managed and maintained by the social organisations and residents. The base of the birdhouse is 10 feet above ground level and its height (from the base ) is 65 feet. Inaugurating the birdhouse, Bhujbal said more such new projects should come up in Nashik city to attract more tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-sets-up-birdhouse-in-puniya-park/articleshow/87493431.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Free pilgrimage plan to resume from Nov 15||New Delhi: The free pilgrimage service for senior citizens under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana, which has been on hold since the outbreak of the pandemic, is likely to resume from November 15. Now, people will even be able to enjoy a government-funded trip to Ayodhya. Recently, a meeting was convened to explore the possibility of resuming the popular scheme. It was discussed that significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation had been witnessed in Delhi and several states and almost all economic activities had been permitted. It was decided that the pilgrimage could be resumed safely by ensuring that everyone stuck to following the Covid-19 guidelines. Kamal Bansal, chairman of Delhi government’s Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti, said a letter had been sent to Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) intimating it of the government’s plan to resume the services from November 15. The letter would be forwarded by DTTDC to Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation. A government official said initially the pilgrimage would start for four destinations — Ayodhya, Nageshwar Jyotirlinga, Somnath and Dwarkadhish. Last week, the Delhi cabinet headed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved the proposal to add Ayodhya as another pilgrimage destination under the scheme. Bansal said the pilgrimage would restart after trains were provided by the railways, the modalities for which were being worked out. The revenue department of Delhi government would be the nodal agency to execute the scheme, while travel and lodging arrangements would be made by DTTDC. Over 35,000 people have availed of the scheme till now. Kejriwal, who had recently offered prayers at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi in Ayodhya, had announced that Delhi government would fully fund the pilgrimage of all senior citizens of Delhi who wished to visit Ayodhya and offer prayers. Aam Aadmi Party has lately increased its political activities in Uttar Pradesh where assembly elections are likely to be held early next year. Kejriwal had also announced that if AAP won the upcoming assembly polls, its government would provide a fully funded pilgrimage to Ayodhya for all people of Delhi. After the scheme was launched in mid-2019, a batch of 1,000 senior citizens was taken on a pilgrimage on the Amritsar-Wagah Border-Anandpur Sahib route. The scheme has no income criteria attached to it. It targets to enable 77,000 citizens of Delhi (1,100 from each of the 70 assembly constituencies) who are above 60 years of age to go on a pilgrimage on any of the five routes once a year. The routes include Delhi-Mathura-Vrindavan-Agra-Fatehpur Sikri, Delhi-Haridwar-Rishikesh-Neelkanth, Delhi-Ajmer-Pushkar, Delhi-Amritsar-Wagah Border-Anandpur Sahib and Delhi-Vaishno Devi-Jammu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/free-pilgrimage-plan-to-resume-from-nov-15/articleshow/87496614.cms||AlokKNMishra

The initiative, which is being touted as a milestone in the restoration and proper functioning of several big and small temples, located in villages and various localities, would start from Kashi Prant by the VHP. After the successful launch, the campaign would be run across the country. The draft of the same was placed and discussed at a meeting of VHP, held at the VHP’s provincial office in Prayagraj on Sunday. During the meeting, the national vice president of VHP and general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust Champat Rai was also present. The regional organisation secretary of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Gajendra, said that people from all over the country supported the Shri Ram temple being built in Ayodhya and this sequence continues even now. “The organisation believes that along with Ayodhya, the temple of each village and locality should also be equally grand and should become the centre of faith and religious rights of the people. For this, the VHP workers and office bearers will select a temple in their respective areas and start the process of its restoration”, he said. In this context, along with taking the help of the local people, the organisation will also cooperate with its resources. If there is any difficulty in the maintenance of the temple, then the workers of the organisation will cooperate in that too, he said. The help rendered by VHP, would be in all aspects, be it financially, physically or ideologically. The office bearer further informed that the temples, which will be renovated with the help of the local people and the organisation, will be used to discuss the problems being faced by the local people along with doing Satsang. Such a temple can also become the centre of ‘family Satsang started by VHP. An action plan for the Gaushalas to be operated in the area will also be prepared from these temples as these will emerge as a communication centre of ‘Sanatan culture’. The message of harmony in society will also be given through these temples. It will play an important role in the integration of Hindus, he added. The block-level group of VHP, which is presently active in the given area, will also look after the work related to the temple as no other officer or worker of VHP will be given any responsibility for this. VHP officials say that issues like conversion and ‘love jihad’ were also discussed and it was decided that there is a need to take concrete steps to bring public awareness about this and to curb it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vhp-appeals-for-restoration-of-old-temples-in-villages/articleshow/87496606.cms||---

Hrutul’s elder brother is doing engineering in Gandhinagar and also preparing for competitive exams. “I want to get admission in AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) Delhi and want to become a neurosurgeon. There were no physical classes since the pandemic broke out and so I returned home to Kodinar and was studying online,” said Hrutul, who had been staying at a rented place in Rajkot with his mother at first to prepare for NEET.

The process of monetizing the 54.62 acres of land, which as per conservative estimates is collectively worth about Rs 1,250 crore, is expected to be completed by next year. The properties include those in residential and commercial hotspots such as P V Cherian Crescent Road off Ethiraj Salai in Egmore, Flower Bazaar, Triplicane, Royapettah and Vyasarpadi, together measuring 11.12 acres, and 43.5 acres in suburban areas like Ennore, Kallikuppam near Ambattur and near Chengalpet town, a mix of vacant land and buildings not in use. In Royapettah and Vyasarpadi, the properties comprise staff quarters vacated after the implementation of VRS scheme for BSNL staff last year. While the largest land parcel is at Ennore, comprising 30 acres, those in the core city are together spread over 192 grounds (1 ground = 2,400 sq ft) could generate a revenue of around Rs 850 crore, with the 30-ground plot on posh P V Cherian Crescent Road alone worth nearly Rs 180 crore. Official sources with BSNL said an assessment of the market value of the identified land parcels will be taken up soon. “We are expecting that the process of monetization of the land parcels will conclude by next year,” a BSNL official said. The properties would be put for sale through the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) functioning under the Union government. “At Flower Bazaar, only vacant land is being subjected to monetization,” the official added. The news has gladdened the real estate sector. K Chandrasekar managing director of Rajam Property Management Services Private Limited, said that instances of land parcels of a central PSU in Chennai being put up for sale were rare. Builders Association of India state secretary S Ramaprabhu said that except for the property in Flower Bazaar, which is in the commercial nerve centre of Broadway, the other four properties in the city could emerge as residential developments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bsnl-to-sell-eight-prime-properties-in-chennai-and-suburbs-worth-of-rs-1200-crore/articleshow/87495160.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Jewellery shop burgled; gold and silver ornaments, cash stolen||GHAZIABAD: A group of men allegedly broke into a jewellery shop in Shalimar Garden area on Monday night and fled with gold and silver ornaments, along with cash worth over Rs 30 lakh. Suman Saurabh Verma, from MCC Raj Nagar Extension, said because of Dhanteras, he wanted to open his shop early on Tuesday.  “I reached around 8 am and once I entered, I found all the lockers had been cut open. The men broke the wall and entered the shop. They have stolen 250 gm of gold, 35 kg of silver ornaments and Rs 1.5 lakh in cash. The total cost of stolen items will be around Rs 32 lakh,” Verma said. According to primary investigation, a group of six people had taken the shop next to the jewellery store on rent. They were supposed to start a furniture business there. On Monday night, they broke the wall between the two shops and used a gas cutter to open lockers in Verma’s store. Gyanendra Singh, SP City 2, said: “They bought some wood to show that they were making furniture. But the plan was to rob the jewellery shop. The adjacent shop was taken on a monthly rent of Rs 30,000. But the owner did not make an agreement or carry out police verification for the tenants.” An FIR has been lodged at Sahibabad police station under sections 380 (punishment for theft) and 457 (house-breaking by night) of the IPC. “It seems the men fled towards Delhi after the crime. Four teams have been formed to trace them,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/day-before-dhanteras-jewellery-shop-burgled-in-gzb/articleshow/87496592.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Flyers fret over night commute from airport||Kolkata: Passengers arriving by late-night flights at Kolkata airport are complaining of a dearth of pre-paid taxis at the stand over the last few days. A number of drivers are refusing to drive at night citing police excesses over compliance of night curfew norms and hiked fuel prices. A young woman from Howrah who was waiting at the pre-paid taxi queue around 11pm after flying down from Delhi, seemed frustrated waiting behind 15 others on Monday night. “After a long day’s work and a late evening flight, all I want is to get a cab and head home. But that can’t be the case anymore. This is the second time in a week when I have had to wait for a long time . The authorities should do something,” said the woman. Another frequent flier, Soumya Mukherjee, a techie, who often returns to Kolkata by late evening flights from Bangalore, said, “Last week, I waited at the taxi kiosk for more than 45 minutes hoping to get a pre-paid cab to my Uttarpara home, but there were none. Finally, I had to take the help of a tout who arranged a car for me at a premium cost but I had no other option.” Incidentally, the cops have tightened night patrol and naka checks to ensure strict maintenance of safety restrictions between 11pm and 5am. Officers at Airport traffic guard provide taxi drivers with a “night pass” that specifically mentions the date and time (11pm to 5am) when they are allowed to ply on the road. “Cops at Bidhannagar Commissionerate recognise the pass but the moment we cross Ultadanga, we are stopped at almost every naka and asked a slew of questions. Some officers refuse to acknowledge the pass and some even take our photographs,” said one of the drivers. “At night, we get several long rides with passengers heading home to places like Barrackpore or Howrah. But we return with an empty cab. Diesel costs Rs 101.50 per litre. Its wiser to save fuel than burn more in greed of earning some extra money,” said driver Naushad Ali. A senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate said they are aware of the issue. “We are trying our level best to ensure fliers are not discomforted. We have deployed extra policemen outside the kiosk at night and forcing taxis to get in queue,” said an officer of airport traffic guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyers-fret-over-night-commute-from-airport/articleshow/87495158.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Allahabad||Tight vigil on passengers arriving from other states||Prayagraj: Learning a hard lesson from the sudden spurt in the number of Covid positive cases in the district after the festival of Holi and home returning of migrant workers, the district health department is leaving no stone unturned this time ahead of the festive season. The department has deputed 22 teams at all prominent bus stations, railway stations and also at Civil Enclave (the airport at Bamrauli) of the district for carrying out a rapid antigen test of all migrants and passengers returning home for the festival of Diwali. The department has also decided to carry out RT-PCR tests of all samples collected from these home-bound migrant workers in the run up to Diwali even if the rapid antigen tests come negative. District Covid-19 nodal officer Dr AK Tiwari said that special precautions are being taken in for the forthcoming festival of Diwali when thousands of migrant workers of UP return home for the festival from various states, including Maharastra, Delhi, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, among others. “A total of 22 teams have been deployed at bus stands and railway stations. Every migrant is being screened. Even if the report of the antigen test is coming negative, the samples are being sent for RT-PCR tests with an aim to not miss any positive Covid-19 positive individual who could spread the virus in the district. Any person who is found positive will be isolated immediately,” he said. The nodal officer said that likewise, even if the report of antigen test from a private hospital for patients comes negative, the samples would also be sent for RT-PCR tests as a sure check. These efforts are to ensure that the pandemic doesn't begin spreading again during the festive season. Presently, Prayagraj has three active Covid-19 cases with one new case being found in Tagore Town locality on Monday. The latest case was the first to be found after a gap of nine days. “Presently, 6,000 RT-PCR tests are being done daily in the MLN Medical College. Apart from Prayagraj, samples of Pratapgarh, Mirzapur and Kaushambi are also being tested here,” he explained. Even at the Civil Enclave of the city at Bamrauli, the passengers coming from various cities were randomly picked and checked for rapid antigen and RT-PCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/tight-vigil-on-passengers-arriving-from-other-states/articleshow/87496618.cms||---

While the body of a woman named Tarulata Kariya was found, her son-in-law Anil Gosai and her granddaughter 18-year-old Sonal were still missing. Tarulata’s husband Dilip Kariya, who lives on Jamnagar Road, told TOI from Rishikesh that the family including him, Tarulata, their daughter Meera Gosai, son-in-law Anil Gosai and their children Sonal and Lakhan had gone to the pilgrim place to perform some religious ceremonies. On Monday around 6 pm, after praying at a temple, Sonal was standing in waist-deep water in Ganga on the ghat to record a video on her mobile phone. A few minutes later, she slipped and got swept away. To save Sonal, Anil and Tarulata entered the river, but they also got dragged away in the swirling waters. After the incident, Dilip contacted BJP leaders back in Rajkot who got in touch with the district administration and police. “Teams of disaster management and fire brigade were able to find my wife’s body, but my son-in-law and granddaughter are still missing,” said Dilip, who works with Sardar Patel Institute of Public Administration in Ahmedabad. The rescuers unsuccessfully searched for them in the river stretch between Rishikesh and Haridwar on Tuesday. They will resume the search in the river beyond Haridwar on Wednesday morning. It was a second marriage for both Dilip and Tarulata, said police, adding that Tarulata wanted to perform ceremonies for her late husband, so the family had planned the trip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-of-rajkot-family-swept-away-in-rishikesh/articleshow/87495164.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants anticipatory bail to TISS student charged with sedition||Mumbai: The Bombay high court has granted anticipatory bail to a 22-year-old student of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), who was charged with sedition last year for allegedly shouting slogans in support of jailed JNU student Sharjeel Imam at an LGBTQ event in the city. In an order passed on October 30, a single bench presided over by Justice NJ Jamadar confirmed the interim protection from arrest given earlier to the student, Urvashi Chudawala, and granted her anticipatory bail after it was informed by the prosecution that only forensic reports were awaited in the ongoing probe in the case. The HC directed Chudawala to co-operate with probe into the case and prohibited her from leaving the country without prior permission from the court. In February last year, the police had booked Chudawala and 50 others under sedition charges for raising “anti-national” slogans in support of Imam and against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), at the Mumbai Pride Gathering event organised on February 1 at Azad Maidan. Imam has been arrested for allegedly delivering an inflammatory speech and inciting violence during CAA-NRC protests in 2019. Chudawala had approached the HC soon after seeking anticipatory bail. At the time, another single bench of the high court had granted her interim relief and said that in the event of her arrest, Chudawala be released on a personal bond of Rs 20,000. On October 30, while disposing of the plea, Justice Jamadar noted that while granting her interim protection on February 11, last year, the HC had said in its order that merely raising slogans did not amount to sedition. Justice Jamadar said the court’s observations made then continued to be relevant at the present stage.

---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypolls: Dalit Bandhu fails to win the day for TRS||HYDERABAD: The Rs 10 lakh Dalit Bandhu scheme, touted to be the mother of all welfare schemes, failed to sway the electorate in favour of the ruling TRS in the Huzurabad bypolls, the results of which were announced on Tuesday. That the BJP polled 135 votes more than TRS in Shalapally village, where the Dalit Bandhu scheme was formally launched by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, would have been the biggest shocker for the pink party. The CM had also addressed a public meeting here during the launch. While BJP’s Eatala Rajender eventually beat TRS’ Gellu Sriniva Yadav by a margin of about 24,000 votes, jury is still out on how the Dalits voted and if heartburn among other poorer sections, currently out of the ambit of the scheme, cost the party dear. The poll pattern would be clear once booth-wise poll data is out. A cursory look at a few polling booths having Scheduled Caste voters in large numbers point to a split in the Dalit vote. For instance, in booth number 153 in Shayampet village of Jammikunta mandal, the TRS got 436 votes as against 152 by BJP. While in booth number 154 in the village, the BJP polled 251 votes and the TRS 249. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had repeatedly assured that Dalit Bandhu would be extended to all 18 lakh Dalit families and implemented in the entire state covering poorer sections from BC and other communities in a phased manner. But voters seemed to have believed the opposition BJP and Congress rhetoric that the scheme was an election stunt and KCR would discontinue it after the bypoll. TRS government had also released Rs 2,000 crore for implementation of the scheme in Huzurabad, but the ECI put brakes on it, resulting in renewed suspicion about its fate after the bypoll, analysts said. The opposition had also raked up the issue of KCR not fulfilling his promises to make a Dalit the CM, not distributing three acres to poor SCs and also accused him of not doing enough on the SC categorisation demand. All this may have impacted voters or they may decided to stick with MLA Eatala Rajender analysts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-bypolls-dalit-bandhu-fails-to-win-the-day-for-trs/articleshow/87495154.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Noida||Air slightly better, but Ghaziabad still country’s most polluted city||GHAZIABAD: For the second day in a row, the district on Tuesday emerged as the most polluted city in the country. Ghaziabad recorded a slightly better AQI of 334 on Tuesday compared to 363 on Monday but Tuesday's AQI also made it the most polluted city in India for the fourth time this season. Previously, the district had recorded an AQI of 349 on October 16 and an AQI of 321 on October 21-the highest recorded AQIs in the country on those dates. Out of the four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad, Loni remained a pollution hotspot on Tuesday, recording an AQI of 381. This was followed by Sanjay Nagar with an AQI of 321. Meanwhile, Vasundhara and Indirapuram recorded AQIs of 301. According to IMD, the district's AQI is currently 'very poor', mainly due to PM2.5, and the chances are that it will remain so for the next two days. However, the impact of stubble burning on air quality is currently low. On Tuesday, the share of crop residue burning in PM2.5 was only 6%, and the 'effective' fire count was 1,795, according to SAFAR data. This contribution may remain low due to winds coming from the southwest and southeast directions, the SAFAR website predicted. However, pollutants are not as easily dispersed in winter as in summer, which contributes to poor air quality. On the other hand, to curtail industrial pollution, the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) is currently carrying out site inspections and imposing heavy fines on polluters. Noida's air quality also continued to remain 'very poor' with AQI dipping to 303 on Tuesday from 301 the previous day. On the other hand, Greater Noida's AQI improved from 306 on Monday to 276 on Tuesday, taking the air quality level from 'very poor' to 'poor'. With an AQI of 303, Delhi recorded ‘very poor’ quality air for the first time on Tuesday. Previously, it had recorded the highest AQI of 298 on October 17. Though it had touched the “very poor” range that day for some hours, the 24-hour average AQI improved later in the day after rain. Dipankar Saha, former head at the Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory, said, “The wind speed has been fluctuating between 2 -4 m/sec in Delhi. The lowest wind speed recorded in the city at 2 m/s is categorised as calm wind. The low local wind speed has led to accumulation of pollutants. The situation will remain the same for the next few days and pollutants may start dispersing after the festival.” The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the ‘very poor’ category and likely to remain so for the next two days. The impact of stubble burning is expected to be low due to unfavourable winds coming from south-west and east direction. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is about 6% (effective fire count 1,795). Prevailing shallow mixing layer height reduces dispersion of pollutants.” SAFAR added that during November 4-6 (Diwali and the next two days), the share of stubble burning in PM2.5 is expected to be in the range of 20-38% as the wind direction is likely to change to north-westerly. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “We need a clear strategy in Delhi and across the region to prevent a full-blown smog episode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/air-slightly-better-but-gzb-still-countrys-most-polluted-city/articleshow/87496613.cms||---

Haryana STF had recently arrested some people involved in a similar racket and the gang members allegedly hacked computers and offered answers to exam questions in exchange for money. It was found that the gang members had been solving papers of various online and offline exams, including those conducted by the SSC, Indian Railways, NEET and IIT. The arrested men are from Haryana’s Sonipat and Jind and Rajasthan’s Jaipur and Panawala. On Tuesday, Haryana Police contacted their counterparts in Noida to get details about those arrested on Monday. “Haryana Police contacted us. We have also asked them to help us with any links that might come to light,” a police officer involved in the investigations told TOI. According to the police, the centre of operation of those arrested on Monday is Haryana. A police team has been sent to the state to check if the Haryana Constable GD question paper found in the accused men’s phone matched the actual one. Sector 58 SHO Vinod Kumar said a model question paper has been recovered from one of the men. “We are verifying the document,” he said. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said their probe will focus on where the accused sourced question papers from and how many “solvers” have been sent against real candidates. “So far, about four other names have come up,” he said. The SHO said WhatsApp chats recovered from the mobile phones of the arrested men, Umesh, Satnam and Lakhan, were about leaking question papers of government exams. “The discussions revolved around where and to whom they would sell the papers to,” he added. He said one of the gang members who is yet to be arrested is a former Merchant Navy officer. “We are getting more details. It seems that some people were removed from their jobs during the lockdown and they started getting involved in illegal activities,” he said. The cops will approach the court to get hold of mobile phones belonging to some of the accused, which will then be sent to the surveillance unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cops-try-to-find-out-if-arrested-men-have-links-with-other-gangs/articleshow/87496604.cms||Shikha Salaria

The by-election was necessitated after Delkar had committed suicide in a Mumbai hotel in February. Kalaben and her son then joined Shiv Sena which offered her the ticket for DNH. Kalaben polled close to 59.51% (1,16,834 votes) of the total votes and won by a margin of nearly 51,000 votes, defeating her nearest BJP rival Mahesh Gavit. This is the highest ever victory margin in DNH polls. "I thank all the people of the constituency for the sentiments they have shown towards my late husband and instilling their trust in me. I will try my best to fulfill this trust," the 50-year-old said after the results. Even as Shiv Sena leaders including Sanjay Raut and others had camped in DNH, Kalaben made a spectacular electoral foray riding on a sympathy wave given the popularity of her late husband who had won this seat a record seven times. “First step outside Maharashtra, giant leap towards Delhi via Dadra Nagar Haveli!,” Raut, the Shiv Sena spokesman tweeted. "I congratulate Kalaben Delkar for winning the elections. We will analyze the results and see what needs to be done," said Gavit, the former DNH district panchayat vice-president and a former cop. Meanwhile, Congress’s poor electoral performance continued with its candidate Mahesh Dhodi losing his deposit. BJP too had also engaged star campaigners including Smriti Irani, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Manoj Tiwari, Parshottam Rupala, Ashwini Vaishnaw. Mohan Delkar had committed suicide at Hotel Sea Green in Marine Drive, leaving behind a 15-page suicide note in which he allegedly named Administrator of Daman, Diu and DNH, Praful Patel and other officials for continuous harassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sena-bags-first-ls-seat-outside-maha/articleshow/87495181.cms||---

---||Chennai||Headmistress & teacher of Chennai corporation school transferred over caste row||CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation issued a showcause notice and transferred the head mistress and a teacher of a primary school in MGR Nagar after the teacher made public batch details with names and caste of students. The leak revealed that a particular class had been segregated based on caste when the usual practice is to divide students into batches in alphabetical order. While the civic body’s education department said this was unintentional, it set up an inquiry committee to look into the issue and added that action would be taken as per rules. The issue came to light when the details were shared on a WhatsApp group with both students and parents a day before the school reopened on November 1. Corporation deputy commissioner, education, D Sneha told TOI that no other school divided students on the basis of caste. “We are checking this and will set it right, if it is found elsewhere too,” she said. On Tuesday, a fresh list for Class IV B in alphabetical order was again shared in the group. The hea mistress, who is in-charge of the school, reiterated that the teacher did not mean to make the caste details public. “The teacher has helped a lot of students get scholarships and helped them improve in their academics. We usually note down caste details of all students in a register as the state announced many schemes for certain castes. This is done routinely just for their benefit and not to discriminate them. But I agree, sharing it on the group was a mistake. It was unintentional,” she said. One of the activists who brought this to light said parents were aware that caste details are collected for the purpose, but making the data public was unfair. “This kind of discrimination takes place in many private schools. We wanted to set a precedent so discrimination based on caste doesn’t happen in any school. Students look up to teachers. They must be fair and very cautious when it comes to such issues. Even when children are eligible for welfare schemes, they are called out openly in front of everyone which may make things awkward,” the activist told TOI on condition of anonymity. A student from a government school told TOI he felt embarrassed when called up to collect free slippers and bags as part of a scheme for SC students. “While I wanted it badly, all my friends are now aware of my caste and it makes me feel like I’m beneath them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/headmistress-teacher-of-corpn-school-transferred-over-caste-row/articleshow/87495203.cms||Komal Gautham

Punbus and PRTC contract workers’ union president Resham Singh Gill said nearly 7,500 contract workers are demanding job regularisation for which they have had several meetings with the state government, including new transport minister Amarinder Singh Raja Warring. He said that during the last meeting held on October 12, the state government had sought 20 days’ time to regularise them but the deadline ended on Tuesday without any action from the government’s side to fulfil promise. Gill said their issue was not even taken up in the cabinet meeting held on Monday in Chandigarh. He added that even the contractual employees have not yet got the salaries in their accounts whereas the state government had assured them a hike this time. The protesting contractual employees had on September 14 decided to resume operations of buses in the state from September 15 after an assurance from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punbus-prtc-contractual-employees-threaten-to-halt-bus-operations-if-not-regularised/articleshow/87495971.cms||---

UT adviser Dharam Pal said earlier, the meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, but now the final decision will be taken next week, when UT and MC officials will review the proposal of the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Human Settlement (IIHS). In the last meeting, the Bengaluru-based consultant was asked to make some changes in their plan, he added. Recently, the UT administration had asked the Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) to submit a revised draft policy on village development, regularisation of illegal structures and extension of Lal Dora. UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit had asked the administration to utilise available vacant land in the city as per the Master Plan-2031, leading to the UT administration looking at overcoming the constraint of land availability through introduction of a land pooling policy. The Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Human Settlement has been entrusted with the task of formulating a land aggregation and pooling policy. The policy will help the administration utilise surplus land for development works which figure in the city’s Master Plan. The administration has asked different departments to submit details of their available, encroached land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-to-take-call-on-land-pooling-policy-next-week-adviser/articleshow/87495172.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the health centre, which is the first of 75 such facilities planned under the Amrit Mahotsav to celebrate 75 years of independence. The health centre has been dedicated in the memory of Colonel VS Babu. “Every citizen must get timely healthcare services. Through these centres, poor and needy people will get affordable health services. NMC has taken a good decision,” Gadkari said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari informed that NMC has been organizing health care camps to provide quality healthcare services to citizens. The civic body has identified locations for the remaining 74 health centres across all 10 zones. The centres are coming up adjacent to community halls or where no public primary health care services are available. Deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram said NMC is providing infrastructure while the health centres shall be run with the help of NGOs. “Primary medical health services would be provided at a nominal fee charge of Rs10. Manpower, including doctor, nurses, receptionist and medicines would be provided by the NGO,” he said. Meshram said some civil works are pending for the 74 centres but gradually all will start, with the deadline of December 2021. “Every centre shall have a cabin each for the doctor and pharmacist, and separate washrooms beside counter and wait area,” he said. NMC will foot the electricity, water and sanitation charges at these centres. If some centres have spare space, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has proposed a couple of oxygenated beds. NMC has received around 150 oxygen concentrators from different NGOs and organisations. NMC had called for expression of interest from NGOs to run the health centres on the lines of Covid facilities being run during the second wave. “32 EOIs were received for the centres,” he said. Meshram said the health centres aim to cater to people from slum areas and below poverty line. Under the Amrut Mahotsav, NMC will also inaugurate Sickle Cell Research Centre at its Pachpaoli Maternity Home on Wednesday. The centre would be run in collaboration with Sickle Cell research unit of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad; Mahatme SAI Welfare Charitable Trust, and NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/first-of-75-vande-mataram-public-health-centres-inaugurated-by-nmc/articleshow/87495109.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Vadodara||Covid cases higher in Vadodara than in Surat, Ahmedabad since last week||Vadodara: Despite having a smaller population than Ahmedabad and Surat, Vadodara has been registering a higher number of Covid-19 cases for a week. While there is no explanation too this, the rise in cases has become a cause of concern. There have been differences in the Covid-19 data declared by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the state government. But since quite some time now, the numbers have been on the same line with only minor differences. Barring the exception of one day, Vadodara city and district has been witnessing higher cases than Ahmedabad and Surat for a week. While there is no concrete explanation for the rising numbers, officials said that it could be because of crowding in the city and people not following Covid appropriate behaviour. Also, several new cases have been of people who have a history of travel. Former nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Sheetal Mistry said that it was difficult to ascertain why the numbers were comparatively high in the city. “But the cases are much milder now. The death rate has gone down significantly,” he said. Mistry, who is now a municipal councillor, however, said that we were far from a victory against Covid-19. “Many countries are seeing a surge. There is another variant AY.4.2 - a sub-lineage of the delta variant - that is spreading and can bypass immunity against Covid-19,” said Mistry. He added that strict quarantining of people detected with Covid-19 was a must now. “We have to work as aggressively as we did when the pandemic began,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-cases-higher-in-vadodara-than-in-surat-ahmedabad-since-last-week/articleshow/87495200.cms||Sachin Sharma

Joshi visited the site along with Manas Sarkar, MD, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the 16km East-West Metro of Kolkata’s Line 2, and other senior officials to review the progress of the ongoing construction. He checked the station, installation of various equipments and passenger interchange points with Eastern Railway. East-West Metro now runs a truncated 6.97km between Sector V and Phoolbagan. The corridor can extend by another 2.3km till Sealdah only after the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) can inspect and give its nod. “We would have invited the CRS by now but completion of the station got delayed because some fire safety equipment did not reach us on time. We should be able to start the stretch by early 2022, after CRS authorization” Joshi said. Two platforms, 1A and 1B, on the east-bound track are being prepared for commercial use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-metros-sealdah-link-may-be-commissioned-early-next-year/articleshow/87495206.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||‘A Dhanteras to remember’, say families from Mumbai who got flats after 9 years||MUMBAI: Residents of a Santacruz (w) building who received possession of their redeveloped flats after nine years on Tuesday are thrilled to be back home. They were given “actual physical possession” of their flats by K Mordani Builders as ordered by Bombay high court on October 27. Justice Gautam Patel directed that nine members of The Santacruz West End CHSL be given possession on Dhanteras by 1 pm. Mordani had included their plot on 15th Road in a larger slum redevelopment project in Andheri. This resulted in delay as the Slum Development Authority demanded compliances from the developer and did not issue part-occupation certificate to their re-developed flats. The residents’ reactions to TOI reflected their emotions. Ajay Maheshwari (66) said he thought the wait would never end, and was apprehensive that the litigation would spill over to the next generation. “This order has made our life. We had almost lost hope. Most of us are senior citizens. We thought it would never end and we would not get to see our redeveloped flats in our lifetime; probably our children would also get involved in the litigation,’’ he said. Mamta Ashish said the residents are “overjoyed at the dynamic order” given by the HC. “It has restored our faith in the judiciary. It was a long wait. The news came in a beautiful way. It was spectacular a Dhanteras to remember,’’ she said. She said it was all the more emotional for her as her mother had passed away during the wait. “I’m very much relieved to be back in my mother’s home,” she added. Inder Bhatia (74) said he took his children along to see the 3BHK flat. “We are happy. It has all the amenities,’’ he informed joyfully. Deepa Rajani said, “It is nothing short of a miracle. It’s a wonderful Dhanteras gift from Justice G S Patel to all of us.” Thanking the judge, builder Kumar Mordani said, “His Lordship was like Lord Krishna for me as a developer and for the society members.” Society secretary Ashwin Shah said, “This is a happy day for us. We don’t want to look back at what we have gone through. We will look forward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/a-dhanteras-to-remember-say-families-who-got-flats-after-9-years/articleshow/87495998.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Allahabad||Allahabad University’s connection with Nobel winning research||PRAYAGRAJ: In the backdrop of the fact that the Nobel Committee has awarded the 2021 Physiology and Medicine Nobel Prize to two US scientists Ardem Patapoutian and David Julius for their discovery of the molecular basis for our ability to sense temperature and touch, this Nobel award winning research on capsaicin has an indirect connection with Allahabad University. The scientists, in their research, have used the pungent ingredient present in chilli peppers known as ‘capsaicin’ to decipher their study on pain receptors. The Nobel Committee has recognized the importance of capsaicin and awarded the 2021 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine to them for their seminal discoveries on pain and temperature sensing mechanisms of living systems based on the action of the chemical capsaicin. On the same lines, a research group under Prof SI Rizvi in the Biochemistry department here has been engaged in understanding the non-neuronal effects of capsaicin for the last 15 years. This research group has published a large number of research papers on the physiological and biochemical effects of capsaicin. Speaking on these studies, Prof Rizvi said that capsaicin, the chemical which gives ‘hot taste’ to chillis, is a very interesting molecule. “It binds to the same nerve endings on the skin which carry sensation of pain and also sensation of temperature. When capsaicin binds to these nerve endings, termed as nociceptors, the nerve is activated and we experience a sense of ‘hot’ feeling. However, when capsaicin binds to nociceptors or pain receptors for a longer time, the nerve becomes insensitive or numb,” he explained. This property of capsaicin to make the nerves, which carry sensation of pain, numb has opened up possibilities to use this pungent compound to mitigate pain. It is also a common observation that food tastes hotter when it is at a higher temperature. This is because capsaicin’s effect is augmented by hot temperature, explained Prof Rizvi. The research group at University of Allahabad has been engaged in research on the effects of capsaicin on the cell membrane. “We have explored a new dimension focused on the question as to why people in hot climatic regions eat more chillies,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/aus-connection-with-nobel-winning-research/articleshow/87496630.cms||---

Vaankozhi (turkey) biryani is among the special dishes prepared by restaurants in the city, particularly for Diwali. While several eateries have already received advance orders in tune with their production capacity, some are preparing to meet the overwhelming demand. Apart from crackers and new clothes, Diwali is synonymous with mouth-watering meat delicacies prepared either on the festival day or the day after. While mutton and chicken biryanis are the usual variants, Trichy has a tradition of offering turkey biryani for the festival. Families that prefer to enjoy the day without spending time in the kitchen and employers who give Diwali gifts to their employees were the ones who mostly placed the orders. “Business and demand have improved this festive season, even matching the pre-Covid trend. We have completed our bookings, but enquiries are continuing and we are planning to accept them too,” K M S Hakkim, proprietor, KMS Hakkim Kalyana Biriyani, told TOI. Hotels said people are opting for turkey biryani as an alternative to chicken biriyani though it costs more. Also, people were keen on ordering biryani made of seeraga samba rice than basmati variety that is slightly bigger in size. Cashing in on the demand, seasonal biryani outlets have cropped up in the commercial streets of the city. According to these entrepreneurs, there is about 10%-20% increase in the number of biryani outlets. Some have opted for home-made biryani by cooking in bulk based on orders at their home kitchen and delivering through food aggregators. “We have relaxed our price by 5% as part of the festive offer. Free home delivery within 3 km of our outlet is available too, the demand is increasing as people are eager to spend amid the pandemic,” V Prashanna, partner, Al Munnas Biriyani, said. As a compliment, eateries offer sweets for those booking bulk orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/eateries-in-trichy-get-sparkle-back-with-biryani-offers/articleshow/87495988.cms||Deepak Karthik

The demand was raised by UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit, who held a meeting with a team of Niti Aayog, including Prof Ramesh Chand, member, Kundan Kumar, IAS, adviser, Dr Biswanath Bishnoi, deputy adviser, in the presence of Dharam Pal, UT adviser, to discuss the issues of the administration lying pending at various ministries. Pal said it was UT’s important proposal and had asked the Niti Aayog to review the earlier decision, which has turned down the proposal. “The CIC is aimed to serve as a platform for collaborations between higher education, R&D institutions, Industries, investors, startups and government agencies, which can give to innovation led growth and employment,” Pal said. As per UT’s proposal, the CIC will have a board of directors, vision and oversight committee, a CEO, member institutions and heads and staff for different research areas. It will also have advisers for business, finance, IP and legal matters. The CIC will operate from a central location in Chandigarh, the space for which will be provided by the UT administration. The CIC that will be incorporated as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act 2013 will be connecting academic institutions, industries, administration and the government on a platform to boost economic and technological growth in the region. A Section 8 company is formed for charitable purpose, to promote education, art, commerce, social welfare. Any profit made by such company is further used for the promotion of the same. As a Section 8 company, the CIC will not make any profits for any agency. However, the money generated will further be used for CIC’s prime objectives.

Many businessmen in markets selling apparels for children,footwear, cosmetics and Diwali goodies said they have reached the 2019 level insales with families going on a buying spree. Before Diwali last year many retailers had to offer attractivediscounts to attract customers but sales did not shoot through the roof. This year however shops in Burrabazar, MG Road, CanningStreet, Ezra Street, Kalakar Street and other pockets started witnessing highfootfalls soon after Durga Puja. Sushil Poddar, president of Confederation of West BengalTrade Associations, said the positive from members was positive. “Membertraders are reporting very good sales figures before Diwali this year. Marketsare filled with shoppers since morning and shops are open till late in theevening. In many sections the business has reached the level of 2019,” saidPoddar. Traders selling apparels for children, footwears, householdfurnishings, cosmetics and Diwali goodies have reported better sales thanothers. Ramesh Saraf, who as an apparels store in Stayanarayan ACMarket on Kalakar Street said people were giving priority to buying clothes,footwear and other accessories for their children. “Many families who shoppedwith us said they wanted to buy gifts for the children because for the past 20months they have not had any occasion to celebrate due to COVID.” Shops selling various types of lights in Ezra Street, Pollockstreet and Chandni Market are getting customers even from outside the city. “Peopleare buying in bulk. We ahev also received orders from several complexes. Itseems people want to make up for the celebrations they could do last year,’said Mohammad Khurshid, a showpowner in Ezra Street. Vaccination has also played a big role in the surge in sales. “We have vaccinated more than one lakh traders and theiremployees through our vaccination camps in the last few months. So they aredoing business following COVID guidelines without any fear. Even buyers who arecoming are also vaccinated,” said Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zee-diwali-business-02/11/21/articleshow/87495229.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Skin microbe study soon for India’s low Covid death clue||Pune: Scientists at four top institutes in Pune and Bengaluru are set to study the unique composition of skin and oral microorganisms of Indians, as well as their distinct immune responses, which could give clues into why the Covid death rate in the country was relatively lower than among the European and American populations. Scientists spearheading the expansive study involving 800 volunteers said the relatively low Covid mortality in India perhaps had something to do with protection provided by the unique microbiota (community of micro organisms) on the skin, as well as in the oral and nasal cavities of Indians. The study will also assess the long-term immunity, up to nine months, after Covishield/Covaxin vaccination in healthy adults. “In-depth immunogenicity data will improve the ability to make public health decisions on need and timing for booster shots,” Dr Anand Kawade, lead principal investigator of the study from Pune-based KEM Hospital Research Centre told TOI. The other three institutions involved in the study include Pune based Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore Baptist Hospital and St John’s Research Institute in Bengaluru. On assessing the composition of skin and oral microbiome of volunteers before and nine months post-vaccination, Dr Kawade said, “Covid death rate in European and American populations is high in comparison to India. There are theories on distinct skin and mucosal microbiome as well as nutritional components in the Indian population. The study will thus characterise the microbiome in the saliva samples and skin of the 800 participants. The results can give clues into the role of this indigenous microbiome in protecting Indians from a greater number of Covid mortalities.” On the long-term immunity study, he said since Covaxin was an indigenous vaccine, there was a need for data on how long the immunity lasted after two doses of the vaccine. “Long term immunity for both Covishield and Covaxin will be assessed. Most such studies have been undertaken at the international level in western populations. A need for similar studies in India is being felt. If the immune response from both the vaccines persists for a long-term period of up to nine months, it will help the government estimate the need for booster doses too,” he said. Dr Kawade said the study would also lay a special focus on T-Cell response after vaccination with Covishield and Covaxin. “This is the most important part of the study. Though antibody response post vaccination tends to diminish overtime, the T-cell response is a more durable source of protection. Memory B-cells remember the infection and can thus provide long-term protection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/skin-microbe-study-soon-for-indias-low-covid-death-clue/articleshow/87495205.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||How a cafe gives blind women a chance to earn a livelihood||NEW DELHI: A live band performs in the background and the open kitchen is abuzz with activity as Kamala, Tara and Rajni busily deliver on orders for muffins, coffee, bread rolls, pakoras — and the all-time favourite: Maggie noodles with a touch of masalas and vegetables. It could be any other bustling cafe until one realises that the women behind the counter, serving, cooking and assisting in the kitchen are all visually impaired. That is when the name of the café, “Blind Bake”, begins to make sense. The concept café will open to the public from mid-November and is a step toward creating livelihood options for the female trainees at the NAB India-Centre for Blind Women and Disability Studies in Hauz Khas Enclave. A menu in Braille, a dedicated subway for the chefs and staff for better accessibility to the café and space for 50 on the picturesque lawn of the centre will make the café experience just that more memorable for guests. Blind Bake was officially launched with some guests and staff in attendance at the NAB Centre last Saturday. “Full-fledged operations will begin on November 15,” Shalini Khanna, founder-director of the centre, told TOI. “While limited seating services will be available to friends of NAB Centre and those in its neighbourhood, Blind Bake will provide delivery services to other parts of the city.” “Once a full-time canteen for the centre staff, Blind Bake now has a broader vision,” Khanna elaborated. “It aims not only at training bright and capable girls to find jobs or start their own cafes and tea enterprises, but also give them real-time exposure to income generation.” The centre offers skilling courses for visually impaired women and runs a hostel for 35 trainees. At present, four blind women work under the guidance of their teacher, Sheena Sahni, a professional baker. When TOI visited the café, Tara and Rajni were handling a wok of noodles. Breaking into a smile, Rajni disclosed that they greatly relied on the senses of touch, smell and perception. “Once we know about the exact placement of things in the kitchen and the exact measurement of ingredients, we can easily cook a particular dish. It just happens,” the 35-year-old resident of Rewari smiled. She has been part of the cooking course for a month now. The course and café have changed Rajni’s life. She admitted to being reluctant to meet people and preferring the indoors, dreading being judged by others. “Now I hope I will be able to open up and overcome my inhibitions,” she said before returning to assist Tara with another order for noodles. Kamala, 39, is the head chef and has her photograph embossed on the Braille menu placed on each table. Her inability to see did not stop Kamala from leaving her home in Nepal and coming all the way to Delhi to pick up new skills at the centre. She arrived just before the pandemic, and cooking has opened up new avenues for her to dream about. She now plans to hone her skills before returning home to her daughter and help her set up an enterprise of their own. Standing by the wok, Tara appears confident of the pace of cooking despite having just about 20% vision. The Kanpur native is most excited about meeting new people at the cafe. Sahni, a considerate guide to these women, revealed that as a sighted person, she tried to step into the shoes of the trainees. “I close my eyes and try to do things to understand the challenges my team confronts. Work is divided among the team members depending on each person’s capacity to handle tasks such as cleaning, chopping, frying and baking.” Welcoming the new space for a good cup of coffee for the area’s residents, Hauz Khas Enclave RWA president Praveen Gupta said Blind Bake was a much-needed idea that would encourage inclusion in enterprise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seeing-things-differently-how-a-cafe-gives-blind-women-a-chance-to-earn-a-livelihood/articleshow/87496651.cms||Ambika Pandit

However, no casualties were reported due to the incident. Fire officials said that the fire broke out in one of the many depots located in a narrow lane and spread further to the neighbouring godowns. Firemen from all fire stations along with 20 vehicles were pressed into service to douse the flames. People living in the locality said that they saw smoke before the depot got engulfed. They suspected that the smoke must have been due to fire-crackers. “Prima facie it seems that a lit firecracker may have fallen in the depot that sparked the fire and engulfed two godowns,” said a fire official. The fire also gutted two to three shanties adjoining the godowns. “The godowns are located in a narrow lane and there were many residential buildings too in the neighbourhood so fire-fighting was difficult,” the official said. Along with fire-fighting through the narrow lane, strong winds too posed a problem. Around 15 houses were evacuated by firemen as a precautionary measure. It took over six hours to douse the fire. But until Tuesday early morning fire tenders were kept on stand-by at the site when the charred rubble was being removed. “It was even difficult to go back to fire stations for refilling, so we drew water from Harni pond using pumps,” a fireman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/major-fire-ravages-timber-depots-near-harni-pond/articleshow/87495242.cms||---
---||Mumbai||First Maharashtra bandh was ‘great triumph of working class’||Most of the red flags at Maharashtra’s first statewide bandh were literal. Stones remained largely unthrown and buses unburnt in the city on the Wednesday of August 12, 1964. The 24-hour token strike saw droves of mill workers marching with flags and posters towards the Collectors’ office amid pouring rain, even as middle-class office-goers shouted anti-price-rise slogans outside their respective workplaces. Restaurants were shut despite being allowed to remain open, BEST buses and Victoria carriages were missing in action, and local trains wore an empty look on this day when none of the 64 textile mills in the city breathed out black smoke. Supervisory staff at State Bank of India conducted “some restricted business”, according to a TOI report, and foodgrain handlers at Mumbai’s docks, railway yards and government godowns continued to work, chiefly to prevent the supply of irony. The hartal, after all, was against the rising prices and shortage of food. The largely peaceful maiden statewide strike was organised as a precursor to a Bharat bandh by various leftist opposition parties, including the Hind Mazdoor Panchayat, the Samyukta Socialist Party, the Peasants and Local Workers Party and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha (whose head, George Fernandes, would soon gift Oxford dictionary the word ‘bandh’). It was considered essential by the parties who had adjudged the “capitalism-ridden” Congress government incapable of solving the issue of spiralling prices for fear of alienating wholesale food trade. Gujarat was still recovering from a violent bandh the previous week, and the city had already seen two peaceful bandhs in July 1958 and August 1963 when Maharashtra prepared for its bandh debut. “A peaceful bandh is absolutely essential. No bandh would help the country more,” a column in this paper argued pre-emptively, after comparing the imminent state-wide bandh to the general strike at the height of the Indo-China war of 1962 in intensity. Incidentally, the demand for a pre-Diwali bonus by the textile labour was also an issue behind the bandh that aimed to make the rulers “bow to public opinion”. In the lead-up, Fernandes warned the authorities against using the police and the home guards as “black legs” British-speak for strike-breakers. The Congress government decided not to oppose the strike, saying it expressed the “pent-up feelings of resentment” of the people. VP Naik, then chief minister, had called upon the people to face the food situation in a “disciplined manner” and state transport drivers were asked not to resist “if the opposition were to carry out its threat of making volunteers lie down before the buses,” as per a TOI report. The peaceful bandh, which started at midnight with taxis disappearing and ended with the cops rounding up a few “bad characters”, was hailed by the organisers as a “great triumph of the working class”. Some highlighted the strain on the economy. Others criticised the government for being too lenient. Though the outcome on food supply is unclear, uninterrupted water supply may have been one of the side-effects of the strike, during which workers of the civicl water department did not turn up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stones-remained-unthrown-and-buses-unburnt-during-states-first-bandh/articleshow/87496003.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Pune||Covid-19: Pune Municipal Corporation increases second jab quota to 90% at sites||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has increased its second jab quota to 90% owing to the slow response to the first dose vaccination against Covid-19. Now, 90 out of 100 doses would be reserved for the second dose beneficiaries at each designated free vaccination site. Earlier, the second dose quota was 60%. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s chief immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar, told TOI, “We are shifting our focus towards the beneficiaries awaiting their second dose. More than seven lakh beneficiaries will be eligible from the Pune civic limits alone this month and more will be joining the list in December.” According to Devkar, there has been quite a slowdown in the response to the daily vaccination in the past few days. With the ongoing festive season, the authorities are prepared for a further dip. The civic official said they had achieved 100% first dose vaccination in terms of target figures, but still there was a possibility of some pockets in the urban areas remaining unvaccinated because of the floating population. “We have asked our ward officers to identify and sensitise citizens in such areas,” Devkar said. Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director from the state public health services, said the next target for them was to achieve 70% double vaccination by November-end for the Pune district, which currently stood at around 54%, and 100% first dose vaccination, which was around 95% now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-increases-second-jab-quota-to-90-at-sites/articleshow/87495218.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cops look for Chaki murder weapons, loot||KOLKATA: A detective department team visited a south Kolkata address and Diamond Harbour on Tuesday in search of the items stolen after the murder of Kilburn Engineering MD Subir Chaki and his driver Rabin Mandal at the Chakis’ Kankulia Road on October 17. Police are also trying to recover the murder weapons, based on the questioning of prime accused Vickey Haldar and associate Subhankar Mondal. Police said Vickey was still changing his statements but it appeared he had approached a relative-cum-friend, with links in Diamond Harbour, and handed him a few items belonging to Chaki and his driver in exchange for money. This was apart from the money Vickey had collected from his office to flee the city a day after the murder, claimed sources. Vickey and Subhankar, after being arrested in Mumbai, were brought to Kolkata and produced in Alipore court on Tuesday. They were remanded in police custody till November 13. Public prosecutor Sourin Ghoshal told the court the police custody was required to recover the weapons, stolen booty and reconstruct the crime. They also needed to be questioned whether anyone else was involved, Ghoshal said. Vickey had worked as a guard in Mumbai a year ago, when he had picked up English and Hindi. Subhankar, a labourer, first met Vickey at a construction site on Fern Road, where he was the supervisor, an officer said. He had left his Basanti home three years ago after he was caught stealing and had returned once to take his clothes, his parents told cops. “Among those present at Chaki’s home, Vickey and Subhankar were closest. The others were recruited by Vickey’s mother Mithu,” cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-look-for-chaki-murder-weapons-loot/articleshow/87495223.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Social distancing protocols went for a toss as customers thronged the stores soon after the shops opened for business in the morning. Though one gram of gold cost Rs 4,645 in Ranchi, the jewellery stores witnessed a steady stream of customers since morning. Vivek Kumar Singh, the floor in charge of a Tanishq showroom in GEL Church Complex in Main Road, said business was up by 30% from last year. “Last year, lockdown and Covid-19 had left the people with very little to spend. But this year, the business is just like pre-pandemic times on Dhanteras. We are hopeful it will be steady throughout November,” Singh said. Another Main Road-based prominent jewellery store owner said: “On Dhanteras last year, we had transactions worth Rs 15 crore. Considering the footfall and upcoming wedding season, we hope that the business will be good.” Like the jewellery stores, the city's automobile showrooms also witnessed a steady stream of customers through the day. “In 2020, we sold 950 cars on Dhanteras. This year, we have projected that around 1,100 cars will be sold in November,” Rajiv Sinha, the chief general manager of Premsons Motors, told TOI. However, Sinha said the sales have been somewhat affected by the shortage of semiconductors due to a global crisis, which has curtailed the production of automobiles to an extent. “Because of the shortage of semiconductors, there is a shortage in production and hence in supplies,” Sinha said. Hike in fuel prices have not played any role in dampening the spirit of car buyers this Dhanteras, the dealers claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/traders-happy-as-buyers-flock-to-stores-on-dhanteras/articleshow/87495313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||New surveillance mechanism for TB patients||Ranchi: In order to ensure 100% compliance of medicines and to keep a real time medication surveillance among drug resistant Tuberculosis (TB) patients, the state department of health in collaboration with USAID has launched a Medication Event and Monitor Reminder (MERM) box for the first time in the country. Around 200 MERM boxes have been provided to state TB cells for distribution among TB patients so that they do not miss out on their respective doses and their surveillance could be done on a real time basis. The head of state TB cell, Dr Ranjit Prasad, said, “The box has been fitted with micro-chips and has a cellular connectivity and the medicines have been placed as per their schedule in the box in five different slots. Once a patient takes his first dose, a green light buzzes in it and the same is communicated to the TB portal which confirms the consumption of dosage by the patient.” He added that if a patient does not open the medicine box, as per schedule, then an alarm will beep in the box as a reminder to the patient and an alert will be initiated on the portal if the patient does not take the medicine. “Soon after the treatment, the supervisor will receive an alert on the portal if a patient misses the medicine. He/she will contact the patient and will ask him/her to take the medicine as continuing the medication as per schedule is very vital for eliminating drug-resistant TB,” Dr Prasad said. Asked how MERM box is going to be beneficial in the fight against TB, Dr Prasad said that it will ease the burden from the treatment support program which is vital in treating patients. “The real-time data will help us in tracking the patient’s medication and the treatment support program will have better information on the patient’s medication and their pattern.” Asked about the current number of TB patients in Jharkhand, a senior official from National Health Mission (NHM) said that there are over 41,000 TB patients, of which over 27,000 are being treated at state-run hospitals while over 14,000 patients are admitted in private hospitals. According to NHM officials, over 200 patients of drug resistant TB are present in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/new-surveillance-mechanism-for-tb-patients/articleshow/87495259.cms||Gaurav Pandey

A city-based tyre shop has launched the scheme on Dhanteras that aims to attract buyers by gifting a litre of petrol/diesel on purchase of two tyres. Gambhir Tyre House proprietor Satnam Singh Gambhir said the scheme is limited to Diwali. But he said the objective of the scheme is not to make profit. “Gifting one litre of petrol/diesel to the buyer on Diwali is an attempt to draw the attention of the government towards the problems commoners are experiencing on account of fuel price hike,” said Gambhir. On the inaugural hour, three buyers received one litre of petrol on buying two bike tyres each, respectively. “It’s delight to get a litre of petrol as a free gift on Diwali,” said Jayant Jaggi, who availed of the offer. A tyre shop owner on Sakchi Kalimati Road said whenever the cost of the onions and petrol increased in the recent years, he came up with different schemes offering free onions or petrol on the purchase of tyres. “In recent years, price of the onions used to decline after a period of time, this time neither the fuel price nor the onion price is declining,” Gambhir added. The price of onion in the city is ranging between Rs 45 and Rs 50 per kg. Keeping the increasing trend intact, petrol price was Rs 104.10 per litre and diesel cost Rs 103.72 per litre in the city on Tuesday. “Festival or normal day, people have become rational in bying petrol. Trend suggests that customers are buying petrol according to daily requirement,” said petrol station proprietor Harvinder Singh Bhatia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/diwali-gift-buy-tyres-get-free-petrol-diesel-in-steel-city/articleshow/87495381.cms||---
