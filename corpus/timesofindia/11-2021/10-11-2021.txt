According to Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation, a trial run for Kanpur Metro priority corridor beat Lucknow’s priority corridor trails by a margin of 69 days. The unique record became the centre of attention also because the project was halted for four and a half months during the corona pandemic period. The Corporation claimed that it took 795 days for the Lucknow Metro to start. The construction of Lucknow Metro started on September 28, 2014, and trail run was conducted on December 1, 2016. While in Kanpur Metro project, the construction started on November 15, 2019, and first official trial will begin on Wednesday post flag off by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In total, it took only 726 days for Kanpur Metro to start trials. Speaking on anonymity, a senior engineer of UPMRC said, “There are four prime reasons behind the unique record of Kanpur Metro. First, we used double T-girders to erect the station concourse. It was for the first time in India for the Metro project that girders were pre-casted at the factory floor and then brought to the construction site which were installed with the help of heavy lifter cranes. This method helped us to save time.” “Secondly, we utilized the corona pandemic lockdown as an opportunity by expediting the construction in those areas of the Metro corridor which were often heavily congested during normal days. In order to ensure that labour is available during the corona pandemic, we constructed a labour colony and provided a food canteen, shelter with attached toilets and drinking water facilities. In fact, the project was halted for four and a half months in the pandemic and we arranged transportation facilities for those labourers who wanted to visit their villages to meet their dear ones. Such steps built confidence and motivated them to return and work for the project,” said the officer. “Thirdly, we had crystal clear understanding with construction contractors. If they had any issues be it financial, material or anything else the contractors were asked to directly contact senior officials for immediate remedies. Lastly, we kept the uniform standard for the entire project — which means almost every girder or pillar is similar, which helped contractors to expedite the construction,” said the corporation engineer. Kanpur Metro priority corridor is 9-km-long and stretches between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel with nine stations, while Lucknow Metro trail stretch has eight stations in 8.7- km-long stretch between Transport Nagar and Charbagh. The Kanpur Metro project is funded by the European Investment Bank. Around 650 million euros (Rs 11076.48 crore) are being pumped into the project to construct two corridors, including a 23.7-km-long stretch between IIT-Kanpur and Naubasta and 8.6-km-long stretch between Agriculture University and Barra- sector 8. The entire cost of the Kanpur Metro project is expected to be realised within five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kanpur-metro-trials-beat-lucknow-trials-by-69-days-says-upmrc/articleshow/87614080.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Two other suspects had been nabbed a couple of weeks ago. "The terror operatives arrested late on Monday were directly in touch with the terrorists who engaged in gunfights with the Army in the forests of Bhatta Durrian in Mendhar and Thannamandi area of Rajouri last month," an official said. Security forces have been scouring the dense forested areas of the frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch for weeks without success to trace the retreating terrorists. The focus is now on rounding up those who facilitated their movement and passed on crucial information that helped them keep the forces at bay. "According to intelligence inputs, more than 12 people were part of the network that assisted the heavily armed terrorists who infiltrated into J&K from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir," a source said. The overground workers arrested from Thannamandi and Mendhar have all been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other laws. Of the nine Army personnel killed in action, two were junior commissioned officers. Five soldiers died during a combing operation in the forested Chamrer region of Surankote on October 11. Another four were killed in a second gunfight with the terrorists on October 14 at Bhatta Durrian in Mendhar tehsil of Poonch district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-held-for-helping-terrorists-kill-9-soldiers-in-jammu-forest-ambush/articleshow/87614227.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Pakistan government ready to give a chance of peace to militants who want to shun violence: Minister Fawad Chaudhry||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Tuesday that the government was willing to give a chance of peace to those militants who were willing to shun violence and accept the Constitution. Briefing the media after a Cabinet meeting which among other issues discussed the prevailing security situation of the country, Chaudhry said that certain groups linked with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) wanted to leave violence and the government too wanted to give them a chance to return to normal life. "There are various groups within TTP; there are (some) ideologues, while there are others who joined the organisation under compulsion. The state of Pakistan wants to give its citizens a chance if all of them, some of them or a fraction of them, want to come back and show their allegiance to the Constitution of Pakistan," the minister said. His remarks came a day after the top military brass briefed the lawmakers about national security situation. According to political sources, Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa made it clear that talks with the TTP would be held within the framework of the Constitution. It was said in the briefing that the TTP would have to follow the Constitution, surrender arms and get its activists registered with the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) to get national identity cards, according to sources. The TTP also in a statement has acknowledged that a month long ceasefire had been agreed from November 9 during talks with the government, which were going under the mediation of the Afghan Taliban. Chaudhry had said on Monday that a ceasefire had been reached between the government and the banned militant group. In his press briefing, the minister said that the new government in Afghanistan wanted Pakistan to negotiate a deal with the TTP. "We believe the new authorities in the neighbouring country want peace in Pakistan," he said. Talking about Afghanistan, the minister said Pakistan would not accept the Taliban government until all regional powers agreed to recognise the new Afghan administration. But he added that Pakistan would continue to provide help. He also said that the Cabinet decided to form a special fund to help Afghanistan to tackle the looming food crisis. Chaudhry also announced that Pakistan would send sufficient amount of wheat and rice to Afghanistan and also slash all taxes on imports from Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-government-ready-to-give-a-chance-of-peace-to-militants-who-want-to-shun-violence-minister-fawad-chaudhry/articleshow/87614823.cms||---

The Dragon vehicle, dubbed Endeavour, parachuted into the sea off the Florida coast as planned just after 10:30 p.m. EST on Monday (0330 GMT Tuesday), following a re-entry descent through Earth's atmosphere carried live by a Nasa webcast. Real-time infrared thermal video imaging captured a glimpse of the capsule streaking like a meteor through the night sky over the Gulf minutes before splashdown. Applause was heard from the flight control center as the four main parachutes inflated above the capsule, seen drifting down toward the Gulf surface and slowing to about 15 miles per hour (24 kph) before dropping gently into the calm sea. "Endeavour, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home to planet Earth," a voice from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles was heard telling the crew as a safe splashdown was confirmed. "It's great to be back," one of the astronauts radioed in reply. The return capped 199 full days in orbit, the longest ever for an entire U.S.-launched crew, according to Kathy Lueders, associate Nasa chief for space operations. It surpassed the previous 168-day record set by the predecessor SpaceX-Nasa mission earlier this year, she said. Within an hour of splashdown, the capsule was hoisted from the ocean to the deck of a recovery ship, and the four astronauts were seen emerging one by one from Endeavour's hatch. Two Nasa astronauts on the flight - pilot Megan McArthur, 50, and mission commander Shane Kimbrough, 54 - were the first two out of the vehicle. They were followed by Japanese crew mate Akihiko Hoshide, 52, and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet, 43, a French engineer from the European Space Agency. Each flashed smiles and a V-for-victory sign as they were helped onto waiting gurneys, unable to immediately bear their own weight after months in microgravity. They were to undergo brief medical checkups then be flown to shore via helicopter. FIERY RE-ENTRYOperating autonomously, the spacecraft began its eight-hour return voyage earlier in the day with a 90-minute fly-around of the space station as the crew snapped a series of survey photographs of the orbiting outpost, circling the globe some 250 miles (400 km) above. The Crew Dragon then proceeded through a series of maneuvers over the course of the day to bring it closer to Earth ahead of its final night-time descent. Propelled by one last ignition of its forward rocket thrusters for a "de-orbit burn," the capsule re-entered the atmosphere at about 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kph) for a free-fall toward the ocean below, during which crew communications were lost for several minutes. Intense friction generated as the capsule plunged through the atmosphere slowed its descent while sending temperatures surrounding the outside of the vehicle soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,927 degrees Celsius). The bottom of the capsule is covered by a shield that dissipates the heat, preventing the spacecraft from incinerating. The four astronauts were launched to orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 23. It was the third crew sent to the space station under Nasa's fledgling public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also founded electric car maker Tesla Inc. The returning team was designated "Crew 2" because it marks the second "operational" crew that Nasa has launched aboard a SpaceX capsule since resuming human space flights from American soil last year, after a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011. The replacement team, "Crew 3," was originally slated to fly to the space station at the end of October, but that launch has been delayed by weather problems and an unspecified medical issue involving one of the four crew members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nasa-spacex-crew-returns-from-record-mission-aboard-international-space-station/articleshow/87615012.cms||---
---||India||Village in area under China’s ‘adverse occupation’ since 1959, can’t do much: Official||NEW DELHI: The Indian security establishment on Tuesday sought to downplay the festering controversy over China’s construction of a new village on the disputed border in the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh by stressing the area in question had been under Beijing’s occupation since 1959. The fact, however, remains that the large 100-home village on the banks of River Tsari Chu is on territory claimed by India, and its construction last year violates bilateral agreements between the two countries. “The village is on territory which the Indian Army describes as ‘adverse occupation’ by China. We can do little about it,” said an official. China, in fact, has been building as many as 628 ‘xiaokang’ model border defence villages along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, over the last few years. “While most of these villages are on the Chinese side of the LAC, some are on disputed territory like the one in question in Arunachal Pradesh,” said the official. This particular village came into focus once again last week after the latest Pentagon report on China’s military power made a reference to Beijing building the “large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the Tibet Autonomous Region and Arunachal Pradesh” last year, as was reported by TOI. Reacting to this on Tuesday, official sources in the Indian security establishment said, “The village along the disputed border in the Upper Subansiri district is on territory controlled by China. They have, for years, maintained an army post in the region and the various constructions undertaken by the Chinese have not happened in a short time.” “The village has been built by China in an area that was occupied by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) after overrunning an Assam Rifles post in 1959, in the operation known as Longju incident along the frontier in Arunachal Pradesh,” the sources added. But there is also major concern that China is staking claim to disputed areas by continuing to settle people, who are provided with all amenities and hefty subsidies, in border areas. Moreover, these “dual-use” villages can act as “extended troop cantonments” in times of hostilities. It is also seen as violating Article VII of the 2005 bilateral agreement, which laid down the “guiding principles for the settlement” of the India-China boundary question”. It clearly specifies: “In reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of their settled populations in the border areas.” Referring to this, an official said, “China can use this to claim its settled populations in such villages should not be disturbed when the boundary is finalized. China, in effect, will lay claim to such areas as undisputed.” “It is, of course, another matter that the boundary settlement between India and China is nowhere on the horizon. China, in fact, has so far even refused to ‘clarify’ the LAC, which will help prevent or reduce face-offs. The Ladakh standoff has only hardened stands in the two countries,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/village-under-chinas-adverse-occupation-since-1959-cant-do-much-official/articleshow/87615274.cms||Rajat Pandit

The report noted that no country performed well enough in all index categories to achieve an overall very high rating in CCPI. Therefore, once again, the top three places in the overall ranking remain empty. Denmark, placed 4th, is the highest ranked country in CCPI 2022, but it does not perform well enough to achieve an overall very high rating. Thus India, at 10th slot, is the seventh country. India, significantly, maintained its 10th position despite pandemic-hit operational difficulties which saw some regulatory flexibility to put the country's economy back on track. China, the biggest current polluter, figured at 37th position (down from 33rd last year) while the second most current emitter, the US, was at 55th spot in the CCPI 2022 which released performance index of 2021.

According to Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar, as many as 130 terrorists have been killed in counter-terror actions, and 39 terrorists and more than 700 overground workers arrested in the Kashmir region since the beginning of this year. In Jammu division, 8 terrorists have been neutralized and 16 arrested so far this year, ADGP and IGP, Jammu Mukesh Singh told TOI. A CRPF spokesperson said that the force has, to counter the reworked strategy of the terrorists to utilize “hybrid” recruits for one-off attacks on civilians and easy targets in Kashmir, have initiated a series of measures to increase their visibility on the ground and are employing deterrent strategies. “The visibility of forces in the Valley, mostly in Srinagar where the recent civilian attacks were concentrated, has been stepped up. The forces are also doing night domination. While the BSF has deployed an additional 25 companies in Kashmir, the CRPF too sent in reinforcements comprising 25 companies in the wake of the civilian attacks and will be deploying five more companies over the next week,” said a CRPF officer. While the focus is to increase the boots on the ground with more policemen and para-military personnel in civilian areas, a source conceded that it remains a herculean task to ensure foolproof security to all the civilian settlements given how thickly populated and widely spread they are. Among the deterrent measures that are being used by the police and CRPF to nip terrorist attacks, particularly against easy targets, are putting up surprise or flash nakas, particularly in civilian areas, frisking of people, random checking of vehicles and deployment of drones to keep an eye on any suspicious movement or activity. “Over the past few days, we have been frisking around 15,000 people and checking 7,000-8,000 vehicles on a daily basis,” said a police officer. Meanwhile, a major crackdown on overground workers is underway in J&K as part of a determined effort to dismantle the entire “terror eco-system”. This includes identifying the terror sympathisers who radicalise youths in schools and civilian neighbourhoods and extend logistical support to terrorists. Also, there is conscious move to deny state-funded benefits including government jobs to Kashmiris who openly support Pakistan and terrorist outfits backed by it, despite being employed in J&K government or studying in government colleges where they avail of subsidized education and scholarships at Government of India’s expense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5500-more-troops-being-sent-to-jammu-and-kashmir-in-wake-of-attacks/articleshow/87615606.cms||Bharti Jain

Malik, refuting the allegations, said the entire land transition was legal and there were no irregularities. Fadnavis alleged the land was bought by the company Solidus Investments, in which Malik’s son Faraz is director, “for just Rs 30 lakh and only Rs 20 lakh were paid. They bought the land for Rs 15 per sq ft, while market rate or ready reckoner rate for it is Rs 8,500 per sq metre and Rs 2,000 per sq ft, which means the land is worth Rs 3 crore,” he said. Fadnavis said the land belonged to the Goawala family in Kurla, and Salim Patel, “who was driver, bodyguard and frontman of Haseena Parkar,” had irrevocable power of attorney for it. “The land was bought from Patel and from Shahawali Khan, a convict in the 1993 blasts case who is in jail serving life term. Khan was part of the conspiracy and did the recce for planting bombs at BSE and BMC building. Malik’s son Faraz signed the registration papers,” he alleged. Fadnavis said the transaction began in 2003 and was completed in 2005. “Khan is in jail as his conviction was upheld by SC. He was convicted under Tada. So it shows Malik’s family bought the land from Khan and Patel to protect it. Why did they buy land from a terror convict and those with underworld links? I will send all documents to agencies and also to NCP chief Sharad Pawar,” he said. Fadnavis also alleged Malik’s family had bought four more properties from those with underworld links. “Malik himself was a director in Solidus Investments for a short while. This means he has business ties with the underworld,” he said. “As per the registration papers for the Kurla land, the Maliks paid Rs 15 lakh to Khan and Rs 5 lakh to Patel, although the deal was of Rs 30 lakh,” he added. Meanwhile, Malik said he would “detonate a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday” on “Fadnavis’s relationships with the underworld.” He said, “We’re ready to go face any probe. Sardar Khan’s house is still in Goawala compound. When we took the property from Goawala family, Khan had claimed ownership of a 300-meter patch. We have bought only a 300 sq m plot from him. We didn’t buy the space under any pressure or from an accused with connections to the underworld.” Malik said his daughter would send a legal notice to Fadnavis as he had alleged cannabis was found on his son-in-law Sameer Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/malik-kin-bought-land-cheap-from-blasts-case-convict-says-opposition-leader-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/87615656.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||India||India has vaccine certificate pact with 96 countries: Government||NEW DELHI: In a big boost to international travel, 96 countries — including US, UK, many European and Middle East nations — have agreed to mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates with India, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Tuesday. The government continues to be in communication with more countries so that beneficiaries of the world’s “largest Covid vaccination programme are accepted and recognised”, thereby easing travel for education, business and tourism purposes, Mandaviya said in a statement. The move will ease travel for those vaccinated with Indian-manufactured Covishield and Covaxin. The countries include Canada, Turkey and Australia as well. Canada has sought an application from Covaxin to approve it, even as WHO’s emergency use approval has boosted the vaccine’s international acceptability. “At present, 96 countries have agreed to mutual recognition of vaccination certificates and also those [countries] who recognise Indian vaccination certificates of travellers fully vaccinated with Covishield/WHO approved/nationally approved Covid vaccines,” the government statement said. Consecutively, persons travelling from these countries are provided certain relaxations as enunciated in the health ministry’s guidelines on international arrivals issued on October 20, 2021, the ministry said. For those who wish to travel abroad, the international travel vaccination certificate can also be downloaded from the CoWIN portal. France, Germany, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Philippines, Bangladesh, Mali, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Angola, Nigeria, Benin, Chad, Hungary, Serbia, Poland, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Finland, Estonia, Romania, Moldova, Albania, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Sweden, Austria, Montenegro, and Iceland are some of the countries on the list. Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Malawi, Botswana, Namibia, Kyrgyz Republic, Belarus, Armenia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Georgia, Andorra, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Maldives, Comoros, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Peru, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Brazil have also agreed to mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates with India. “The ministry of health along with the ministry of external affairs is in continuous communication with all countries for mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, and WHO and nationally approved vaccines to facilitate hassle-free international travel across countries,” the minister said. “The Union government’s commitment to accelerate the pace and expanding the scope of Covid-19 vaccination throughout the country has resulted in crossing the 100 crore milestone in administration of doses on October 21, 2021,” he stated. A total of 109.63 crore doses of Covid vaccine had been given in the country till 7.30pm on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-has-vaccine-certificate-pact-with-96-countries-government/articleshow/87615816.cms||---

Can the highest constitutional court override the concerns of armed forces?” the SC said in the Chardham road case. Countering vehement opposition to the Centre’s plea for widening of feeder roads leading to Indo-China border locations, popularly known as the Chardham project, by NGO ‘Citizens for Green Doon’ on the ground that it would cause an environmental disaster, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath said, “There is no doubt that sustainable development has to be balanced with national security requirements. Can the highest constitutional court override the concerns of armed forces, particularly given the contemporary developments at the Indo-China border?” The bench further said, “Defence of India requires upgradation of roads. Look at the preparedness on the other side (Chinese side). Can the environment trump the defence requirements or should it be balanced?”  Attorney general K K Venugopal made a detailed pre sentation about the need to widen the existing roads to 7-metre width, which the court had permitted to be only 5.5 metre, to meet the requirements of armed forces given the troubling developments along the Indo-China border.  “In the 1962 war, our troops were without supplies and had to undertake arduous treks to reach the border outposts. We know what happened. Given the situation at the border and the new legislation passed by the Chinese government to override claims of neighbouring countries on disputes over border lands, there is an urgent need to build infrastructure to carry heavy artillery, tanks, missile launchers and swift movement of troops,” the AG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/national-security-environment-must-be-balanced-says-supreme-court/articleshow/87615873.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Major parties are back to padayatra politics, spar over Mekedatu delay||BENGALURU: The politics of yatra is unfolding in Karnataka in an apparent bid to set the ground for the 2021 assembly elections, with all three political parties indulging in a blame game over the Mekedatu drinking water project.  Last week, the Congress had announced a 100km padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru to press for “speedy implementation of the project which seeks to supply drinking water to Bengaluru city”. The party claimed the BJP government’s failure to implement the project even two years after it came to power has forced it to take out the padayatra. “There are no legal hurdles or other obstacles whatsoever. Still the government is not showing any intent to implement the project. If we don’t exert pressure, the government will not start the work. There is no other intention behind the padayatra,” claimed opposition leader Siddaramaiah in Mysuru on Tuesday.  He said the detailed project report was prepared during his tenure as the CM and submitted to the Centre. In 2010, Siddaramaiah had led a similar padayatra from Bengaluru to Ballari against illegal mining, the success of which catapulted him to the CM’s post. He, however, said: “It is not correct to link our proposed padayatra with that of the earlier one.”  The Congress’ decision has irked the ruling BJP as it is seeing this as an effort to put the blame on it for the delay. “The project is before the court and the government is fighting it out. It also needs a green signal from the Central Water Commission and we are making efforts to get it. Such being the case, the Congress is trying to put pressure on us for political reasons which is not fair,” CM Basavaraj Bommai said. He also blamed the previous Siddaramaiah government for the delay. “The Congress government took a long time to prepare a detailed project report. What was stopping the Congress to implement the project when it was in power?,” he asked. Congress hijacked our plan, alleges HDK Meanwhile, the JD(S) has accused the Congress of hijacking it's plan. “Two months ago, we announced the padayatra seeking implementation of the Mekedatu project. We had also met the CM and the governor in this regard. But the Congress has hijacked our plan,” former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said during a programme in Bengaluru on Monday. The JD(S) has also announced Janata Jaladhare, a programme to create awareness among people about effective utilisation of the state’s water resources, especially rivers. “Through the programme, we will tell the people how the national parties failed to protect the state’s interest in irrigation matters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/major-parties-are-back-to-padayatra-politics-spar-over-mekedatu-delay/articleshow/87615913.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bangar named RCB head coach||Bengaluru: Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday named former India assistant coach Sanjay Bangar as the head coach for the next two years. The 49-year-old succeeds Australian Simon Katich who quit after the Indian leg of the IPL earlier this year citing personal reasons. Director of cricket operations Mike Hesson had stepped in to fill Katich’s role during the second leg in the UAE. Bangar, who featured in 12 Tests and 15 ODIs for India, is the first Indian at the helm of coaching in the Bengaluru-based franchise and is the seventh coach in 11 seasons after Martin Crowe, Ray Jennings, Daniel Vettori, Gary Kirsten, Katich and Hesson. In a social media video post by RCB, Hesson, speaking on Bangar’s appointment, said, “Sanjay has been chosen as head coach following a rigorous and robust selection procedure. We have been through interviews and were pleased with the quality of candidates we have spoken to. But Sanjay was our standout candidate. He is highly respected as a coach. Primarily known as a batting coach, but certainly has far more expertise than that. Sanjay is very good with building relationships with players and he does that through his expert knowledge.” On the new role, Bangar, who joined the RCB coaching staff this year, said, “It’s an honour and opportunity to serve such a great franchise in the capacity of head coach. I have worked with some exceptional and talented members in the squad and can’t wait to take this team to the next level.” Looking ahead to the mega auction for the 2022 season, Bangar added, “Our work has already begun in terms of auction strategy and retentions, so all our scouting staff and coaches have put their heads together and are working in earnest. We are committed to building a strong franchise and the long-cherished dream of winning an IPL championship.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangar-named-rcb-head-coach/articleshow/87615915.cms||Manuja Veerappa
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt plans PLI-based schemes for GCCs, chip design: IT minister||BENGALURU: C N Ashwath Narayan, minister for higher education, and IT & BT, in the Karnataka government, is confident that the Beyond Bengaluru initiative to take industries beyond the capital would pay off. It will be one of the focus areas during the 24th edition of the Bengaluru Tech Summit that begins on November 17. Excerpts from an interview: Karnataka government's Spoke-Shore initiative is aimed at accelerating global capability centres (GCCs) in the state and creating a sizable talent pool beyond Bengaluru. The plan is to create 10 lakh (direct and indirect) jobs by 2026 in the Mysuru, Hubbali and Mangaluru clusters. How has the initiative progressed?We are getting a good response. The Karnataka government has taken many steps aimed at enhancing the ecosystem in these cities, leading to an increase in demand for talent from IT/GCC/ESDM companies in tier II & III cities. IBM, for instance, has set up a client innovation centre in Mysuru. A task group comprising industry, academia and other stakeholders has been set up to accelerate the initiative. The objective is to host 5,000 IT companies and startups by 2026 in the Mysuru, Hubbali and Mangaluru clusters. We are planning to develop schemes similar to PLI (production linked incentives) to spur GCCs and chip designing in the state. We have launched the India Innovation Alliance, an initiative to connect various innovation clusters across different states of India and bring them on the Bengaluru Tech Summit platform and liaise with the prestigious institutions globally. Karnataka government announced an improved electric vehicle policy when it saw states like Tamil Nadu drawing away EV investments. Are the changes made enough?Two companies making lithium batteries have set up units in the state recently. We are thinking about revising the EV policy to make it much more investor-friendly. Ola's electric scooter manufacturing went to Hosur. The law banning online gaming has impacted the gaming business in Karnataka, a state that was leading in the space. How do you see this?Other than a formidable policy, we are talking to entrepreneurs one-to-one. We are ensuring that we are open to recommendations and providing necessary incentives to attract investors. On the gaming ban, we have decided to keep the interest of the people foremost. We are not against skill-based gaming, but there cannot be gambling. In manufacturing, we have identified a 200-acre land parcel in Haralur at a cost of Rs 150 crore to set up a semiconductor facility. Karnataka is the fourth largest electronics manufacturer in the country, accounting for 10% of India’s total electronic industrial output. The state is home to more than 300 manufacturing units. Some of the incentives rolled out include land subsidy (25%), plant & machinery subsidy (20%), reimbursements on stamp duty and registration charges (100%), land conversion fee (100%), and power tariff (Re 1 per unit), production linked incentives (1% of annual net sales turnover), and exemption from electricity duty (100%). We have set up an MNC engagement cell where most of the concerns are addressed effectively. Would you extend the Elevate programme to focus on women entrepreneurs?Yes, we will soon be rolling out the Elevate programme for women entrepreneurs who can avail themselves of a seed fund to start their ventures. We also want to introduce grants for cluster-specific startups. The government is also setting up a Rs 100 crore fund for startups, akin to a VC fund where the fund sponsor is the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-plans-pli-schemes-for-gccs-it-minister/articleshow/87615917.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The group is spearheading the three-day Bengaluru Tech Summit that begins on November 17. The theme for the 24th edition of the event is “Driving the Next,” highlighting the role of digital and technological innovations which drove and supported growth of multiple sectors in the post-pandemic world. “India is today creating solutions for 7 billion people in the world, not just the 1.3 billion that live in the country. Our role is becoming bigger than ever," Gopalakrishnan said. The event will include multitrack conferences, an international exhibition, and a focus on global innovation alliances, and startups. There will also be an India USA Tech Conclave. The event is expected to see participation from more than 30 countries, 5,000 startup attendees, and more than 300 exhibitors. “We have curated sessions that will highlight the most recent technological and scientific advancements in the field of biotech like mRNA technologies in conceiving vaccines. Gene-editing takes centre stage in crop regeneration, and cell therapy drives new areas in therapeutics,” said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Biocon chief and chairperson of the Karnataka Vision Group on Biotechnology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/blore-tech-summit-to-focus-on-digital-future/articleshow/87615918.cms||---

Starting Wednesday, the mela — organised by University of Agricultural Sciences — will focus on agricultural technology, said UAS vice-chancellor S Rajendra Prasad. Catering to the popularity of jackfruit, the mela will have a new variety called Byra Chandra with less gum and more sugar content and antioxidants. The tree will start bearing fruits in less than four years. “You will get fruits twice a year and each tree will bear 120-150 fruits in a year,” said a scientist. UAS has introduced several disease-resistant varieties and a special variety of sugarcane suited for production of jaggery. “With health-conscious people opting for millets, there is a great demand for ragi (finger millet). The new variety is expected to yield 17-19 quintals per acre while withstanding harsh climate and diseases,” Prasad said. The university couldn’t organise the mela for two years owing to the pandemic. This time, it will be held both offline and online. “We are expecting a footfall of 15,000 to 20,000 daily; over 500 stalls will display crops, fruit and vegetable varieties. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will inaugurate the mela,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-varieties-of-cereals-millets-at-4-day-krishi-mela/articleshow/87615922.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||256 Karnataka kids found homes in 2020-21 in the midst of pandemic||BENGALURU: With 256 of its children being given away in adoption during 2020-21 amid the pandemic and related restrictions, Karnataka stood third nationally in the number of adoptions. Maharashtra topped the list accounting for adoption of 668 children and Tamil Nadu second with 375. However, Karnataka’s figure was an eight-year low. Adoptions falling is a nationwide phenomenon. While India saw 3,745 children being adopted in 2019-20, the count fell by 5% to 3,559 in 2020-21. Karnataka, though, saw a 9% dip compared to last year. In 2019-20, the state saw 282 adoptions — 261 in-country and 21 inter-country. In 2020-21, the number fell to 256 — 227 in-country and 29 inter-country adoptions. The top two states though bucked the national trend: Maharashtra saw 626 adoptions and Tamil Nadu 299 in 2019-2020. “Because of Covid-19, certain changes were brought about in the system. With travel restrictions and the fear of virus, the referral period given for completing the adoption process was increased from 20 to 30 days,” said officials from the State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA), women and child welfare department. Referral period is the time within which prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) have to meet the child, who is under the care of a specialised adoption agency, take a decision and complete the formalities.  Only after this can they have parental rights towards the child. Officials attributed the fall in number of adoptions in the state to temporary halt in adoption-related procedures at the peak of Covid first wave when the country went through a nationwide lockdown. “Some of the prospective adoptive parents have also put their adoption plans on hold in these challenging pandemic times,” said Sindhu Naik, member, Karnataka State Council For Child Welfare. She added that the pandemic scenario has had its impact as travel restrictions and legal proceedings too got delayed since courts were closed, especially in Maharashtra. When contacted, SARA authorities in Maharashtra said that on several occasions, the state intervened and wrote to the courts to ensure that the adoption process was completed for children. “We have proactively taken up the matter with local courts in certain instances during the pandemic to ensure that there was no delay in completing the adoption process. In fact, for prospective adoptive parents from other states, we also issued required letters so that they could travel to Maharashtra,” said officers in charge of SARA, Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/256-ktaka-kids-found-homes-in-2020-21-in-the-midst-of-pandemic/articleshow/87615923.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Mysuru||At 1.5k, Karnataka saw most pedestrian deaths in the country last year||BENGALURU: Karnataka has recorded the highest number of pedestrian deaths in road accidents in the country in 2020. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report released last week, 13% of pedestrian deaths in India (1,536 out of 11,901) were reported from Karnataka during 2020. This means at least four pedestrians were killed in the state every day last year despite a reduction in vehicular traffic during the pandemic. Among the pedestrian fatalities, Karnataka (1,536) topped the list followed by Andhra Pradesh (1,272), Maharashtra (1,176), Tamil Nadu (1,164), Madhya Pradesh (1,073) and Gujarat (824). However, states like Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Nagaland, Mizoram as well as UTs such as Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry did not record any pedestrian deaths last year. The NCRB report also stated that 1,490 pedestrian fatalities of the 11,901 reported in 2020 were in 89 major cities. Among those cities, Bengaluru recorded the second-most fatalities (163) after Chennai (181). Figures for other cities are: Ahmedabad (151), Visakhapatnam (82), Jaipur (78), Vijayawada (72), Faridabad (68), Surat (63), Delhi (57) and Indore (56). As per the report, 65 walkers were killed at pedestrian crossings in urban areas of the state, including 20 in Bengaluru. Indian Roads Congress (IRC) guidelines say footpaths should have a width of 1.8m in residential areas and 2.5m in commercial areas. While most places in Karnataka have no footpaths, the existing ones in urban areas are encroached by parked vehicles and hawkers. BBMP’s TenderSURE roads are largely restricted to central business district areas and peripheral areas have no pavements at all. As per NGO WRI India’s analysis, pedestrians accounted for around 40% road traffic fatalities. It also revealed that 50% pedestrian deaths were reported on arterial roads, 64% occurred near traffic intersections and 20% near Metro and bus stations. “Bengaluru’s outer wards such as Whitefield, KR Puram and Byatarayanapura account for 50% of pedestrian deaths. The first and last mile to Metro stations, bus stands etc., are prone to crash risks as 20% pedestrian deaths occur within walking distance of these transit nodes. Eighty per cent public transport users walk for at least the first or last mile,” said Akhila Suri, manager (sustainable cities and transport programme) at WRI India. "Our major arterial roads are not safe. About 50% pedestrian deaths occur on places like Hosur Road, Outer Ring Road, Mysuru Road and Tumakuru Road. The intersections too are dangerous for pedestrians because of increased conflict with vehicles. The larger the intersection area, the greater the conflict if not planned well" said Suri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/at-1-5k-state-saw-most-pedestrian-deaths-in-the-country-last-year/articleshow/87624034.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru doctors remove 222 fibroids from 34-year-old’s uterus||BENGALURU: A 34-year-old woman who suffered from acute pelvic pain for at least one year has got a new lease of life after doctors from the city removed 222 fibroids, totally weighing 2.2kg, from her uterus.  Media professional Ritika underwent a four-and-a-half-hour surgery on October 6, and doctors at Sakra World Hospital preserved her uterus. Ritika’s uterus was found to be enlarged (the size of an 8-month pregnant woman’s), causing a bulge in her lower abdomen. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous, estrogen-dependent tumours, usually occurring at child-bearing age. They cause anaemia and in Ritika’s case, her haemoglobin level had fallen to 7 grams per decilitre as against the normal of 12 to 15. Though she experienced typical symptoms of pain, excessive bleeding and abnormal menstrual cycles, she delayed consulting doctors due to Covid fear. Dr Shantala Thuppanna, senior consultant, head of obstetrics and gynaecology, Sakra World Hospital, who operated on Ritika, said uterine fibroids are common in approximately 40-50% women. But only a few have symptoms. “In Ritika’s case, she was anaemic and faced heavy bleeding despite practising yoga daily and maintaining an active lifestyle. She had waited for about one year to undergo the surgery due to the pandemic,” said Dr Shantala.  During the operation, doctors found that the fibroids — of various sizes and shapes (one resembling a large cauliflower) — were located below the urinary bladder and were spread throughout the left side of her uterus. “The fibroids were near important structures in the abdomen, which made the surgery complicated as they appeared like bunches of grapes. We were able to remove all the fibroids in her uterus that appeared compressed in the MRI scan, without any complications,” explained Dr Shantala.  According to the doctor, uterine fibroids are made of muscle and fibrous tissue, and vary in size and shape. The symptoms include pelvic pain, abnormal menstrual cycles, and sometimes even abortion, premature delivery, bulge in tummy, and urine and motion disturbance.  “They sometimes go away on their own. However, when left untreated, these fibroids can grow in size and numbers, resulting in worsening of the symptoms and causing further complications, including anaemia and infertility,” she said, adding initial symptoms must not be ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/docs-remove-222-fibroids-from-34-yr-olds-uterus/articleshow/87615927.cms||---

It started as an eye dispensary on November 9, 1896 during the British Raj in Chickpet with Dr SV Ramaswamy Iyengar as its medical officer. It received nine outpatients on the first day. The present facility’s foundation stone was laid by the Mysore Maharaja in December 1910 and named after then Viceroy, the Earl of Minto. The hospital was inaugurated in 1913 and got Regional Institute of Ophthalmology status in 1981. The 300-bed facility, which treated 90,000 patients every year, witnessed a peak in 2018-19, when the total number of patients crossed 1 lakh. “Every year, we perform 10,000 surgeries, including 8,000 cataract and 2,000 complex procedures,” said Dr BL Sujatha Rathod, director. Taking part in the celebrations on Tuesday, medical education minister K Sudhakar said there’s a need to spread awareness on eye donation. He also appreciated Minto staff’s work during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/minto-hospital-turns-125/articleshow/87615929.cms||---

The incident took place on the night of November 5 at a pub on Mcgrath Road when Ramesh (name changed), 26, a private company employee from Banashankari, paid a visit with three of his friends. The pub staff took the keys of Ramesh’s Toyota Innova Crysta, saying they will park it. A slip, containing the vehicle number and contact number of Ramesh, was handed over to him. By 10.45pm, Ramesh and his friends got ready to leave the pub and asked the valet parking staff to hand over the keys. “To my surprise, the staff replied saying someone had taken the keys as well as the vehicle,” Ramesh said.  He sought an explanation from the pub staff, asking how could someone else drive away his vehicle when the slip was with him. A quick inquiry revealed an unidentified man in his 30s, wearing a face mask, had produced an old slip by altering the date and the vehicle number and drove it out around 9.45pm. The staff from the parking lot failed to notice that the receipt had been tampered with. Soon, Ramesh lodged a complaint with Ashoknagar police and a close examination of CCTV footage revealed how the miscreant drove away by showing an old slip. “The staff from the valet parking are at fault. Had they carefully examined the slip, they would have realised it was old. The miscreant is seen driving away the vehicle at maximum speed from the parking lot,” an officer said. Asked how the miscreant managed to get hold of the old slip, cops said: “The staff would throw the slips returned by vehicle owners after the pub shut at night. The miscreant had collected them and seems to have waited until a vehicle bearing a number that resembled one on a slip arrived. The slip was almost three weeks old,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-tampers-with-valet-parking-slip-drives-away-suv/articleshow/87615930.cms||---

The venue for the event, Palace Grounds, was thronged by fans who travelled from different parts of the state to express solidarity with the Annavru family that is yet to come to terms with the demise of the 46-year-old actor. Looking at the sea of fans, Puneeth’s elder brother Raghavendra Rajkumar said: “He (Puneeth) was ellara mane huduga (dear to all). We are happy that so many people have come to accept the prasada (lunch).” The Rajkumar family had decided to host lunch for fans on the 12th day of Puneeth’s death and had made elaborate arrangements. Around 700 chefs were roped in to prepare the dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and the food had been readied on time. Puneeth’s wife Ashwini and elder brother and actor Shivarajkumar started the programme by serving food to a few fans. Shivarajkumar said: “The love shown by fans is unmatchable. I was fortunate to have Puneeth as my brother, he had done so many good deeds without talking about them.” There were several teary-eyed fans who were finding it difficult to fathom the fact that their favourite star was no more. Actor Srimurali said: “All of us are sad, but we are consuming (the food) with devotion so that he (Puneeth) is at peace.” The massive lunch for fans, according to actor-producer Rockline Venkatesh, is the first such gesture by a family in film industries across the country. Apart from lunch, the event also saw blood donation by family members, including Shivarajkumar and hundreds of Puneeth fans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/thousands-attend-lunch-served-in-memory-of-power-star-puneeth/articleshow/87615934.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Data-entry operator swindles Rs 67 lakh while issuing trade licences; complaint filed||BENGALURU: BBMP officials have alleged that a data entry operator misappropriated Rs 67 lakh from the Rs 13 crore collected while issuing trade licences for online businesses between 2014 and 2018.  Bommanahalli police registered a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust against Rajashekar N based on a complaint filed by Dr Nagendra Kumar S, health officer of Bommanahalli zone on November 2.  Kumar told police BBMP chief auditor had audited accounts for 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-2018 during his predecessor Dr Suresh HG’s tenure. It was found that Rajashekar, an outsourced data-entry operator, had collected Rs 13 crore from 10,598 businessmen towards trade licences to run online businesses. He allegedly did not maintain the account books and failed to produce them for auditing. He failed to deposit fees, fines, remittances and DDs to the BBMP commissioner’s bank account. He allegedly misappropriated Rs 67 lakh belonging to the Palike, the complaint said. “The issue was discussed at a meeting held by the special commissioner (finance), BBMP, on October 12. We decided to file a criminal case against the suspect,” Kumar said.  3 held for crypto fraud Three persons were arrested for allegedly cheating the public by luring them to invest in cryptocurrency for high returns. The accused are Raghavendra, Nagaraju and Shivamurthy, all residents of HSR Layout. Police said the trio operated Fomoex, claiming it deals with cryptocurrency. They promised victims up to 20% profit against their investment. Central Crime Branch sleuths learnt the gang held a business promotion programme in a Yelahanka hotel. The gang claimed their company had offices in the US, China and Singapore. Probe revealed they lured and cheated many people in the name of another blockchain firm. The accused offered 10% profit per month to those who brought in a new investor who could invest $100. It offered 11% for $300 investment, 12% for $500, 13% for $1000, 14% for $5000 and 15% for $10000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/data-entry-operator-swindles-67-lakh-while-issuing-trade-licences-plaint-filed/articleshow/87615935.cms||Santosh kumar.B

SWR officials said they decided to reintroduce two pairs of Demu services (four trains): 06387 KSR Bengaluru-Kolar, 06388 Kolar-Bengaluru Cantonment, 06383 Channapatna-Kolar Demu and 06384 Kolar-Channapatna. On September 23, TOI published an article on the delay: ‘Five months on, Bengaluru airport halt station unused as trains suspended’. SWR operated 10 trains every day to and from KIA halt station when it was inaugurated on January 4. However, services were suspended in April-end due to poor patronage during the Covid-19 second wave. However, activists say poor frequency of trains and lack of awareness are to blame. The halt station located 3.5km from the KIA terminal was built by Bangalore International Airport Limited at a cost of around Rs 3 crore and aimed at benefiting 28,000 airport employees as well as passengers. BIAL also operated free shuttle bus services between the station and terminal. The train ticket fare is between Rs 10 and Rs 15. Shortage of cabs Many KIA passengers are complaining about shortage of cabs, especially during weekends, due to increase in passenger movement. At present, cabs and BMTC’s Vayu Vajra and KSRTC Flybus service are operating at the airport. Work on Namma Metro and suburban rail connectivity to KIA is yet to commence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/swr-resumes-trains-to-kia/articleshow/87615936.cms||---

---||India||Suicides up 30% among small business owners in 2020||MUMBAI: Death by suicide increased 30% nationwide among small business owners in 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, as compared to 2019, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) accidental deaths & suicide report 2020. Experts said the surge in suicides in this group — from 9,052 in 2019 to 11,716 in 2020 — underlined the economic hardships due to the Covid-imposed lockdown. The NCRB report classified vendors, tradesmen and other small business owners among the self-employed categories most affected (overall, death by suicide among the self-employed in India rose to 17,332, up from 16,098 in 2019). Among the states, Maharashtra, which has the highest Covid case tally (66 lakh) and death toll (1.4 lakh), logged a 25% increase in suicides among vendors, tradesmen and small business owners. The NCRB report said 1,610 such self-employed individuals took their own lives in Maharashtra in 2020 as against 1,289 in 2019. Tamil Nadu, which has the maximum deaths in the self-employed category, registered a 36% increase from 1,061 in 2019 to 1,447 in 2020. Karnataka recorded a 102% rise in deaths (from 875 in 2019 to 1,772 in 2020). Incidentally, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka record higher number of overall suicides as compared to other Indian states. Dr Vibhuti Patel, retired economics professor from TISS, Mumbai, said the NCRB findings reflect the fact that people in the informal sector “lost everything”. “These were self-made people who couldn’t step out to earn their living. If they did, they were brutalized by the police. Many of them had to queue up for ration,” she said. Dr Patel said vendors and small traders not only suffered economic losses, “they lost their identity and self-esteem”. Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association president Viren Shah said shopkeepers and traders in the lower and medium income groups were the worst-hit by the pandemic. “Any advantage was only to industrialists and the corporate world, leaving small shopkeepers with no option but suicide as they couldn’t pay loans and rent,’’ said Shah. Shishir Joshi of NGO Project Mumbai which worked closely with marginalised groups during the lockdown said, “The pandemic impacted people at multiple levels. For the small businessman, the pandemic not only meant loss of income, but a struggle to get hospital beds for his family members and to pay school fees for his children.’’ Maharashtra topped the chart the second consecutive year for most suicides among 28 states and eight UTs with 19,909 in 2020 against 18,916 the previous year. Apart from the self-employed, it was the farm sector in the state that was impacted the most. The state had 4,006 suicides among farmers, cultivators and agricultural labourers in 2020 against 3,927 cases in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suicides-up-30-among-small-business-owners-in-2020/articleshow/87615956.cms||V Narayan

According to Naziya (name changed), her daughter Farhana (name changed) stole gold ornaments between April 1 and November 6 at the behest of Ameenul Islam, 22, a security guard. Naziya told police that her husband was admitted to a private hospital in January. Islam was a security guard at the hospital and that’s where he came in contact with Farhana. Islam expressed interest in marrying Farhana and assured her that he’d tie the knot soon after getting a decent job. According to police, Islam managed to convince Farhana that he needed money to land a good job and told her to steal gold from her residence to arrange for the same. Farhana allegedly stole the gold ornaments and gave them to Islam, who sold them at jewellery shops. The theft came to light when Naziya questioned both her daughters about the missing gold. Bharatinagar police have registered a case under IPC sections 380 (theft), 109 (abetting any offence) and 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) against Islam, Farhana and three jewellery shops based on Naziya’s complaint. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mom-files-theft-case-against-girl/articleshow/87616031.cms||---

Sriki, 26, was granted bail on Rs 4,500 personal surety. He must cooperate with the probe and abstain from tampering with evidence. Sriki and his friend Vishnu Bhat were picked up from a star hotel on Old Airport Road recently. Bhat had allegedly attacked the hotel staff for opposing his entry into the lobby without recording details in the register. He had come to meet Sriki who was staying there for over 55 days to look after his father, undergoing treatment in a nearby hospital. They were produced before court on Monday. Police had sought custody of Bhat as they had recovered 10 cigarettes filled with ganja from his house. Sriki’s counsel Dayanand Hiremath had moved the bail petition. “Sriki was arrested on drug consumption charges, under section 27 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act-1985 (punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance). If charges are proved, the punishment will be either six months of jail or Rs 10,000 fine, or both. He is not a peddler in this case. As no drugs were recovered from him, I pleaded with the court for bail,” Hiremath said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hacker-sriki-gets-bail-in-drug-case/articleshow/87616033.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||‘Place probe report before SIT chief’||Times News Network Bengaluru: The high court directed the report prepared by the additional commissioner of police and the investigating officer in the sex-for-job case, allegedly involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, to be placed before Soumendu Mukherjee, the head of Special Investigation Team (SIT), for appropriate orders. Thereafter, the report has to be placed before the court in a sealed cover on the next date of hearing — November 29, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi stated. The court also extended the restraint order regarding submission of the final report. “Once the SIT was constituted, the report prepared by ACP MC Kavita should have been placed before additional commissioner police Soumendu Mukherjee (IPS) and it was to be approved by him,” the bench noted. Earlier, senior advocate Indira Jai Singh, who appeared for the complainant-woman argued that the investigation as well as the report do not conform to the criminal procedure code. She claimed the victim had challenged the constitution of SIT based on the letter from the then home minister to Bengaluru police commissioner and added that any conditional nod by the court for submission of the final report would affect the petition. Jai Singh alleged certain details of the final report stating there’s no case against the ex-minister have been deliberately leaked to the press on the day when the matter was to come up before the high court. In one of the petitions, the woman had sought for transferring the probe to some other agency, contending she does not expect fairness in the one being carried out by SIT as it was formed pursuant to a letter by Jarkiholi. She alleged political interference and access of the accused to the home minister and to central leaders are in public domain. Another petition wherein the woman had sought for quashing of the complaint filed before Sadashivanagar police by MV Nagaraju (on behalf of Jarkiholi) is also clubbed along with the PIL filed on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/place-probe-report-before-sit-chief/articleshow/87616034.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||HC: Things can be set right if one officer is sent to jail||Times News Network Bengaluru: Reiterating its strong disapproval of government officers’ tendency to take court orders lightly, the high court on Tuesday said the situation may improve if one officer is sent to jail for disobeying them, as a test case. If one officer is sent to jail, everyone will fall in line, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi orally observed after noticing gross delay and inaction on the part of BBMP in relation to demolition of an illegal structure in Sriramapura put up by a temple trust, despite a specific court order passed on February 5, 2020 to complete the task within six weeks. The bench noted that the fourth respondent (Sri Ramachandra Swamy temple trust) has not moved any application for grant of time to undertake removal of the illegal construction and added it was the responsibility of BBMP to ensure the demolition. “Counsel for BBMP informed us that a certain portion of the illegal construction has been removed. But some part hasn’t. We are surprised as to why the illegal construction has not been demolished. We direct BBMP to complete the demolition within two weeks, failing which its chief commissioner along with all authorities concerned shall be present before the court so that they may be proceeded against for deliberate non-compliance of the court order,” the bench observed. On February 5, 2020, the court had recorded based on BBMP’s submission that the illegal structure consists of two parts — the first floor measuring 15.5 x 9.45 metre and sheet room which measures 4.7 x 7.4 metre. Though the Palike had claimed it needs to prepare an expenditure estimate and obtain sanction for demolition, the court had noted that since there is an order under sub-section (3) of Section 321 of Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, and another under Section 462 of the Act was passed on January 20, 2020, no further nod was required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-things-can-be-set-right-if-one-officer-is-sent-to-jail/articleshow/87616037.cms||---

---||Business||Godrej & Boyce to retain 3,401 acres on business division||MUMBAI: The-controlled Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company (G&B) will continue to retain the around 3,401 acres of land that it owns, even as a division in the family business is expected to conclude soon. The Godrej family is synonymous with landholdings and the maintenance of what is the largest privately managed mangrove belt in the city. Of the 3,401 acres located in the eastern suburbs of Mumbai, roughly 1,750 acres of mangroves are part of the Soonabai Pirojsha Godrej Foundation. A few years ago, when talks of a separation began between the two families — Adi Godrej, Nadir Godrej and family (Godrej Industries and associates) and Jamshyd Godrej and extended family — real estate was a moot point which brought to the fore questions about how the asset will be divided. Sources close to the family told TOI it has been decided that G&B which owns the real estate will retain it as well. TOI has learnt that senior directors across group companies have been sworn to secrecy not to talk about the negotiations. Besides, there is an embargo on them not to sell or trade in Godrej stocks till then. An insider, when contacted by this newspaper, said it makes sense for G&B to retain the entire land. “While the probability of apportioning the land through a separate vehicle was discussed, it was difficult to execute it as it would attract a huge stamp duty payment based on the ready reckoner value of the land,” said the source. “The 5% stamp duty would kick in even if the land were to be transferred from one group company to another,” said the source. The decision to vest the land in G&B will in turn boost the valuations of the company, said sources. It could make the family business separation an expensive proposition for Jamshyd Godrej’s side. Turnover wise, the unlisted G&B (Rs 11,400 crore in 2019-20) is half the size of Godrej Industries & associate companies (around Rs 21,000 crore). It is not clear whether Godrej Properties, which is part of Godrej Industries and associate companies, would continue to benefit by developing properties on land owned by G&B, following the family separation. Over and above the 3,401 acre land which belongs to G&B, there is a separate land parcel on which the Godrej Group has been in dispute with the state government since 1973 over who controls the land. The state claims the land belongs to it and had filed a suit against G&B in that year. The dispute is pending before the Bombay high court. In response to TOI’s query on this matter, the Godrej family said in a joint statement: “The Godrej family has been working on a long-term strategic plan for the group for the last few years to ensure best value for its shareholders. As part of this exercise, we have also sought advice from external partners. These discussions between the family remain ongoing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/godrej-boyce-to-retain-3401-acres-on-business-division/articleshow/87616030.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Open & shut appendix surgery gets doctor Rs 25,000 legal appendage||AHMEDABAD: A patient went under the knife for getting appendix removed after a sonography report diagnosed the problem but the doctor did not remove the organ as he did not find it was inflamed and causing trouble! This happened to a Mehsana patient whose family sued the doctor for medical negligence. Interestingly, while the court cleared the doctor of charges of medical negligence saying he acted in his interest, the doctor has been asked to cough up compensation of Rs 25,000 on humanitarian grounds. The case involved Baldevbhai Raval from Titodan village in Mehsana who was suffering from severe abdominal pain and consulted doctors in Gozaria town. He was advised sonography and on perusal of reports, local surgeon Dr Bhargav Patel undertook a surgery on Raval in March 2012 for appendectomy. Raval was charged Rs 20,000 for the surgery. Post-surgery, when relatives of the patient inquired about the removed appendix, they were told the patient was not suffering from appendix inflammation and hence it was not removed. Miffed for putting their patients under an unwarranted surgery, the Rawal family sued the doctors, hospital and the laboratory with the Consumer Dispute and Redressal Commission, Mehsana disitrict for a wrongful surgery. In 2014, Dr Patel was ordered to reimburse part of the surgery charges and pay Rs 1 lakh compensation to the patient. The doctor challenged the compensation order before the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission and explained how diagnosis in such cases cannot be 100% correct about when surgery is required. Dr Patel also placed medical literature supporting that such surgery is normal acceptable situation. He insisted he had acted in the best interest of the patient without any malafide intention. Even the district consumer commission had noted that it was a premature surgery and not a case of medical negligence. After hearing the appeal and perusal of case papers, judicial member in the state commission, M J Mehta, said that the doctor had felt that patient’s abdominal pain was due to appendix inflammation and surgery was necessary. The commission noted that it was not a case of medical negligence as Dr Patel had acted in the interest of the patient and this is not a case of medical negligence. The state commission modified the district commission’s order and asked the doctor to pay Rs 25,000 to the patient with 7% interest on humanitarian ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/open-shut-appendix-surgery-gets-doc-rs-25k-legal-appendage/articleshow/87614010.cms||Saeed Khan

Ali was in charge of the outpost. The victim was identified as Vishwanath Choudhary (72). He was arrested with 18 litres of country-made liquor from his residence at ward number 3 in Krishna Nagar locality of Sitamarhi town hours before his death. The seized liquor was packed in small pouches of 180ml each. Peeved at Choudhary’s death, locals blocked the road at Mehsaul Chowk in the town for several hours on Tuesday. The blockade was cleared only after senior officials pacified the protesters and assured them of proper investigation into the incident. SHO of Town police station Vikash Kumar Rai said that Choudhary’s wife, Gayatri Devi, has lodged an FIR against SI Ali, accusing him of beating her husband to death in police custody. Sitamarhi SP Har Kishore Rai said Ali had been placed under suspension for negligence of duty. The SP added Choudhary was placed inside the lockup after his arrest. “Ali and others got busy preparing an FIR and doing other procedural works. After about an hour, they found Choudhary unconscious in the lockup. He was rushed to a local hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead,” Rai said. The SP said Choudhary’s post-mortem was conducted by a medical board in presence of a magistrate on Tuesday. “According to the post-mortem report, Choudhary died due to a heart attack. No external injury mark was found on his body,” he said. According to police, Choudhary and his wife were engaged in country liquor smuggling. “The two had been arrested on several occasions in the past,” Sadar SDPO Ramakant Upadhaya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cop-booked-as-bootlegger-dies-in-police-custody-in-sitamarhi/articleshow/87613340.cms||---
---||Pune||Give jab on priority to kids with obesity, malnutrition: Maharashtra's paediatric task force||PUNE: The state’s paediatric task force advised priority Covid-19 vaccination of children with obesity, malnutrition, juvenile diabetes and nine other medical conditions in its recommendations submitted to the Maharashtra government recently. The task force comprising eminent child specialists made it clear that vaccination was not mandatory for attending schools. They urged parents to send children to schools and not to unduly suspend/delay school attendance over Covid vaccination. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — meant for immunization of children in the 2-18 years age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunization programme by December-end. The Centre would also be issuing guidelines on vaccinating high-risk kids. “The Union government will prioritise Covid-19 vaccination for children with pre-existing illnesses. For this, we have shortlisted 12 underlying medical conditions. We have recommended the state government to prioritise these comorbid children as Covid shots won’t be available for healthy kids initially,” senior paediatrician and task force member Pramod Jog said. “The task force has made the recommendations after studying the data of the children in Maharashtra who developed serious Covid illness during the second wave. The recommendations are expected to help the state government prioritise Covid vaccination among the state’s high-risk adolescents ahead of the nationwide rollout of ZyCov-D and Covaxin,” Jog said. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, was the first vaccine in the country to get the emergency use authorisation (EUA) for being administered to kids aged 12 years and above. Covaxin got EUA for children in the 2-18 years age bracket. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “The Covid vaccines will not be available to healthy children initially. Hence, we appeal to parents to send kids to schools. The benefits of sending children to school far outweigh various risks involved in not sending.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/give-jab-on-priority-to-kids-with-obesity-malnutrition-task-force/articleshow/87614062.cms||Umesh Isalkar

At least four companies of CAPF, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel, have been deployed in Patna, Bhagalpur, Aurangabad and Muzaffarpur for Chhath. These deployments will continue till Thursday. According to state police ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar, at least 10,000 trainee constables have been deployed in several districts as per requirement. Also, 2,500 trainees of Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) and equal number of home guard jawans have been mobilised for deployment and crowd control on roads, ghats and other places, especially along land-bound water bodies where devotees would throng to worship the Sun God. Overall, 19 regular armed companies of BSAP have also been pulled out of their barracks and other deployment locations for field duty during Chhath. The headquarters has also deployed 24 DSP-rank and 130 inspector and sub-inspector-rank officers in the field for commanding the constables on Chhath duty. These security personnel would also ensure that social distancing is maintained and other Covid-19 protocols set by the central and the state governments are followed. The security personnel would also be involved in rigorous river patrolling and traffic management so that the devotees and commuters don’t face problems. Besides, 14 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed at various ghats in the state. NDRF’s 9th battalion commandant Vijay Singh said the 14 teams comprise around 600 personnel. “They are equipped with boats, life jackets, buoys and first-aid kits,” Sinha said. He added altogether 105 boats are moving in rivers, including 70 in Patna. Sinha said these teams also have deep divers for any emergency. “Several ghats have been identified as dangerous in Patna district. Barricading has been done, but people are still risking lives by wading into the water by crossing barricades,” he added. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) deputy commandant K K Jha said their 665 personnel have been deployed at 99 locations in 25 districts. “We have engaged 300 inflatable boats having 3,000 life jackets and 600 buoys. Twenty-seven deep divers have also been deployed at the strategic locations. They are continuously working in coordination with district administration concerned,” Jha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/20k-security-personnel-deployed-across-bihar-for-chhath/articleshow/87613385.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Day 2: Chhath devotees begin 36-hour fast||PATNA: The aroma of “kheer” filled the air as devotees prepared and later distributed “kharna” prasad on Tuesday, the second day of Chhath. The devotees started the 36-hour-long fast after performing puja and consuming prasad. The devotees will end the fast on Thursday morning after paying obeisance to the rising sun. Apart from the ghats, different localities were beautifully decked up and Chhath songs could be heard in every nook and corner of the city. Huge rush was witnessed at several ghats in the city as people collected Ganga water to be used in preparing prasad. Several families had even camped near these ghats to carry out the rituals on Wednesday. One such devotee was Urmila Devi who had come from Jehanabad. She was staying near Collectorate Ghat. Busy preparing “kheer” using jaggery, milk and rice on an earthen stove, she said, “I had a desire to perform Chhath on the bank of the Ganga. My sons have brought me here. I am happy to be near Goddess Ganga during Chhath.” Aditi Mishra, a resident of Rajiv Nagar, said piousness and devotion with which the prasad is cooked make this festival special. “We do cook kheer and roti even on other days, but the taste of today’s prasad cannot be compared with any cuisine of the world. My mother cooks it in the brass utensil on the earthen stove and cleanliness is the priority while cooking prasad,” she said, adding a large number of relatives and friends will visit their home in the evening to eat prasad. Aditi’s mother, Sarooj Mishra, who has been observing Chhath for the past 15 years, said, “It is out of devotion that I have been observing this festival since the last 15 years. I pray for the good health of everyone and peace across the globe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/day-2-chhath-devotees-begin-36-hour-fast/articleshow/87613318.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri granted bail||MUMBAI/JAISALMER: The additional district judge (ADJ) in Jaisalmer on Tuesday granted bail to former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri, who was sent to 14-day judicial custody by a chief judicial magistrate (CJM) from the city on November 1. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan high court also stayed the CJM’s order to arrest directors and employees of Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company, where Chaudhuri was a director. The ADJ granted Chaudhuri bail on a personal surety of Rs 1 lakh and a deposit of Rs 50,000. He has been asked to be present in the court on November 15. After release, Chaudhuri was received by his family members. The HC had passed the stay order in two petitions filed by the directors and by employees of Alchemist ARC. During the hearing, the advocate for the petitioner pointed out that a similar FIR was filed by the complainant earlier but the same was quashed by the Supreme Court. Chaudhuri was arrested by the Jaisalmer police on November 1 based on a complaint filed by the promoters of Godawan Group which had taken a loan in 2007 for their Garh Rajwada hospitality project. SBI had subsequently classified the account as a non-performing asset and the loan was sold to Alchemist ARC a few months after Chaudhuri retired. Chaudhuri subsequently joined Alchemist as a director. The asset was finally sold under an insolvency process despite attempts by the debtor to stall the process in various courts. “We had filed a petition in the HC under Section 482 of the criminal procedure code to quash the FIR as well the order dated 12.2 20 taking cognisance of the complaint. The HC has stayed the order and subsequent orders. Also, both the ADJ and the Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan HC have said that these are civil proceedings,” said Alok Dhir, director at Alchemist ARC. “It is unfortunate that a chronic defaulter who has not paid a penny for 13 years after taking a loan could get somebody of the stature of Chaudhuri arrested. It is a sad commentary on the legal system that recovery proceedings by a lender have been given the colour of criminality,” said Dhir. “The allegation is that the security was undervalued by SBI. In this case, what was sold was not the property but the loan. The recovery was done under the IBC process and the property was sold to the highest bidder approved by the NCLT,” he added.Complainant’s advocate Kanwarraj Singh Rathore said the case of bail petition of the accused was transferred to ADJ court from sessions court on Monday. “Although we protested on granting him bail, ADJ court justice Dalpat Singh Choudhary, while looking at his age, accepted the bail petition,” Rathore said. According to Dhir, the complainant has been engaging in ‘forum shopping’ throughout. After an original FIR was closed in 2015, they filed a subsequent FIR which was quashed by the Supreme Court. Around the same time, they filed a protest petition against the closure of the original FIR. It was in response to this petition that the arrest order was issued”. Chaudhuri’s arrest drew sharp reactions from top bankers across the country who described the arrest as unfortunate. SBI chairman Dinesh Khara expressed confidence that Chaudhuri would be released unconditionally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/former-sbi-chairman-chaudhuri-granted-bail/articleshow/87615251.cms||---

The state government has formed a committee to look into the matter and, based on their findings, plan to take a final decision on the matter, said state education minister Jitu Vaghani. “Children in this age group haven’t gone to school for a long time so we are also working on a plan on how to get them back on track for physical classes. We will announce our decision about re-opening of schools for Class 1 to Class 5 students at an appropriate time,” according to Vaghani. The committee will comprise of experts from the educational field and medical experts including child psychiatrists. Diwali vacation will end on November 21 and the schools are expected to re-open for students of Class 1 to Class 5 soon after this, said sources in the state government. The resumption of classes is expected to give some respite to those who had enrolled their children in government and aided schools that did not have the infrastructure to conduct online classes. Also, online education for children of this age group has not been easy. The government has allowed in-person classroom education in schools for Class 6 to Class 12 students. Schools are to follow strict protocols and government guidelines to guard the students against Covid-19. According to government’s rules for re-opening schools, a written consent has to be provided by the parents to the authorities. Attendance is not compulsory and online classes will continue. The classes are be conducted with 50 percent capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/school-for-primary-classes-likely-to-re-open-after-nov-21/articleshow/87614860.cms||---
---||Business||RBI lifts ban on new biz for Diners Club||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Tuesday that it has lifted the restriction on Diners Club International from on-boarding new domestic customers. Diners Club, which is owned by Discover Financial Services, issues cards in India through a partnership with HDFC Bank. The RBI had barred Diners Club from on-boarding new customers from May 1, through an order dated April 23. The ban followed the card network’s failure to comply with the central bank’s order/norms pertaining to data localisation. In terms of these norms, RBI-regulated entities have to store data pertaining to Indian customers on Indian soil. They can send the data overseas for processing, but the same has to deleted within 24 hours and the process certified. Besides Diners Club, the RBI had also barred American Express Bank from on-boarding new customers. Subsequently, the ban was extended to Mastercard. Although the payment giant had confirmed that it would comply with the central bank’s guidelines, the RBI decided to issue the order as it failed to meet the extended timelines. While Diners Club and Mastercard are network providers, American Express has a banking licence which it uses only for issuing cards. Amex, besides issuing cards, also acquires merchants and provides the payment network. The ban on Mastercard and Diners Club had given a boost to Visa’s card issuance. Visa, already the largest credit card network, has been the biggest gainer from the ban on Mastercard as many issuers who had exclusive arrangements with Mastercard shifted to its rival. HDFC Bank, which issued over five lakh cards in less than six weeks, is understood to have issued most on the Visa platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-lifts-ban-on-new-biz-for-diners-club/articleshow/87615320.cms||---

Last month, as part of the restructuring, the board of IDFC and IDFC Financial Holding Company had appointed Citigroup Global Markets India as investment banker for divestment of IDFC Asset Management Company. In July this year, IDFC received a clarification from the RBI confirming that after the expiry of the lock-in period of five years, IDFC can exit as a promoter of IDFC First Bank. The move was seen by analysts as a precursor to the reverse merger of the bank with IDFC. IDFC has five direct subsidiaries — IDFC Projects, IDFC Financial Holding Company, IDFC Foundation, IDFC Alternatives and IDFC Trustee Company. The management of IDFC has been facing heat from shareholders and analysts for lack of clarity on the issue of a reverse merger with IDFC First Bank. In September, shareholders of IDFC rejected a proposal to reappoint Vinod Rai, former comptroller and auditor general, as director. Rai is also the non-executive chairman of the company. Shareholders took a tough stance on the reappointment as they were unhappy with the management communication concerning future plans. There has been speculation that IDFC might seek a merger with another financial institution. The board also appointed Anita Belani as an additional director for three years, subject to shareholder approval. Belani is co-founder and partner of Emotionally, a mental wellness company specialising in counselling, therapy and coaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idfc-clears-merger-of-three-arms-with-itself/articleshow/87615337.cms||---

Police explained that Sitamma was bedridden due to old-age related ailments. After giving her a bath and serving her meal, Durga Rao left for work.

The average wholesale onion price increased by 15% on resumption due to drop in supply in comparison to demand. The average wholesale onion price stood at Rs 2,900 per quintal as against Rs 2,500 per quintal on the last working day — October 28. APMC officials said the arrival of onions at Lasalgaon has reduced causing the rise in average wholesale price. Usually, around 15,000 quintals of onions are auctioned at the Lasalgaon market every day, but only 7,000 quintal of onions was auctioned on Tuesday, officials said. The onions arriving at the market now are summer onions harvested in March and April. The fresh kharif onions were expected to arrive after Diwali, but only 30 quintal was auctioned on Tuesday. Heavy rain in September and October badly damaged kharif onion crop in the district. Regular arrival of the fresh late-kharif onions is expected by November-end. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon APMC were recorded at Rs700 and Rs 3,251 per quintal, respectively. According to the APMC officials, farmers still have stocks of summer onions that could last two-three weeks. The average wholesale onion prices are expected to increase up to Rs 3,200 per quintal over the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/onion-auction-resumes-at-lasalgaon-after-11-days/articleshow/87612175.cms||Tushar Pawar

Rashmi, a resident of Mitra Mandal Colony in Anisabad, got a makeshift tank made on her rooftop recently to observe Chhath rituals. “My family members did not want to take any risk amid the pandemic,” she told this reporter on Monday. Homemaker Anita Sinha echoed similar views and said she preferred celebrating Chhath at home instead of visiting ghats due to the pandemic. Usha Thakur of Phulwarisharif and Neeta of Ashiana Nagar have also got temporary tanks made on their rooftops and decorated them with lights, flowers and banana leaves. “Such an arrangement makes it easy for the elderly and sick people to participate in Chhath rituals conveniently,” Usha claimed. Like Usha, several other women living in apartments are observing Chhath rituals at home with utmost devotion. According to them, coming together to offer ‘arghya’ to the Sun God in the presence of family and friends feels great. Meanwhile, the administration has barricaded the nine ghats in Phulwari where thousands of devotees are likely to offer ‘arghya’ to the Sun God on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. Besides, watchtowers with adequate lights have been installed and changing rooms set up for the devotees.

Student leaders linked with the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and other outfits made a representation before city police commissioner Shamsher Singh on Tuesday raising doubts over Vasu’s death being considered suicide. “Just a day before the incident, he had met me. He purchased firecrackers from my shop. He was so excited about Diwali festivities. We used to meet regularly and there is no way that a joyful person like him would commit suicide,” said Vraj Patel, former general secretary of MSU Students Union and NSUI leader. Vasu was elected as a class representative at the unit building of the Faculty of Commerce in 2017. The police have so far said that the 22-year-old youth who was staying with his friend as he and his father did not go along well, may have ended his life as he was wanted in a prohibition case. “We don’t believe that he had any prohibition case in which he was wanted. But even if he had any prohibition case against him, why would he commit suicide,” said Patel, adding that even the mobile phone of the deceased is missing. “The way his body was found on the railway track itself raises suspicion that he was murdered,” said Patel, adding that the city police commissioner has assured a thorough probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/probe-demanded-into-msu-students-death/articleshow/87612974.cms||---

---||Business||Good Glamm Group is 35th unicorn of 2021||Chennai: The Good Glamm Group, the content-to-commerce D2C beauty brand, is India’s 35th unicorn for 2021, raising $150 million funding in its series-D round co-led by private equity investors Prosus Ventures (Naspers), Warburg Pincus along with the participation from Alteria Capital and existing investors L’Occitane, Bessemer Venture Partners, Amazon, Ascent Capital and the Mankekar Family Office. The round includes both primary and secondary sales and values the digital-first FMCG group at around $1.2 billion post money. One representative each from Naspers and Warburg are also set to join the group's board with this round. The group earlier in September closed a $100 million (Rs 755 crore) Series C round, making it the the largest series C fundraise by any beauty brand in India. Darpan Sanghvi, group founder & CEO, Good Glamm Group, said the company’s unicorn status is a validation for the entire D2C beauty category and the tailwinds it has enjoyed post the pandemic. “While getting to a public listing is an eventual goal, it is at least 2-3 years away for us,” he added, noting that the group was cheering for Nykaa’s IPO and it had potential to be a successful one. The Good Glamm Group will be utilising its latest funding to invest in product development, support data science and technology research, increase offline expansion, fund working capital requirements while also expanding the content creation capabilities and digital reach of POPxo, Plixxo, BabyChakra and ScoopWhoop. The group said it will also continue to make investments in more beauty and personal care brands. The group has a current revenue run rate of around $120 million and projects a run rate of around $250 million by March 2022 as it has set aside a war chest of around $100 million for strategic investments in Beauty & Personal care brands. It has already made acquisitions and investments worth $270 million to date. Vishal Mahadevia, MD and India head at Warburg Pincus, said that with a strong portfolio of D2C brands and proprietary content assets, the group is well positioned to scale rapidly and create a large digital-first business in the beauty and personal care space. The brands owned by the Good Glamm Group include cosmetics brand MyGlamm, mom and baby entity MomsCo, teen cosmetics enterprise POPxo, baby and mother brand Baby Chakra, and lifestyle & pop culture media portal ScoopWhoop. MyGlamm also has around 30,000+ offline retail points of sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/good-glamm-group-is-35th-unicorn-of-2021/articleshow/87614005.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

It is, in the minimum, a base assurance at work. At its best, it results in optimum flow of innovations, creativity and ideas. However, psychological safety is more an outcome of a deeper issue — sociological safety. Organisations are societies, with all obvious strengths, but also some potentially wrecking cracks. In my corporate and advisory experience, I have found that psychological safety flows from an individual to an individual interplay. But the socio-cultural environment is more complex and the one to treat at its core. Every organisation has its own societal dimensions. These create its own unique gestalt and behavioural archetypes, one of which is psychological safety. But its societal DNA influences reputation, governance, culture, innovation and, finally, its sustainability. Each organisation would do well to evaluate its own sociological imprint and see if that needs a tweak or repudiation to create a more aligned and functional ecosystem. Is there too much angularity in its societal DNA that could be hurting its present and putting at risk its future? Here are some pronounced sociological constructs that could be possible red flags for corporation... * Tenure-biased: Some organisations have culturally valued tenure as a very crucial pivot of its being. What really matters in such places is the years one has worn a certain jersey. Breakthrough impact is substituted by ‘loyalty’. One needs to spend a certain number of years before being truly accepted in its ranks. Such tribal and clannish behaviour surely builds stickiness, but compromises fresh ideas, newer possibilities. Personal relationships outweigh the merits of situations and group-think may become the way of life. Newer members either leave or lose their own individuality to gain acceptance and become just ‘another of them’. And the best talent today wants to be more measured in impact, hunts for new experiences and may be unwilling to feel tethered. * Demographic-biased: T-here are other organisations, many with a historical context of origin, which become very regional and parochial in being. The leadership reflects a similar linguistic, ethnic or regional (or national) composition. At times, people unconsciously regress into speaking in a way that the odd other member present may not comprehend. The ability of such companies to attract a different talent is often compromised. People feel alien in this world. The practices and behaviour for everyone else is usual, but social assimilation can be a nightmare. This, again, builds a challenge to get the best out of a new hire. The sociological blind spots are difficult to accept by the majoritarian bias. * Education- & experience-biased: Then there are organisations that have overwhelmingly most citizens with a similar educational or experience mix. No doubt certain industries would need it, but the sociological risk is again one of limited perspective. The ability to acknowledge other perspectives gets compromised. One tends to do like everyone else. There is little challenge to prevailing ideas. Sometimes this is most visibly and disastrously seen in the composition of the boards and executive teams. And anyone who comes with a different background may struggle to express, suggest or influence the preponderant thinking. Such companies again expose themselves to enterprise risks for want of a variety in their thinking. * Behaviour-biased: Many organisations have a strong behaviour-anchored sociological bias. Irrespective of whether it is good or bad, every pronounced bias shapes its societal character. Some are entrepreneurial, others risk-averse. Some are consensus-centred, others more siloed. Anything overdone makes a good strength a liability. It then hires and keeps people who are like them again, with all the upsides and risks. Organisations are societies, making their shares of rituals and metaphors. Over time, they become non-negotiables. And anything staid and unquestionable runs the downside of developing blind spots. A new different hire typically then is the problem, not the larger society. The reason why culture-fit thinking could build sterility in corporations. * Personality-biased: I also observe some corporations start developing sociological fault lines because of a personality cult that prevails in these set-ups. Often, these could be the promoter or the CEO. There is a lot of legitimate value and credit that may be ascribed to these individuals. But over time, folklore makes these enterprises practise cloned behaviour. The over-hang becomes obvious to anyone who sees it from the outside. People start dressing that way, speaking the same way and, of course, behaving much the same way. This then brings a certain rigidity in the sociological makeup of such companies. Anything, even remotely different, is seen as sacrilege. This makes ecosystems very closed. And in the process, makes such companies potentially fragile. While these are broad sociological patterns of organisations, each firm must ask itself the hard question: Is it becoming a victim of a sociological trap? It is not easy for it to recognise it in its typical daily experience. Powerful business disruptions or a truly external and independent adviser could help show the mirror. And it will take honesty and courage for any institution to unshackle itself of any of its rusty sociological chains.

This is in addition to the arrest of three others — Sandeep Kumar, former branch manager of Indian Overseas Bank, Mrudhula, assistant branch manager, and a private person identified as Yohan Raju. The woman arrested in the case is Pusalapati Pramila Rani, Raju’s wife. The scam came to light in October after the general manager of warehousing corporation, Yerra Pattabhi Ramaiah, lodged a complaint with Bhavanipuram police, while Chalapaka Ramana Murthy, manager of the cooperative federation, filed a similar plaint at Atkur police station. Explaining the modus operandi, cops said the accused liquidated fixed deposits worth Rs 14.6 crore belonging to the two organisations by forging fake documents. In both cases, the accused forged employees’ signatures to liquidate the FDs, which bore similarity to the recent Telugu Akademi fraud unearthed in Hyderabad where Rs 64 crore worth of fixed deposits were liquidated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-cops-make-4th-arrest-in-fixed-deposits-scam/articleshow/87613466.cms||---

While the retail part was fully subscribed, the institutional part was subscribed 46% and the part reserved for high networth investors (HNIs) was subscribed just 5%, making up the overall figure of 48%, BSE data showed. The IPO, set to be the largest such offering in India, will close on Wednesday. A successful closure will see this IPO eclipse the Coal India offer for Rs 15,200 crore that was launched 11 years ago. In large IPOs, usually the institutional and HNIs invest on the last day of the offer. According to sources, some of the investors, who bought Paytm shares in the anchor round, which closed on November 3 that was the last working day before the IPO opened on November 8, have also bid in the IPO. One of the largest pension funds in the world, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), has made a bid worth nearly Rs 1,300 crore, they said. In its anchor round, the company had raised Rs 8,235 crore. In addition to CPPIB, global fund management majors like Blackrock, the government of Singapore, UBS and a host of other entities had picked up 3.8 crore shares of the company at the upper end of the Rs 2,080-2,150 price band for the IPO, a company release had said. The Paytm IPO was launched on the fifth anniversary of the Prime Minister’s demonetisation drive that was aimed at limiting the use of cash in the economy and also to weed out black money. Paytm was one of the top beneficiaries of the government’s move, which was announced on November 8, 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytms-ipo-subscribed-48-on-day-2/articleshow/87615335.cms||---
---||Business||Gehlaut to quit as chairman of Indiabulls realty||Mumbai: Indiabulls Group promoter Sameer Gehlaut took another step to disengage himself from the real estate business by stepping down from Indiabulls Real Estate as its chairman. K G Krishnamurthy, formerly with HDFC Group and a veteran of the realty sector, will replace Gehlaut as the company’s chairman. The change over will be effective February 1, 2022. For the last several months, Gehlaut has slowly been reducing his stake in the realty firm as Embassy Group is now taking charge of the entity to complete the process of merger with it. In mid-2019, when Indiabulls group was planning to acquire Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB), one of the regulatory conditions was that the group would have to get out of the real estate business. Although eventually Indiabulls Group was denied permission to take over LVB, the promoters kept reducing their stake in the real estate business. As a result, their holding in Indiabulls Real Estate is now down to about 6% from nearly 39% as of March 2019, just before the group bid to take over LVB, BSE data showed. According to a release from the company, Krishnamurthy,former MD & CEO of HDFC Property Ventures, joined Indiabulls Real Estate as an independent director on the board for an initial term of three years. For over three decades, he has been in the real estate sector, during which he advised international and domestic real estate funds having an aggregate corpus of about Rs 7,100 crore. He is also on the boards of several realty, financial services and consumer businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gehlaut-to-quit-as-chairman-of-indiabulls-realty/articleshow/87614869.cms||Partha Sinha

Tejashwi’s family members, including his elder brother Tej Pratap, took to social media platforms to wish him. Tejashwi is currently in Delhi with his parents. “Birthday greetings to my Arjun, who has single-handedly defeated Manuvadis,” Tej tweeted. His tweet was shared by Lalu’s daughter Rohini Acharaya, who also wished Tejashwi on the occasion. “Since many people have lost their lives in the state in recent hooch tragedies, Tejashwiji has decided not to celebrate his birthday in a grand way this time. He has also advised others to skip celebrations. However, some party workers have celebrated his birthday at individual level by distributing prasad and cutting cakes,” RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said. At RJD’s office on Beerchand Patel Path here, party members were seen distributing sweets and cutting a cake. “Tejashwi has drawn a new line in politics by raising burning issues like unemployment, education, corruption and inflation,” RJD leader Shakti Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-keeps-his-32nd-birthday-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/87613236.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The proposed expenses for the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) initiative have been projected at Rs 363 crore. The contract will be done for the next seven years. The general body agenda available on the civic body’s website stated that a total of 32 vehicles will be used for the earmarked road sweeping, and around 382 employees, who include sweepers, operators, drivers, and helpers, will be employed. Mechanised sweeping was first implemented across the PCMC limits in 2015, which was discontinued after 2017 due to tendering related issues. Though earlier this year the draft proposal was presented before then commissioner Shravan Hardikar, after his transfer in February the proposal took a backseat. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said the project is likely to involve a lot of corruption hence the state should investigate it transparently. Earlier, medical officer of health Dr Anil Roy had said pandemic has affected the resumption of the mechanised road sweeping. “Now, that the proposal is with the general body, we are expecting a favourable nod. We are expecting the process to get completed in the next three-four months,” said Dr Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-may-decide-on-mechanised-road-sweeping-next-week/articleshow/87614067.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The two factions have realigned ownership interests in the businesses allotted to them so that control of their respective portfolios flows to them. Inox was founded by the duo’s grandfather. Recently, their father Devendra Jain, 92, the patriarch, signed a family accord following bickering between the two brothers over running the businesses. External advisers close to the family, including law firm Khaitan & Co and tax consultant Dhruva Advisors, assisted in the implementation of the settlement deed. The family settlement agreement was inked when shares of flagship Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFL) were hovering at Rs 900 apiece on the BSE, sources said. The business group, which started as a paper and newsprint trading company that went on to be the country’s largest liquid medical oxygen producer during the Covid pandemic, has the fourth generation of the family involved in operations. “We have started a new growth journey and are in the process of launching a group logo under Inox GFL,” said Inox Wind director and Vivek’s son, Devansh Jain. Vivek, who is based in New Delhi, has inherited three publicly listed companies — Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Inox Wind and Inox Wind Energy — and a closely held unit, Inox Green Energy. Older brother Pavan, who is based in Mumbai, has gained two closely held outfits — Inox Air Products and Inox India — and the publicly listed Inox Leisure, the country’s second-largest multiplex player. His son Siddharth Jain (also the brother-in-law of Zee Entertainment Enterprises MD Punit Goenka) oversees the three businesses. This faction’s businesses will be grouped under Inox, which derives the name from the combination of ‘industrial oxygen’. Siddharth did not comment on the report. Devansh said, “The realignment was based on valuation linked to multiple factors, including current financial metrics and future prospects across businesses.” After the settlement, there continues to be minor cross-holdings by the two factions in each other’s companies, like Pavan has less than 1% in Gujarat Fluorochemicals, while Vivek owns about 3% in Inox Leisure. Vivek is also on the board of Inox Leisure, which was originally promoted by Gujarat Fluorochemicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/century-old-inoxs-biz-split-between-2-families/articleshow/87615201.cms||Reeba Zachariah

On Tuesday evening, the MSRTC suspended 376 employees who participated in the strike and were accused of provoking others to stay off duties. “The industrial court had declared the strike illegal. Now, the Bombay high court declared it illegal too, and said we can file a contempt petition. We will be filing a contempt petition against those continuing with the strike tomorrow,” he said. MSRTC advocates G S Hegde and Pinky Bhansali have already informed the court that there were several individuals manning MSRTC depots who were “guilty of wilful disobedience” of the orders passed by the HC. The decision to file contempt petition comes in the wake of 99% MSRTC bus depots — 147 out of 150 — staying completely shut on Tuesday, with bus operations coming almost to a standstill. The only depots which were functioning, although partially, were the two depots in Kolhapur and one at Nashik. Those suspended from service include 58 workers each from Nanded and Sangli, 57 from Yavatmal and 40 staffers from Wardha. Among the cities, 18 were suspended from Nagpur and 17 staffers were suspended from Nashik. No staffer from Mumbai has been suspended yet. This inconvenienced over 25 lakh daily commuters who would travel in 12,500 state buses. In Mumbai, the depots at Kurla, Parel and Mumbai Central wore a deserted look. Parab has now asked workers to call off the strike and said the government was available for a dialogue. However, the decision on their key demand to merge the MSRTC with the state government and to be deemed as state government employees would have to be considered by a state committee set up on Monday. “The MSRTC has suffered heavy losses to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore in the last two years of the pandemic. These are not decisions which can be taken lightly. There are many government corporations which could make the same demand and the government has to think of this in terms of an overall policy,” said Parab. He also appealed to the unions not to get provoked into acting against their own interests. “We have already agreed to three of the demands. This remaining issue has to be considered by the committee,” Parab added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-msrtc-suspends-376-staffers-to-file-contempt-petition-today/articleshow/87623781.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

According to health experts, Chhath is the worship of the setting and rising sun and hence standing before it during the change of season creates magical effects on human bodies. Exposure to sunlight also enhances the devotees’ overall mental outlook and sense of well-being. The skin’s exposure to sunshine releases endorphins which are a sort of antidepressants. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s medicine faculty dean Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad says fasting for more than 24 hours, consuming unadulterated and fresh food and worshipping the setting and rising sun go a long way in enhancing the life span of the devotees. “Following these rituals rigorously helps build a strong immunity which keeps us protected from the invasion of harmful viruses and bacteria,” adds Dr Prasad. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr U K Jha also points out that Chhath Puja rituals help in flushing out harmful bacteria and viruses from the body. He says, “In this month, many people start showing symptoms of allergy, cough, and cold. The Chhath Puja rituals help the human body get rid of toxicity that declines the impact of these symptoms.” Dr Jha adds, “Devotees take dips in water bodies and expose themselves to the sun. This increases the flow of solar energy, boosting the overall function of the human body. Standing in water in front of the rising and setting sun rejuvenates the nervous system of people, giving them good health and a calm mind.” Government Ayurvedic College principal Dr Dineshwar Prasad says our bodies need nutrition to survive and function in the best way possible. He adds, “Deficiency of elements like calcium and vitamin D leads to bone problems and other diseases. Worshipping the sun in Kartik month (during the change of season) leads to better absorption of vitamin D, an element significant for calcium absorption. Since Chhath is celebrated during sunrise and sunset, one is likely to receive ultraviolet rays that are beneficial for human health.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chhath-rituals-build-strong-immunity-doctors/articleshow/87612894.cms||B K Mishra

The devotees will offer ‘arghya’ to the setting sun on Wednesday. The district administration has made elaborate lighting and safety arrangements at Simaria Dham Ghat for the convenience of devotees. Barricades have been put up inside the rivers for the safety of devotees. Divers have also been deputed. Also, police personnel have been deputed at the ghats to maintain law and order. In the town area, ponds were being spruced up on Tuesday. However, the centre of attraction remained the pond at Bishnupur Chaturbhuj Asthan at Ratanpur for its impeccable cleanliness and tastefully decorated stairs. Bari Pokhar at the heart of the town also wore a clean look with proper sanitation after DM Arvind Kumar Verma personally visited it a few days ago. The festival will not be celebrated at Sarvodaya Nagar Pokhar this year as the local administration has identified it as dangerous. More than 12 traditional ghats in the district have been identified as dangerous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chhath-ghats-spruced-up-in-begusarai/articleshow/87612959.cms||---

This is a part of the bank’s attempts to recover loans to the group. According to legal experts, the bank can seek redressal from the Allahabad HC against the police order. The police have issued a notice under Section 102 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which gives them power to seize property that is allegedly stolen or there is reasonable suspicion. The notice was issued on a case based on a complaint by Subhash Chandra, chairman of Essel Group. The FIR is understood to have been lodged in September 2020. The private bank, which is the largest shareholder in DishTV with a stake of over 24%, has sought to oust the management. The bank had acquired a stake in the broadcaster after invoking a pledge on shares that were offered by the Essel Group promoter. The pledges were invoked after the promoter defaulted on its loans. The Essel Group, which has come under stress, had managed to extract a standstill agreement from other lenders. Yes Bank has continued to pursue recovery and moved a resolution to sack CEO Jawahar Goel and other independent directors. However, last Saturday, DishTV informed the stock exchanges that the UP Police have issued a notice to the bank asking it not to deal with DishTV shares or exercise any rights in respect of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-plans-legal-action-on-police-order/articleshow/87615306.cms||---

The Centre has challenged the Delhi HC order allowing implementation of 'Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna' saying that the HC had permitted the AAP government to implement the scheme without hearing the Centre on the deleterious impact of the scheme, which runs counter to the provisions of the NFSA, on distribution of ration to the needy. It said that one of the important adverse impacts would be on the implementation of "one nation one ration card' scheme, which was launched by the Union government to benefit the migrant workers who could draw foodgrains from ration shops at their workplace anywhere in India through biometric authentication. It accused the AAP government of failing to implement ePOS machines at ration shops and also the 'one nation one ration card' scheme and alleged that to hide its failures on these counts it is now attempting to float a new scheme in contravention of the NFSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-in-sc-against-delhi-govts-ration-at-doorstep-scheme/articleshow/87614843.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Most FIRs against cattle owners lodged this year||AHMEDABAD: The cattle nuisance and control department of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has lodged the highest-ever number of police complaints, 564 in all, against stray cattle owners in the period between April and November 8 this year. The owners have been booked mainly for obstructing officials from performing their duties, for attacking them or for creating public nuisance and obstructing flow of traffic. “We have lodged 564 police complaints against stray cattle owners from April 1 to November 8 this year. This is the highest number of police complaints we have lodged since we began filing complaints against stray cattle owners in the middle of 2019-20 (Apr-Mar),” said a senior official in CNCD. He said that the AMC had lodged 485 police complaints in 2019-20, 364 complaints in 2020-21. The complaints are lodged under various provisions of the IPC as well as under the Cattle Trespass Act 1871 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. “We have caught as many as 7,523 stray cattle in the April to November 8 period, which is also the highest. Of these, the highest number of stray cattle (2,529) were caught in October. The same month, we lodged 211 police complaints, highest in a month this year, against cattle owners,” the official said. The official said that the biggest obstruction the department faces is when cattle owners attack them while they are catching stray cattle. “Our teams are attacked frequently for doing their duty, which is the biggest issue we face. We have decided to adopt a no-tolerance policy and requested the police department to send police personnel with our teams,” the official said. “The other issue is repeated offenders. We usually tag stray animals with RFID when we catch them. They are freed when the cattle owners come to reclaim their animals after collecting Rs 3,000 in fine and Rs 500 per day as animal maintenance from them. However, we keep catching the same animal over and over. This year so far, we have caught as many as 324 animals which had been caught and freed earlier,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/most-firs-against-cattle-owners-lodged-this-year/articleshow/87614874.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

These people had surpassed the required interval period between the first and the second shot and should avail the second dose at the earliest possible for broader and long-lasting immunity, officials stressed. The district’s total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, a total of 83.42 lakh are above 18 years and eligible to get the vaccines. Of them, 78.68 lakh have got the first dose. Among them (who got the first dose), 43.33 lakh citizens got both the doses so far. “Of the 10.48 lakh due for the second dose, 9.47 lakh are due for the second dose of Covishield and 1,00,953 are due for the second dose of Covaxin. These citizens have completed the gap of 84 days (for Covishield) and 28 days (for Covaxin) from the first dose as of November 9. They should get the second dose at the earliest,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director, health services.  “After the first priming dose, immunity is stimulated. But over time, it contracts. At this time, the second dose improves the breadth of immune response and ensures durability of the same,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force. In Covid-19, studies have consistently shown lower vaccine efficacy after the first dose as compared to the efficacy after the second dose. The latest state health department report revealed 70 lakh people had not taken their second jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/about-10-5l-residents-due-for-second-jab-in-dist/articleshow/87614075.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Leaders of School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) said as many as 1,000 school buses should cater to passengers on MSRTC routes in Mumbai Metropolitan Region which extends up to Virar, Karjat-Kasara and Pen district. “Across Maharashtra, close to 5,000 school buses will operate in villages, towns and other cities affected due to the strike,” said Anil Garg from SBOA. School and private buses will collect fares which are approved for ST buses. This includes Rs 10 for 0-4 km, Rs 15 for 4-6 km, Rs 20 for 6-10 km, Rs 25 for 10-18 km, Rs 30 for 18-22 km, Rs 35 for 22-26 km, Rs 40 for 26-30 km and Rs 45 for 30 -34 km.

As most ST buses are not plying, these passengers are forced to look for other transport options. On Tuesday morning, many train passengers who deboarded at Nashik found that there were no buses at the ST stand in front of the station. Autorickshaw drivers were seen haggling for higher fares with such passengers. Senior railway officials said there was an increased rush of passengers looking to take the Godavari express to Mumbai as the buses were unavailable. Jignesh Rawat, a passenger who came from Itarsi with 16 others, said, “We did not know about the bus strike. We want to go to Chakan in Pune. Since there are no buses plying towards Pune, we have been waiting at this railway station since last night. Private bus operators are likely to charge us a high fare.” A woman, with two small children, said she had been waiting for her husband to come on a bike from Sinnar to pick them up. She said the private operators are cramming passengers inside their vehicles and are charging exorbitant rates. Therefore, she felt it was better for her to wait for her husband instead. A large number of passengers headed towards Malegaon, Dhule and Trimbakeshar, who otherwise would have taken a direct ST bus, instead opted for city bus services till Dwarka and CBS and then rent taxis to their final destinations. Many passengers headed towards Shirdi, Sinnar and Sangamner walked till the Nashik Road flyover to take a private bus. Private vehicles including cars and jeeps were also ferrying passengers to adjoining talukas and districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-stir-strikes-train-passengers-deboarding-at-nashik-road-station/articleshow/87612202.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Ahmedabad||‘Refund failed Thailand trip charges’||Ahmedabad: A consumer court has ordered a tour operator to return tour expenses to two petitioners, who went to Thailand on a package tour but failed in visa interview and had to return from Bangkok airport. The case involved Maheshkumar Panchiwala and Vasantkumar Modi, both traders from Deesa town of Banaskantha district, and Ahmedabad-based Priyanka Tour & Travels. Panchiwala and Modi had opted for a package tour to Bangkok and Pattaya in 2018 and paid for the tickets and visa charges. They were told by the tour operator that theirs is a group of 15 tourists and they would be provided with a tour manager, who would receive them on Bangkok and look after their stay and travel comfort. The manager was supposed to accompany the tourists throughout the trip up to the Ahmedabad airport. Both the tourists board their flight for Bangkok in May 2018. When they landed at Bangkok, the manager did not turn up to receive them. They had to face visa interview. They did not have any evidence to show their pre-planned tour and hotel bookings. They did not have required currency to show to qualify for the visa. The immigration authorities did not allow them entry and sent them back to Kolkata. For this, they had to incur expense from their own pockets. Upon return, they sued the travel agency in the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Banaskantha district alleging deficiency in service and demanded Rs 1.30 lakh back. The travel agency refused the claim that the tourists were promised a tour manager. They failed the visa interview. The travel agency maintained that there was no duping on its part. After the hearing, the court concluded that it was a failed trip. The travel agency had recovered charges for bookings and visa. But when they reached Bangkok, they had nothing to prove that it was a pre-planned trip and that their stay was booked at hotels in Thailand. Absence of documents with customers to ensure visa is poor service on part of the operator. Any harassment is deficiency in service . The travel agency was asked to refund the amount and pay Rs 2,500 extra for the harassment .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/refund-failed-thailand-trip-charges/articleshow/87614077.cms||---

The AQI was 369 on Monday. According to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the air quality may even turn 'severe' in the next few days due to decreasing wind speed and dropping temperatures. The average wind speed decreased to 8km/hr on Tuesday from 10km/hr on Monday. On Tuesday, three of the four air monitoring stations in Gurgaon recorded AQI in the 'very poor' category. A ‘very poor’ AQI can lead to “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. The Gwal Pahari monitoring station recorded the highest AQI of 386, followed by Vikas Sadan with an AQI of 373 and Sector 51 with an AQI of 345. The AQI at Teri Gram was not recorded on Tuesday due to insufficient data. HSPCB officials said that civic authorities and other agencies were following all measures, according to the graded response action plan (GRAP). “Besides water sprinkling on roads and mechanised sweeping of roads, agencies are implementing a strict ban on dumping and burning of garbage,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB. On Monday, HSPCB officials had pointed out that garbage burning in several parts of the city was contributing to a rise in pollutants. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurgaon recorded a minimum temperature of 13 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The low temperature is currently preventing the dispersal of pollutants closer to the ground, said air quality experts. Meanwhile, Delhi's air quality again turned 'severe' on Tuesday as the city recorded an AQI of 404, up from 390 on Monday. However, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 reduced from 30% on Monday to 27% on Tuesday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). Following the same trend, the air quality in Faridabad again turned “severe” on Tuesday. On Monday, Faridabad’s AQI was 360 in the 'very poor' category but on Tuesday, it became 430. "With the region currently witnessing a dip in minimum temperature, pollutants are likely to stay in the lower atmosphere, making the air quality unbreathable," an IMD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-air-of-relief-aqi-likely-to-hit-severe-mark-again/articleshow/87614884.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Delhi||Digital short-format and cinema will coexist, evolve. People want great story, says Prasoon Joshi||NEW DELHI: A glut of storytellers and a dearth of the necessary audience – that’s how Prasoon Joshi describes the “new reality” that the advent of OTT platforms and social media has created in the entertainment space. Speaking at a session of the Times LitFest, Joshi said “democratisation” of platforms has led to audiences being bombarded with content. Lower attention spans aren’t helping but binge-watching holds out hope. In conversation with actor Vani Tripathi, the adman, poet, writer, lyricist and screenwriter, and current chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), plucked the word ‘frontloading’ from the advertising lexicon to emphasise how attention span of the human race has dropped to “less than eight seconds, which is one second less than the goldfish”. At the same time, he noted, there are still people who are “binge-watching, at times for 6-7 hours at a length”. Joshi agreed that clamour for the short and to-the-point digital format was growing, especially in pandemic times, but said it it’s too early to say that longformat cinema will not survive. Both, he said, will coexist and evolve, “because eventually, people are looking for something unusual, great ideas and great stories. (And) for me, if you are delivering a story in a long format, it has to satisfy a certain seek,” he said. Responding to a question by Tripathi on his journey from a 30-second storytelling milestone to a three-hour one, Joshi said the art of storytelling was an “age-old tradition in the country” and while growing up in the mountains with fewer resources for entertainment, it had come to him naturally. “For me, the 30-second (advertisement) format came later as a discipline, while storytelling was at the genesis of it,” he said. “As storytellers, what we do is to pull out a few strings from here and there and present it in a colourful way.” Not one for happy endings:In another free-wheeling session, author Ravinder Singh spoke to writer-columnist Kena Shree about his latest book, ‘Write Me A Love Story', released in May 2021. The charm of being an author, Singh said, was that while writing a book, he could live so many different lives and experience so many things he otherwise wouldn’t. Like most of his protagonists, Abhimanyu Razdan of his latest novel also ends up having some shades of him but the storyline, in Singh’s words, is “brutally real” about the challenges within the publishing business. Asked about his style of writing where “tears go teary”, the 39-year-old author said he injects pathos in his characters as it comes more naturally to him than a happy ending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/digital-short-format-and-cinema-will-coexist-evolve-people-want-great-story/articleshow/87614872.cms||---

A bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla, which was hearing a batch of petitions on decongesting the complex, asked South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to “arrive at a broad consensus” with the other stakeholders and share its proposal within a week on vendors in the area. The court took note that another bench of the high court was examining the issue of vendors and their rights and said, till then, it would allow the 95 vendors, who already have interim court orders in their favour, to continue hawking while strictly complying with the restrictions with regards to time, space and place imposed upon them. “We will ask you (vendors) to comply and allow only those permitted by DDA to sell. Stay confined to your area and leave the place clean... Nehru Place is a big commercial area. It should not become a slum. Things are very bad,” it remarked. The court also stressed that, while balancing competing interests, it must be seen that there was access to fire brigades in case of an emergency. “There can’t be excessive hawkers or excessive shopkeepers. In an area for 60 people, 5,000 people cannot hawk,” the court added. During the hearing, the court also questioned the civic body over its failure to verify on the ground level that limited hawkers were allowed. “We will haul up your commissioner, he is not complying with the court orders.. SDMC is not playing the role of a leader,” the court remarked. It also asked Delhi Jal Board to file an affidavit stating that it would finish all its digging work within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-nehru-place-does-not-become-a-slum-hc-to-sdmc/articleshow/87634616.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: CM Ashok Gehlot finally says will have to reduce VAT on auto fuels||JODHPUR: Giving in to pressure, chief minister Ashok Gehlot finally admitted that he would have to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel in the state. He said the state government would bear the revenue loss caused by the move. Though he did not hint when it would come, his statement has come as a huge relief for the people paying the highest rates for auto fuels in the country. Gehlot, who was in Jodhpur on a one-day visit, said this at a public address at Jaleli Fozdar village after taking stock of a camp under ‘Prashasan Gaon ke Sang’. “When all the states have reduced prices, we would also have to reduce it," he said. A day earlier, he had expressed his reluctance to reduce tax and had written a letter to the Centre demanding further reduction from their part. But as many states have already done it, especially Congress-ruled Punjab, Gehlot was under pressure to follow them. "Our government would also provide relief to the people by reducing VAT on petrol and diesel in state," he said. Holding the Centre responsible for high fuel prices, he said that it was looting people by levying massive taxes on fuel. "They have provided a meagre relief," he said, stating that the Centre should further reduce taxes. Gehlot, who had come to his hometown after an year-and-a-half, also held a ‘Jan Sunvai’ at the Circuit House for over an hour. He was accompanied by the PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra and mining minister Pramod Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-finally-says-will-have-to-reduce-vat-on-auto-fuels/articleshow/87614901.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: PLL to invest Rs 1,700 crore to build third jetty at Dahej||AHMEDABAD: Petronet LNG Ltd, which meets about 40% of the country’s total gas demand from its terminal at Dahej, is planning to invest Rs 1,700 crore to build a third jetty, said industry sources close to the development. “The company recently floated a tender to initiate construction work for the project. The expansion was stuck for some time due to the Covid pandemic,” said an industry expert, aware of the matter. As many as eight companies are in the race for the jetty project, he further said. With this project, the company aims to undergo diversification as it has chalked out plans to import liquid ethane and propane at the third jetty. Ethane is feedstock for the manufacturing of petrochemicals and is used to produce plastics, while propane is used as cooking gas and for home and water heating. Earlier this year, a senior company executive said they were exploring plans to set up a petrochemicals complex in Gujarat. PLL owns and operates LNG terminal at Dahej which commenced its commercial operations in April 2004. “Considering the increasing demand of natural gas in the country and proposed expansion of LNG terminal from 17.5 MTPA to 20 MTPA, PLL has now proposed to construct third berth (jetty) of 2.5 km adjacent to the existing second berth for unloading of LNG and transport to the storage tanks,” according to a pre-feasibility report for the third jetty. It will also act as a risk mitigation measure in case existing berths are unable to operate for an extended period or to cater to the anticipated number of ships at a time, the report states. PLL is also planning to import and unload liquid ethane and propane at the third berth through carriers of parcel size of 1 lakh cubic metres. It is expected that 1.25 MTPA ethane will be handled initially and expandable to 2.5 MTPA in the future, as per the report. “There is a huge demand for ethane and propane by petrochemical industries available in the vicinity. Thus, it is proposed to import ethane and propane also through third berth and supply to the consumers,” it said. The onshore infrastructure for ethane and propane storage & regasification system shall be planned and installed at a later stage. Ethane and propane unloading shall only be done after construction/installation of onshore ethane and propane storage & regasification system, it said.

Uttam Patil, head of the MSRTC Workers’ Union, said, “All 12 depots in the Kolhapur region are participating in the strike; no bus was operational on Tuesday.” Patil said the government had not yet acted against the protesting staffers in the Kolhapur region, but said they would intensify the strike if any workers are penalized. “If the government wants to take action, then it should act against the entire union,” Patil said. Seema Chougale, a MSRTC bus conductor, said, “We are firm on our demands. It’s time for the government to give us state government employee status. We have struggled and survived difficult duty hours, which were mentally taxing, that too on minimum salaries. Even during the pandemic, we were at work. The public should understand our difficulties and support us.” The state government has given temporary permission for private buses, school buses and transport vehicles to serve as public transport vehicles, which were seen running at capacity in the district. Satishchandra Kamble, head of a private travel operators’ body, said, “Post-Diwali, buses and trains are running full. People are suffering due to the strike and so, we have asked private operators to charge normal rates and not to take undue advantage of the strike.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/staff-of-all-12-msrtc-depots-in-kolhapur-take-part-in-agitation/articleshow/87612216.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Ahmedabad||‘Defence capability development is national imperative’||Ahmedabad: The capability development of the country’s armed forces is a national imperative due to the country’s active and disputed borders with two neighbours, said General M M Naravane, chief of the Army staff (COAS), here on Tuesday. He added that disruptive technologies are fast transforming the character of the modern world. Gen Naravane was speaking at the virtual MoU signing ceremony between Gandhinagar-based Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU) and the Army Training Command (ARTRAC). As part of the MoU, the university and Indian Army will collaborate for academic research in national security issues. The ARTRAC also signed an MoU with Gandhinagar-based Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N) for geoinformatics and space tech. “Disruptive technologies are transforming the character of the modern world, faster than ever before. We have seen the decisive impact of these technologies in recent conflicts around the world,” General Naravane said. “Given our active and disputed borders in the north and the east with our two neighbours, capability development of Armed Forces remains a national imperative.” He added that the dependence on niche technologies with other countries creates significant vulnerabilities especially in times of conflict. The collaborations on Tuesday aligns with the government’s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and would pave way for the civil-military fusion in defence capabilities, he added. “Academic vigour needs to be enriched with operational understanding to meet the challenges of modern warfare. The MoUs signed will synergise the expertise and potential of both the institutions,” said the COAS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/defence-capability-development-is-national-imperative/articleshow/87614106.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||Former teacher protesting against land grab for 25 yrs goes to UP CM rally to demand action||Muzaffarnagar: Master Vijay Singh, 59, proceeded to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's rally in Kairana on Monday to further his case and demand action against an ex-MLA who allegedly encroached upon thousands of bighas of land in the Shamli district. It was only a few days ago when Singh, who had been protesting against the land grab for the past 25 years, received an RTI reply with the report of a government-initiated investigation that concluded the land was encroached upon by the former member of the legislative assembly. Singh, who was blindfolded in a symbolic gesture to show what he felt is a miscarriage of justice, was surrounded and stopped by the police but his memorandum was accepted by the officials present there. He had taken a ride from a biker who dropped him from Muzaffarnagar to Kairana. TOI had reported earlier that according to the RTI reply, the inquiry ordered by Shamli's administration, based on Singh’s complaint, was completed in 2019 but the findings were not communicated to Singh despite him having continuously asked for it. No action was taken either. Now, with chief minister Yogi Adityanath in a neighbouring district, Singh tried to meet him, requesting him to take action. Sub-divisional magistrate Vishv Raja said, "He wanted to meet the chief minister but since he did not have permission, we had to stop him. However, I requested him to hand over his complaint to me but he did not do so." Giving more details about his 25-year journey fighting against illegal land grabbing, Singh told TOI, "Back in September 1994, I was en route to school and saw a child with his mother crying for some roti. Our village has thousands of bigha of government land, which is supposed to belong to the poor for farming. I discovered that thousands of bighas of land in the village was encroached upon by powerful people. The very next day I decided to dedicate my life to the cause of the poor." "After struggling for months and not getting any results, I sat on a dharna against land grabbing by a former MLA and his associates in January 1996 at Muzaffarnagar's collectorate," he added. Singh had quit his job as a teacher during his quest for justice. He said, "I have 20 bighas of farming land through which my family earns their bread and butter. My family had stopped giving me money in 2016 and had asked me to end my protest, but I did not give up. Now, Devaraj Panwar, who is a social activist, along with several others, is helping me survive. He provided me some space to store my belongings and stay the night -- all just yards away from my dharna spot."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/former-teacher-protesting-against-land-grab-for-25-yrs-goes-to-up-cm-rally-to-demand-action/articleshow/87614087.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Coimbatore||Rain fills waterbodies to the brim||Coimbatore: Most of the waterbodies in the city and on its outskirts are already filled to the brim, even as more rain is expected to lash the district in the coming days. A Public Works Department (PWD) official said Ukkadam Periyakulam, Valankulam, Krishnampathy lake, Selvampathy lake, Singanallur lake, Vellalore lake and Selvachinthamani lake were all in spate and the surplus water was being released through outlet channels. All these waterbodies are located on the Noyyal basin in the southern part of the city. With the meteorological department predicting more rain, he said, they, along with the city corporation officials, were closely monitoring the waterbodies. The official said almost all the waterbodies on the Noyyal basin had filled to their 100% capacity because of the copious water flow in the river. The only exceptions are Neelambur lake and Perur Big Tank, which are only 95% full. “Since they are in spate, we have closed inlet channels to them completely. Only rainwater from the city will flow to them for now. We are closely monitoring the waterbodies to prevent any breach.” According to weather experts, the district usually receives the height rainfall of the northeast monsoon season in October (142.8mm on an average), followed by November (84.2 mm) and December (23.1mm). However, the district had received 177.5mm rainfall this October. Major dams in and around the district are also fast filling up, thanks to the heavy rainfall. While the water level in the Aliyar dam has touched 118.85ft against its full capacity of 120ft, the Bhavanisagar dam level has rose to 103ft against its full capacity of 105ft. The water level in the Pillur dam has, meanwhile, touched 88ft against its full capacity of 100ft and the level in the Siruvani has increased to 44.64ft against its full capacity of 49.53ft. Activists, meanwhile, said some of the waterbodies were lacking proper weirs and hence it was difficult for the excess water to drain out. R Manikandan, coordinator of Kovai Kulangal Pathukappu Amaippu, said the reason for waterlogging at Ramanathapuram Junction on Trichy main road was the absence of a proper weir in Valankulam tank. “Surplus water could not drain out from the tank and it creates waterlogging at Ramanathapuram Jn. Outlets of all waterbodies should be inspected and officials should ensure that proper weir is in place.” Another activist said Chinnavedampatti lake, which is located in the northern part of the city, hadn’t received water in tune with the rainfall in its catchment areas such as Thadagam, Mangarai and Kanuvai. S Sivaraja, coordinator of Chinnavedampatti Lake Restoration Association, said the small streams in Thadagam area were not culminating in Sanganur stream because of several breaches on their pathways. “Sanganur stream water flows into Pannimadai check dam, from where the water reaches the lake via Raajavaikkal. Since the small streams are not reaching Sanganur stream, the flow to the lake is hit. If the lake gets more water, it will help improve the underground water table. Hence, officials should do the needful to ensure proper water flow to the lake at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rain-fills-waterbodies-to-the-brim/articleshow/87614894.cms||V Devanathan

In Bengal, more than 50 schools, which were initially chosen, have now been replaced with others and a fresh circular reached the survey coordinators on Tuesday with new names. Four schools in Kolkata and 12 in Howrah are among those that have been replaced by the board for the survey. Among the schools in Kolkata that have been replaced are Maheshwari Balika Vidyalaya, Janakalyan Shiksha Mandir High School and B D Memorial Institute. No replacement was found for Maheshwari Balika Vidyalaya, but Janakalyan Shiksha Mandir High School has been replaced with Jadavpur N K Pal Adarsha Shikshayatan and B D Memorial with National Gems Higher Secondary School. “For all the schools on board, intense training sessions are on with the observers. The final list of schools is ready and we hope to conduct a smooth survey,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, a board appointed co-ordinator. Schools affiliated to the state board are facing the most trouble. A head master said, “We were told on October 31 to arrange for offline exams and the District Inspector’s office directed us to follow instructions. But one instruction after another have made it complex, without a clear guideline on how to prepare students. We have searched out samples to ready the kids.” Assistant headmaster of Kataganj Gokulpur Adarsha Sikshayatan High School Prabir Biswas said, “We spent from our school fund for sanitization. It is difficult for a school like ours to bear initial costs as we have limited money. We should have got more time to prepare our students as the format is new for them.” Headmaster of Chetla Boys’ School Rajib Kar said, “We have arranged for training for class X students but response is poor. We are not sure whether we can bring at least 30 students or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-schools-replaced-on-survey-list/articleshow/87614906.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

All local authorities have been directed to persuade their staffers to complete their second dose as per the schedule. With the door-to-door campaign, the department heads can track the numbers and ensure that all frontline workers are vaccinated,” Kunte told TOI. As per the public health department, 87% of healthcare workers and 86% frontline workers have been vaccinated in the state. Kunte said even as most of the frontline workers have got their first dose, there was some complacency in getting the second dose. He said the state should look at covering all the beneficiaries with at least single dose of vaccine by December-end. Additional chief secretary health Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that with the “har ghar dastak” campaign, they were proactively approaching all those who have missed their second dose and those who are yet to get first dose. “We will try to ensure that all eligible population is covered by November 30,” he said. On the Covishield doses gap, Kunte said the state has been continuously following up with the Centre on the issue. Senior state government officials told TOI that even as persuasive techniques should be followed, coercive techniques should not be adopted by the local authorities Recently, the Thane municipal corporation mandated that the government staff would not get their salary if they were not vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/chief-secy-calls-for-speeding-up-vax-of-frontline-workers/articleshow/87614084.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Goa||Yet again, it’s BJP vs BJP in Mandrem||PANAJI: With state polls nearly three months away, BJP is facing its first test as former CM Laxmikant Pareskar and Mandrem MLA Dayanand Sopte have locked horns for the Mandrem seat. On Monday, Sopte officially launched his poll campaign for the 2022 elections taking Parsekar by surprise. With ticket distribution yet to begin, Sopte’s move is being seen in political circles as a message to the party brass that he is ready for the fight. But a belligerent Parsekar, who has remained steadfast in his decision of contesting, dismissed it and said: “Those who think they have hurdles on their way have to start work early, that’s the reason one has started the campaign.” In 2017, Parsekar, then CM, lost the assembly election by over 7,000 votes to Sopte of Congress. In 2018, Sopte joined BJP and they have been open about their differences. “If someone is saying that the ticket has been allotted to him, or that he has got the green signal, it is blatant lies. I am in touch with the persons concerned including members of the parliamentary board, the BJP national president, and the BJP national general secretary (organisation),” Parsekar said. Sopte, meanwhile, said everyone should work together over the next two and a half months to strengthen the party and show BJP’s strength in Mandrem to CM Pramod Sawant, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and general secretary (organisation) Satish Dhond. In August this year, in an embarrassment to BJP, the CM’s visit to Mandrem saw the constituency’s two heavyweights not share the stage. Parsekar not only did not show up at the event, but he also organised his own function. However, Sawant tried to play it down and said Parsekar would join the event later. But the former CM did not turn up and in an indirect attack on Sopte, said people attended his function without accepting money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-again-its-bjp-vs-bjp-in-mandrem/articleshow/87614903.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Short circuit in flat 1902 led to fire at Curry Road highrise’||MUMBAI: A preliminary report by the Mumbai Fire Brigade into the blaze at the 60-storey One Avighna Park at Curry Road on October 22, in which killed one person died, has stated that the fire was owing to a short circuit in the main electrical distribution board of the 19th floor flat number 1902. As already reported by the TOI, the fire brigade, in its report tabled before the civic standing committee meeting on Tuesday, has said that fire teams reached on the 19th floor of the building’s B wing where the fire had started and tried to douse the flames with the help of in-built water hose. “But this caused hurdles in the fire fighting work as water was not coming with the required pressure. The firemen then decided to make use of the water hose from its vehicles to douse the flames. This led to the entire flat number 1902 getting gutted; fire also spread to a part of flat number 2002,” said the fire brigade in its report. On the day of the blaze, a chilling video of a 30-year-old security guard hanging from the 19th floor and falling to his death from the blaze site had gone viral across social media and messaging groups. The fire report added, “The exact cause of the fire is under investigation but, in preliminary investigations, it is revealed that the fire was reported in flat number 1902. A police complaint is also filed by the fire brigade. As the fire fighting equipment in the society was not kept in working condition, a show cause notice has been issued to the concerned stakeholders.” Under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measures Act, 2006, it is the responsibility of the property’s owner or the cooperative housing society to follow fire safety norms and submit an audit report, signed by a licensed fire expert, every six months. Meanwhile, a probe into the incident is being conducted by a panel formed under additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar. A report with regards to it is expected to be tabled in the BMC soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-short-circuit-in-flat-1902-led-to-fire-at-curry-rd-highrise/articleshow/87615764.cms||Richa Pinto

KTR said he was getting calls that they were seeing KCR of the Telangana movement days and they wanted to see him (KCR) like that. The minister asked the party workers not to spare those who resort to a smear campaign against KCR, ministers or other TRS leaders on social media, especially WhatsApp and Facebook. “The party workers should give them back on the same platform if anybody maligns any of the 60 lakh TRS family members,” KTR said. The minister attacked Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Aravind without naming them. He said some people won elections by making promises on a bond paper and now were keeping quiet after getting elected. KTR said while neighbouring Karnataka BJP MLAs want Telangana schemes to be replicated in respective constituencies, local BJP leaders have been blind to development of the state in the past seven years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-of-t-movement-days-intact-says-ktr/articleshow/87614095.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Ahmedabad||PROFITABLE BUZZ BACK ON LABH PANCHAM||Ahmedabad: The bustle was finally back in Ahmedabad on Tuesday after the festival holiday. Streets looked busy, downed shutters in the city’s major markets were up, and the roads along these markets which were deserted during the festive season were full of people. Going by the tradition that has been cherished for generations, shopkeepers opened their establishments, decorated the entrances with marigold and asopalav festoons, performed a pooja, and began the day. Being an auspicious occasion, Tuesday was important for businesspersons. They check for a propitious muhurat during the day and personally go to their stores to open the shop, perform the pooja, and begin operations. “We usually perform a pooja in the morning, seek blessings, and start the day,” said Jigar Soni, an Ahmedabad jeweller. “Our first transaction is usually a pre-decided order which has been placed in advance for the Labh Pancham muhurat and customers come to take delivery.” Soni added: “Overall, the sentiment was good as customers walked in to buy gold and silver coins and bars honouring the Labh Pancham muhurat.” Major markets across Madhupura, Panchkuwa, Teen Darwaza, Bhadra, Dilli Darwaza, CG Road, Ashram Road, SG Road, Bodakdev, and Prahladnagar among others resumed business as usual. Some markets such as the jewellery hub in Ratanpole and Manek Chowk will resume business over the next two days. Footfalls at the shops were significant even after festivities were over.“The Panchkuwa cloth market is a wholesale centre and the business was much better than expected,” said Kiritbhai Patel, president, Shree Panchkuwa Mahajan. “We expected a slow start but in the run-up to the wedding season, people came in with fresh orders. Others made purchases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/profitable-buzz-back-on-labh-pancham/articleshow/87614909.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Online retailers enjoy Diwali dhoom||Ahmedabad: Retailers across the board rejoiced a generous revival in demand this festive season. Online retailers, however, cornered more business in the run-up to the festive season than their offline counterparts. The cash collected by e-commerce platforms in the state far exceeded the amount garnered in offline retail trade, according to cash indices prepared by CMS Info Systems – a company that handles cash management and transit at ATMs, retail, and e-commerce points. The company's cash index for e-commerce platforms stood at 160 in Gujarat against the index value of 121 for offline retailers in October 2021. The cash index value is calculated on the basis of cash collected by CMS from retail and e-commerce points. The wide gap between indices of e-commerce and retail suggests how e-commerce purchases ruled festive season purchases over offline retail. “Gujaratis are clearly spending more through e-commerce as is demonstrated with October 2021 seeing 60% growth over February 2020,” said Anush Raghavan, president – cash management business, CMS Info Systems, which commands at least 40% share in Gujarat’s cash management services market. The cash indices, however, may not reflect the small-time retailers who are not affiliated with CMS. Talking to TOI, Raghavan also said that despite a slew of digital payment modes available for payments, cash continues to add convenience in purchases and other transactions. Since the pandemic, convenience and safety both drove consumers increasingly towards the digital platform for purchases. “The shift towards e-commerce was clearly more since the pandemic, given the sheer convenience of purchases. Consumers are becoming increasingly more comfortable buying a range of products online with several features and shopping that make the buying experience as easy as purchasing it from the store. Over the past three to four months, we have seen an uptick in the buying and spending patterns and discounts do drive the sales, especially during the festival season,” said Neha Sheth, who owns an e-commerce portal in the fashion and lifestyle segment. Ever since the growth of online e-commerce giants, brick-and-mortar stores are increasingly feeling the heat as online shopping platforms are eating into their share of revenues. Since the pandemic, in fact, several local stores have also begun selling online. “Discounts have always lured customers to online shopping platforms. Conventional retail outlets gained in terms of a shopping experience, after-sales service and the try-touch-feel-use-experience factors. However, since the pandemic, buying patterns have undergone a drastic shift. At the same time, even e-commerce platforms have introduced new features and improvised on their service experience all of which has pushed customers away from offline retail,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/online-retailers-enjoy-diwali-dhoom/articleshow/87614910.cms||Niyati Parikh

The commissioner took the stern action against the cops for accepting bribes from a spa centre owner to allow flesh trade. The officers have been identified as sub-inspector Ananda Kumar, Kalaiselvan, Sekar, and head constable Manikandan. All of them were attached to the Hasthampatty police station. According to a police officer, the four officers were ordered by the commissioner to inspect all the spa centres in the city two months ago. However, the officers allegedly received bribes from one centre that was owned by Tej Mandal, 27, of Bengaluru, and allowed it to run flesh trade. On October 15, Tej Mandal was found dead under suspicious circumstances at her house. Following her death, the Hasthampatty police registered a case and initiated an inquiry. During the inquiry, it was confirmed that the spa centre owner carried out flesh trade at the spa centre. A police official said that the commissioner directed the Salem-north deputy commissioner M Madasamy to look into the issue. The DC confirmed the officers received kickbacks from the spa centre owner and submitted his report to the commissioner recommending him to issue the suspension order for the four officers. “Based on the report, the commissioner issued the order on Tuesday evening and served the copies to them on the same night,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/4-cops-allow-sex-racket-after-taking-bribe-suspended/articleshow/87614907.cms||---

The board has tested this as pilot during the January 2021 CTET examination. “Data was collected in collaboration with Central Square Foundation and Playpower Labs to develop algorithms to identify suspicious data patterns at the centre and the individual test-taker level. Based on the analysis results and the algorithms developed, CBSE has decided that such analysis will be extended to other administered examinations,” the statement added. Through this technology, CBSE aims to identify exam centres where the data indicates existence of malpractices. “Post this, appropriate measures can be taken by CBSE to strengthen the reliability of examinations and to deter any malpractices,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-to-use-data-analytics-to-curb-cheating-in-exams/articleshow/87614908.cms||---

Thalassemia, the most common hemoglobinopathy, is prevalent in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam, partly due to consanguineous marriages. The Andhra Pradesh government sanctioned the project to AMC under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. Andhra Medical College has procured specialised diagnostic equipment with about Rs 20 lakh for this pilot project to screen children aged between five and eight years. Speaking to TOI, Andhra Medical College principal Dr PV Sudhakar said the project also involves conducting community-level awareness programmes. “While the pathology department will take care of screening of the kids, the community medicine department of the college will pitch in for conducting the awareness programmes. These are aimed at improving health-seeking behaviour and to accept the screening and management of thalassemia. For instance, thalassemia in the Visakhapatnam tribal areas is closely associated with consanguineous marriages. The awareness programmes will discourage consanguineous marriages,” said Dr Sudhakar. Dr Sudhakar added that the high-performance liquid chromatography machine was procured for the accurate diagnosis of thalassemia patients. “ITDA-Paderu project officer R Gopala Krishna is supporting the project on various fronts,” said Dr Sudhakar. Principal investigator of the project and head of the department of pathology Dr A Bhagyalakshmi said about 2,000 children, aged between five and eight, will be screened for thalassemia under the project. “Initially the kids will be tested through haemoglobin estimation and other primary tests. If there is any abnormality in these tests, the child will be referred for a high-performance liquid chromatography test. However, even if the primary tests turn out to be negative, some kids will be referred for the HPLC tests based on their signs and symptomatology. This will help in early detection of the cases, which will in turn help identify the cases in siblings of patients. A medical register will be maintained for the screened children,” said Dr Bhagyalakshmi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/amc-to-screen-tribal-kids-for-thalassemia/articleshow/87613062.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Ahmedabad||Deputy collector held in Ahmedabad for sexually harassing government officer||AHMEDABAD: A deputy collector working in Modasa town of Arvalli district was held by the city police on Monday for allegedly harassing a Class 2 government officer with sexual remarks, threats and sending obscene pictures to her 10-year-old son, husband and other family members. The accused has been identified as Mayank Patel, 28, a deputy collector in Modasa and a resident of Shihora village in Kapadwanj taluka of Kheda district. Patel met the complainant for the first time in 2016 during a state government event and they later met of and on for work purposes. When they met, Patel was a deputy mamlatdar in Nadiad and was preparing for the deputy collectors’ exam. In 2017, he passed the exam and became the deputy collector of Modasa. The complainant had to meet Patel for government events, during which he had taken her mobile phone number and began talking with her. The complainant and accused used to visit each other’s houses and had good relations. As Patel began making advances, she stopped talking to him, which enraged him to the extent that he began harassing her. Patel had nine simcards, including one government allotted number, using which he had harassed the complainant, pestering her to have a relationship with him. “Patel used to interfere in her personal and professional life, due to which she stopped talking with him. He would call her from different numbers and if she did not receive his calls, he would keep calling and sending messages from different numbers,” said a police officer. He used to get the location of the complainant by misusing his powers and would reach wherever she was to harass her, said a police officer. Patel also began calling her husband and in-laws and threatened them with dire consequences. “Patel threatened to slander the complainant and even threatened to commit suicide after killing her family members,” said a police officer. The complainant’s family also approached Patel’s family, to try to persuade him not to harass her, but he did not stop. Recently, he sent obscene images of her to her son, husband and father-in-law, after which the complainant approached city police and filed a complaint of sexual harassment along with charges under the Information Technology Act against Patel on Monday. Cybercrime police have arrested the accused and begun an investigation.

The 23-year-old had even sought permission to give his architecture exams from jail. He completed his graduation this year. The prosecution had opposed the plea to move aboard. Noting Parihar’s age and educational qualifications, special NDPS judge D B Mane, however, said, “He intends to accept the offer of service given... In such circumstances, the application of the accused is liable to be allowed with certain conditions to secure his presence, though not on each date, but at least some dates on which his personal presence is required.” Parihar will reside in the UK with his brother. Parihar told the court he received the offer letter from the company in September, and was scheduled to join them this month. Parihar’s lawyer submitted that he would not dispute his identity during the trial and his absence will not cause any prejudice to the prosecution or hamper the the trial’s progress. It was further contended that the right to travel abroad and right to practice any profession are recognised by the Constitution. Allowing the plea, the court directed the Narcotics Control Bureau to return Parihar’s passport. The judge directed Parihar to attend court once in four months — February, June and November, 2022 — and also any other date if, ordered or summoned. Parihar will also have to deposit Rs 1 lakh as security. “If the accused commits breach of conditions, the security amount would be forfeited,” the court said, adding that he is to provide details of his itinerary, and also inform it and the investigating officer about his residence in the UK. “The accused is also ordered to bring this order to the notice of his employer,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drugs-case-accused-allowed-to-work-in-uk/articleshow/87615766.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The accused was working as a watchman at an apartment in Shamshabad. In 2018, the accused had sexually exploited his two minor daughters, aged about 14 and 12 years, at their home, investigating officer S Ashok Kumar said. “Even though some other members of the family were aware of the assault, they could not stop the accused due to fear. The incident came to light when the girls finally mustered enough courage and told some neighbours,” Ashok Kumar said. Police immediately arrested the accused under Sections 376 (2) (f) (n) Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 5 (1) & 6 of the POCSO Act. A charge sheet has been filed in 2019. After the trial, the MSJ Court of LB Nagar convicted the accused on Tuesday and sentenced him to undergo 15-year rigorous imprisonment. The court has also awarded Rs 6 lakh compensation to each of the two survivors. “The girls have been shifted to a rehabilitation home after the incident,” Ashok Kumar said.

---||Goa||Logistics index: Goa languishes at bottom||Panaji: Despite its natural advantages, Goa continues to languish at the bottom of the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) ranking for 2021. Plagued by poor infrastructure, high transportation costs and regulatory constraints, Goa came in at 18th position in the 2021 LEADS report released by the Union ministry of commerce. Though the state improved its ranking by three positions as compared to the 2019 index, the relatively low score proves that despite the state government’s intent, not much has changed on the ground. Gujarat consolidated its position at the top of the LEADS chart followed by Haryana and Punjab. The ministry of commerce and industry had launched a study, “Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS)” in 2018, with the main objective of ranking states and Union Territories on the efficiency of their logistics ecosystem. The report ranks the states on the basis of their logistics ecosystem, highlights the key logistics-related challenges faced by the stakeholders, and includes recommendations. The LEADS 2021 exercise has gone one step ahead in analysing domestic and EXIM logistics ecosystem of states. According to the report, Goa needs to improve the availability and quality of infrastructure, especially road, rail, and terminal infrastructure. It has recommended that road connectivity along the Kochi-Mangaluru-Goa (NH 66) route, and stretch from Ramnagar to Anmod need to be improved quickly. Goa has a low score when it comes to road freight rates and prices of terminal services, which in turn leads to high transportation costs. “Exporters feel that cost of transportation from Karnataka to Goa is higher than transporting it to JNPT. This results in increase in the logistics cost, thereby making marine products uncompetitive. Non-availability of scheduled rail connectivity for container movement from Goa to JNPT, and the feeder vessel frequency for exports movement is sporadic,” the report noted. Goa has tried to address these challenges by granting industry status to the logistics sector and by preparing a state logistics policy. The report has stressed on the need for adequate access to ICEGATE (Indian Custom EDI gateway) service centres for freight forwarders from Goa. ICEGATE is the gateway for importers, exporters, airlines, shipping agents, banks, custodians and government agencies for document-filing and data-sharing under the customs business process. “The state may inspect and investigate the constraints being faced by the industry and may prepare and formalise a comprehensive logistics policy at the state level to provide regulatory support, guidelines, requisite approvals, incentives, and clearances for the logistics sector. Strengthen institutional mechanisms by setting up a city logistics coordination committee to streamline city logistics. The road leading from Huballi to Goa, especially the road stretch between Ramnagar to Anmod near the Goa check post may be repaired and re-carpeted,” the LEADS report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/logistics-index-goa-languishes-at-bottom/articleshow/87614911.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Ahmedabad||Multiplexes witness blockbuster footfalls||Ahmedabad: The curtains have finally lifted at multiplexes and cinema halls. After a year and half being shut or near deserted, footfalls have finally begun to increase at multiplexes in Ahmedabad. With the Diwali weekend going nearly house full for most multiplexes, cinema hall owners are now getting positive about business prospects for the coming months. “Earlier, we saw decent footfalls when the James Bond movie released but the audience for any Hollywood movie is usually niche. With some big banner Bollywood movies releasing, business was very good over the Diwali weekend with most shows running house full,” said Manubhai Patel, president, Gujarat Multiplex Owners’ Association. Multiplex owners say Bollywood movies attract crowds. Even after offices and businesses reopened on Monday, footfalls remained at a sizeable 30%-50%. In the revision of Covid-19 guidelines just ahead of Diwali, the state government finally permitted multiplex owners to operate at 100% capacity and even curtailed curfew timings. “The government decision to enforce night curfew from 1am came as a boon to multiplex business. We now run at least five shows a day and schedule them in a way that the last show finishes by midnight so people have an hour to get home,” said the manager of a city multiplex. Over the festival period, ticket prices which had gone to as low as Rs 100 for any show after the pandemic, were also increased to between Rs 170 and Rs 240 per person. Multiplex owners say that with Covid cases decreasing, people are confidently stepping out to enjoy a movie and with new releases coming, footfalls are expected to grow on weekends. “No new film is scheduled to release this week and we expect footfalls to go down but from next week there is at least one movie releasing every week and we’re expecting footfalls to return to pre-Covid levels soon. Business is finally looking up,” said the owner of an Ahmedabad multiplex, who asked not to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/multiplexes-witness-blockbuster-footfalls/articleshow/87614914.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Act against drug abuse cases, sexual exploitation of minors’||Panaji:After receiving cases of underprivileged minor girls in rural areas being induced into drugs and finding the police reluctant to act, the women’s collective, Bailancho Saad raised the issue with director general of police (DGP) Mukesh Kumar Meena at a meeting on Monday and asked for his intervention to stop drug abuse and sexual exploitation of minors. Bailancho Saad has requested the DGP not to permit parties or functions where drugs are consumed and demanded immediate investigations and action against procurement and sale of drugs to youngsters. The group also said that cases should be investigated involving sexual exploitation of young girls, non-registration of complaints by police, refusal to give copies of letters at the stations, human rights violations of minors such as beating, keeping them without food the whole day and refusal to send victims of substance abuse and sexual exploitation for medical examination. “More worrisome is the drug consumption in the rural areas, far removed from the coastal belt and urban areas where drug sale and consumption is high. Since the girls come from poor rural households, they do not have money to buy drugs to feed their addiction. They are then pushed into sexual activity to get money for drugs,” Martins stated in her letter to the DGP. Bailancho Saad also highlighted a recent case of a mother who sought help to cure her daughter of addiction and free her from sexual exploitation so that she could continue studies and answer the Class X board exams this academic year. The women’s collective stated that although the mother wanted to lodge a complaint at the police station, it was not registered. “Though the girl was brought to the police station, she was not sent for medical examination or medical treatment for detoxification for the past one year, ever since she last reported to police in Sept 2020,” Martins said, alleging that the girl was beaten up at the police station after her mother complained in October 2021. “She was not sent for medical examination. The girl was deeply traumatised and became aggressive and started assaulting her mother in retaliation to the police beating. When the mother approached Bailancho Saad, we referred her to the child welfare committee to seek protection and care of the child, which she did,” Martins added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-drug-abuse-cases-sexual-exploitation-of-minors/articleshow/87614940.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: First waste-to-energy plant ready for operations||GUNTUR: The first waste-to-energy plant in the state is ready for commercial operations. The plant, located on the outskirts of Guntur city, will generate 15MW power with garbage collected from Guntur and Vijayawada cities and eight other municipalities in Guntur district. The Jindal group-owned JITF Uurban Infrastructure Limited signed an MoU with the state government five years ago. Although the plant construction was to have been completed within 28 months from signing the MoU, the developer took nearly five years due to change of government in the state and technical issues. Work picked up pace after special chief secretary (municipal administration) Y Srilakshmi inspected the plant two months ago and expressed her displeasure at the slow pace of progress. The government had agreed to supply nearly 1,200 metric tonnes of garbage from two major cities—Vijayawada and Guntur—and eight municipal towns in Guntur district. However, the civic bodies could not ready themselves to transport the garbage required for generation of power. After struggling to coordinate with different agencies, the Jindal group has finally completed the project. The firm has also prepared the civic bodies to shift the garbage to the plant. Garbage from Mangalagiri, Tadepalle, Sattenapalle, Ponnur, Chilakaluripet and Narasaraopet municipalities will be transported to the Jindal plant. The firm has also completed the trial run in the last fortnight and filed an application with the Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) for synchronistation of power supply. “We are waiting for green signal from energy department for launching commercial operations,” said a senior official of Jindal group. A 33kv supply line was also laid to connect the plant with the grid. The Jindal group has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with CPDCL to sell power at Rs 6.16 per unit. The project developer has built the plant in such a way that it could be expanded to generate 20MW in future. The Jindal group is now readying to set up another major waste to energy plant in Visakhapatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/first-waste-to-energy-plant-ready-for-ops/articleshow/87613078.cms||Samdani MN

The team was at the spot to rescue the assailant’s wife. The man was later handed over to police, said helpline officials. According to helpline officials, a woman had called up saying her brother was assaulting his wife.  “The woman was scurrying for cover when a team reached at the spot near Sarangpur. The man had a sword in his hand and was searching for his wife. When he got to know that the team was there to rescue her, he tried to attack before the sword was snatched from him,” said an official. “The woman had taken refuge in a neighbour’s home, fearing for her life.” The officials later got to know that the couple has been married for 10 years and have three children. As the man is in a relationship with another woman for the past two years, he wanted a divorce which the wife refused to give. Kalupur police have taken over further probe. In another incident, a woman from Madhya Pradesh was rescued by the helpline. The woman, mother of a girl with disabilities, had married a man, who also had a child with disabilities, about one and a half months ago. The duo had met through a matrimonial site. The woman then realized that the man was not earning enough, and there were other social issues she faced. “She faced language barrier, and could not understand the divorce papers prepared in Gujarati. The volunteers helped her go through the sections, after which she filed the case and left for MP last week,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drunk-man-attacks-abhayam-team/articleshow/87614111.cms||---

The chairman’s comments came during SI K Venkateshwarlu’s deposition on Tuesday. “I answered all question asked by the magistrate. There are some mistakes in the statement. Some of the facts recorded in it are not stated by me,” the SI said when the commission’s advocate asked him why he had failed to mention the accused attacking police officers, including throwing mud, before allegedly snatching his weapon in his statement to the judicial officer at Care Hospital on December 7, 2019, (a day after the alleged encounter). When the panel’s lawyer pointed out that the above claims have been made only during his deposition before the commission and find no mention in his statement to the judicial magistrate, or 161 CrPC statement before the IO or his affidavit before the commission, the SI said: “That is what had happened.” The SI also initially claimed that he didn’t remember taking any oath before his statement to the magistrate when commission members asked if he was aware that lying under oath and contradicting statements given under oath was punishable. But subsequently the SI had to admit he had taken the oath after the panel confronted him with the written record. At one point, chairman Sirpurkar told other tribunal members that he was “seriously thinking of recommending him for prosecution”. “I want to send him straight away to custody,” he observed. The cop was also quizzed about his claim during his deposition that he was taken from the Community Health Centre at Shadnagar to Care Hospital in an ambulance while hospital records mentioned that he had been brought in a private vehicle. When asked if he thought hospital had erred, the SI said: “I can’t say.” When panel asked SI to explain how he could claim to be at safe house in Mirjaguda at 1.33 am on December 6 when his mobile Call Data Record indicated he was at Maharajpet, SI reiterated that he was at the safe house, adding he didn’t know where Maharajpet was.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-warns-si-of-prosecution/articleshow/87614113.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Goa||Makadmares may soon face water woes due to broken tanks||MARGAO: Just as one thought that their woes had lessened following the efforts of the state and the society to mainstream them, the Makadmare (Wanarmares) tribals in Nirankal, Ponda, are now once again staring at the prospects of water crisis. Reason: The two water tanks installed by PWD near their settlement five years ago on the instructions of the South Goa district administration now lie damaged. With no other arrangements for assured water supply in place, the 100-odd houses could soon be facing water woes. Five years ago, after the hutments of the Makadmare at Nirankal were demolished by an angry mob of locals, the South Goa district administration and police machinery had swung into action to provide relief and security to the adivasis. Street lights were installed to illuminate the area, and two water tanks erected at the site to provide for drinking water. The PWD was entrusted with the task of refilling the tank periodically. “The installation of water tanks had saved the tribal women of the hardships of walking miles into the dense forests to fetch water from the springs. The government should immediately step in to replace those with new ones or take immediate steps to provide alternative arrangements for potable water,” Sachin Tendulkar, agro-researcher and social worker, who has been relentlessly taking up the cause of the Makadmare over the years, told TOI. All the houses of this Makadmare settlement were recently provided with photovoltaic (PV) solar lighting system by the Goa energy development agency (GEDA under its remote village electrification programme. The development came nearly a year after Goa human rights commission (GHRC), taking suo motu cognisance of TOI’s article ‘For the Makadmare tribe, a roof and electricity remain distant dreams’ (June 15, 2020), had called for reports from the director of tribal welfare and the chief electrical engineer of the electricity department. Earlier in 2016, efforts by the district administration and some social workers helped the Makadmare obtain ration cards and Aadhar numbers. While their bank accounts were opened under the Jan Dhan scheme, their children were enrolled in primary schools for the first time. They voted for the first time in the 2017 state assembly elections after a spirited movement by social workers to get them enfranchised bore the desired result. Hitherto, in the absence of any valid document to establish their identity — birth certificate, ration card, voter identity card, etc — they were deprived of all the welfare schemes meant for the underprivileged. Following the 2016 incident in which locals razed their huts, then South Goa collector Swapnil Naik had revealed plans of the district administration to prepare a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the tribals staying in the district. He had even directed the mamlatdars of all talukas within the district to identify all pockets of tribal habitation existing on government or comunidade land. “Apart from Makadmares, there are several other tribes staying in various parts of South Goa in illegally-constructed dwellings on government, comunidade or forest land for the last many years. We will draw up a comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of all such homeless tribals and submit it to the state government’s social welfare department to work out a scheme for their rehabilitation,” Naik had then told TOI. With Naik’s transfer soon after the incident, the plan appears to have since been grounded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/makadmares-may-soon-face-water-woes-due-to-broken-tanks/articleshow/87614935.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: At 97, disabled WWII veteran wins decade-long pension battle||JAIPUR: Sepoy Balwant Singh, a 97-year-old World War II veteran from Jhunjhunu in northern Rajasthan, won a long personal battle on Tuesday when a military tribunal awarded him the government’s war disability pension from 2008 onwards. He lost his left leg in a landmine blast while fighting with the Indian contingent for the Allied forces in Italy on December 15, 1944, and was discharged two years later on a basic pension reserved for soldiers who had become invalid after suffering war wounds. Singh, who enlisted in 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943 and was transferred to Rajputana Rifles following his return from WWII, had applied for a pension that the government had introduced in 1972, guaranteeing “100% of the last salary drawn” by Indian soldiers discharged from service because of wounds in various wars since Independence. However, soldiers who lost their limbs or were maimed for life fighting in the two World Wars were excluded from this retirement scheme. More than 2.5 million Indians fought in the WWII alone. A New Delhi bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal, which took over the case from its Jaipur unit that was hearing it since 2010, ruled in favour of the nonagenarian soldier on Tuesday. An administrative member from Chennai said Singh would get 100% pension from 2008 along with arrears, which is three years before he filed the case. Singh’s counsel Col (retired) SB Singh said the WWII veteran and his family at Gidaniya village in Jhunjhunu district were delighted with the news. “Balwant Singh’s disability is 100% as he lost his left leg. We are happy that he got at least some of the dues denied to him.” “We are happy that he got at least some of the dues denied to him,” Singh said. Singh served in the pre-Independence Indian Army for three years, two months and 16 days before he had to retire prematurely after having lost a leg. His son, Subhash Singh, said he was happy with the tribunal’s decision, but felt it could have been better had the state come forward to help it. “We live in a village and knew nothing about the pension for the battle wounded. We came to know of it only after the Kargil War (summer 1999). We would like to have the same incentives given to veterans of other wars,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-at-97-disabled-wwii-veteran-wins-decade-long-pension-battle/articleshow/87614963.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Both Rhea, who was in a relationship with the actor around the time of his death in June last year, and her brother Showik Chakraborty, were arrested in the case. They were granted bail by the Bombay high court. In her plea to the special NDPS court, Rhea said she supported her lifestyle and her brother with the money from the bank accounts, and freezing the accounts over the last 10 months has caused her prejudice. Imposing conditions, the special NDPS court said Rhea is to give a written undertaking supported by an affidavit that when required, during the pendency and conclusion of the trial, she will make available the balance amount, as shown in the accounts. The court further said that once the undertaking is furnished, the NCB is to issue necessary letters to the concerned bank regarding defreezing of the accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-gives-nod-to-unfreeze-actor-rhea-chakrabortys-bank-accounts/articleshow/87615784.cms||Rebecca Samervel

All roads leading to Chandigarh, Delhi, Amritsar and several city areas were blocked, causing traffic chaos on many a route despite the diversions.The protest started at 9am, when the agitators sat in the middle of the road and set up barricades and ropes to close all stretches. They raised slogans against Arora, who was booked for hurting religious sentiments on October 20 after an audio clip went viral.Around 11am, the traffic police uploaded a message on their Twitter handle and Facebook page that read, “All routes leading towards Samrala Chowk have been diverted due to protest. If you are coming from Chandigarh Road towards Samrala Chowk, then please take a diversion from Kohara or Veer Palace. If you are coming from Jalandhar Bypass towards Chandigarh Road, then take a diversion from Tajpur Road.”Despite the diversions on all roads connecting with Samrala Chowk, traffic congestion could not be averted. In the afternoon, school buses got stuck in jams and students as well as parents were hassled.Ishwar Singh, a resident of Model Gram, said, “While going to Chandigarh Road for an official meeting, I got stuck in a massive traffic jam near Cheema Chowk flyover as vehicles were being diverted from there due to the Samrala Chowk protest. When even after half-an-hour I could not move ahead, I went back from the wrong side. It took me one-and-a-half hours.”Inder Arora, a resident of Mohar Singh Nagar, said, “My children study in a school at Chandigarh Road. They called me up, saying their bus was stuck in a jam. When I went to bring them home, I too got caught up in gridlocks. I was left with no option other than walking to Samrala Chowk.”Kulpreet Singh, a resident of Shivaji Nagar, said, “I was returning from Chandigarh to Ludhiana when I got stuck in a traffic congestion near Veer Palace. Cops were deployed there to divert the traffic, but there were serpentine vehicle queues. I took more than one-and-a-half hour to reach Shivaji Nagar from Veer Palace. The route otherwise takes hardly 15 minutes.”One of the agitators, Jaswant Singh Cheema, said, “The police have failed to arrest Arora though an FIR was lodged against him on October 20. The protest will continue till he is arrested.”“A man was injured after he was allegedly attacked by the protesters near Samrala Chowk. The man had an argument with protesters, which turned violent. He was taken to a hospital. The allegations are being verified,” said a cop.Threaten protest from Shambhu to Attari borderAround 6pm, the protest ended after deputy commissioner of police (law & order) SPS Dhindsa met the agitators. They have given police 72 hours to arrest Arora, else they will stage a protest from Shambhu border to Attari border, in entire Punjab. Dhindsa said, “We are trying to trace the accused. Seven people, who helped Arora, have already been arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/daylong-protest-leaves-all-roads-linked-with-samrala-chowk-choked/articleshow/87613082.cms||---

The police held a meeting with the office-bearers of different associations of north Indian citizens on Monday evening to explain that the risk of Covid-19 had not disappeared and gathering of people could lead to further spread of the infection. The state government also came out with a notification on November 3 stating that people should celebrate Chhath puja at their homes instead of crowding near rivers, lakes or beaches. Every year, during Chhath puja, north Indians gather in the Goda ghat area for the celebrations. This year, however, the police have asked the office-bearers of the associations to spread the message among community members to avoid going to the water bodies for the rituals. Narendra Pagar, the NMC divisional officer, has also appealed to the citizens to not come visit the river banks. During the meeting, Prakash Chaudhary and Umapati Oza, of the association of north Indians, appealed to the people to follow all guidelines issued by the state government. The police would be maintaining bandobast in the Goda ghat area to make sure that there are no violations of the government orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-chhath-celebrations-on-godavari-banks/articleshow/87612238.cms||---

Among other Marathwada cities, Parbhani and Nanded recorded minimum temperatures of 14.8 degrees celsius and 15.9 degrees celsius, respectively, revealed the data available with India Meteorological Department (IMD). As per advisory issued by the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University in Parbhani, many parts of the region are likely to have the minimum temperatures below the normal range from November 14 to 20. While the maximum temperature is expected to stay well within the normal range, parts of Osmanabad and Latur are likely to get occasional spells of light showers for two days from November 12. Shriniwas Aundhkar, the director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said conditions may not stay favourable for further onset of winter. “Two cyclonic circulations are developing in the Bay of Bengal. Due to these cyclones, further significant decline in the mercury level is unlikely in the next few days,” he said. Many citizens said the change in the weather condition was pleasant. “The winter chill was missing during Diwali. Now the tone is set for a perfect winter,” said Neha Hiwrale, a homemaker. With onset of winter, the local market for woollen clothes has started attracting buyers. Set up near the central bus-stand, the market has stalls by sellers from the northeast and other parts of the country. Last year, Aurangabad’s lowest minimum temperature in November was 12 degree celsius — on November 11. The city’s all-time low for November was recorded on the 30th day of the month in 1970, when the minimum temperature was 1.9 degrees celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mercury-drops-to-13-6c-in-aurangabad-city-on-tuesday/articleshow/87612253.cms||---

MMC, during its tax repayment drive, had issued notices to several business establishments and October 31 was kept as the deadline to submit the necessary documents to MMC. “It has been observed that the deadline was not strictly adhered to, so the taxation department of MMC has been asked to draw a detailed report of such businesses operating without necessary documents within 10 days from today (Tuesday). Businesses not authorised by necessary MMC regulations will be treated as unlawful, illegal and against the business guidelines of MMC and hence will be dealt with severely following the ground report received from the taxation department,” Fernandes said. He said that with the taxation department having reported a drop in tax receipts, it could impact the MMC during the next salary round by December. MMC has been struggling to generate enough revenue to pay salaries to its employees for the last two to three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-council-to-take-action-against-tax-evading-traders/articleshow/87614978.cms||---

---||Goa||Lobo endorses Kandolkar for Mapusa seat||Panaji: In a major embarrassment to BJP, ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo on Tuesday exuded confidence that Congressman Sudhir Kandolkar would win the Mapusa seat in the upcoming assembly elections. The Mapusa constituency has been represented by BJP for over two decades now. Former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had joined BJP in 2000, and after his death in 2019, his son Joshua has been party MLA there. “We have started work from the Mapusa boundary,” Lobo said. “We have inaugurated projects in Verla-Canca and we have come to Parra. People of the three constituencies (Calangute, Siolim and Mapusa) and our well-wishers will elect our MLAs. All the three candidates vying to contest are sitting here itself. Sudhir Kandolkar is from Mapusa, and I think the people of Mapusa will 100% get him elected. Delilah (Lobo’s wife) will contest from Siolim constituency with the blessings of the people.” Kandolkar, a one-time close aide of Francis D’Souza, was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket in the 2019 by-election, after the death of D’Souza. After Kandolkar was denied the BJP ticket, he switched over to Congress and was defeated. Lobo said that over the past 25 years, people-centric development has not taken place in Siolim. Over the past couple of weeks, Lobo has kept BJP guessing over his moves. Lobo had said that he has been approached by Congress and other parties. Last week, Lobo said that he and his wife Delilah would contest the election on the same party ticket. Lobo wants to contest from Calangute (which he currently represents), while Delilah has started work in Siolim constituency. Recently, Lobo had said that he is ready to leave BJP if the party does not want him, and that he would win six out of seven seats in Bardez. Lobo was speaking after meeting Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-endorses-kandolkar-for-mapusa-seat/articleshow/87614956.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cyber crime cases highest in Covid pandemic period: RTI query||Nagpur: With the advent of online payment services, cyber crime cases too have risen throughout the country, and Nagpur is no exception. In the last six years, from 2016 to September 2021, the number of such cases is rising steadily, and it was the highest during the Covid-19 pandemic period, say replies to an RTI query provided by the police crime branch.On other hand, detection rate is woefully low, with just 229 cases being detected out of 793 registered in the six years. These detections led to booking of 159 accused, but no information was provided whether they were arrested or not. The information under RTI Act was provided by assistant commissioner-cum-public information officer (PIO) of the crime branch in response to queries by veteran RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar.The reply informed 173 cases of cheating through various means were recorded in the last six years, while 82 cases were online cheating. In the same period, 35 cases of online booking fraud were reported and 63 of cheating through debit and credit cards. About 65 cases were registered for cheating through online banking.Though the RTI data is of six years, the coronavirus pandemic period from March 2020 witnessed a steep increase in all cases related to cybercrime like banking frauds, cheating through debit and credit cards, and online booking of goods and materials.In the pandemic period, just 16 cases are registered against those spreading fake news through social media, despite hundreds of such fake posts being circulated on various social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others.The amount involved in all types of cyber crime cases runs into crores, but due to low detection rate and absence of proper mechanism to prevent such incidents, very few managed to get back their hard-earned money. According to Kolarkar, despite the government trying its best to spread awareness among people regarding the risks involved in online financial transactions, very few pay attention to it. The majority of victims fall prey to fake offers.Police officials say most victims do not even come forward to lodge a police complaint, apprehending embarrassment or due to the small amount lost, and therefore the number of registered cases may not depict the reality.Police said almost every day all users of social media are bombarded with hundreds of fake messages like lotteries, where people get lured in their greed for easy money. They share all their details with strangers without verifying credentials. They repent only after their money gets deducted from their bank accounts. A majority of cyber crime victims are women and senior citizens, who are most vulnerable to such frauds, officials said.BOX#Cybercrime cases from 2016 to 2021*:Year ------- Cases ------- Detected ------- Accused ----- Fake News2016 ------- 96 ---------- 23 ---------------- 23 -------------- 42017 ------- 81 ---------- 29 ---------------- 34 -------------- 22018 ------- 108 ---------- 31 ---------------- 24 --------------32019 ------- 112 ---------- 34 ---------------- 31 -------------- 32020 ------- 243 ---------- 53 ---------------- 35 -------------- 12021* ------- 153 ---------- 59 ---------------- 12 -------------- 3Total ------- 793 ---------- 229 ---------------- 159 -------------- 16(Cases till September 2021)#Cyber Cheating Cases’ types from 2016 to 2021*:Year ------- CT --------------- OB ------- OC ------- CC/DC ------- OTP2016 ------- 14 ---------------- 0 ------- 11 ------- 12 ------- 62017 ------- 34 ---------------- 1 ------- 18 ------- 9 ------- 12018 ------- 29 ---------------- 0 ------- 9 ------- 16 ------- 62019 ------- 31 ---------------- 10 ------- 11 ------- 14 ------- 92020 ------- 25 ---------------- 16 ------- 20 ------- 4 ------- 82021* ------- 40 ---------------- 8 ------- 13 ------- 8 ------- 2Total ------- 173 ---------------- 35------- 82 ------- 63 ------- 32(CT- Cheating, OB – Online booking, OC – Online cheating, CC/DC – Credit & Debit cards, OTP – One time password)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cyber-crime-cases-highest-in-covid-pandemic-period-rti-query/articleshow/87614150.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The police said the infant’s mother, Sheetal More, approached them with a complaint of cheating after she received only Rs 40,000 of the promised Rs 2 lakh. When the police investigated the matter, they found that the mother herself had sold the child with the help of agents, including one of her friends from Nashik. Besides Sheetal, the police have booked her friend, Kalpana, the agents Laxmi Kondar and Amol Valhekar and Deepak Singh, who allegedly bought the child. The police said Sheetal, a resident of Nashik, is mother to two children, besides the infant who was sold. According to the police, since Sheetal’s financial condition was bad and her husband did not help her, Kalpana paid the Rs 8,500 bill of her maternity-related hospital expences. It was Kalpana who advised Sheetal to sell her newborn so that all her financial problems could be resolved in one go, police said. Kalpana then allegedly took Sheetal and her child to Kalyan where she introduced her to Laxmi and Indu. The duo promised Sheetal that they would sell her child for Rs 2 lakh. They later sold the infant to Deepak, who belongs to Varanasi in UP but lives in Mumbai. Shekhar Bagade, senior police inspector of Manpada police station in Kalyan, said, “Deepak’s brother died recently, and he, along with the child, has gone to his village in Varanasi. However, he has promised us that once he is back, he will hand over child to us.” Kunal Gangurde, investigation officer, said, “Once we get the custody of the child, we will send him to the child welfare centre. We will also arrest all the accused involved in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-infant-sold-for-rs-2l-mom-among-5-booked/articleshow/87615802.cms||Pradeep Gupta

However, all this is set to change as the district will soon have a university to cater to the academic needs of the youth of not only Azamgarh, but also of neighbouring districts. With the foundation laying of the university by Union home minister Amit Shah in presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on November 13, the construction work will begin on around 50-acre land with a budget of over Rs 108 crores. The university will become operational by June 2023. Site plan of the proposed universitySetting up of a university has been a decades old demand of the people of Azamgarh as despite being a hub of institutes of higher education, the colleges here were affiliated to the Gorakhpur University and later Jaunpur. “Thankfully, the government realised the need and decided to establish a university here, which will bring opportunities for advanced studies for local youths,” said a senior research fellow at Shibli Academy, Umar Siddaqui. According to divisional commissioner Azamgarh Vijay Vishwas Pant, the Union home minister and CM will be performing the rituals of foundation laying of the proposed university in Azam Bandh area on November 13. “They will later view an exhibition of the model of the proposed university campus,” he said, adding, “They will also address a public meeting at the same venue on this occasion.” Providing details of the project, district magistrate Azamgarh, Rajesh Kumar said, “The decision to establish a university in Azamgarh was taken by the CM in March 2019, after which 49.42 acre land was arranged in Azam Bandh area. The cost of the approved project is Rs 108.05 crores and PWD has been assigned to execute it with an aim to complete it in 18 months from the laying of foundation.” Giving details of the varsity’s structure, regional higher education officer Varanasi, Gyan Prakash Verma said, “The number of state universities in UP is 18, including three residential universities in Lucknow, Kanpur and Gorakhpur and two for distance learning. The CM had announced three universities for Aligarh, Saharanpur and Azamgarh. The university to come up at Azamgarh will also be an affiliated university. About 400 colleges, including 247 of Azamgarh and 153 of Mau district will be affiliated to it. These 400 colleges have a base of 2.66 lakh students.” “The colleges will continue running regular courses,” said Verma, adding, “On its own campus, the proposed university will offer vocational studies related to skill development in black pottery, terracotta, food processing and agro-based industry, dairy technology, nursing, pharmacy and handloom in consonance with the National Education Policy 2020. It will also have a school of advanced learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics.” Meanwhile, the news has enthused almost all sections of the society in a politically vibrant Azamgarh. A social worker Dr Piyush Yadav said, “The district has been associated with Maharshi Durvasa. It has also nurtured a number of legendary litterateurs, poets and academicians, including Hindi travelogue Rahul Sankrityayan, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Shibli Nomani, Kaifi Azami, among others.” He added, “It has also been represented by politicians with criminal background and some of its youth have been associated with terror outfits, the links were exposed after the Batla house encounter of 2008. The district not only failed to get desired development projects including a university, but its image has also been distorted. Now, a university will change its negative perception.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/silver-lining-azamgarh-to-have-its-own-varsity-by-2023/articleshow/87614973.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Over the years, the car-centric development of the city shrunk the space of the sidewalks to one-third to make way for the carriageway. The rest of the space has been encroached by hawkers, thereby forcing pedestrians to take the risk of walking down the carriageway. To re-establish the rights of pedestrians and ensure their safety, a national coalition of NGOs wants both the Centre and state to observe January 11 as National Pedestrians’ Day through a nation-wide campaign by Sustainable Urban Mobility Network (SUM Net), a coalition of individuals, voluntary organizations and civil society networks and movements promoting sustainable urban transport solutions across India. “Any transportation planning needs to prioritize the pedestrian movement. But we have done the reverse in our car-centric planning. In majority of the crossings pedestrian signal is negligibly small, forcing people to cross the road by running. In rest of the road intersections the pedestrian interval is altogether absent,” said Ajay Das, former chief of traffic and transportation planning directorate. As per the 2011 Census, one third of all work trips are done on foot with data showing that women tend to walk more than men. Campaign coordinator Suraj Jaipurkar said, “We have launched this campaign to highlight the alarming rise in pedestrian fatalities.” “Around 50% of road accident victims are pedestrians. Before the pandemic around 50 to 60 people were killed on an average in road accidents each year. The major reason is the lack of designated sidewalks and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure on road,” said Vinay Jaju from SwitchON Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campaign-to-remove-encroachment-and-get-back-sidewalks-for-pedestrians-in-city/articleshow/87614162.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

He lost his left leg in a landmine blast while fighting with the Indian contingent for the Allied forces in Italy on December 15, 1944, and was discharged two years later on a basic pension reserved for soldiers who had become invalid after suffering war wounds. Singh, who enlisted in 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943 and was transferred to Rajputana Rifles following his return from WWII, had applied for a pension that the government had introduced in 1972, guaranteeing “100% of the last salary drawn” by Indian soldiers discharged from service because of wounds in various wars since Independence. However, soldiers who lost their limbs or were maimed for life fighting in the two World Wars were excluded from this retirement scheme. More than 2.5 million Indians fought in the WWII alone. A New Delhi bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal, which took over the case from its Jaipur unit that was hearing it since 2010, ruled in favour of the nonagenarian soldier on Tuesday. An administrative member from Chennai said Singh would get 100% pension from 2008 along with arrears, which is three years before he filed the case. Singh’s counsel Col (retired) SB Singh said the WWII veteran and his family at Gidaniya village in Jhunjhunu district were delighted with the news. “Balwant Singh’s disability is 100% as he lost his left leg. We are happy that he got at least some of the dues denied to him.” “We are happy that he got at least some of the dues denied to him,” Singh said. Singh served in the pre-Independence Indian Army for three years, two months and 16 days before he had to retire prematurely after having lost a leg. His son, Subhash Singh, said he was happy with the tribunal’s decision, but felt it could have been better had the state come forward to help it. “We live in a village and knew nothing about the pension for the battle wounded. We came to know of it only after the Kargil War (summer 1999). We would like to have the same incentives given to veterans of other wars,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-97-disabled-wwii-veteranwins-decade-long-pension-battle/articleshow/87614981.cms||---

Gokulam Kerala FC were left with nothing in the bag for the second consecutive game as Iran’s Shahrdari Sirjan scored a 1-0 victory to go top of the AFC Women’s Club Championship at the Aqaba Development Corporate Stadium in Jordan on Wednesday. It was a freekick that separated the two teams yet again. With both teams tied at the hour mark, Gokulam Kerala captain and goalkeeper Aditi Chauhan was sent off for her jump outside the box that saw Shahrdari striker Zahra Alizadeh knocked out of the game. The collision was horrific as Alizadeh chased the ball and appeared to have moved ahead of Dalima Chibber. Sensing danger, Chauhan rushed out but ended up with a foul. The referee had a good look at the incident on the television monitor and then decided to issue the Gokulam captain the red card. Afsaneh Chatrenoor scored from the resultant freekick, curling the ball past the outstretched hands of substitute goalkeeper Shreya in the 64th minute. Gokulam Kerala had lost their opener against Amman Club with the Jordanian champions scoring the winner from a freekick. The Indian Women’s League (IWL) champions are now out of the race for the title. They will face Uzbekistan’s FC Bunyodkor on Saturday to avoid finishing at the bottom. Shahrdari, the champions in Iran, will lift the trophy if they can put it across local side Amman Club in the concluding game. Gokulam Kerala were left to wonder what might have been, yet again. They saw more of the ball in the early stages of the game but didn’t do enough to trouble the rival goalkeeper. Till the sending off, even Gokulam Kerala goalkeeper was rarely troubled. Shahrdari’s best chance came from a freekick just outside the box, which Chatrenoor could not keep on target. When she was presented with another chance in the second half, the Iranian forward picked the top corner. Even when they were a goal and player down, Gokulam Kerala could have got at least a point. In the closing stages of the match, Grace Dangmei saw her shot from inside the box hit the goalpost and bounce back into play. The rebound fell at the feet of Elshaddai Acheampong, but the Ghanaian striker couldn’t give the finishing touches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/irans-shahrdari-move-on-top-with-narrow-win-against-gokulam-kerala/articleshow/87634538.cms||---

The officials had taken a long time to prepare the DPR, and the process of getting a certification from a consultant is likely to delay the project further. Meanwhile, garbage processing is closed at the main dump at Tajpur Road since February and heaps of rubbish is lying at the site. Officials had prepared the DPR after visiting several cities for almost four to five months, and the Okhla model of converting waste into energy was selected. The authorities have also proposed to generate 9 to 10 MW energy from garbage as the city is generating around 1100 to 1200 tons daily. The DPR is divided into two parts, one is for garbage lifting from secondary collection points to main dump and the second part is related to processing of garbage into energy. As far as door to door garbage collection is concerned, officials have planned to implement the “Chandigarh Model” and garbage will be lifted through e rickshaws. MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We are told to get the report certified from some consultant so now we are doing that process. It would take some time but once we are through with formalities, we will be able to float tenders and hire a agency.” He said first of all, they are bringing e-rickshaws for smooth garbage collection in the city and as many as 300 e-rickshaws are coming in next few days. He said they will streamline things as soon as possible. Notably, the MC had an agreement with A2Z waste management company for garbage lifting and processing at the main dump. However, the civic body had served a termination notice to the company recently and notice period ended on February 4. Since then, garbage is not being processed at the main dump, and even from the secondary garbage collection points, collection is not proper because the source segregation had got affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dpr-ready-but-waste-management-project-likely-to-get-delayed/articleshow/87613182.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Allama Iqbal’s photo on BHU Urdu dept’s poster, absence of Malviya’s, trigger row||Varanasi: A group of students raised objection over a poster displayed on a Facebook page by the Urdu department of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) that carried the photograph of Allama Muhammad Iqbal — the Urdu poet 'who envisioned the two-nation theory and was an inspiration for Pakistan'. The picture of BHU founder Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya, was, however, missing from the poster, they said. The students, who met the dean to register their protest and submit a memorandum in this episode, alleged that Urdu department authorities not only skipped the image of Pt Malviya in their poster but they used a photo of Allama Iqbal. Both acts were unacceptable, said the students demanding action in this episode. Following an uproar on social media, the poster was removed from the FB page and the Urdu department apologized. The dean of the faculty of arts also formed a committee to probe into the matter. The Urdu department authorities replaced the poster on its Facebook page and tweeted, “Urdu Department, Faculty of Arts, #BHU, is organizing a webinar as per the details given in the poster. Sincerest apologies for the inadvertent mistake in the earlier poster that went viral on social media." BHU spokesman Rajesh Singh said, “The Urdu department of the faculty of Arts (BHU) had organised a webinar on the role of Allama Iqbal in the growth of Urdu on the occasion of Urdu Day on Tuesday. The department had uploaded the poster of the webinar on its FB page on Monday carrying the photograph of the Urdu poet. When attention of the Urdu department officials was drawn towards the issue, they removed the poster on Sunday late evening.” “The poster was replaced by another poster which contained the image of the BHU founder. The head of the Urdu department expressed his apology in writing,” said Singh adding, “The dean of the faculty also tweeted the new poster with an apology and formed a committee to look into the matter.” A group of BHU students, including research scholars Vivek Kumar, Gunjesh Gautam, Divyamani Dwivedi and Patanjali Pandey on Tuesday met the dean of faculty of arts in his office and raised serious objections over the matter. Levelling serious allegations on the Urdu department officials, they had demanded action against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/allama-iqbals-photo-on-bhu-urdu-depts-poster-absence-of-malviyas-trigger-row/articleshow/87614990.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Meanwhile, Suresh conducted a high-level meeting with the authorities on the incident at Anantapur. Addressing the media, the minister said the government is clear on improving standards at aided colleges and is not insisting that any college management surrender its grant-in-aid status. “SSBN aided college is a completely autonomous college. The management has given its consent to the government to give up their grant-in-aid status. They have also surrendered their staff. But opposition parties are creating unrest in the college using student unions. These unions are stopping other students from attending classes and are pelting stones at the police. A girl student suffered injuries in the incident. She has given a statement that the police treated her well and she was injured by the stones hurled by the student union members. The government has taken a serious approach to the issue,” the minister said. Meanwhile, around 15 activists of various student organisations rushed to the press conference venue to prevent the minister from speaking. Special police forces arrested the student leaders who interrupted the minister. Suresh assured the students that the government will not impose any decision on colleges. Student unions condemned the minister’s comments alleging a conspiracy behind the protest. “Education minister is trying to divert the issue by showing fabricated evidence. We demand action against DSP, CI, SIs and other officers who attacked students at Anantapur,” A Ravichandra, PDSU state president, demanded. In Anantapur on Tuesday, police arrested representatives of various student unions who gave a bandh call to protest against Monday’s incident. The district police wing remained on high alert following the bandh call and had mobilised additional forces as a standby. When the representatives of students unions tried to converge at the tower clock centre and take out a rally to the district police office they were arrested by local police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-wont-impose-its-decision-edu-min/articleshow/87613195.cms||Venu Lanka

The four accused had lent him Rs 90,000, but took Rs 1,44,000 towards the interest on the principal amount so far. Complainant Ajay Patel has stated that he had sought money from four different persons — Dipak Labana, Puspraj Labana, Bhavesh Labana and Jayraj Meravat — involved in money lending in Nani Bandibar.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: After Nahargarh, Jaigarh Fort now under forest dept scanner||JAIPUR: The state forest department has questioned commercial activities at the Jaigarh Fort, owned by the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur. Stating that the fort is situated on forest land that has been notified under Section 20 of the Rajasthan Forest Act on January 15, 1962, the department has asked the property’s manager to explain under which law they were carrying out commercial activities and if they have received a ‘no objection certificate’ (NOC) for the same. The department has cited the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order dated October 4 that prohibits commercial activities at Nahargarh Fort, which too is located on the same forest land in the Amber subdivision. Assistant conservator of forests Ghanzansar Ali Zaidi said, “We have issued the notice to forest administration regarding commercial activities in the fort. However, no reply has been given till date.” Office-bearers at the Jaigarh administration claimed they did not receive any notice from the forest department. TOI tried to contact erstwhile royal family member and BJP MP Diya Kumari, but she remained unavailable for comment.  Earlier, the NGT had directed discontinuing all commercial activities in the notified forest area of Nahargarh Wildlife Sanctuary with effect from December 1, 2021. Rajendra Tiwari, an environmentalist who filed a public interest litigation (PIL), had alleged that illegal commercial activities were being carried out at the reserve forest and fort in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. “The state government vide its notification dated 21.11.1961 had declared the area of Jaigarh and Nahargarh forts as reserve forest. Both the forts come under the wildlife sanctuary and forest department property,” Tiwari said. Sources in the forest department alleged that in the past, many movies were shot at Jaigarh Fort. However, film shooting is illegal in reserve forests as it constitutes a violation of wildlife protection and forest conservation Acts. The petitioner had also submitted to NGT that while the forest department was managing the Keoladeo National Park and the tiger reserves of Ranthambhore and Sawai Madhopur, the Nahargarh Fort was not being operated by the department. Jaigarh Fort was built in 1726 AD by Sawan Jai Singh II and is several hundred feet above the sea level. The nearly intact fort is enclosed by huge walls and is connected to Amer Fort by subterranean passages. It is believed to have been built to protect Amer Fort and is an important monument.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-nahargarh-jaigarh-fort-now-under-forest-dept-scanner/articleshow/87615006.cms||---

The stretch was closed after a series of landslides at multiple locations on August 31. The 457km Dhule-Solapur national highway connects Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat to central and western Maharashtra, as well as several southern states, while passing through the 10km long ghat stretch.

The letter to the officials has asked the child welfare officers to inspect and verify sale of liquor, bidis/ cigarettes, gutka and other tobacco products in the vicinity of schools and other educational institutions and to take action. “Action as per relevant laws may be initiated if any such outlets are found. Compliance report with details of the outlets and action taken to be submitted to the ccommission within 15 days of receipt of this letter,” the commission stated in its letter to the SPs. The commission highlighted the importance of streamlining and making strategic efforts through various authorities, institutions and agencies to bring a paradigm shift in preventing substance abuse amongst children in the state. “Small efforts need to be made to wean children away from substance abuse through corrective and preventive measures, through convergent actions in a time-bound manner,” chairperson Peter Borges said. The commission in its letter also highlighted legal provisions on sale of liquor and tobacco products in the vicinity of schools, educational institutions and coaching centres for children.

Allowing the petitioner to submit a representation to the state election commission, the high court directed the SEC to consider his representation and act upon it in accordance with law within two days. V Venkataramana had moved the high court seeking directions to the SEC to change the returning officer, alleging that the officer was acting in a biased manner and supporting the ruling party, and should be removed to ensure free and fair elections. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Narra Srinivas said though a complaint was lodged before the election commission against the said officer, no action was taken which left them with no option than moving the high court. Arguing on behalf of SEC, S Vivek Chandra Sekhar said the officer against whom allegations were levelled is not appointed as election officer, but as a special officer to assist the election officer during the Kuppam elections. Justice A V Sesha Sai asked the SEC under what provisions of law he was appointed as special officer, and also wanted to know whether the petitioner had made any representation to the SEC about his grievance. Srinivas told the court that a representation was sent by TDP on behalf of the petitioner. Justice Sesha Sai observed that a writ petition, which has been filed by an individual based on the representation sent by a political party, cannot be entertained. He said if the representation by the party is to be considered then the petition will become a public interest litigation and cannot be taken up under writ rules. The high court disposed the petition as it was in the form of a PIL. However, the court allowed the petitioner to submit a representation to the SEC first and directed the latter to consider the grievance and take appropriate action in accordance with law within two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/petitioner-told-to-approach-sec-in-poll-plea/articleshow/87613212.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Nursery module for govt schools to keep pace with private institutions||JAIPUR: The three years of pre-primary classes in state government schools would see modules on hygiene and healthcare, effective communication and better understanding for children aged 3-6 years. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training, Udaipur, has designed the three-year curriculum for government schools to keep pace with private institutes. The content is fully loaded with graphics, illustrations and texts with localised examples catering to children who are first-generation literates. The three-year content will lead to improved outcomes, including better nutrition, health and education in both the short and long run. “The content is aimed at involving student develop critical thinking and creativity. It also focuses on their collaboration and communication skills,” said Kamlendra Shekhawat, public relations officer, SIERT. In the pre-primary class-I, focus is on teaching awareness about self by teaching them about their body parts, family members, decision making and problem-solving methods. The expected outcome is that a child begins to state some physical characteristics about themselves and identify close family members. “Exercises teaching the importance of maintaining distance from strangers and is aware of good touch and bad touch,” reads the document. The pre-primary II would lead to awareness of self and others leading to expressing own preferences and interests, recognising common dangers/hazards and takes safety precautions. “Start using toilets and handwashing on his/her own,” the document says. By the time the child enters pre-primary III, he/she starts developing patience to listen to others for a short period of time and respond accordingly. “Demonstrating some social conventions like eye contact, using thoughts verbally and non-verbally and follows oral instructions,” reads the document. Moreover, from an economic point of view, investment in pre-primary programmes offers a high pay-off in human capital making a strong case for public intervention. “Pre-primary programmes not only benefit children and families, but also reduce social inequality and benefit communities and societies at large,” said Shekhawat. “The pre-primary curriculum designed by the SCERT is a balanced one and there is a need to train the teachers to handle the kids. It should be capable enough to make a child ready for class I. The bigger question is what is the curriculum of class 1, the foundation class of government schools. It is a good beginning and pre-primary should be added in every government school,” said Damodar Goyal, an educationist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nursery-module-for-govt-schools-to-keep-pace-with-pvt-institutions/articleshow/87615021.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Chandigarh||Polls near, Punjab govt goes populist: Cabinet nod to regularise 36k daily wage, ad hoc, contractual staff||Chandigarh: To regularise the services of the 36,000 employees working on contract, ad hoc, work charged, daily wages and temporary basis, the Punjab cabinet on Tuesday approved the ‘The Punjab Protection and Regularization of Contractual Employees Bill-2021’ to be introduced in the legislative assembly. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said after the meeting, “We have taken a major decision to regularise the services of 36,000 employees. A bill will be brought in the Vidhan Sabha session with complete details. It has also been decided to raise the minimum wages of government and private sector employees – outsourced and factory workers.” According to a state government spokesperson, with this decision the services of employees with more than 10 years’ service would be regularised. Likewise, the cabinet also gave approval for the extra creation of deemed posts. The provisions of reservation policy would be followed during the regularization process of these employees. However, this decision of regularization would not be binding on the boards and corporations. Contract farming bill to be repealed In view of the “fear in the minds of the producers and farmers” of the state due to the strict provisions incorporated in the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, like imprisonment, monetary penalties and other rigorous punishments, the Punjab cabinet decided to repeal the aforesaid Act. To amend Punjab agri produce market Act To “safeguards interests of farmers, farm labourers and those engaged in ancillary and incidental activities”, the cabinet also gave approval to amend the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets, Act 1961 “to revoke the anti-farmer provisions”. The 1961 Act is a legislative measure enacted by Punjab to facilitate the development of markets/mandis infrastructure, to provide better facilities and amenities to farmers to sell their agricultural produce seamlessly besides to regulate the marketing of agricultural produce for the elimination of malpractices. “Over the years, certain amendments to the Act have been undertaken that has introduced several vulnerabilities and distortions to the grave detriment and prejudice of agriculture and communities associated therewith. These amendments have left the rural communities, especially the farmers, vulnerable, thereby jeopardizing the sustainable agricultural development and security of livelihood of the persons engaged in agriculture in the state,” said the spokesperson.Amendment in fruit nurseries Act The cabinet also approved to introduce the ‘Punjab Horticulture Nursery Bill-2021’ in the session by amending ‘Punjab Fruit Nurseries Act-1961’. The amendment is necessitated in view of drastic changes in the new technologies like GPS tagging and traceability. To repeal Punjab (institution & other buildings) Tax Act ‘The Punjab (Institutional and Other Building) Tax Repeal Bill, 2021’ will be introduced in the current session to waive off unpaid dues in all cases. It may be recalled that the Punjab (Institutional and Other Building) Tax Act was implemented on industrial and other institutional buildings, outside the municipal limitd. This decision would give a relief of Rs 250 crore to the beneficiaries. Go-ahead to universal health cover plan The cabinet also accorded approval to the universalisation of ‘Ayushman Bharat - Mukh Mantri Sehat Bima Yojana’, under which the entire population of Punjab would be provided an insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year, except for the state and central government employees and pensioners. Nearly 61 lakh families in the state would benefit from this decision. The registration of the other left-out families shall be carried out on Aadhaar-based authentication and the enrollment forms shall be available at empanelled hospitals, common service centers (CSCS) and suvidha kendras, where the facility of e-card issuance is available through BIS portal. Relief for building bylaws violators The cabinet also gave nod to promulgate ‘The Punjab One-Time Voluntary Disclosure and Settlement of Violations of the Buildings Bill, 2021’ for all unauthorised constructions, which have come up till September 30, 2021. The move is aimed at providing one time opportunity to the violators within the municipal areas who have made non-compoundable violations in the buildings for regularisation without compromising on public safety/security and convenience. The compounding fee has also been reduced by 25%. There are a large number of unauthorized buildings where the building plans have not been approved. Most of the violations are non-compoundable and therefore such buildings cannot be regularised under the existing provisions. Such constructions have been coming up for the last many years and at this stage it is not possible to demolish such buildings, nor is it desirable to demolish. Minimum wages raised to Rs 9,192.72 It was decided to enhance minimum wages with effect from March 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020, as per the provisions of ‘The Minimum Wages Act, 1948’ and revision of wages from March 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020, after the decision of the Punjab Minimum Wages Advisory Board constituted under the provisions of the said Act. The minimum wages based on CPI was due on March 1, 2020m with a raise of Rs 415.89. Resultantly, the minimum wage has now been revised from Rs 8,776.83 to Rs 9,192.72. The worker would also be entitled to get arrears of Rs 8,251 from March 1, 2020 up to October, 2021. Changes in fiscal responsibility, budget law To avail the benefit of normal net borrowing ceiling of 4% of the projected GSDP in FY2021-22, allowed by the Government of India, the cabinet also approved amendment in Section 4, in Sub-Section (2), for Clause (a) of the Punjab Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003. Out of this normal net borrowing ceiling of 4% of the projected GSDP, the states will be allowed borrowing permission based on 3.5% of GSDP in the beginning of the financial year 2021-22. The remaining borrowing ceiling of 0.5% (half per cent) of GSDP will be allowed to the states on the basis of capital expenditure incurred by the states during the financial year 2021-22 against the prescribed target. The department of expenditure, ministry of finance determines the net borrowing ceiling of the states for each financial year on the basis of projected GSDP of the states. In line with the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FC-XV), the Government of India has decided to fix the normal net borrowing ceiling for the states for the financial year 2021-22 at 4% of the projected GSDP, which was 3% of the GSDP for the financial year 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/polls-near-punjab-govt-goes-populist-cabinet-nod-to-regularise-36k-daily-wage-ad-hoc-contractual-staff/articleshow/87615016.cms||---

Praj and IOC are already collaborating on a number of projects, with Praj helping the latter set up a second-generation ethanol plant at Panipat in Haryana, as well as a waste-water treatment plant at IOC’s Dumad facilities. The agreement was signed by the Praj founder and chairman Pramod Chaudhari, and IOC chairman SM Vaidya. The MoU is largely focused on developing alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuels — a cleaner solution for aviation fuels. The use of ATJ is also in line with mandates regarding clean fuels in aviation from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the parties said in a statement. “The deal will augment the share of biofuels in India’s energy portfolio. ATJ fuel presents a great opportunity that must be leveraged to comply with the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) guidelines to substantially reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector,” said Vaidya in a statement. The memorandum of understanding is also aimed at developing 50:50 joint ventures and special purpose vehicles in segments such as compressed biogas, ethanol, and biodiesel. Under the ventures and SPVs, the parties have also agreed to set up new production facilities for these alternative fuels.  IOC is a substantial player in the aviation fuel space in India, under its Skytanking brand.“We are delighted to partner with Indian Oil to increase the share of biofuels in India’s transportation fuel mix. Objectives of this overarching MoU encompass socio-economic-environmental aspects related to the nation’s growth,” Chaudhari added in the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/praj-and-ioc-ink-biofuel-aviation-fuel-agreement/articleshow/87614191.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Goa||Brazil will provide India’s defence the biggest test: Thomas Dennerby||Panaji: Thomas Dennerby is as excited as his players about the trip to Brazil later this month. The Indian women’s football team will take on the might of world football’s heavyweights in a four-nation tournament on November 25. It’s the first time that a senior national team plays Brazil, and understandably everyone – which includes coach Dennerby -- is looking forward to the clash. “It’s going to be fun to go to Brazil,” Dennerby told TOI on Wednesday. “The Brazil coach (Pia Sundhage) and assistant (Lilie Persson) are both my good friends from Sweden. It’s nice to see old friends, but the most important thing are the games. The first one against Brazil will be a really tough one. No other team will test our defence as much as them.” Brazilian women may not have achieved unrivalled global success like their men, but the country defines the beautiful game. The women, ranked seventh, are among the top teams in the world and made it to the Olympics final twice (2004, 2008), and World Cup in 2007. Preparing for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 at home, India have done well during their recent tours in Bahrain, UAE and Sweden. But Brazil, who have named a full-strength side which includes legends like Marta and Formiga, will be a different ball game. “It’s going to be tough. If you look at Brazil’s squad age, it’s a little bit high. They have a lot of players over 30. Our team will definitely be younger. We hope that with good stamina, fighting spirit and enthusiasm, we can at least give them a fight. “I always tell the girls, we should respect our opponents, whether they are ranked fifth or 105, but never fear. In football, there’s always a chance. Of course, Brazil will be the toughest (opponent) you can get,” said Dennerby, who coached Sweden to a third-place finish at the World Cup in 2011. India are expected to reach Manaus -- in the middle of the Amazon rainforest – either on November 22 or 23, providing little time to acclimatise to the conditions. Dennerby knows the players will be tired too, after a long-distance flight from Delhi. “The game is very important but comes close to our arrival (in Brazil). With the time difference of nine hours, the players will be jet-lagged. What we can do is prepare in the best manner possible and give it our best,” said Dennerby. Besides Brazil, there are other challenges for India in Manaus as they tackle Chile and Venezuela. Both are ranked above the Asian visitors, but the coach feels his team will be up for the challenge. “Chile (ranked 20 places above India) and Venezuela will be challenging. They are technically good teams. I hope, with all the hard work we are doing at the moment, the fitness levels and improved stamina, we can match them. We will have two really good games,” said Dennerby. India face Chile on November 28 and Venezuela on December 1. But, not surprisingly, it’s the clash against Brazil that has got everyone talking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/brazil-will-provide-indias-defence-the-biggest-test-thomas-dennerby/articleshow/87635540.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The police traced the Wagon R driver, who drives his car as a tourist vehicle, to Navi Mumbai and recorded his statement. Nothing suspicious was found, said police. “There were a total of four men (including the driver) and not two in the private cab as earlier stated by a taxi driver,” said a source. The city police had launched a hunt for two “mysterious men” in a WagonR who asked a taxi driver for the way to Antilia on Monday and purportedly claimed not to have an app to find the route themselves. The Ambanis are not in Mumbai at present. CRPF has been deployed for security at Antilia for a long time. “After we received a call from a taxi driver about two suspicious men, we began a probe. The car number provided by the taxi driver was incorrect. With the help of CCTV cameras, the police found the car driver in Navi Mumbai and he was brought in for inquiry at the Azad Maidan police station. During the inquiry, he said the three men were businessmen from Gujarat and wanted to visit several places as part of Mumbai darshan. They went to Gateway of India, CST and while passing from Azad Maidan, the driver inquired about the Antilia address since his mobile had switched off,” said a police officer. While trying to search for the car driver, police also took help from a sketch artist to prepared the sketch of two men based on taxi driver’s description. “The private cab driver told us that the businessmen wanted to see various places and they did visit there. They had left the city for Gujarat on Monday evening. He also provided the contact details of the three persons,” said a police source. The Mumbai police with the help of their counterparts in Gujarat got the details about the three men verified before allowing the car driver to leave. The police also spoke to the three men over phone while verifying details. “Nothing suspicious has been found. They were normal businessmen,” said an IPS officer. No case was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mysterious-men-looking-for-antilia-just-bizmen-from-kutch/articleshow/87615826.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Sarangi player Lakha Khan Manganiar, environmentalist Shyam Sundar Paliwal and educationist Arjun Singh Shekhawat have been awarded for excellence in their respective fields. The announcement for the awards was made on January 25. Khan comes from a traditional family devoted to music based in Jodhpur. Born in Raneri village, Khan took up his family profession and started singing from village to village and from house to house with his family members. His life turned 360 degrees after he met renewed anthropologist Komal Kothari who had spotted his sarangi skill as extraordinary. “Kothari Sahab gave me chance to perform on stage in many parts of the country and in the foreign countries,” Khan had told TOI earlier. He is among the many from his community who have earned awards of national repute. A day earlier, Ustad Anwar Khan Manganiar was awarded Padma Shri 2020 by the President in New Delhi. The next awardee, Paliwal, is known as father of ecofeminism for successful integrating conservation of environment with a social cause. Paliwal had launched Kiran Nidhi Yojana by planting 111 trees for every girl child in his village with a financial scheme in a bid to improve the sex ratio in his village Piplantri in Rajsamand. His initiative was readily adopted by other villages leading to improvement of sex ratio in his village. A retired principal of a government college, Shekhawat is the next recipient of Padma Shri from the state in the category of education and literature. He has authored 50 books, mostly on tribals, since he had worked in the tribal region in Pali. He immensely contributed in highlighting the buried aspects of tribal culture, history, food etc in his book which has become a repository of information of tribes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/padma-shri-2021-for-3-from-raj/articleshow/87615031.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With only 3 days left for the event to end, the forest department has announced a birding programme at Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary on Wednesday, followed by a webinar on the identification of birds by experts, said an official release. Veteran ornithologist Dilip Bhagat said this half-baked schedule by the forest department defeats the purpose of celebrating Bird Week. “The awareness measures must involve the young generation on a priority basis. The forest department should reach out to school and college students by organising different competitions to evoke a maximum public response,” he said. Bhagat said the occasions such as Bird Week must not be reduced to the in-house affair of the forest department. “We expect thoughtful schedules in future by the department rather than haphazard and impromptu activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-announces-bird-week-schedule/articleshow/87612348.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Young Heroes of Hyderabad||Ahead of Children’s Day, TOI brings to you stories of student change-makers who have stepped up to do their bit for society. Their work has not only touched lives but also inspired others to contribute towards a more sustainable future Saving every rupee for dogs Name: Unnathi Maheshwari Class 2 For the last one-and-half years, every rupee that this eight-year-old has received in gifts -- on festivals and other occasions – has gone towards Salma aunty’s dog orphanage in Shamshabad. That’s how passionate Unnathi is about taking care of street dogs and ensuring that they do not go hungry. Apart from generously contributing to the orphanage, Unnathi also routinely feeds strays in and around her home. “Dogs are just so lovable, cute and nice. Who can resist their cute faces? Even street dogs are like that. If you are kind to them then they will start coming to you, recognising you and will never harm you,” the little dog activist said. Even for her birthday this year, the second grader sent out an invitation to all her friends, asking them to not get her gifts and instead put that money into her dog orphanage fund. Ask her how she started taking interest in dogs and pat comes the response: “It was after I met my neighbour Uma Aunty’s Golden Retriever (Zoey) and realised how cute and playful dogs are. Then I naturally started to get interested in dogs and moved onto street dogs and the orphanage.” So, will she continue this work when she grows up? “I love animals a lot, as much as I love my family. I want to be able to earn and collect funds so as to create the best animal home for them. It will have a great shelter, beds, clean kitchen and the yummiest food in the world - only for animals,” Unnathi added. Books, toys for cancer patients Name: Akarshana Sathish Class 5 Her trips to the MNJ Cancer Hospital started amid the pandemic last year. Akarshana accompanied her father every day as he, along with other members of the community, visited the facility to assist them with food. It is during one such trip that the 10-year-old realised the children at the hospital had little to do to keep themselves engaged. “They told me that they would love to get some colouring and drawing books. That’s when I started thinking and came up with the idea of getting some books for them,” the student of Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet said. “I sent out a message to my neighbours, friends and relatives asking them to generously donate books so that we could set up a small library for the children at the hospital. Eventually, we managed to get over 1,000 books – fairy tales, story books in different languages, colouring books etc,” said Akarshana who even used the donation – some had helped with cash – to buy a bookcase for the library apart from toys for the children. “Since I love reading myself, I am glad I could share that joy with others,” she added. Delighted with the feedback she received, the young girl is now planning to set up a similar library at the juvenile home for girls, with help from the police department. All for a green tomorrow Name: Shourya Kadam Grade: Class 11 His education in conservation started while growing up in the US. So, when Shourya’s family relocated to Hyderabad, he jumped in to become part of any social initiative he could find, that worked on addressing climate change. From joining the Telangana government’s Haritha Haram drive to becoming an active member of the Fridays for Future, the teenager has been doing it all. “I have come to realise that it is important to preserve what we have to make our future – which we children will live in eventually – better. Since I was taught to take care of the environment right from my early school days, I continued to do the same in Hyderabad and it has given me immense satisfaction,” said the student from Oakridge International who was even honoured with the Diana Award recently for his work in the area of climate change – through strikes, blog posts and other student initiatives. The award is given to young people between 9 and 25 years of age for taking forward the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Giving women a safe period Names: Radha Priyanka, V M Sai Harini, D Khyathi Sree, S Twisha, P Anvitha Class 12 When they were asked to come up with a sustainable project last academic year, the first thing that struck this bunch of young girls was – menstrual hygiene. How could they contribute to this social issue that continues to be a concern in many parts of India? Their solution was simple but effective: To make sustainable sanitary napkins. Since then, this girl gang from Silver Oaks has been at it and has even come up with a prototype. It’s USP? The napkin has absolutely zero plastic – a usual feature in most commercially available sanitary napkins -- and is instead made from material that’s completely biodegradable, safe and comfortable for use by women. Explaining this, teammate Radha Priyanka says: “We’ve used cotton tissue, cotton and a gel pad (made from aloe vera and neem), among other things, to make the napkin not just environment friendly but also rash-free. We’ve also mixed rose water to add aroma.” At present, the team is working on enhancing the durability of the product that they intend to market within the school and distribute among the less privileged, free of cost, outside the premises. “Our intention is to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene and also ensure that more and more women can have access to that,” said Harini. Fighting pandemic across cities Name: Ansh Bansal Class 12 At a time when students across the country were facing uncertainties over their academics, Ansh Bansal, class 12 student of P Obul Reddy Public School started a students’ network ‘Indian Conclave’ that changed the lives of many during the pandemic last year. Launched on June 27, 2020, the Indian Conclave started raising funds by organising model united nations (MUN) and pre-MUN events. “We conducted events such as legal workshops for students who wanted to pursue law. Initially, our target was to raise Rs 15,000 through these events and help those in need. But the response was overwhelming among all students as we ended up raising close to Rs 1.5 lakh and soon Rs 2.7 lakh through such events,” said Bansal. With funds raised, he collaborated with students from seven cities -- Hyderabad, Warangal, Mangalore, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Siliguri – to help those in need. “We reached out to people to understand what they needed during the lockdown. We distributed food packets, umbrellas, grocery and medical kits among various other items, especially among the slum dwellers,” said Bansal. The youth group spearheaded by him was recognised by the IT minister K T Rama Rao, education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy among others. Rallying against drug abuse Name: Taniya Begum Class 5 Right from the age of five, Taniya Begum has been championing social causes. Her primary focus: Drug abuse. Today, she is the junior ambassador for Foundation of Drug-Free World, India, indicating how age is no bar to bring about a change. “Before the pandemic, I used to go with my father to People’s Plaza, Necklace Road to distribute pamphlets and explain to people the ill-effects of drugs. Even today, we see the Hyderabad police and the central agencies cracking down upon sale and use of drugs,” said Taniya, a student of Hamavathi High School. In the last five years, she has distributed over 38,000 booklets on ‘truth about drugs’ and participated in over 110 events to raise awareness about several social issues. Amid the pandemic, she along with her sister donated grocery kits to those in crisis using funds they had collected in their piggy banks. “We had together collected close to Rs 31,000 over a period of four years. Using that money, we donated about 75 grocery kits during the lockdown. It gives me great satisfaction to help people in need,” the young||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/young-heroes-of-hyderabad/articleshow/87614258.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Prices of sand, gravel cut to Rs 5.5 per cubic foot||CHANDIGARH: Promising to provide sand and gravel to the public at “minimum affordable rates”, the Punjab cabinet on Tuesday approved the Punjab State Sand and Gravel Mining Policy, 2021, to provide sand and gravel at Rs 5.5 per cubic foot (cft) across the state. As per new policy, sand and gravel shall be provided to public at Rs 5.5/cft at mining sites and the amount would include loading charges. The royalty rate of ordinary clay and ordinary earth will be decreased from Rs 10 per ton to Rs 2.5 per ton. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said after the cabinet meeting: “Sand mafia has been a key issue in Punjab. Despite the approved rate being Rs 9 per cubic foot, sand was earlier being sold between Rs 16 and Rs 22 per cubic foot. We had tried to ensure that there was no overpricing. Today, the cabinet has decided to reduce the rate to Rs 5.5 per cubic foot, excluding transportation charges, beginning Wednesday. The contractor will ensure the filling up and weighing of sand. On an experimental basis, I had given instructions to SSPs and DCs that the approved rate is enforced,” said Channi. He also promised a new sand mining policy ahead of the next elections. “We do not appreciate the existing policy, but it is binding, and we do not want to get into legal hassles,” he said. “If sand is sold at a higher price, then I am responsible. The enforcement of the rules is upto us. Till now, money was being siphoned, but we will wipe out the mafia,” he said. According to the new mining policy, the landowner or possesser can dispose of ordinary earth extracted during the levelling of their agriculture fields up to three feet. Removal of any minor mineral by the landowner/panchayat is allowed for meeting their land-filling requirements and for their bona-fide requirements, including religious and development activities. These activities do not require any rent, royalty or permit fee and no permit is required. These activities will not be hindered by officials and contractors without any valid reason and disciplinary action shall be initiated if any official or contractor is found guilty. The mineral concessions of sand and gravel mines in Punjab have been awarded through e-auction to the various concessionaires in accordance with the Punjab Sand and Gravel Mining Policy, 2018. Quantities to be mined were fixed at 350 lakh metric tonnes per annum. With this policy, the Government had fixed the pit head selling price of sand and gravel at Rs 9/cft including loading charges. The average sale price of the sand and gravel in various cities of Punjab varies from Rs 20/cft to Rs 35/cft, depending upon distance from source to destination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/prices-of-sand-gravel-cut-to-rs-5-5-per-cubic-foot/articleshow/87615038.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||‘Gut bacterial compositions differ for Indian, Western people’||VISAKHAPATNAM: The researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal have found differences in the prevalent gut bacteria between Indian and Western populations. These variations majorly arise from the dietary pattern approaches in these two regions – the Indian diet being richer in carbohydrates and fibre than the Western one. In 2011, the German scientists classified human beings into three “enterotypes”, depending on the kind of bacteria that dominates the gut, including Prevotella, Bacteroides or Ruminococcus. Based on the same, the IISER researchers found that the Indian gut microbiome has the highest abundance of the Prevotella genus of bacteria, in particular, a species called Prevotella copri. This bacterium also dominates the guts of other populations that consume a carbohydrate- and fibre-rich diet, such as the Italian, Madagascarian, Peruvian, and Tanzanian. The gut microbiomes of people from the Western countries like the USA are dominated by Bacteroides. Associate Professor at the department of biological sciences, IISER Bhopal, Dr Vineet K. Sharma, along with his collaborators from the South Dakota State University, USA has also elucidated the relationship between gut bacteria and inflammatory diseases such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). This work on the gut bacterial enterotype in the Indian population by the IISER Bhopal scientists was published in the journal “Biofilms and Microbiomes”. The paper is co-authored by Dr. Vineet K. Sharma along with his research scholars Vishnu Prasoodanan, Dr. Ashok Sharma, Shruti Mahajan, Dr. Darshan B. Dhakan, and Dr. Abhijit Maji from IISER Bhopal and Dr. Joy Scaria from Animal Disease Research & Diagnostic Laboratory, South Dakota State University, USA. According to the researchers, the human gut contains 300-500 types of bacteria that are necessary for our survival. These bacteria help in digestion, protect us from infections and even produce essential vitamins and neurochemicals. “Most enterotype studies are largely based on the Western population and have not correlated the type of dominant gut bacteria with the type of diet. This is a pioneering study that investigated the role of Prevotella species on human health in different populations, and reveals the significance of P. copri in the metabolism of complex polysaccharides and dietary fibres in non-western populations,” said Dr Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gut-bacterial-compositions-differ-for-indian-western-people/articleshow/87613253.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Salasar is devoted to Lord Hanuman and is frequented by many devotees, especially on Tuesdays. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, accompanied by party MLAs and leaders who have been nominated to contest the upcoming assembly elections, boarded a luxury bus from his residence at Badal village to embark on the pilgrimage. Earlier on the first day of Navratris, Sukhbir had visited the Chintpurni temple in Himachal Pradesh. Although SAD is considered a party more inclined towards Sikh rural voters and farmers, it has allotted a considerable number of tickets to Hindus, including for Bathinda Urban.  “After severing ties with BJP, predominantly urban and Hindu-centric party, SAD is concentrating on urban voters along with its core rural vote bank,” said a senior SAD leader, adding that Sukhbir’s regular sojourns to Hindu shrines are part of that exercise. He said the party is leaving nothing to chance and reaching out to every section of society. The bus left village Badal amid chanting of Hindu religious slogans. ‘Will restart Mukhmantri Teerath Yatra scheme’ After paying obeisance at Salasar Dham, Sukhbir announced that once the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power in Punjab, the Mukhmantri Teerath Yatra scheme initiated by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal would be restarted covering this ‘dham’ as well as places of worship of all religions. He prayed for peace and harmony as well as universal brotherhood, besides wishing for progress and prosperity for Punjab and Punjabis. SAD leaders lauded the decision, saying it was in line with former CM Parkash Singh Badal’s policy to respect to all communities in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/eyeing-urban-voters-sad-chief-visits-salasar-dham/articleshow/87615045.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Construction waste to be collected in Jaipur soon||Jaipur: Jaipur will soon join the list of cities that have started the project for collection of Construction and Demolition (CND) waste. The project will soon begin where construction waste will be collected on the spot by the company that is given the contract. Though tenders were floated for it in 2017, implementation was slow. According to an estimate, every day around 300 metric tons of CND waste is generated here that is dumped on the roadside. Hoopers coming for garbage collection are not under the contract to collect CND waste and hence people and construction companies dump them without any proper guidelines. JMC-Heritage commissioner Avdhesh Meena said, “We are in discussion with the company and a land lease agreement will soon be finalised. The contract with the company will be for 20 years in which they will collect the waste and process it. Tenders were floated at a time when both the corporation were together and so the contract will be implemented in both the corporation.” After picking up waste, it will be taken to Langaniyawas where this waste will be converted into bricks and tiles. A plant at Langaniyawas will be established by the company itself and the corporation will pay the company Rs 390 per metric tonne. This will soon become a reality and Jaipur will be among few cities in the country to have such a system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/construction-waste-to-be-collected-in-jaipur-soon/articleshow/87615042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A total 243 of the 676 cane cultivators have received the amount. However, the farmers who have changed their crop have to wait for some more time as the verification of changed crop is presently ongoing. As a Diwali bonanza to around 672 sugarcane cultivators attached to the Sanjivani sugar factory, the state government had sanctioned the balance 20% of the compensation amount under the Special Assistance Scheme to sugarcane cultivators. 80% of the amount was disbursed earlier in March. Following an order issued by the director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso, the government has sanctioned Rs 2.5 crore to the Sanjivani factory to credit it to the farmers’ bank accounts towards clearing the balance 20% of the compensation being paid to them in lieu of shutting down of the sugar factory from 2019, factory administrator Chintamani Perni said. After the closure of the factory, the state had assured to pay the farmers compensation for the next five years and the All Goa Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association, through its meeting held on August 31, had demanded that the government should consider the highest quantity of cane supplied by them to the factory while calculating the compensation. The farmers had supplied 47,069 tonne during the crushing season 2017-18, which was the highest quantity. “During this season (2020-21), the farmers had actually supplied only around 26,000 MT crop. However, By considering the highest quantity criteria, the government is paying a compensation for around 41,000 tonne cane which is around 15,000 MT more than the actual crop cultivated this year,” Perni said. The data maintained by the factory states that the farmers had supplied a total 26,391 MT cane during the 2019-20 crushing season and the government had paid an amount of Rs 9.4 lakh, including the harvesting cost, at a rate of Rs 600 per tonne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanjivani-releases-balance-compensation-to-cane-ryots/articleshow/87615052.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

But is the fastest route also safe to travel? A Rajkot-based information technology (IT) firm will help residents of a UK county search safest routes in near future. Considering all the parameters like number of crimes recorded on a road, CCTVs installed on a stretch, shops that remain open during night and frequency of police patrolling, residents of this county will be able to know the safest route to commute. “We are not only developers but also partners in this project. We, along with the police of the county, had moved this idea before the central government for funding. And we have got a positive response,” said Chintan Panara, a native of Rajkot and promoter and founder of ‘Xpertness’, the firm which is developing the mobile app. The firm has operations in Rajkot, Ahmedabad and the UK. “We have come up with this program to improve community safety. The safest route will consider many factors. The data for this project is being gathered from the police and will be continuously updated,” said Arun Kar, ex Indian army major and alumni from IIM Bangalore, who is handling the UK business. The basic feature of this app will help users search for safer routes with the map showing safety levels based on pre-fed data. Users can themselves select the criteria while selecting the routes. The upgraded version will have a SoS (standard distress signal) feature through which commuters can make quick calls, send messages for help or real-time crisis alerts, find nearby rescuers for help, start auto route tracking and SoS alert when they divert from the route. “It is expected to be completed in the next 3-4 months. The police department will make the county’s name public once the project is rolled out,” said Panara. The 2014-founded firm had earlier developed a beach check app spearheaded by the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) council for crowd management on beaches. The app helped beach goers to maintain social distance last year when lockdown started easing in Britain. The app was so successful that it was rolled out nationally by the UK government to help all the cities and towns in crowd management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-it-firm-to-help-uk-residents-commute-safely/articleshow/87613271.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The performance ranking of 213 urban local bodies given by the directorate of local bodies (DLB) revealed that the JMC-Greater and Heritage were ranked 197 and 187, respectively. To reach the largest segments of eligible youth, the government had launched a web portal and an app to apply and get loans without hassles. However, in 10 municipal corporations, only 5.67 per cent applications were submitted on the portal against the target. An official said, “Against a target of 5 lakh in urban local bodies, only 64,123 applications were submitted on the portal. There are 10 municipal corporations in the state and not a single is included in the top 100.” Jodhpur South Municipal Corporation and Bikaner Municipal Corporation hit the rock bottom as they attained 204th and 202nd positions, respectively. Similarly, Jodhpur North stood at 188th and Udaipur Municipal Corporation at 173rd, Kota North Municipal (167), Kota South (157), Ajmer (128) and Bharatpur Municipal Corporation (136). People earning more than Rs 15,000 or whose family monthly income is more than Rs 50,000 were not eligible for the loans under the scheme. A screening committee under the chairmanship of municipal commissioner was constituted to decide the eligibility of the youths for the loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civic-bodies-fail-to-implement-indira-job-scheme/articleshow/87594071.cms||---

The counting will be held on December 14. The retiring members are senior Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam and Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap (both from the BMC constituency), minister of state for home Bunty Patil from Kolhapur, Amrishbhai Patel from Dhule-Nandurbar, Gopikishan Bajoria from Akola-Buldhana-Washim and Girish Vyas from Nagpur. Their tenure ends on January 1, 2022. The terms of eight members from seven local authorities constituencies are going to expire on January 1, the poll panel said in a statement. But only five constituencies are going to polls as they have been found to be meeting the poll panel guidelines — at least 75% of the local authorities in a constituency are functioning, and at least 75% of the electors out of the total electorate of the constituency are available — by the state chief electoral officer (see box). Hectic lobbying is on in Shiv Sena for the BMC seat as the party is unlikely to re-nominate former minister Kadam, who is seen as out of favour. It is alleged a close Kadam associate was instrumental in complaining against transport minister Anil Parab. Among the Sena contenders are Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, party secretary Milind Narvekar, Sachin Ahir, who joined the party a year ago, former MLA Sunil Shinde, who had given up Worli for Aaditya Thackeray, and Rahul Kanal, Aaditya’s friend. BJP is likely to nominate Chitra Wagh, a women’s activist who shifted from NCP during the 2019 assembly elections. Bhai Jagtap’s fate hangs in balance as Congress doesn’t have the strength to elect a member on its own. In the 227-seat BMC house, Sena has 97 members, BJP 82, and Congress only 29 members. The party will re-nominate Bunty Patil from Kolhapur, BJP may re-nominate Amrish Patel and Vyas, while Sena may re-nominate Bajoria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-polls-for-6-council-seats-on-dec-10-all-eyes-on-kadam/articleshow/87615838.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The demand gathered mass after the state cabinet resolved to rename the Mumbai-Karnataka region after Kittur. Activists and politicians feel a dedicated board would help leverage funds to develop backward areas in seven districts of Kittur-Karnataka region. In the general budget, it is hard to get due share of funds for development works, they say. After Basavaraj Bommai took charge as the chief minister, he moved several offices to Suvarna Vidhana Soudha here, and also showed interest to give a facelift to north Karnataka region.People, immaterial of of their political affiliations, are planning to put pressure on the CM for the board, especially during the winter session of the legislature scheduled for December.Rajya Sabha MP Eranna Kadadi said Bommai has kept his promise by renaming the region. “Now, it is time to establish a separate board for this region as many taluks in its seven districts have remained backward. I’m confident the CM will heed our demand,” he told TOI. Ashok Chandaragi, the Kannada activist who was instrumental in getting the region renamed, said the new board is the need of the hour. “Mere change of name will not help fetch funds. In general budget, there will be no separate header under Kittur-Karnataka for funds allocation. Forming a board or an authority is a must. There are several areas that need money for transformation. Kannada organisations will pursue this issue seriously,” he said. Deepak Gundaganahatti, another Kannada activist, said development is key to resolving the border dispute. “The onus is on the state government to uplift the region which has been suffering due to lack of funds. Pro-Kannada outfits will chart a plan of action to convince the government on the same,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/govt-urged-to-set-up-kittur-ktaka-development-board/articleshow/87613300.cms||Shreyas HS

We are going through the contents of the same to see if any offence is made out and whether an FIR can be registered,” Aurangabad’s deputy commissioner of police (Zone-II) Deepak Girhe told TOI. When contacted, Malik told TOI, “I never made any casteist remark against anyone, including Sameer Wankhede, nor have I committed any atrocity against any member of backward community. I have merely questioned Wankhede’s religion based on his birth and marriage certificates.” Wankhede confirmed that Gunfabai is his father’s sister and told TOI that she has filed the complaint application with the Aurangabad police. He, however, preferred not to make any further comment. In her plea, Gunfabai has alleged that the minister has falsely claimed that Wankhede has bagged a central government job based on forged caste certificate and he has conveyed this alleged false information to the state’s social justice minister and other government offices. The plea further stated that by giving false information about Wankhede’s caste, the minister has provoked the officials for using their power against the NCB official. “The allegations by the minister have troubled us,” the application stated, claiming that the same amounted to violation of SC ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. Gunfabai stated, “The minister has insulted us merely because Wankhede had arrested Malik’s son-in-law in a drugs case.” She further stated that by holding news conferences and making allegations about Wankhede’s caste, the minister has caused public hostility, antipathy against their family. “Moreover, the making of allegations through news conferences has caused mental harassment to us and compelled us to file an application with the police,” she stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wankhedes-aunt-moves-aurangabad-police-for-action-against-malik-under-atrocities-act/articleshow/87612382.cms||Mohammed Akhef

After Johnny's death, Jhansi was inducted into Johnny's place. Johnny had aided in crackinng over 65 criminal cases in the district, including murder, theft, and robbery, and the dog was a nightmare for criminals. The 14-month-old dog, has been trained at the Adugodi police headquarters and is prepared to assist in the investigation of crimes. "In Bengaluru, Jhansi was taught how to behave with others, how to attack, how to follow instructions, its duty, and discipline. Jhansi is a very sensitive, and understanding animal, it has been following our instructions perfectly," said trainer Fakiresh Kamanahalli. Srikant Kabbur, another trainer, stated that they have been monitoring Jhansi's health on a daily basis. The dog is being taken out in the mornings for walks, running, and exercises. All four dogs — Jhansi, Julie, Kanana and Rani — eat breakfast consisting of milk, eggs, malt, cereals, and vegetables. In the evening they train for two hours again and will have dinner. This is the daily routine for sniffer dogs. Their schedules may change if are sent outside, he explained. Maruti Hegade of the CPI district armed reserve police said that Jhansi can trace criminals up to 11kms from the incident site. "These four sniffer dogs are being cared for by four dog parents, assistant dog parents, and chefs," he added. "In the district, Kanaka and Rani, two labrador breed dogs, are already working in the bomb-detecting department. All the four dogs were depolyed during Mysuru Dasara, Bengaluru air show, winter sessions in Belagavi, and VIP and VVIP public events.

Several groups were sceptical about the scale of the event considering the Covid-19 restrictions imposed in the city. Every year, thousands of devotees throng Tapi River bank on the sixth day of New Year of Vikram Samvat to worship the sun. The city has an estimated population of over three lakh migrants from Bihar and Jharkhand. Meanwhile, migrants have started preparation at 25 places on Tapi riverbank. Eight major organising groups have approached police for permission and they have been allowed to limit the number of participants upto 400 at a time. Prasad Yadav, president of Bihar Vikas Mandal said, "For the last 28 years, we have been observing Chhath Puja at weir-cum-causeway near Singanpore. In 2020, post lockdown majority of migrants went to their native places and gradually returned as industrial and commercial activities resumed." “In Chhath Puja. most women observe day-long fast. In a few families, men also join the women in fasting. On Wednesday, people will perform prayers of the setting sun and perform puja of rising sun on Thursday. This year , we started arrangements very late as we are awaiting official permission to hold the event,” Yadav added. “On Tuesday different department officials visited pooja places and gave instructions which will be helpful to maintain covid protocol. We also request people to follow government rules and regulations for covid and celebrate the festival,” said an organiser. A senior police officer who visited the river bank at weir-cum-causeway said, “We gave some suggestions to organizers which will help them to observe Covid protocol. We expect people will perform puja with face masks and social distance after all it is for their own health and safety.” Ajay Chaudhary, president of Samast Bihar-Jharkhand Samaj Trust said, “Since the last six years we have been doing public co-ordination during Chhath Puja at Parle Point. This year we will allow only two members from each family. The walkway behind the Ambajee temple is very long so we will request people to see the celebration from there.” “The organizers have been allowed to celebrate the festival with a limit of 400 people. Organisers will have to ensure that Covid-19 restrictions are followed strictly,” said a senior police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/stage-set-for-chhath-puja-on-banks-of-tapi-in-surat/articleshow/87613294.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by M Parvathy Pillai, 69. The petitioner along with her family members came from Sri Lanka to India in 2007. She was residing at the Mandapam camp along with her unmarried son Niruban alias Lanjan. In 2019, the Q branch police registered a criminal case against Niruban. Even though bail was granted to him in the case, he was taken to a special camp for foreigners at the central prison campus in Trichy district, based on the order passed by the authorities to restrict his movement. The petitioner who is suffering from age-related ailments submitted representations to the authorities seeking to shift her son to the Mandapam camp as she requires the care and support of her son. Since the same was not considered, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief. Justice G Ilangovan observed that the question which arises for consideration is whether the mother should be deprived of the care and support of her only son due to the pendency of the investigation in the criminal case. In the considered view of the court, the request by the petitioner is more on humanitarian ground and than on legal ground. The judge observed that this court is of the opinion that the order is only a restriction order and it cannot be termed either as a detention or a confinement order. The movement of the petitioner’s son is restricted, however, there is no total restriction as he can come out of the camp after obtaining proper permission of the Trichy district collector. The judge observed that a perusal of the records shows that the petitioner is an elderly woman and is suffering from many health issues. The petitioner requires the care and support of her son and therefore it is the fit case that can be considered on humanitarian grounds. Hence, the judge directed the petitioner to make proper representation to the Union ministry of home affairs by setting out the facts for shifting her son from Trichy camp to Mandapam camp in Ramanathapuram. On receipt of the same, the ministry shall consider the same on humanitarian ground and pass orders taking into account the family circumstances of the petitioner, directed the judge, while disposing of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/consider-sl-womans-plea-to-shift-son-hc/articleshow/87614282.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A criminal case was also registered by the Palani taluk police. It was submitted that the revenue officials were continuously monitoring the area to prevent illegal mining activities. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan directed the collector to conduct an inquiry and file a report on the total extent of government land available at the Periyammapatti village and the total extent of soil which has been illegally excavated so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-report-on-petition-to-prevent-illegal-sand-mining/articleshow/87614284.cms||---

The builder Prashant Trivedi lodged a complaint of cheating and forgery at Waghodiya police station on Monday after the partners Sunil Makhija and his brother Deepak Makhija did not return his money and sold off the properties promised to him to others. Trivedi told police that he became a partner in the project in July 2014 by investing Rs 1 crore. It was decided to audit the accounts quarterly and share the profits as decided. Trivedi was to receive 10% of the profits. However, the two accused would not share any accounts with Trivedi. So he decided to withdraw his partnership. In January 2017, Trivedi was promised that he will be paid Rs 4.8 crore in different instalments between March 2017 and May 2019. The duo did not pay the money to Trivedi, but did another agreement with him to give him properties under the project instead of money. According to the new agreement they signed a sale deed for several properties under the project and promised to give him possession within four months. Trivedi was not given possession of the properties as promised and when he checked with the sub-registrar’s office, he came to know that several of the properties were already sold to others. Trivedi submitted a complaint to Waghodiya police station, based on which the two brothers were booked for forgery and cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/builder-cheated-of-rs-1cr-by-business-partners-in-waghodiya/articleshow/87612997.cms||---

In his petition, M Sivabalasubramaniyan of Tenkasi district stated that his father I Murugaiya was an employee of Rajammal Fireworks at Sippiparai near Sattur taluk. On March 20, 2020, a major fire accident occurred at the unit in which a total of 14 people, including his father died. He stated that officials from various departments visited the family members and assured that compensation would be awarded. While the government announced Rs 1 lakh interim compensation, the collector assured that the state government would provide Rs 10 lakh compensation and employment to a member of the family. He stated that despite submitting several representations to the authorities, no steps were taken to provide compensation so far. Since the authorities had permitted the cracker unit to function without proper licence, they are liable to pay compensation for the death of his father. Similarly, five people - T Krishnaveni, G Singaraj, K Mohanaselvi, G Armugathai and B Vijaya who are family members of the other deceased people filed separate petitions seeking compensation. Hearing the pleas, justice C V Karthikeyan sought response from the state and adjourned the cases to a further date for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/kin-of-workers-who-died-in-fire-accident-seek-relief/articleshow/87614288.cms||---
---||Madurai||Chamber appeals govt to reduce VAT on fuel||Madurai: The Tamilnadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI) has urged the state government to reduce value added tax (VAT) on fuel for the benefit of common man, trade and industry. Chamber president N Jegatheesan pointed out at the excise duty reduction of Rs 10 and Rs 5 litre for diesel and petrol with effect from November 4 and the Union government urging states to reduce VAT to pass on the benefit to consumers. The economy is seeing a significant turn from the recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic because of the hard work of the trade and industry. A substantial reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel would increase consumption and greatly help to reduce inflation, Jegatheesan said. He added that this would also reduce the prices of essential commodities. It would in turn benefit the poor and the middle class families to some extent. The chamber noted that 13 states had reduced VAT on fuel. States like Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Tripura and Goa and Puducherry have reduced VAT by Rs 7 per litre. In Puducherry, VAT reduction has reflected in the cost of petrol and diesel dropping to Rs 94.94 and Rs 83.58, respectively, per litre. This is against Rs 101.4 per litre petrol and Rs 91.43 per litre diesel in Chennai. As farmers are preparing for the rabi season cultivation, reduction in taxes on diesel would greatly help them, the chamber said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/chamber-appeals-govt-to-reduce-vat-on-fuel/articleshow/87614292.cms||---

The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by K Pushpavanam, a law student from Madurai district. The petitioner stated that the Ayyalur forests in Dindigul district and Kadavur region in Karur district are significant habitats of the species. In the counter, the state submitted that preliminary data about the presence and population of slender loris at Ayyalur and Kadavur is essential to declare the area as a sanctuary. A census was conducted at the Ayyalur forest in 2018. Though the population could not be studied, the abundance of the species was noted in the area. Due to the nocturnal habitat and arboreal nature of the animal, the exact number could not be determined with the known techniques. Action is being taken to conduct a census about the presence of slender loris using specialists. Only after obtaining the details from the sites on the abundance of the species, a detailed proposal for declaration of the reserved forest of Ayyalur and Kadavur range as slender loris sanctuaries will be submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pil-plea-to-protect-slender-loris-habitats-in-karur-dindigul/articleshow/87614289.cms||---

---||Madurai||AIADMK slams Tamil Nadu, Kerala on Mullaperiyar water row||MADURAI: Hundreds of AIADMK members participated in protests organised in the five southern districts – Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga – to condemn the Kerala and Tamil Nadu governments for their actions that resulted in releasing water from Mullaperiyar dam before the storage reached the permitted limit of 142 feet. “How could the AIADMK government store water till 142 feet?” party coordinator and former chief minister O Panneerselvam asked while addressing the protesters at Cumbum in Theni district. He accused the governments of the two states of betraying the farmers and people of the five districts in Tamil Nadu. He said that the Kerala government has been spreading lies about the strength of the dam from the year 2000. Panneerselvam said the AIADMK government had been categorically fighting those lies and addressing issues raised by the neighbouring state. The government under J Jayalalithaa had made efforts to increase the storage to 152 feet through communications with Kerala and also waged a legal battle before the Supreme Court when the party had been in power till 2006. The Jayalalithaa government had spent several crores of rupees to strengthen the dam to realise the full reservoir capacity, he said and alleged that the DMK that came to power in 2006 did not show interest in the case before the apex court and went in favour of the Congress that was in power in Kerala. The AIADMK once again took up the case strongly after returning to power in 2011 and ensured that the water level was increased to 142 feet. The AIADMK government had also set aside Rs 6.5 crore to repair the baby dam but permission was denied by the neighbouring state, he said. Strongly condemning the Tamil Nadu government for discharging water from the reservoir before the level had touched the permitted limit of 142 feet, he criticised minister for water resources S Duraimurugan for substantiating the act. Theni MP O P Raveendranath Kumar, who addressed the protesters, said that the Kerala government had been misleading people in that state with a false propaganda about the strength of the dam. He said that farmers and people of the region would teach the DMK a lesson for deceiving the people of Tamil Nadu by going hand in glove with the Kerala government over the Mullaperiyar dam issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-slams-tn-kerala-on-mullaperiyar-water-row/articleshow/87614295.cms||---

The fresh state tally of 106 includes nine men and seven women, including two in advanced stage of pregnancy from the Zika epicentre of Chakeri and another patient who tested positive on Saturday from neighbouring Kannauj district.  The 16 patients are residents of Harjinder Nagar, Pokharpur, Tiwaripur Bagiya and Qazi Khera localities in the Chakeri hinterland, said CMO Dr Nepal Singh. The pregnant women who contracted the virus underwent an ultrasound test and doctors confirmed their foetuses were healthy. “In the report received from King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow on Tuesday morning, seven women of whom two are pregnant, and nine men have been confirmed to be infected with Zika virus,” the CMO added. “The infected persons have no severe symptoms. All have been kept in home isolation. About a 100 teams have been deployed in the city for source reduction and 15 teams for home sampling and sampling. Also, an additional 15 rapid response teams (RRT) have been engaged to check the spread of Zika virus,” the CMO added.

During the pandemic, we made efforts to hold online classes as well. In the last two months, we are having students celebrate their birthdays with a cake to make them interested in coming back to school,” said Joseph Jeyaseelan, headmaster of the school. Students, who have birthdays in a particular month, are asked to come to school with their parents to cut a cake, which is kept ready, and also receive a gift. The headmaster said that children from economically poor background often don’t get to celebrate their birthdays like this, and as a result children eagerly look forward to come to school to cut a cake. The walls of the school halls and rooms are also welcoming for students as they are all painted colourfully with paintings including train, aeroplane, rocket and bus among others. “The painting was one of the initiatives I took up when I first joined as headmaster and was able to do it by spending my own money with a friend’s help. Through these paintings we wanted children to dream even of aiming higher for ambitions like pilot and aeronautical engineering,” said Jeyaseelan, adding that there are also plans to introduce the children to practical-oriented learning by teaching them agriculture and gardening on the school grounds. T P Chandrakala, a parent whose three sons go to this school, said that the school has created a wonderful environment for learning. “My sons study Class V, Class II and LKG respectively. The innovation and dedication of the headmaster and teachers is admirable,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/efforts-pay-off-as-students-eager-to-come-back-to-campus-at-this-school/articleshow/87614299.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Madurai||Sathiyar Dam water level reaches 28ft, one feet short of full capacity||Madurai: As water level in Sathiyar Dam reached 28ft against its full capacity of 29ft, district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and superintendent of police V Baskaran along with officials from the PWD inspected the dam and discussed the precautionary measures to be taken to ensure uninterrupted outflow from the reservoir when it reaches the full capacity. The collector said that water released from the dam will fill up 10 tanks downstream and will be a boon for farmers. “Though Madurai has recorded only normal rainfall, 70% of the tanks in the district are full and overflowing. The PWD, revenue and the rural development departments are carrying out precautionary measures such as clearing the outlet channels and strengthening the bunds,” he told reporters. As Vandiyur tank in the city is filling up, representatives of the Gomathipuram Thendral Nagar Residents Association petitioned Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan. Association president D Raghavan said that 90% of the water that would reach Vandiyur Tank is from Sathiyar Dam. “Vandiyur Tank is already full and water is let out through the sluices on the eastern side. Water from Sathiyar Dam will reach Vandiyur tank through two channels – Sathiyar Odai (near the Mattuthavani bus stand) and Aathikulam Channel (near the flower market) – at Mattuthavani. So we requested the corporation to open the sluice gates at the Melamadai Junction to release from the tank,” he said. Representatives of the association said that there is possibility of the tank’s bund getting breached when water is released only from one of the two sluice gates. Water could be evenly distributed when it is released from both the sluice gates on two different sides of the tank and take the surplus water to River Vaigai. The civic body official told them that the tank is under the control of the PWD and promised to take it up with them. The residents also pressed for establishing a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) on the inlet to the tank through the Aathikulam Channel, as the channel directly brings waste from the industrial estate and Pudur areas to Vandiyur Tank. Borewells from Anna Nagar, KK Nagar, Melamadai, Gomathipuram, Yagappa Nagar, Anbu Nagar, VOC Nagar and Maruthupandiyar Street depend on the tank for ground water recharge. Establishment of a micro STP on the vacant site near the Mattuthavani Flower Market will benefit the residents of ward number 28, 29 and 30 in the corporation, the association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sathiyar-dam-water-level-reaches-28ft-one-feet-short-of-full-capacity/articleshow/87614296.cms||---

So far, out of 18 accused involved in the cases, five have been arrested and remanded in judicial custody. According to police, the cases have been registered at Anna Nagar, Keeraithurai, Koodalpudur, Mathichiyam, Sellur, Tallakulam, and Teppakulam police stations. The modus operandi involved the accused receiving money from the victims ranging from Rs 1 lakh to more than Rs 12 lakh on the promise of getting them a job at a private/government entity. In the case registered by the Anna Nagar police, the complainant was cheated of Rs 5.9 lakh by two promising to get his son a job at the Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) in 2017. The accused, G Sankar, 52, was working as a temporary translator at the university while the other accused, Parthasarathi, was working as an office assistant before being recently suspended from his duties. Police arrested and remanded Sankar while Parthasarathi is absconding. In another case registered by the Teppakulam police, a man was cheated of more than Rs 12 lakh between 2018 and 2021 by three who promised to arrange for a job in Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). The accused are absconding. Police sources said that pending cases and petitions that were submitted involving job scams are being reviewed and cases are being registered so that legal action can be taken. “In case of such job scams, the problem is that the complainant is also engaging in an illegal activity by offering money in the first place to get the job. The transaction is also mostly by cash. So, they are not willing to come forward immediately to report the scam and register a case,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-register-7-job-scam-cases-in-madurai-arrest-5/articleshow/87614302.cms||---

Chairman of the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC), Dr S Gurushankar told reporters on Tuesday that these devices, acquired from US-based Teladoc Health in August last year, empowered the doctors to treat patients anywhere, anytime by acting as their third eye. “More than 40,000 inpatients and outpatients have been treated at our hospital during and after the second wave of Covid using these robots. Over 3,500 of these were Covid-19 patients admitted to the Covid-19, ICU and emergency wards,” said Gurushankar. These robots can collect and process data from other diagnostic equipment and present it to the doctors. “Specialists can cross-consult each other regarding a patient and even consult remotely with doctors located in countries like the US and the UK. We integrated these robots with our USG, echo, Cathlab and other diagnostic devices to monitor patient parameters. They are also connected with our picture archiving and communication system (PACS) through which doctors can pull out the patient’s diagnostic reports,” said Gurushankar. Senior vice-president of Teladoc Health, US, Dr Shayan Vyas said that advanced virtual care increases the efficiency and independence of clinicians, while also improving safety measures for both clinicians and patients. “It reduces the need for patient and clinician to travel and increases the number of patients a single doctor can see in a day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/doctors-use-tech-to-treat-40000-patients-during-pandemic/articleshow/87614311.cms||---

The Corporation claimed that it took 795 days for the Lucknow Metro to start. The construction of Lucknow Metro started on September 28, 2014, and trail run was conducted on December 1, 2016. While in Kanpur Metro project, the construction started on November 15, 2019, and first official trial will begin on Wednesday post flag off by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In total, it took only 726 days for Kanpur Metro to start trials. Speaking on anonymity, a senior engineer of UPMRC said, “There are four prime reasons behind the unique record of Kanpur Metro. First, we used double T-girders to erect the station concourse. It was for the first time in India for the Metro project that girders were pre-casted at the factory floor and then brought to the construction site which were installed with the help of heavy lifter cranes. This method helped us to save time.” “Secondly, we utilized the corona pandemic lockdown as an opportunity by expediting the construction in those areas of the Metro corridor which were often heavily congested during normal days. In order to ensure that labour is available during the corona pandemic, we constructed a labour colony and provided a food canteen, shelter with attached toilets and drinking water facilities. In fact, the project was halted for four and a half months in the pandemic and we arranged transportation facilities for those labourers who wanted to visit their villages to meet their dear ones. Such steps built confidence and motivated them to return and work for the project,” said the officer. “Thirdly, we had crystal clear understanding with construction contractors. If they had any issues be it financial, material or anything else the contractors were asked to directly contact senior officials for immediate remedies. Lastly, we kept the uniform standard for the entire project — which means almost every girder or pillar is similar, which helped contractors to expedite the construction,” said the corporation engineer. Kanpur Metro priority corridor is 9-km-long and stretches between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel with nine stations, while Lucknow Metro trail stretch had eight stations in 8.7- km-long stretch between Transport Nagar and Charbagh. The Kanpur Metro project is funded by the European Investment Bank. Around 650 million euros (Rs 11076.48 crore) are being pumped into the project to construct two corridors, including a 23.7-km-long stretch between IIT-Kanpur and Naubasta and 8.6-km-long stretch between Agriculture University and Barra- sector 8. The entire cost of the Kanpur Metro project is expected to be realised within five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/upmrc-kanpur-metro-trials-beat-lucknow-trails-by-69-days/articleshow/87615122.cms||Arvind Chauhan

According to police, Jesinh Solanki had started for Gondal in his pick-up van to purchase onion on Monday late night. During the early hours of Tuesday, Solanki felt sleepy while driving his vehicle. So he parked the van near a hotel at Sokhda village in Morbi taluka to take a nap. While Solanki was asleep, two unidentified men opened the door of his vehicle and threatened him at knifepoint. The duo took away Rs 6.1 lakh cash that Solanki was carrying to purchase the onions. Later Solanki contacted police and informed about the robbery. Police said that they have checked the footage of CCTV cameras in which the two robbers are seen approaching Solanki’s vehicle. “We are investigating if anyone related to the victim was involved because not many knew that he was carrying so much cash,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/vegetable-trader-robbed-of-rs-6l-at-knife-point/articleshow/87613432.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Two acquitted in drugs case||Ahmedabad: A special NDPS court in Gandhinagar acquitted two persons in connection with the seizure of 8kg of charas brought from Jammu & Kashmir in a luxury bus in 2018. The two acquitted were Fakir Mohammed Chhipa from Madhya Pradesh and Mohammed Ashraf Reshi from Jammu & Kashmir. The case under the NDPS Act was registered when Chhipa was caught in possession of 8.2kg charas, worth Rs 4 lakh, from a bus at Chandrala check post. The investigation led to the implication of Reshi and two others from Jammu & Kashmir. Since only Reshi was arrested, the trial took place against Chhipa and Reshi. The court granted the duo benefit of the doubt after their advocate B M Gupta raised questions about the process of seizure and sealing of contraband. The prosecutor examined 16 witnesses and presented 21 pieces of documentary evidence in court, but the court found major contradictions in the evidence. It also pointed out that while seizing the contraband, the raiding party applied one seal on the parcel, but when it reached the FSL, two seals were found on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-acquitted-in-drugs-case/articleshow/87593473.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Feeling more humbled after meeting other Padma Awardees: Dr Sagdev||Nagpur/Kochi: Dr Dhananjay Sagdeo, born and brought up in Nagpur and now serving in Wayanad district of Kerala, received the Padma Shri honour at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday. Speaking to TOI soon after the ceremony, he said, “I am feeling more humbled after seeing and knowing fellow Padma awardees.” “The People’s Padma is a new concept that is bringing many unknown personalities to limelight. These great human beings have dedicated their lifetimes for some cause. It is an honour for being one among them,” said Dr Sagdeo. Dr Sagdeo, who is serving tribals, said that is his “life’s mission” and “it will continue”. “I am feeling fortunate that the work done by me was noticed. Eventually, it’s team work. I have accepted the award for the entire team involved in Vivekananda Medical Mission that works in tribal India,” he added. Dr Sagdeo said that he would take forward his mission to empower the tribal community by providing them better health, education and making them self-reliant. Terming the award as the biggest recognition of his service, Dr Sagdeo said he is looking forward to celebrating with the Vivekananda team and the tribals who he has been serving for four decades. “I am happy that I could personally meet the top leaders of our nation at the award ceremony. Narendra Modiji met each of the awardees and gave me a pat on the back while talking. Though it was a brief interaction, it was the biggest encouragement to continue my work,” said Sagdeo. While many Padma awardees chose to wear traditional attires of their respective states, Dr Sagdeo went to collect his award from President Ram Nath Kovind in a simple half-sleeve shirt and trousers. “There was no discussion about what I should wear in my family. I wear the same type of clothes everyday so nothing special was for Padma ceremony,” he said. Dr Sagdeo was accompanied by his wife Sujatha and daughter Dr Gayatri who is doing post graduation in AIIMS Patna. His brother Wg Cdr Vinay Sagdeo was also present at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. “It was a lifetime moment for all of us when he marched towards the podium. Vice president Dr Venkaiah Naidu, PM Narendra Modi and others greeted him. He got a standing ovation,” said Wg Cdr Sagdeo. He said the Covid pandemic had affected his work. Dr Sagdeo now plans to revamp a five-point project which will focus on tribal health, education, self-reliance, moral values and social inclusion. “Besides the Covid vaccination and awareness programmes, there is a need to strengthen the work related to the pneumococcal and sickle cell disease vaccinations too. We have been helping the government with this. As PM Modi called for atmanibharata, tribal people need to be skilled to attain self-reliance. Education and skill training is the best way to do that,” said Sagdeo. Dr Sagdeo and family will return soon to Muttil in Wayanad (Kerala) where he is current based after a stopover in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/feeling-more-humbled-after-meeting-other-padma-awardees-dr-sagdev/articleshow/87615131.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Medical officer, 3 nurses arrested over Ahmednagar hospital blaze||NASHIK: Ahmednagar police on Tuesday arrested a medical officer, Dr Vishika Shinde, and three staff nurses — Sapna Pathare, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant — in connection with the fire in the ICU of the Ahmednagar civil hospital which killed 11 Covid patients on November 6. Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil told TOI that cases have been registered against all four under sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC. They will be produced in court on Wednesday. On Monday, the state government had suspended Dr Shinde along with district civil surgeon Dr Sunil Pokharna, another medical officer, Dr Suresh Dakhe, and nurse Pathare. It had also terminated the services of Sheikh and Anant. “Police investigation has found that the four arrested were assigned to be at work at the ICU on Saturday morning but none of them were present when the fire broke out. There was a delay of about 10 minutes in the response time after the fire broke out. We feel more lives could have been saved had the fire been detected in time,” Patil said. The police had carried out an investigation related to the deaths in the blaze. It had examined footage from the CCTVs installed in the ICU. “Dr Shinde was supposed to be on duty at the ICU from 9am onwards on that day. But she did not visit the ICU even once before the fire broke out at around 10:30am,” Patil said. Asked whether there could be more arrests in the case, Patil said police investigations were still on. Meanwhile, nurses at the civil hospital staged a demonstration on the premises on Tuesday morning protesting against the action against their three colleagues. The Maharashtra nurses’ association has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding that the action against the three nurses be withdrawn. They claimed that the three nurses were the first to sound an alert after the fire broke out and that they helped in taking patients out from the ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/medical-officer-3-nurses-arrested-over-hospital-blaze/articleshow/87612485.cms||---

The 88-year-old passed away due to old age at his home in Danta. All the markets and shops remained closed in the town to pay respect to the late prince. Born on May 31, 1933, Parmar was the second son of late Maharana Saheb Sri Bhawani Sinhji. After graduating in history and law from Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU), Parmar made his political debut in 1962 with victory in the Gram Panchayat elections. Parmar was found of hunting, said sources. According to sources, Parmar was cremated with royal honours at Koteshwar near Ambaji. Before cremation, a Palkhi Yatra of his mortal remains was taken out from Danta to Divadi and then to Koteshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ex-prince-of-danta-cremated-with-honours/articleshow/87613460.cms||---

Barely a lak Gujarati vacationers went up the mountans for the 5-day holiday period and for once, the local administration at Mt Abu preferred to take it easy too. Though it turned Nelson’s eye to the usual stringent Covid protocols, not wanting to play spoilsport to Diwali revellers, many tourists were seen moving around without masks. The administration was keen not to let people return to their homes 250-odd kms away with long drawn faces from a subdued festivity. In pre-Covid era, Mount Abu would witness a mad rush of tourists, especially from Ahmedabad, beginning with the commencement of Diwali holidays. Hotel room prices would soar and sometimes tourists would have to sleep in the open for lack of sufficient accommodation. Even sleeping in tents would be charged at the market rate just for being provided with a single cot! It was always a sea of humanity at favourites hangouts like Sunset Point and Nakki lake, which even this year managed to lure the visitors. According to municipal officials, about 15,000 vehicles arrived on the hill for the vacations, while the civic body managed to make a good income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sans-rush-mount-abu-enjoyed-a-calm-diwali/articleshow/87613487.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Crocodile remains elusive, officials exercising caution||Nagpur: The ‘camera shy’ crocodile on a patch of Nag River near Gawalipura continued to elude wildlife officials on Tuesday. No other sightings were reported by citizens either. After photos and video of a crocodile in that particular spot went viral, wildlife officials have been trying to first spot it and then figure out a plan to capture it. Kundan Hate, honorary wildlife warden, said, “Since dawn, our team was there but nobody spotted the crocodile. We will keep looking for a few days before deciding on the next step.” Going by the presumption that the crocodile is still in the same area, Hate said any rescue plans will have to executed with a lot of care. “The crocodile is extremely dangerous in water, so to catch it while it’s still there is extremely risky. We are trying to coordinate with NMC officials and other agencies to see if the water level can be reduced on this particular patch,” said Hate. He added that if water dries out here, then officials can think of capturing the crocodile. To lure the crocodile out of the waters with a bait is a non-starter, said Hate. “It’s definitely getting ample food inside the water. Animal carcass regularly flows through these waters and crocodiles feast on anything. In such a scenario, the bait option won’t work,” said Hate. A few theories are emerging on where the crocodile might have come from. The dominant one is that it came from Pench. “Around 20 years ago, crocodiles were introduced in the backwaters there. From there to Totladoh, to Gorewada and then through the waste water sewage, it might have landed here,” said Hate. He said decades ago, officials working on Maharajbagh campus too had seen crocodiles in Nag River. “So, it’s probably an old migratory route for them,” said Hate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crocodile-remains-elusive-officials-exercising-caution/articleshow/87615141.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Dehradun||RTI query reveals state lacks proper data on rehab centres||Dehradun: An RTI query has revealed that the state machinery neither has any data on rehabilitation centres nor does it have any information about the rules governing them. The query — filed by advocate Shiva Verma on August 6 — sought information on rehabilitation centres in the state from senior superintendent of police (SSP), district magistrate (DM), chief medical officer (CMO) and department of social welfare. In their reply, officials claimed that the required details were not registered with them. Notably, rehab centres in Dehradun have been under the scanner, of late. Things turned from bad to worse when a few women at a centre in Clement Town, on the outskirts of Dehrdaun, had alleged sexual exploitation by the manager. In another incident, on October 24, a 30-year-old man had died after his health deteriorated at the rehab centre in Nehru Colony. The family had later lodged an FIR pressing murder charges against the centre management. Speaking to TOI, Shiva Verma said, “There have been so many cases of misconduct on the part of rehab centres, which can only be curbed through a policy that regularises rules for such centres. People from weaker sections end up paying hefty amounts for treatment, which often leads to further harassment. The response from all departments for not having any data on the centres in the state is shocking.” The director, social welfare, Rajendra Kumar, when queried, said, “Government is in the process of framing guidelines to monitor rehabilitation centres."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rti-query-reveals-state-lacks-proper-data-on-rehab-centres/articleshow/87613500.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri SIT: Forensic report confirms accused fired guns||BAREILLY: A forensic lab report on Tuesday has confirmed that shots were fired from the firearms recovered from Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister Ajay Mishra, Latif alias Kaale, and Satya Narayan Tripathi during the violence that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, a member of the special investigation team (SIT) working on the case told TOI. The three are the key accused in the matter. A rifle, a revolver, and a repeater gun were recovered from the accused in the days that followed the incident. They were sent for forensic testing on October 15. The development comes a day after the Supreme Court expressed dismay at the pace of the investigation and recommended that it be monitored by a retired high court judge from outside Uttar Pradesh. The apex court then suggested two names, that of justices Rakesh Kumar Jain and Ranjit Singh, both of whom retired from the Punjab and Haryana high court. The Supreme Court was also disappointed over the delay in finalising the forensic report as well as the mix-up of evidence collected from different FIRs, all registered in relation to the one incident. TOI had earlier reported that police initially dismissed farmers' claims of being shot at by the men in vehicles that ran over five men -- four farmers and a journalist. However, later, the SIT mentioned the presence of bullets in its preliminary report. But whether shots were fired or not remained unclear until now. The latest forensic lab report has established that the arms that were recovered along with empty cartridges match with the bullets. Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra, father of prime accused Ashish Mishra, had earlier said that no shooting had taken place during the incident. Special prosecution officer (SPO) S P Yadav told TOI, “A rifle was seized from Ashish Mishra and was sent for forensic examination along with firearms recovered from the other accused. However, we can’t share more details as it is confidential." A member of the SIT, who didn’t wish to be named, said that the ballistic report has indeed confirmed that bullets were shot from Ashish's rifle. Two employees at a power sub-station along with some others living near the spot where the incident happened had earlier told TOI that they heard several gunshots after the convoy mowed down farmers who were protesting since the morning. A few of them saw some men firing in the air and running towards a sugarcane field. Sources have also confirmed that another forensic report has verified that CCTV footage recovered from a petrol pump where the vehicles of the convoy had gathered for a few moments is genuine. However, it is unconfirmed whether Ashish is seen in that video or not. Ashish was arrested by the SIT on October 9 after questioning and his rifle was seized by the probe team the same day. So far, 13 people, including Ashish, have been arrested for the killing of farmers. Four farmers, too, have been arrested for the lynching of three BJP workers. SPO Yadav said, “Judge Mona Singh has remanded two suspects to police custody in the lynching case. Their remand will start from Wednesday morning.” Meanwhile, after the SIT confirmed in court that journalist Raman Kashyap was crushed to death by cars in the convoy and not lynched by farmers, as claimed by BJP leader Sumit Jaiswal (who filed an FIR against farmers in this matter), Raman’s brother Pawan moved an application under section 156 (3) of the CrPC in the chief judicial magistrate's court to register an FIR against Ajay Mishra, Ashish, and 12 others. Pawan said, “The SIT investigation has clearly mentioned the names of those responsible for my brother's death. We want an FIR to be registered against all of them. We had filed a complaint with the SHO and SP, Lakhimpur, but our FIR was not registered. The next date of hearing is November 15.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lakhimpur-forensic-report-confirms-accused-fired-from-weapons-on-day-of-violence/articleshow/87613510.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

One person, who fell ill after consuming spurious liquor, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kanti. IG (Tirhut range) Ganesh Kumar rushed to Kanti soon after receiving information about the hooch deaths. The incident, which occurred despite a massive crackdown on liquor smugglers after the recent hooch deaths in Gopalganj, West Champaran and Samastipur districts, has left the police red-faced. At least 59 people have lost their lives in seven hooch cases in the state in less than a month. According to police sources, 17 hooch incidents since January this year have claimed at least 112 lives in the state. “Family members of the victims from Kanti have told police that they (those who died) had consumed liquor during campaigning for the panchayat election on November 7,” Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant told TOI over phone. He said bodies of two victims were cremated by their family members without the knowledge of the police. “Post-mortem was conducted on the body of one of the victims. The report is awaited. It seems that the victim had consumed spurious liquor and fallen ill on Monday,” the SSP added. DSP (west) Abhishek Anand said those who died on Tuesday were identified as Sumit Kumar alias Gopi Patel (25) of Sirisiya village, Ashok Rai (50) of Bariyarpur village and Rambabu Rai (67) of Kaparpuri village, all under the Kanti police station area. “One Dilip Rai (53) of Bariyarpur is undergoing treatment at a private hospital,” he added. “Rambabu had died in course of treatment at the hospital. He had lost his vision and was also suffering from stomach ache,” he said. The DSP added Sumit and Ashok were also under treatment at a private hospital, but their family members took them home where they died on Tuesday morning. “Their bodies were cremated by the family members before the police could do anything. Only Rambabu’s body could be sent for post-mortem,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hooch-claims-3-lives-in-muzaffarpur-toll-59/articleshow/87613411.cms||---

Our teams are tracking down the accused peddlers as well as drug addicts,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner, adding that cops will contact them to gather more details about the illicit network. “We will find out their current occupation and also check if they still are associated with contraband trading. We will scan their mobile phone call records and keep an eye on their routine. The larger idea is to send a message across to the suspected gangs that we are keeping an eye on their activities,” Singh told TOI. The teams formed to bust drug gangs are also identifying hotspots where contraband are sold in the city. Areas around schools and colleges are being strictly monitored. “We have also formed committees in every police station that would include an ACP, school teacher and social worker who would counsel addicts, help trace peddlers and also spread awareness about drug addiction problems,” Singh added. Cops said that if they come across any young addict, they will treat them as victims and not as accused. Efforts will be made to counsel and get them into de-addiction programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/busted-peddlers-addicts-of-last-20-yrs-under-cops-radar/articleshow/87613002.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Hyderabad||Kishan ploughsinto paddy war,slams CM KCR||Hyderabad: The war of words between the ruling TRS and the BJP escalated on Tuesday with Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy criticising the TRS government for giving exaggerated indents to the Centre for paddy procurement after agreeing to a limited quantity. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, the minister slammed chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for claiming that the Centre was defrauding Telangana’s farmers. “A few months ago, Telangana agreed at a meeting of all states that 40 lakh metric tonnes can be procured from the state. Within a few months, they sent an indent saying there is an expected paddy yield of 108 lakh MTs,” he said. The state government said their survey was based on simple observations by looking at the paddy farms. “There is no scientific basis to this. The state government does not have a proper idea of paddy produce and procurement,” he said. Condemning KCR’s comments that the Centre was refusing to buy paddy from farmers, he said: “We informed the state that only raw rice will be taken not parboiled rice as consumption within the state and other states like Kerala has come down. We have been paying for paddy procurement. The CM is trying to create unnecessary confusion.” Kishan Reddy said the Centre had procured 600 lakh MTs of rice from various states in 2021, including 94.54 lakh MTs from Telangana. “In 2014, the Centre procured 43 lakh MTs of rice from Telangana. The Centre’s expenditure has increased from Rs 3,404 crore in 2014 to Rs 26,640 crore in 2021 for paddy procurement in the state,” he explained. Taking strong objection to CM’s remarks, he said: “These comments were inciteful and abusive. He has no right to complain about other people’s language. He cannot get away using such terminology. I am very circumspect in my criticism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kishan-ploughsinto-paddy-warslams-cm-kcr/articleshow/87614350.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Dehradun||Education dept scraps proposed fee act||Dehradun: The state education department has scrapped the proposed fee act, succumbing to the pressure put by private schools' lobby. Several parents' associations in Uttarakhand have been demanding a law to check overcharging by private schools. The education department is now planning to come up with a state school standards authority (SSSA) to regulate all private schools. The formation of an authoritative body has been suggested in the NEP (National Education Policy) 2020 as well. Officials have been given instructions to prepare a primary draft in this regard, which will be tabled in the upcoming state cabinet meeting. The department’s move has drawn criticism from various quarters since state education minister, Arvind Pandey, had been giving assurances for the past few years that the act will “come up soon” but now, all of a sudden, it has scrapped it. The proposed SSSA will fix accountability and monitor the quality of education as well. It will not only control the fee charged by private schools but will also ensure that staff members are paid above the minimum salary level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/education-dept-scraps-proposed-fee-act/articleshow/87613611.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to flag off Kanpur Metro trial run today||KANPUR: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will flag off the trial run of Kanpur Metro on Wednesday. The event, which was scheduled for mid-November, has been advanced following completion of the related work after a hectic and non-stop schedule skipping even the Diwali holiday.  The project was started on November 15, 2019, and the trial is being done after almost two years. Officials said if everything goes as per plan, the Metro services would be rolled out for the public by December 31 with a state-of-the-art transport infrastructure. Officials said that the CM will press the button to begin the trials of the Metro train. Two sets of trains are already available for carrying out the trials. However, only one would be used for the purpose. The trials would be carried out under the strict supervision of RDSO and would go on for six weeks before Metro services are rolled out commercially. The Metro services will not only help in establishing seamless connectivity, but will also ease vehicular congestion across the city and give a major boost to the development of the region. In addition, the Metro services will aid in improving civic facilities and will end the day-to-day commuting woes of the common people. During the trial run, the CM will also inspect the Metro and the facilities available in the coaches as well as the arrangements at the platforms. As per plan, on becoming fully operational, six Metro trains will run on the Priority Corridor between IIT and Motijheel and two trains will remain parked in the depot as reserve. Six more trains will arrive in the city by the time the commercial operations are launched. Each train has three coaches with a total capacity of 974 passengers. In the first phase, the Metro train will run on the nine-kilometre elevated track named Priority Corridor. On the nine kilometre stretch, nine stations have been constructed. The work on the second leg of the first corridor of Kanpur Metro has also commenced at Naveen market where the process is on to construct the underground station. The work on the second leg of the first corridor will be done between Motijheel and Transport Nagar. The second corridor, work on which would be done in future, would run between CSA University and Naubasta. The construction work of the project was initiated by the Yogi-led government on November 15, 2019. In a record itself, despite the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns, the project has been completed in less than two years, officials said. Kanpur Metro is special in many ways. It will be equipped with regenerative braking technology which will save upto 35% energy. That is, if 1,000 units of electricity are spent in train operation, through regenerative braking the trains will generate about 350 units again to be reused. The elevators installed in the stations and depots will also be able to save energy by regenerative braking technology. These will have an energy efficiency of up to 37%. For conservation of energy and electricity, the Metro premises have also been equipped with LED lights. Furthermore, a plan has been formulated to install solar panels at Metro depots and stations. For the first time in India, Kanpur Metro will come with a ‘Third Rail DC Traction System’. Special inverter, which will enable the energy generated by the brakes in the train to be used back in the system. As of now, no such arrangement has been implemented in any metro rail project in the country. The train is also special in terms of protecting the environment and for safety management, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-yogi-to-flag-off-metro-trial-run-today-services-likely-to-be-rolled-out-by-dec-31/articleshow/87615196.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

That worked. As the video went viral, police swung into action and filed a case of gangrape against inspector Ramvir Singh Yadav and his friend Vinod Singh Yadav. Two more men were charged under various sections of the IPC. By evening the cop had been handed his suspension order. Superintendent of police (Rampur) Ankit Mittal said, “Taking note of the viral video, the woman was called to give her statement. She has charged an inspector at Ganj Kotwali police station and his friend with gangrape and physical assault. Based on her complaint, an FIR has been registered against inspector Yadav, Vinod Singh Yadav, Manoj and Vijay under various sections of the IPC.” Additional superintendent of police, Rampur, Sansar Singh added, “An inquiry has been ordered by Sambhal police against the accused police officer, who has also been accused of destroying evidence.” Relieved at the police action, the woman said, “Ever since the incident, I have been running around to get justice. The men had even threatened to kill me but that did not stop me. I went to the National Commission for Women (NCW) too.” She alleged that the accused barged into the private hospital where she worked on April 5 this year and gang-raped her over a property dispute. She also said the district administration did not act on her complaint despite several reminders. "Making the video threatening to kill myself in front of the CM was the last resort," she said. One of the accused, Vinod Singh Yadav, refuted the woman's charges and said she was making things up. "She has a criminal background," he said. “The woman runs an illegal hospital in Rampur. I had purchased a property from her and paid her Rs 50 lakh. But when the time came to vacate the place, she refused and framed me and the inspector in a false rape case."

---||Delhi||AQI touches 'severe mark', Delhi in a haze as relief disappears into thick air||NEW DELHI: After a blink-of-an-eye respite on Monday, the city’s air degraded once again to fall in the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reading 404. Weather officials said the air pollution level was likely to fluctuate in this manner between the higher end of ‘very poor’ category and ‘severe’ category for the next few days due to calm wind conditions in the evenings and nights and the high impact of stubble burning. Experts said that due to the calmer winds at night, the locally sourced pollutants accumulate and cause air quality to deteriorate. Though the emissions from stubble burning as a constituent in Delhi’s PM2.5 reduced from 30% on Monday to 27% on Tuesday, forecasting body System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research categorised the share as “high” and the impact as “significant”. Explaining the reason behind the AQI touching the ‘severe’ mark, Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “The wind speed picks up during the day but drops to nil at night. The rate of dispersal of pollutants is slow and accumulation of pollutants is increasing during the night hours.” Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been tweeting about Delhi’s air quality every day, posted on Tuesday, “On November 9, AQI 404 (401 to 500 —Severe), PM10 - 414 (351 to 430 — Very Poor) PM2.5 - 265 (Above 250 — Severe).” Tuesday was the fourth ‘severe’ day of the month. Before November, there were six severe air in January this year. Track the pollution level in your cityR K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, confirmed, “The wind speed was almost the same as Monday with a speed of 8-10 kmph between 8am and 4.30pm, but there was calm wind in the evening and at night.” He said that for the past three days, the visibility during the morning hours had dropped to 800-1,000 metres improving to 1,200 to 1,800 metres during daytime. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, reiterated, “The AQI is likely to fluctuate between the upper-end of ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ category for the next few days.” In its bulletin on Tuesday, SAFAR said, “Winds coming from the northwest at 925 millibars have slowed down but are still favourable for transport of stubble pollutants to Delhi. However, its impact on Delhi’s PM2.5 is gradually reducing. Today’s share in the PM2.5 pollutants was 27%. The AQI is likely to improve but remain in ‘very poor’ category due to partially cloudy conditions and shallow mixing layer height.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-in-a-haze-as-relief-disappears-into-thick-air/articleshow/87614356.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Dehradun||Brown-headed gulls, Siberian seabirds flock to Terai region for winter sojourn||Rudrapur: It was a chirpy morning at Terai as flocks of migratory birds, including brown-headed gulls and Siberian seabirds, flew down to the region with the advent of the winter season. Every year, between November and January, birds from Siberia, Russia, and other cold regions migrate to South Asia in search of food. These winged guests flock to the areas like Gularbhoj, Khatima, Nanakmatta and Bazpur. It’s a special delight for nature enthusiasts and tourists, who have started gathering at the barrage on the Sharda river, located on the Indo-Nepal border in the Terai region of Uttarakhand, to enjoy the sight of the migratory guests, who fly across thousands of miles to escape the unbearable cold of their natural habitats. "The birds that migrate include 15-20 different species. The two main species are bar-headed geese and Brahminy duck (ruddy shelduck). Other than that, pochard and teals, too, come here. Local species of birds like cormorant are also spotted here," said Pran Chaddha, an avid bird watcher. Every year, between October and November, one can witness movement of birds in large numbers, signifying the start of migration. It is the annual dispersal of birds from the northern hemisphere to the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka. Exotic birds such as mallards, greylag geese, gadwalls, teals, shovelers, pochards and coots make their temporary nests in various transit stays in the region of Terai. The birds attract a lot of tourists to these places. "Ruddy shelduck is one of the common birds that migrates here from high-altitude areas like Kazakhstan and Siberia because the environment here is conducive for it to breed," said ornithologist Ajay Narayan Singh. “We have to conserve our wetlands to ensure that the birds get enough food” said environmentalist Rajiv Nayan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/brown-headed-gulls-siberian-seabirds-flock-to-terai-region-for-winter-sojourn/articleshow/87613660.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Delhi||Rs 200 crore extortion: Delhi police arrests five prison officials||NEW DELHI: The Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police has arrested five prison officials after investigations into the case of extortion of Rs 200 crore from a business family by conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar. The accused have been taken on remand for interrogation. Two of the arrested officials — Sunil Kumar and Surinder Chandra Bora —hold the rank of superintendents, while Mahender and Laxmi Dutt are deputy superintendents and the fifth, Prakash Chand, is an assistant superintendent. All were posted in Rohini jail. Cops say that Chandrasekhar distributed around Rs 20 crore of the extorted money among the jail officials as gratification for acts such as allowing him the use of smartphones illegally in jail. With two earlier arrests in the case, the number of arrested jail staff has risen to seven. According to police, Chandrasekhar was running an organised syndicate from behind the bars in connivance with these officials. "They were actively involved in dealing with the main accused, Sukesh Chandrasekhar, who was earlier arrested in the case pertaining to extortion and cheating of Aditi Singh w/o Sukhvinder Singh of Religare Finance,” said an EOW official. The cops had recently filed a chargesheet under MCOCA and invoked other laws too against the extortioner, his girlfriend, Leena Maria Paul, and 11 other people. On August 10, TOI had published details about the biggest-ever extortion case reported in Delhi in terms of the amount involved and Chandrasekhar's arrest in the case. TOI was also the first to report that the Enforcement Directorate had started a parallel probe in the case. Chandrasekhar and Paul were arrested by ED as well and on August 23, the directorate seized 16 high-end cars, a luxurious beachfront bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and 2kg of gold belonging to the couple. Chandrasekhar was the first to be arrested from Rohini jail along with two associates, Deepak and Pradeep. EOW then arrested Komal Poddar, a manager at the Connaught Place branch of RBL Bank, and two of his associates, Jitender and Avinash, on charges of allegedly facilitating and laundering money for the conman. Soon after, two jail officials and hawala dealer Avtar Singh alias Dolly Kochar were also arrested by EOW. These people were accused of laundering money for Chandrasekhar for a 7% commission. The money was allegedly laundered in cash and through shell companies in Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, apart from Hong Kong and other foreign locations. In July, Delhi Police’s Special Cell filed an FIR following a complaint by the wife of a billionaire businessman now in jail. Chandrasekhar used the "number spoofing" technology through an app called Crazy Call to impersonate high-ranking government officials. He would call his targets and strike deals while the victims would see the phone numbers of officials on their phone screens. In one of the last calls to a victim, he had impersonated the Union law secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-200cr-extortion-five-prison-officials-held/articleshow/87614361.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Previous govt used to withdraw cases against terrorists, we send them to their planet: Yogi||Bareilly: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday launched a frontal attack on the opposition Samajwadi Party for “withdrawing cases against the terrorists who attacked Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya” and stated that “the BJP sent them (terrorists) to their planets”. However, at the venue in Shahjahanpur city, Asha workers were allegedly thrashed and detained by police, preventing them from marching towards the rally venue to stage a protest against the Yogi government over the non-fulfilment of their longstanding demands. Several videos of the incident later went viral. “People have seen a new India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This new India retaliates if an enemy stares at us. This new India has respect and schemes for every citizen,” said Yogi, addressing three public rallies in Budaun and Shahjahanpur districts in the poll-bound UP. “Before 2017, it was impossible to celebrate any festival peacefully as riots would take place. The government would impose restrictions to curb celebrations, while people were scared of going to Ayodhya, but now every festival is celebrated peacefully. UP has not seen any riots in the past four and a half years, while several riots were reported immediately after the SP came to power in 2012,” said the CM. Addressing a public gathering in Budaun, the CM said the land in UP is extremely fertile and had the previous governments made sincere efforts, the farmers in the state would have been able to grow sufficient foodgrain to fulfil the requirement of the world. “Previous governments only exploited the farmers for their benefits,” he said. Accusing the SP of being indulged in several scandals during its regime, Yogi said: “The entire family used to make money from job aspirants who would never get a job as the court would stay the recruitment process after finding anomalies. The BJP has given jobs to 4.5 lakh youths since it came to power and never charged money.” Meanwhile, in Shahjahanpur city, Asha workers were detained near the rally venue when they were marching towards the venue to stage a protest against the government for “ignoring their demands for years”. Later, videos of women constables thrashing a few Asha workers went viral on social media. Police, however, claimed that it was a minor scuffle and no one was hurt. The Asha workers were released after the CM concluded his visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/previous-govt-used-to-withdraw-cases-against-terrorists-we-send-them-to-their-planet-yogi/articleshow/87613701.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

According to environmentalists, the Jakhan forest belt is one of the few green areas left in the city. “With development and expansion happening at a rapid pace, green belts are gradually vanishing. Jakhan forest is a beautiful patch but is slowly becoming a garbage dumping site. Locals have been dumping waste in the area for years now. We had raised the issue in 2018 and with the help of locals, and forest department, the green area was fenced,” said Naveen Kumar Sadana, senior manager, waste warrior society, an environmental NGO. When TOI visited the spot, a broken fence was seen. Officials allege that the local population is responsible for cutting the fence and dumping garbage in the area. Jakhan resident, Rahul Sharma, said as door-to-door garbage collection is not done on a regular basis, some people dump waste in the open. Environmentalists say despite repeated complaints, authorities have not taken any action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/a-green-belt-in-doon-scarred-by-waste-apathy/articleshow/87613704.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Chennai||Shortage of key device in Chennai affects accuracy of weather forecasts||CHENNAI: A low pressure may be moving towards Chennai but India Meteorological Department may not have adequate upper air data to forecast its movement with accuracy because it does not have enough stock of a telemetry instrument called GPS sonde or radiosonde, flown on a weather balloon to generate upper air data. Instead, IMD is relying on satellite data, which, when fed into weather models, generates forecasts with errors. An IMD official said they failed to forecast the circulation that brought heavy rain to the city last weekend due to lack of upper air observations. “These instruments can give you the circulation’s location and direction. Last weekend, we could have picked up the circulation, which came close, and forecast its movement if we had upper air data,” an IMD official said. “In Chennai, we have not generated upper air data using GPS sonde in the last six months because we do not have these instruments. Using satellite data alone is causing a lot of errors in our forecast.” IMD’s upper air instruments division-monitoring system webpage shows that the instrument was flown only in Mangaluru on Tuesday. GPS sonde-attached balloons are usually launched twice a day from Meenambakkam observatory. They ascend to 35km and drift around for 60km. The device, used widely in Europe and the US, reads and transmits data on pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction. This data, read with satellite inputs, is key to run weather forecast models to forecast upper air circulation, altitude of a trough and the movement of low pressure systems and cyclones. “Data from radiosonde is a major input for running numerical weather prediction models. Satellite data is only a backup and not the actual observation. Satellite data can be verified only with data generated from radiosonde,” former IMD deputy director general Y E A Raj said. “In case of a low pressure area, a satellite can identify it and show how much it has moved. But it cannot forecast.” M Ravichandran, secretary, ministry of earth sciences said there is a shortage of the instrument as imports were stopped due to the pandemic. “For southern regions, including Chennai, we have mobilised pilot balloons. These balloons can ascend to 12km, which is enough for a forecast, because there won’t be much change in the atmosphere beyond 12km. We also have satellite and radar data,” he said. “We have placed orders. We should get them by November-end.” However, officials said pilot balloons, flown using a lit candle, is an age-old method and is not reliable on cloudy or rainy days. IMD floated a tender to procure 34,400 GPS-based radiosondes. But it may take at least four months for delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/shortage-of-key-device-affects-accuracy-of-weather-forecasts/articleshow/87614398.cms||U Tejonmayam

The habit of my school days where I used to pen down my memories, eventually got lost in the race of life. Competitive studies, professional studies, job, marriage, kids, career all these steered the path of life, and my habit of writing took a back seat somehow. The new normal challenged me in bringing this writing skill from the deep shackles where I had laid it to rest. I started with writing on random topics based on my personal and work experiences and now intend to take it forward and, perhaps, write more professionally. I do have an avid habit of recollecting my childhood memories and narrating them as stories to my children during bedtime. The children thoroughly enjoy it. Every day, I keep jotting down key points and characters which I can include as my characters in the novel that I will eventually write. I really hope that my passion culminates into something substantial. Recently on my daughter’s advice, I have started writing down recipes that have been passed down from my grandmother. Hope this writing spree of mine will help my kids and future generations to appreciate life just as it has enabled me to reminisce about the happy moments in my life with pleasure and look forward with hope towards the future.

Justice Banerjee assumed charge as the CJ on January 4, 2021. The transfer order is dated September 16. “The Supreme Court collegium, in its meeting held on September 16, has recommended transfer of Justice Sanjib Banerjee, Chief Justice, Madras High Court, to Meghalaya High Court,” said a statement released by the collegium. The collegium has also recommended transfer of Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, a judge in the Allahabad high court, to the Madras high court. Justice Banerjee, who completed 60 years on November 2, has two more years of service. From the 75-judge chartered high court, Chief Justice Banerjee is moving to a high court which at present has two judges. In his short stint in the Madras high court, Banerjee had penned several significant rulings. In April 2021, the first bench headed by him lambasted the Election Commission of India (ECI) for failing to maintain Covid-19 protocols during the TN assembly poll campaign and said the “ECI should be put upon murder charges for being most irresponsible institution (sic)”. He had also warned of stalling the election if protocol was not followed. Though the ECI went to the Supreme Court to expunge the observations made by him, the apex court had refused to oblige. In July, the judge, while sitting at the Madurai bench of the court, chastised the state government for not booking anyone in connection with the Sterlite police firing incident in which 13 protesters were killed. “Can we kill people and throw money at them and say that our job is done?” his bench had asked. In July, the bench headed by Chief Justice Banerjee had dismissed a plea challenging the validity of a committee constituted by the Tamil Nadu government to study the impact of NEET on students from socially and economically backward classes. The bench had observed that “there is nothing to stop an elected government from studying the impact of NEET”. In September, a bench headed by Chief Justice Banerjee had stalled elections to Puducherry local bodies citing a “serious anomaly” in reserving seats for Scheduled Castes and women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/10-months-into-his-tenure-cj-of-madras-hc-shifted-to-meghalaya/articleshow/87614423.cms||---
---||Delhi||Wife of DU professor murdered in north Delhi||NEW DELHI: The wife of a Delhi University assistant professor was murdered in north Delhi’s Burari on Monday. The accused, who earlier lived on the top floor of the victim’s house and was her husband’s close friend, has been arrested. Around 7pm on Monday, while patrolling the 100 Feet Road in the area, constable Bhim found a nervous-looking person. When he asked him the reason, he claimed to have killed his sister-in-law. The man, Rakesh (31), was then taken by the constable to Burari police station. Rakesh said the woman was on the fourth floor of the building. When a police team reached there, they found a 32-year-old woman lying unconscious on her bed. She was rushed to a hospital where she was declared dead. Subsequently, Rakesh was arrested. The accused was a taxi driver. Three years ago, he met the woman’s husband and started considering him his brother. “The assistant professor gave Rakesh his car to drive and also gave him and his family a room to live on the top floor of his house. The accused did not take his salary each month and told the teacher to give him the entire amount whenever he needed it,” said an officer. On February 16, after the woman got married to the teacher, she asked her husband to remove Rakesh from the house and also from the job. An argument ensued between Rakesh and the woman on the issue, but he was sacked and also had to shift out of the house along with his family. She even refused to give Rakesh’s pending dues. “Due to this, Rakesh started planning to take revenge. On Monday, he came to know that the assistant professor was out with his mother. The woman and her 84-year-old father-in-law were in the house. The accused entered the house, strangulated her and also gave electric shock to her body to check whether she had died or not. As the woman’s father-in-law is hard of hearing, he didn’t realise what was happening in the house. Even when cops came to the house, he was motionless,” the officer added. Police said the electrocution part was yet to be verified and would be revealed after the autopsy report. However, sources said cops had found the wires through which Rakesh had given the woman electric shock. The woman’s family claimed that they had filed a complaint with police in August regarding a threat to their daughter from her husband, Rakesh and his wife. “The husband and wife had some issues. But we have till now only found the role of Rakesh in the crime,” said DCP (North) Sagar Singh Kalsi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wife-of-du-professor-murdered-in-n-delhi/articleshow/87614430.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Parties reach out to voters with events like Diwali milan, kojagiri||Nagpur: With civic polls early next year, political parties have already started reaching out to voters through religious and festival gatherings. Though the list of candidates is far from finalized, the festival season has provided the perfect platform for aspirants to communicate with the masses through Diwali milan, kojagiri, chhath puja, and haldi kumkum events. The ruling BJP is a pioneer in organising several such outreach programmes and has added chhath puja to connect with the masses since the last four to five years. “We have been organizing Diwali milan and kojagiri at the assembly level since the last few years. From last year, it was decided to hold such programmes at the ward level to reach out to the common public. These events are just occasions to communicate with the voters, listen to their grievances, and solve them at our level,” BJP state secretary and spokesperson Archana Dehankar says. Even the Congress has started following suit to connect with its vote bank and instructed its ward and booth heads to organize such events in their areas. “Our activists are regularly organizing such events in their areas for Diwali and kojagiri to bring people together and interact with them. We are doing this not only in wards where our corporators were elected, but also in other areas, to find out problems faced by people. We received several complaints from people in wards of BJP corporators, as they have miserably failed to fulfil their assurances,” Congress city president Vikas Thakre said. Taking a dig at the BJP, Thakre added the Congress leaders don’t have the habit of pasting their pictures on sweet boxes for publicity, but do their work silently. Guardian minister Nitin Raut recently met supporters at a popular Coffee House at Sadar and engaged in a conversation with them on the eve of Diwali. “It’s actually not directly connected with the polls, but I wanted to reach out to people as guardian minister and listen to their problems. Going there helped refresh some old memories, when we used to sit there regularly. Yesterday too, I visited homes of several party activists and interacted with their families to assure them of any help if required. Through such meetings, I am also trying to assess the post-Covid situation in the city,” he told TOI. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), one of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents, is also reaching out to voters, but its mode is slightly different. “We are focusing on health care and awareness camps for citizens on a regular basis. The activity increased in the post-Covid period. We have also organized camps for registration of poor labourers. So far, NCP has organized about 39-40 such camps in various areas. Communication is the key and by such activities, we get to know the voters’ perspective of their corporators and what they actually want as citizens,” city chief Duneshwar Pethe said. Young corporators like Sandip Gawai, who is also chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) water works committee, started such outreach events after he was elected. He feels such programmes are perfect platforms for understanding voters’ grievances and develop their confidence in elected representatives. “I had requested leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis to visit homes of voters in my ward. We visited them and distributed sweet boxes. They were very happy that a former chief minister came to meet them. Since the beginning, I have been organizing such social events in my ward like haldi kumkum. On Teachers’ Day, we felicitated over 200 teachers in my area. All this of course helps stay in touch with voters and they also feel assured that their elected leader is working for their welfare,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parties-reach-out-to-voters-with-events-like-diwali-milan-kojagiri/articleshow/87614442.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Allahabad||Harvest of Allahabadi Lal Surkha to be adversely affected this year again||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that Prayagraj and the neighbouring district of Kaushambi received heavy rainfall this rainy season, which extended till late October, the lovers of Allahabadi Surkha (red-coloured guava) and ‘Safeda’ may struggle to gorge on their favourite fruits yet again this year. For the past four years, the production of both the famous Allahabadi Guava has failed because of which both the Surkha and the Safeda were sold for a higher price. And even after paying a higher amount, Guava lovers have not been able to get the desired quality. According to experts, because of the heavy rainfall, guava trees of the famous ‘guava belt’ of the two districts have flowered quite early because of which the harvest is already available in the market. “Because of the rains stretching till late October, the trees have flowered early because of which there will be a dearth of quality variety of the fruits this year. The red colour, in the ‘Lal Surkha’ variety of the Guava would not be as impressive as it should have been”, said Horticulture, Experiment and Training Center (HETC) in charge, Khusro Bagh, Vijay Kishore Singh. He further explains, “It so happens that the trees should ideally start bearing flowers by late October and by mid-December the fruits start to ripe as owing to the intense fog and chilly winter, the fruit gets its red colour during mid-December to mid-January. Now, when the fruit is already ready to be harvested, Guava production is all set to be hit hard, both in terms of quality and quantity”, said an expert. He added that ideally, the farmers should check the flowering of the fruit during summers by using urea (in mid-May to June) and if the trees do not bear fruits in the rainy season, the winter crops would be healthy. However, the farmers of the district were blaming the government machinery for failing their crops yet again. “None of the government officials visited our fields or trained us as to what methods we should apply to save our crop or get healthy harvest because of which despite getting the GI tag several years back, we the farmers of world-famous ‘Lal Surkha’ and Safeda have not been able to reap the benefits”, said Indrajeet Singh Patel, leader of Allahabadi Surkha Welfare Association and a farmer from Bakrabad, Bamrauli. Because of the indifferent attitude of the experts, the Guava cultivators are thinking of leaving the traditional family business, he added. However, another Guava grower from Kanjia village of Kaudihar block of the trans-Ganga area, Kuldeep Singh said, “I had used urea in half of the trees of my 8-bigha of the orchard in May-June because of which this year the Guava crop of my orchard is very impressive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/harvest-of-allahabadi-lal-surkha-to-be-adversely-affected-this-year-again/articleshow/87615264.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 24 years on, 5 acquitted in Parel murder case||MUMBAI: Finding evidence shaky and witnesses untrustworthy in a night-time mob assault incident that occured during a power outage, the Bombay high court acquitted five residents of Parmanandwadi in Parel, South Mumbai in a 24-year-old murder case. In 1998, the Sessions court convicted and sentenced the five men to life imprisonment. The trial court committed a “grave error’’ as the judgment was “full of surmises and conjectures’’ said HC bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chauhan. Post conviction, in 2006, with HC nod, three defence witnesses were additionally examined, as in a separate trial two prior absconding co-accused were acquitted. Their evidence of the case being doubtful with no one to identify the assailants, the HC found more probable. All were on bail during appeal, one after spending 10 years in prison. The case registered by R A Kidwai Marg police station was that the accused, a chief promoter of a housing society, and his followers had as a mob fatally assaulted with chopper, hockey sticks and fists a man who, though not a member, used to attend meetings and oppose proposals made by the office-bearers. There were 500 hutments and it was a Slum Rehabilitation Authority scheme. The mob allegedly attacked the man at about 9.30 pm on July 14, 1997, with no streetlights on and hauled back the victim on the road when he tried to escape into a house. He was left bleeding, and when taken to the civic-run KEM hospital, declared dead on arrival. It was homicide, said the HC, citing a doctor who conducted the autopsy. There was a dispute between the chief promoter and slum society members over whether they would be allotted 180 sq ft or 225 sq ft. The HC said, “It is difficult to digest how there can be a motive for the accused to assault the man who wasn’t a society member.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-24-years-on-5-acquitted-in-parel-murder-case/articleshow/87615625.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar row: Centre wants baby dam strengthened, Kerala bats for new dam in apex court||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Close on the heels of the controversy over a tree-felling order at Mullaperiyar dam issued in favour of Tamil Nadu allegedly at the bureaucratic level and its subsequent freezing, the Centre has written to the state government requesting it to allow the necessary strengthening works of the baby dam and earthen dam as well as the approach ghat road at the reservoir as proposed by the neighbouring state. The letter written by Sanjay Awasthi, joint secretary, ministry of Jal Shakti, department of water resources, to additional chief secretary (water resources) T K Jose on November 8, highlighting the demands of Tamil Nadu, said the strengthening works would ensure that the safety of the dam "is not compromised in any way". The state government, meanwhile, reiterated its stand by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court that "no amount of rejuvenation" can perpetuate the 126-year-old "deteriorated" Mullaperiyar dam and there is a limit to the number of years one can keep dams in service through maintenance and strengthening measures. The affidavit said the only permanent solution for removing the "eternal threat" to the dam and for protecting the safety of lakhs of people living downstream is to build a new dam in the downstream reaches of the existing one. It also sought fixing the maximum water level in the reservoir at 140ft till November 30 based on the rule curve proposed by Kerala, in view of the northeast monsoon extending up to December. The letter from the joint secretary referred to the recent supervisory committee meeting to address the emergent issues at the dam and said the reservoir water levels were being monitored on an hourly basis. "Request the government of Kerala to allow the necessary strengthening works of the dam (baby dam and earthen dam) as well as repair works to the approach ghat road, as proposed by the government of Tamil Nadu," it said. The controversial decision allowing Tamil Nadu to cut 15 trees at the dam was reportedly taken at an officiallevel meeting on November 1 and communicated to the Tamil Nadu government on November 5. An apex court bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar had on October 28 said Tamil Nadu and Kerala would abide by dam water level notified by the expert committee, as per which it will be maintained at 139.5ft till November 10. It had posted the matter for hearing on November 11 to enable Kerala to file a better affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-wants-baby-dam-strengthened-kerala-bats-for-new-dam-in-apex-court/articleshow/87614432.cms||---

In the last two seasons, tourism had suffered due to lockdown. Now, almost all the tourist destinations and hotels are brimming with people. Most of the tourists here are from Gujarat as business activities in the neighbouring state literally come to a standstill for five days until Labh Panchmi and Udaipur becomes a preferred destination. The tourist inflow to Udaipur this year during the season is unprecedented, said Shikha Saxena, deputy director, tourism. The rush of visitors seems more of a stress relieving exercise after Covid. There is a positive and encouraging effect on every sector associated with tourism in and around the city. Those associated with the industry are ecstatic as every sector has benefited and they have been able to recover the losses incurred in the last two years. Along with the tourists from Gujarat, tourists from Delhi made Udaipur their preferred destination this Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/post-diwali-tourism-at-peak-in-udaipur-guj-travellers-top-list/articleshow/87615266.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Green activists concerned over levelling of land at Pushkar fair||Jaipur: Environmentalists in Ajmer have raised alarm over levelling of land by local authorities at the new Mela Ground in Pushkar. The new land with sand dunes and thin vegetation cover on the outskirts of Pushkar is witnessing setting up of tents and removal of green cover for the cattle fair that began on Monday. Pushkar cattle fair has been shifted from Purana Mela Ground to the new mela ground spread over 514 bighas in a government land due to encroachment in the former. Since the matter is pending in court, the local administration was forced to shift the ground. “Horse traders from Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and from different parts of Rajasthan started levelling the land for the past one week under the nose of the administration. They have cleared the long patch with JCB machines damaging sand dunes and vegetation including khejri and babool trees. It is unfortunate that these private influential players are damaging the local ecosystem for their gains,” said Ajay Rawat, a renowned sand artist at Pushkar. Notably, the forest and soil conservation department along with Central Arid Zone Research Institute, under the GAP scheme, has carried out major plantation drives in past 30 years. The idea was to stop erosion of soil in order to save Pushkar lake and Aravali hills, along with the holy city.

---||Dehradun||IFS officer Chaturvedi refuses to probe illegal constructions in Corbett||Dehradun: Days after IFS officer and Magsaysay award recipient Sanjeev Chaturvedi was directed to probe the matter of illegal constructions and tree felling in Corbett Tiger Reserve, the officer refused to conduct an inquiry citing lack of decisiveness among senior officials. Meanwhile, another IFS officer BK Gangtey, who was also asked to probe the same matter by another authority, also raised objections to his appointment as inquiry officer. After both the officers have expressed their inability to proceed with investigation, TOI has learnt that a vigilance inquiry has been ordered by the state government on Tuesday evening, as the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had earlier recommended it. Chaturvedi, in a communication, said senior officials of the forest department and the secretariat had been approaching him ‘personally’ and making comments in public domain about the ‘legality’ of the probe. According to him, such actions have hit the ‘sanctity’ of the inquiry even before he could proceed with it. Chaturvedi was asked to probe the matter on November 2 by the head of forest force (HoFF) Rajiv Bhartari after the Nainital high court took suo motu cognizance of a TOI report which highlighted that the NTCA has confirmed ‘illegal construction and tree felling’ at Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division of Corbett, where PM Narendra Modi’s ambitious Pakhro Tiger Safari and forest rest houses are located. In a letter to Bhartari, Chaturvedi stated: “In my career, I have conducted probes into hundreds of corruption cases -- in which the top leaders of parties in power and senior bureaucrats were accused -- and have earned appreciation from institutions such as CBI, CVC and parliamentary panels. But never an environment of ‘fear, desperation, confusion and apprehension’ reflected in any of the past inquiries as much as in this one, just by my appointment as the inquiry officer.” Chaturvedi also asked senior officials to direct him to conduct the inquiry only after ‘clarity and surety’ among themselves first and when there is a ‘genuine intent’ to punish the wrongdoers. Bhartari had chosen Chaturvedi after the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee wrote to Uttarkahand’s chief secretary SS Sandhu, secretary of MoEF&CC (Rameshwar P Gupta) and the HoFF of Uttarakand forest department to find out the details of the matter and sought a reply. But when the NTCA and the Nainital high court also directed a probe into the matter, Uttarakhand chief wildlife warden JS Suhag -- who has the regulatory authority as per the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 – directed IFS officer BK Gangtey to lead the investigation. Responding to TOI through SMS, Gangtey said, “Today (Tuesday) I am sending my objections over my appointment as the inquiry officer.” He, however, refused to divulge further details. TOI had on November 9 reported that the forest authorities carried out construction activities at the Pakhro Tiger Safari site four forest rest houses using concrete, instead of eco-friendly material such as bamboo, in violation of the sanctions given by the NTCA, Central Zoo Authority and the Forest Conservation Division of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). Besides, concrete was used to construct several buildings in the four forest rest houses around Pakhro Safari in Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division of Corbett and Lansdowne forest division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ifs-officer-chaturvedi-refuses-to-probe-illegal-constructions-in-corbett/articleshow/87613768.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Mercury drops, Shivajinagar coldest in Maharashtra at 12.7°C||PUNE: Shivajinagar was the coldest place in Maharashtra on Tuesday at 12.7°C — three notches below the normal minimum temperature. Popular hill station Mahabaleshwar at 14.1°C was even warmer than the city. The minimum temperature in Lohagaon was 12.7°C, a degree below normal. Jalgaon in north Maharashtra and Gondia in Vidarbha recorded the minimum temperature of 13°C each. In the Marathwada region, Aurangabad was the coldest place at 13.6°C, while Nashik in Madhya Maharashtra, which also includes Pune, recorded a minimum temperature of 13.4°C. “Night temperatures across Maharashtra dropped from Monday under the influence of the northerly wind entering the state. The night temperatures will remain below the normal level by one or two degrees till November 13,” said a senior official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune. From November 14, the night temperature of the city was expected to rise by 1-2°C, with partly cloudy conditions in the evening hours, said the official. “A weather system is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal from November 13. Under its influence, the southeasterly wind will bring moisture over the state. It will ultimately result in the formation of cloudy conditions. There is also a chance of light rainfall in some parts of the state on November 15. The night temperatures are likely to increase from November 14 due to these conditions,” the official said. The city’s winter season usually prevails between November and January. The night temperature remains in the range of 10-15°C. The city had experienced warmer nights because of the light rainfall in the evening hours last week. A Met official said, “We have noticed variations in the minimum temperatures in the Chinchwad and Magarpatta weather stations.” Another IMD official said, “The minimum temperatures were recorded in the range of 16-19°C. We do not know the exact reason behind the variations in the temperature at these stations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mercury-drops-shivajinagar-coldest-in-state-at-12-7c/articleshow/87613781.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Crime branch accuses ED of sabotaging probe||MUMBAI: Amid the ongoing tussle between state and central agencies, the Mumbai crime branch told a magistrate’s court on Tuesday that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is trying to sabotage its investigations by seeking permission to record the statement of dismissed cop Sachin Waze while he is in their custody. Metropolitan Magistrate SB Bhajipale rejected the ED’s application. The ED is probing a money laundering case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh who had allegedly asked Waze to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants every month. ED has arrested Deshmukh and claims to have found a money trail in which Rs 4.2 crore was routed through hawala operators and transferred to the former minister's trust in Nagpur. It was former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter to the CM which triggered the probe. Now, the crime branch claims Waze had confessed that Singh asked him to collect Rs 2 crore. This admission came following a probe into a complaint lodged by businessman Bimal Agarwal. As part of the probe, the crime branch obtained custody of Waze while Singh was named as a co-accused. The state argued on Tuesday that Waze is a “puppet” in ED’s hands. “Why has ED jumped into the picture now? They could have taken his custody when he was in jail. They want to sabotage our investigations by asking Waze to take names,” Shekar Jagtap, special public prosecutor, told the court. “The recording of statements by ED of Waze can impede the process of investigation by the crime branch. ED's application is not maintainable and bad in law...particularly because the accused, Waze, may not cooperate after interference of ED,” says the crime branch's reply to the court. It said the ED recorded Waze's statement in Taloja jail while he was in judicial custody. ED is operating under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act but it doesn't have scope to interfere in another investigating agency's probe, said the crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crime-branch-accuses-ed-of-sabotaging-probe/articleshow/87614447.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: Accounts manager held for duping his firm of Rs 13.6 crore||NEW DELHI: An accounts manager at a private firm has been arrested for allegedly duping his employer of a staggering Rs 13.6 crore, police said on Tuesday. The accused used fictitious firms and a forged resolution by the company board to carry out the fraud. According to officers of Economic Offences Wing, the accused has been identified as Shubham Saxena (33), a resident of Shrestha Vihar in Delhi. Saxena, cops said, had been siphoning off the company money since 2018. Police had filed an FIR in the matter on September 23, after receiving a complaint from the firm, Eldeco. The firm discovered the alleged fraud in August this year. During an internal inquiry, the firm found that he had diverted crores of rupees by opening fictitious account in the name of vendors having an uncanny similarity with the name of the actual vendor companies being dealt by Eldeco and its companies. “On receiving the complaint, preliminary inquiry was conducted and an amount of Rs 13.65 crore was found diverted from the bank account of complainant/ employer company M/s Eldeco SIDCUL Infrastructure,” additional commissioner (EOW) RK Singh said. During investigation, documents from the company as well as from the banks were seized. The investigation also revealed that maximum fund was transferred through internet banking, for which mobile number and email id of Saxena was registered. The internet banking facility got activated on the basis of a forged board resolution. The accused was absconding since registration of the FIR. A team led by DCP K Ramesh and ACP Virender Kadyan was formed to track him down. The team located him at Greater Noida using technical surveillance and arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/accounts-manager-held-for-duping-his-firm-of-rs-13-6-crore/articleshow/87614452.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi government sanctions Rs 220 crore for double-decker flyover||NEW DELHI: Delhi government approved the construction of a double-deck viaduct with a section of Delhi Metro’s upcoming Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor on the upper deck and a PWD flyover on the lower deck. The government’s Expenditure Finance Committee sanctioned Rs 220.1 crore for the project on Tuesday while also clearing Rs 230.6 crore for the construction of new building blocks in Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSUT). Public Works Department is working with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation on two double-decker viaducts in the city, which apart from a 1.4-km stretch on the Majlis Park-Maujpur section also includes a 2.5-km viaduct on the upcoming Tughlakabad–Aerocity corridor of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV project. The integrated structure on the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor will connect the proposed Yamuna Vihar and Bhajanpura metro stations. Delhi government said in a statement on Tuesday that the project was approved with the sanctioning of Rs 220.1 crore, and thanks to the joint effort of DMRC and PWD, this firstof-its-kind structure would result in a saving of around Rs 180 crore for the government. The expense committee took the decision in its meeting on Tuesday in the presence of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio. Sisodia said that the project would also save social cost in terms of inconvenience to the citizens, environmental effect, land and wastage of precious time. He said that the project would be a gamechanger in the development of Delhi and would save about Rs 140 crore in the construction of a separate flyover and Rs 40 crore in the construction of the metro viaduct. The deputy CM said that the double-deck viaduct would be 20 metres wide with the six-lane flyover covering the two busy crossings of Karawal Nagar and Ghonda Chowk. He said this project, which he claimed would be completed within two years, would be crucial in eliminating traffic issues at these spots even as it would increase the carrying capacity of the existing road. In the meeting on Tuesday, a project for the construction of a six-block building in NSUT worth Rs 230.6 crore was also approved. Sisodia said that the number of students in the university had increased threefold — from 2,000 in 2006-07 to 7,700 in the 2020-23 session. He said that the new building blocks would aid in creation of new facilities for the growing number of students. He said it was important to add new buildings to the university so it could meet the growing demand for skilled engineers and technologists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-sanctions-rs-220-cr-for-double-decker-flyover/articleshow/87614450.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur govt med college gets nod for PG courses||Kolhapur: The wait for MBBS graduates to get enrolled to various postgraduate medical courses at Kolhapur’s Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Medical College is finally over as the National Medical Commission (NMC) — the apex body governing medical education in country — has approved the starting of 10 PG medical courses with total intake capacity of 38 students. The medical college run by state government has 150 seats for MBBS, but it did not have permission to enrol graduate medical students for higher education. College authorities said the approval by the NMC is a milestone and it will help enrolment of resident doctors and help strengthen service provided to the patients. The medical college has Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital attached with it. Sangita Kumbhojkar, vice-dean of the medical college, said, “The inspections were done by a team deployed by the NMC earlier this year. We have all the required facilities — library, teaching hall, top doctors — to start PG courses. The MBBS graduates after completing their internship will be enrolled into these PG courses based on their ranks in all-India PG entrance exam. We will get top medical graduates available for the service of the patients. They will undergo on-job training for three years.” There is one government medical college in region’s every district — Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur. For Satara, the state government is preparing to start one medical college. At Solapur and Miraj medical colleges, PG courses are already being taught. Some of the private medical colleges in the region already have PG courses. The PG courses in government colleges are preferred by students due to the rigourous training they get and at the same time the fee is less in comparison to private medical colleges. Therefore, from next year onwards, most students will prefer to get their PG done from the medical college in Kolhapur. Kumbhojkar said approval to start PG course in anatomy, physiology and paediatrics is yet to get an approval. The courses that have been approved are medicine, general surgery, microbiology, ENT, gynecology and anaesthesiology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-govt-med-college-gets-nod-for-pg-courses/articleshow/87611945.cms||---

A single-judge Bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari has asked the petitioner to submit a counter affidavit by November 23. The next hearing of the case has been fixed for November 23. Swami Yatishwaranand was removed by the management committee in 2018. This was challenged by him in the high court, which did not rule in his favour. He was, afterward, reinstated by the deputy registrar of the cooperative society. The Mahasabha alleged that this was done by putting pressure on the registrar and therefore challenged the order in the HC, which put a stay on it. The court has initiated a contempt petition against the MLA for not following its previous order, for which the hearing is to be held on November 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-extends-stay-order-on-mahasabha-reinstatement-of-mla-yatishwaranand/articleshow/87613790.cms||---

Police have ruled out foul play saying that the boy could have fallen into a pit of biogas accidentally. “Upon questioning the family members and villagers, we came to know that the boy was playing in the open area of the house on Monday morning while his parents were inside the house. Around 9.30 am, they did not find him in the area. That is when they started searching for him. However, they could not find him,” said inspector Satish Hodgar of Manchar police. Initially on Monday, a section of villagers had feared that the boy may have been taken away by a leopard, prompting the forest officials to conduct an elaborate search. Hodgar said, “On Tuesday morning, the villagers again started a search during which they found a little opening to the pit of the biogas plant close to the boy’s house. When they opened the cover of the pit, they found the boy’s body afloat in the slurry. They immediately rushed him to the sub-district hospital, Manchar, where he was declared brought dead.” Hodgar said, “We have registered an accidental death case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/missing-boy-found-dead-in-biogas-slurry/articleshow/87613794.cms||---

Although the I&B ministry set up a Film Facilitation Office in Delhi in 2015 that helped 120 international filmmakers from 27 countries to shoot in India since its formation, I&B secretary Apurva Chandra pointed at that “only 70 domestic films” made it necessary for various states to ease shoots and clearances. Chandra said that the government would soon frame a ‘Draft Model Film Facilitation Policy’ — based on policies that 14 states have come up with — that all other states could adopt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-to-frame-policy-to-boost-film-tourism/articleshow/87615628.cms||Mohua Das
---||Delhi||Delhi high court takes strong note of ‘victimisation of trees’||NEW DELHI: Taking note of what it dubbed as “victimisation of trees” Delhi high court has demanded an explanation from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and the AAP government on why hundreds of trees had been concretised in south Delhi. The court was hearing a plea seeking preservation of trees and failure of agencies to comply with orders passed by courts and the National Green Tribunal against concretising of trees. The court was shocked by some of the photographs and noted that “right up to the tree trunk, nails had been embedded and metallic wires been strung along the trees.” Justice Najmi Waziri noted that this was “evident victimisation of the trees” and pointed out that SDMC, which maintains the streets inside residential colonies, would have noted it “but has, for reasons best known to it, allowed the callous affair to fester for years.” It further directed the deputy commissioner, SDMC, to file an affidavit explaining “how this unfortunate state has come about” and made it clear that the executive engineer and director (Horticulture) concerned would also fix responsibility and take remedial measures. The court made the tree officer of the area, deputed by the forest department, a party to the petition filed by environment activist Bhavreen Kandhari. She submitted that last year she even complained to the tree officer on victimisation of trees and illegal activities, where trees on the streets had been concretised. The court noted that “concretisation of the street is unmindful of the directions of this court and that of the NGT. It shows disregard of the law not only by the municipal corporation, but by the road maintaining agency – Public Works Department” and directed them to file an affidavit. The bench also asked the local SHO and the DCP to explain how the concretisation was allowed in the first place. The plea said instead of taking action against the offenders on the complaint filed to the tree officer, notice was issued to the Vasant Vihar Welfare Association, which was actually involved in preserving the trees in the said colony. After studying the efforts by the residents, including children and senior citizen, the court observed that “the efforts of the Residents’ Welfare Association for preserving the ecology of the area should be encouraged.” The court then posted the matter for next week when it would examine the stand of the agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-takes-strong-note-of-victimisation-of-trees/articleshow/87614479.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Chandigarh||RWAs bats for local candidates in MC polls||Rajinder.Nagarkoti1@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: With political parties initiating the process of finalising candidates for MC elections scheduled to be held in December, residents’ welfare bodies are demanding fielding of candidates local to wards instead of outsiders. In a recent governing body meeting of the RWA in Sector 44, it was decided that this time, a candidate from the sector would be supported. According to them, the ward was neglected in the past as the councillor was not from Sector 44. Davinder Singh, vice-president of Sector 44 RWA said that it was decided in the meeting that the candidate should be a resident of the same sector to ensure accessibility to residents. “It is suggested that this time, a senior and experienced person, who can look after MC affairs in a planned manner should be roped in,” said Davinder Singh. Society residents of sectors 48, 49, 50 and 51, under the banner of “Voice of Housing Societies (VOHS)” have also decided to field their own candidate. In a meeting of presidents, secretaries and other functionaries, it was decided to field social activist M N Shukla, a trained yoga teacher. Talking to TOI, Shukla said that issues of societies remain unaddressed and people have decided to field their own candidate. The VOHS, which was formed in 2019 to raise a voice against the regressive flat transfer policy of 2018, is a household name in sectors 48, 49, 50 and 51. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations, Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu has already said that capable and prominent RWA members will contest from their respective wards. In the coming days, they will finalise who will contest from which ward after consultation with other members, he clarified. Surinder Sharma, president, welfare society (Regd), Sector 15, has announced that he will contest the upcoming MC election as an independent candidate from ward no 12. (sectors 15, 16, 17 and 24). Punjab and Haryana High Court advocate Ashok Sharma Nabhewala, a resident of Sector 45 A, will contest from ward no 34 (sectors 45 and 46). In the recently held draw of lots for MC elections, which was held in the presence of representatives of political parties at the UT Guest House, ward nos. 7, 16, 19, 24, 26, 28 and 31 were reserved for SC candidates. Out of the seven wards, ward nos. 16, 19 and 28 were reserved for SC woman candidates. Out of 35 wards, ward nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 22 and 23 were reserved for woman (general) candidates. In comparison to last MC polls in 2016, the number of wards this time has increased from 26 to 35.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rwas-bats-for-local-candidates-in-mc-polls/articleshow/87613799.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Coimbatore||Govt wants more TN students to join armed forces||Coimbatore: If the efforts of the state school education department yield results, more students from Tamil Nadu would be joining the armed forces in the coming years. The department has asked district chief education officers (CEOs) to instruct schools in their respective districts to create awareness among parents and students of Class X to Class XII on job opportunities available in the Indian Navy and other defence services. The government is also likely to offer free coaching for rural students, on the lines of coaching for NEET, to crack the competitive defence examinations. In the October 28 communication sent to all chief education officers, the state government has sought suggestions on starting free coaching centres to train rural students to get employment in this unexplored area. The education department’s move comes after an Indian Navy officer serving in the Naval NCC urged the state government to offer training to rural Tamil medium students as they find it difficult to clear the Defence recruitment tests conducted in Hindi and English. Citing lucrative jobs opportunities in the armed forces, Captain D Senthil Kumar said that a basic training on going about the entrance tests will help students end up with a regular job. The Indian Navy has increased the annual intake of sailors, which is the entry-level position of soldiers, from 2,000 to 7,000. But less than 2% of candidates from Tamil Nadu are joining the Indian Navy. Even these candidates are from cities and there is a negligible contribution from the rural areas. “Most children in the higher secondary classes drop out in search of early employment over poverty. Since armed forces offer better prospects at an early age, by offering a push in terms of clearing defence recruitment test, the dropout rate can be brought down as students will be assured of jobs,” said Coimbatore district chief education officer N Geetha. A Surendren, Director, Defence academy Chennai, an institute to train aspirants to armed forces, said schools hardly educate children on the opportunities in the armed forces. Most of them come to know about the forces only in their colleges. However, armed forces recruit candidates soon after their Class XII even for officer cadres, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-wants-more-tn-students-to-join-armed-forces/articleshow/87614456.cms||Sampath Kumar

After the fire incident at Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, issue of fire safety at CPR Hospital has also come to fore. In September 2020, a fire had broken out at the trauma care unit of the hospital where critical Covid patients were admitted. While shifting the patients during the fire, three had died as per claims of the relatives. The claims, however, were denied by the administration. After the incident, fire safety audit was carried out at all 26 buildings on the premises of the hospital. The officials suggested over 200 changes and estimated an expense of Rs 8 crore to undertake the changes. The changes were infrastructural such as making ways for easy passage of patients and staff during fire-like disaster, changes in oxygen supply lines and electrical lines. However, due to lack of funds, no measures were adopted. Only minor changes were made such as putting up signs and displays with instructions to be followed after the fire incident. Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar, minister of state for health, said, “We have decided to grant Rs 1 crore immediately through the district planning council. The funds will be utilised to initiate fire safety-related works. The Rs 8 crore proposal is pending with the government and more funds will be sanctioned soon.” The main building of the hospital is a heritage structure and the rest of the buildings constructed later. The fire safety audit of other public hospitals too was carried out for which estimate of Rs 10 crore was made and the proposal of the same too is pending with the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cpr-hospital-to-get-rs-1cr-to-initiate-fire-safety-works/articleshow/87611952.cms||---

CCTV cameras that were that were installed near Vashi village to monitor debris dumping at themangroves have been removed for the expansion of the highway. Not only can debris dumping mafia now dump trash there without fear, but environmentalists have also pointed out that this is an indication that the highway expansion has been encroaching into mangrove areas.  After three years of complaints by the NGO, NatConnect, the forest department had installed two cameras. Green groups said these were grossly inadequate to cover the long stretch of mangroves. The continuous highway expansion has now led to the uprooting of those cameras as well. Range forest officer (mangrove cell) D S Kukade said, “We had to remove the cameras since the PWD has necessary permission to expand the highway. The cameras came in the way of road work. Once the expansion work is over, we will reinstall the cameras. Meanwhile, we have decided to beef up the patrolling. We also plan to build a protection wall to preserve the mangrove cover here.” However, activists said a wall is not the answer, constant CCTV surveillance is.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-activists-irked-as-cctv-cams-are-uprooted-from-vashi-mangroves/articleshow/87615630.cms||---

It was an over three-degree drop from Monday, when the minimum temperature was 23.4 degrees. As per IMD’s weekly forecast, minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 21 degrees. Morning walkers said the chill was evident. “I felt a bit cold in the morning while I was on my walk, but then when I stepped out around noon, it was warm again. However it wasn’t uncomfortably hot like we had been feeling last month,” said Ghatkopar resident Manasi Shah. In comparison to Santacruz, IMD’s Colaba observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 23.5 degrees, which was 0.3 degrees below normal. IMD said the reason for the chill was: “North-easterly to easterly winds prevailing at the lower level over the region.” Last November, the lowest minimum temperature recorded was 19.2 degrees (November 10). The record minimum for November was 13.3 degrees over 70 years ago (November 19, 1950). In the last decade the lowest November temperature was 14.6 degrees in 2012.

District collector Manisha Khatri has ordered the special Covid-19 vaccination drive that will continue till the end of this month. “There are an estimated 70,000 beneficiaries in the district whose second dose is overdue. We have prepared a village-wise list of such people who along with other beneficiaries would be vaccinated on a priority basis,” district health officer Dr Mahendra Chavan said. According to the data provided by the state health department, around 62% of the 5.45 lakh adult beneficiaries (45 years and above) have so far got their first dose and around 37% have been fully vaccinated. Similarly, of the 8.75 lakh beneficiaries in the age group between 18 and 44 years, around 43% have got their first dose and over 21% have got both the jabs. Khatri has appealed to the beneficiaries to take the Covid vaccine during this special drive that the administration has planned. She added that apart from the health department, other departments like revenue, police, NGOs and social organisations will be a part of the drive to increase district’s Covid vaccination coverage. According to district Covid vaccination nodal officer Dr N L Bawa, the health staff will visit every village in the district and inoculate the beneficiaries who are yet to get their first or second dose. “We will be making phone calls to all the beneficiaries, who are yet to get their second dose, to come forward to get inoculated in this special drive,” Bawa said. The district administration has also decided to organise Covid vaccination camps at banks, various institutes and even at market places to inoculate beneficiaries. “Moreover, health workers will travel over river Narmada in boat ambulances to reach villages that are located on the river banks to reach the beneficiaries,” health officials said. The administration has already started an awareness campaign in the entire district about the special vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-door-to-door-vaccine-drive-from-nov-10/articleshow/87611957.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||CBSE’s algorithm to identify board exam cheats||Nagpur: When CBSE’s Term-1 board exams for Std X and XII begin later this month, a new invisible ‘invigilator’ will be tracking all malpractices in both India and abroad. Innumerable lines of computer software programming codes will spur the algorithm in CBSE’s server to zero in on exam centres, and even students, who are likely to have indulged in malpractices. Though it sounds like out of a sci-fi movie, CBSE’s algorithm is a reality. A pilot project conducted in January this year during Central Teachers Eligibility Test (CTET) showed amazing results, following which the powerful algorithm will now be unleashed in full force this November. The central board’s information and technology (IT) director Antriksh Johri confirmed to TOI that the ‘invisible invigilator’ will be on duty during the November exam. “We generate huge amount of data and analysis of that gives us a wide range of information. Using data forensics, we are in a position to identify centres and even individual test-takers who may have indulged in malpractices. This will help to strengthen CBSE exam conducting environment and ensure that every student completes the exams in a fair manner,” said Johri. Considering that this November’s board exams will be held at home centres, the implementation of this algorithm becomes even more crucial. The algorithm is being seen as an additional layer of security for conduct of the exam. Johri said, “CBSE aims to identify examination centres where the data indicates the existence of malpractices during the conduct of examinations. Post this, appropriate measures can be taken by CBSE to strengthen the reliability of the examinations and to deter any such malpractices in the future.” Once the data starts coming in of ‘suspect’ exam centres, CBSE can move in to rectify the situation. “CBSE will use advanced data analytics to detect, respond and, in the long run, prevent any irregularities in academic testing across all major CBSE administered exams in the country,” said Johri. The pilot analysis for CTET examination data was in collaboration with Central Square Foundation (CSF) and Playpower Labs to develop algorithms. CBSE’s IT department has been leapfrogging in the use of technology in the sphere of payments to teachers (for exam work etc), to shifting all forms online (for students as well as teachers), to digitalizing the school affiliation process etc. Not only is the affiliation process online, it also uses artificial intelligence to speed up the bureaucratic paperwork for schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbses-algorithm-to-identify-board-exam-cheats/articleshow/87615279.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Covid-19 guidelines have played a dampener as permissions were not available for large gatherings. Chhath Puja events held at Fajalpur on Mahi banks and ponds in the city are a major attraction with residents from Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and parts of Odisha joining the rituals. The event at Fajalpur even hold concerts featuring Bhojpuri artists. In the city, the bigger events are held at Bapod and Kapurai. General secretary of Purvanchal Lokhit Mandal that holds the puja at Kamlanagar, Bapod and Padra said that the organisation had applied for permission several days back. “We were told only now that the event can be held only with 400 persons participating. We need at least 15 days for preparations and there was no way that we could be ready,” he said adding that only the event at Padra will be held. Hindi Vikas Manch (HVM), that organizes the biggest event at Fajalpur, has put up a banner at the venue stating the event was not being held as permission was not available. Organizers said that the city police was willing to give permission for 400 persons, but the expected crowd was much higher. Fajalpur area organizers are, however, peeved at the fact that other festivities and events were held in the city, but Chhath Puja was being restricted. “Lakhs thronged to Pavagdh during Navratri, garbas too were held across the city,” Jitendra Rai from HVM alleged. Rai said that he had come to know that the chief minister was going to attend Chhath Puja in Ahmedabad. He asked if only 400 persons would remain present for the event and there would be no violation. “Rules have to be the same everywhere and for all,” he said. Police commissioner Shamsher Singh said that the city police was willing to give permission for the event within permissible limits. Sources, however, said that some organisers had mentioned large numbers in their applications for permissions which the city police was not in a position to give.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-organized-mass-events-this-year-too-in-vadodara/articleshow/87613018.cms||---

As per senior office-bearers from BJP, the party may replace sitting MLC Girish Vyas with BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule. On other hand, the Congress has decided to fight the polls this year, unlike in December 2015 where it had withdrawn its candidate in an unofficial “mutual understanding pact” with the rival BJP. In return, the BJP had withdrawn its candidate Manoj Kotak against Congress’ Ashok alias Bhai Jagtap from Mumbai. Bawankule, the former energy minister denied receiving any such intimation from the BJP’s central leadership, terming it as speculation. “Today, only the election schedule is declared. It’s too early to say who will receive a ticket from the party. As far as I am concerned, I would follow whatever the party decides,” he told TOI. Even BJP city chief Pravin Datke endorsed Bawankule’s stand clarifying that the seniors in Delhi and Mumbai would finalise name of the candidate. “We are, however, confident of our win this time owing to our upper hand in the number of voters. BJP has 65 more number of voters than Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena together,” he said. Confirming that the Congress would fight the MLC polls from Nagpur, its city president Vikas Thakre and chief spokesperson Atul Londhe said, the party would jointly take on the BJP’s might under the umbrella of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which is already ruling the state under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Our high command in Delhi would finalise the candidate’s name although many are in the fray. But we will contest the polls with our full might like we did when former minister Rajendra Mulak was elected from the district before Vyas,” they told TOI. The ECI would be holding the polls for six MLC seats on December 10 from 8 am to 4 pm. In a statement released on Tuesday, the ECI said the election notification would be issued on November 16 while the deadline for filling up the forms would be November 23. These elections are held after every six years for local constituencies. This time however, the ECI has not announced the poll schedule for Solapur and Ahmednagar constituencies, even as terms of their respective MLCs are also expiring on January 1 next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ignored-for-mla-poll-ticket-bawankule-may-get-mlc-nod/articleshow/87614494.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||India||Over 50% of dental post-graduate seats still unfilled||NEW DELHI: With just a day to go for admissions to post-graduate seats in dental medicine and more than half the seats remaining unfilled, the association of private medical and dental colleges on Tuesday appealed to the Dental Council of India and the government to reduce the cut-off percentile so that more candidates could become eligible for admission. The colleges are also hoping that the November 10 deadline for admissions will be extended. Roughly 10-12% of dental post graduate (MDS) seats have been going vacant every year since 2018. In 2015, there were no takers for almost 44% of seats, but the vacancies have reduced since then. Of the 6,658 MDS seats for which NEET PG entrance was conducted, only 2,950 (44%) were filled as on November 8, pointed out a dental council member adding that colleges were hoping for a reduction in qualifying percentile as was done in earlier years. “This year, out of 27,580 candidates who took the entrance, going by the qualifying cut-off 16,300 qualified. That’s a ratio of barely 1.5 candidates per seat. However, according to the government’s 2017 gazette notification, if the number of qualifying candidates in the respective categories is less than three times the number of seats or vacancies, the cut-off percentile will be automatically lowered to ensure that the number of eligible candidates will be at least three times the number of seats in each category,” explained Dr Keshav Agrawal of the Association of Private Medical and Dental Colleges. Hence, the colleges are expecting a reduction in the qualifying percentile. Private dental colleges want NEET to be done away with as it is proving to be a barrier in filling seats despite lowering of cut-off, said a DCI member, adding that the council was not entirely happy about lowering standards. The member added that despite a freeze on opening any more private dental colleges, there are over 27,200 BDS seats and 6,658 MDS seats. Out of the total MDS seats, less than 900 are in government colleges. Out of 320 dental colleges, less than 60 are government ones. “There are way too many private dental colleges offering bachelor’s degree in dentistry (BDS) and MDS seats. This has led to a glut and most dentists have no job opportunities. The jobs they get mostly pay very poor salaries, Rs 15,000-20,000 per month. In fact, most BDS graduates prefer to do post-graduation in disciplines such as hospital administration or public health as these offer more job opportunities and better paid options than investing in a far more expensive post-graduate degree in dentistry,” explained a BDS graduate who did a post-graduation in public health after failing to get a decent paying job as a dentist. “The seats in non-clinical subjects such as public health dentistry, oral pathology and oral medicine are the ones that usually have no takers. We have proposed to the government to allow us to take BDS graduates to fill these seats so that there will not be a shortage of faculty in dental colleges in the future,” said Dr Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-50-of-dental-post-graduate-seats-still-unfilled/articleshow/87616208.cms||Rema Nagarajan

Statehood agitators getting a monthly pension of Rs 3,100 will get a monthly pension of Rs 4,500 now and those getting Rs 5,100 will get Rs 6,000. The CM also said the state will come with a sports policy. “To provide better opportunities to our youth, who have showcased their talent on national and international levels, the state will soon come up with its Sports Policy-2021,” he said. He said that sanitary pad vending machines would be made available at anganwadi centres and that staffers of the National Health Mission (NHM), for their “outstanding contribution during the pandemic phase”, will receive an one-time incentive of Rs 10,000. Under the Eja-Boi Shagun Yojana, a pregnant woman who stays for 48 hours in a government hospital would be provided Rs 2,000 for the safe health of mother and child. The CM also said that de-addiction centers will be set up in Dehradun and Haldwani and that State Institute of Urban Development will be established in Uttarakhand. The CM also said that a Foreign Employment Cell would be set to help the state’s youth find employment opportunities outside the country. To promote girls’ education, each district headquarter will have a women’s hostel. Besides, hostels for working women will also be constructed at district headquarters as per requirement. Dhami also announced that to help tourism get back on feet, Uttarakhand will be promoted as a wellness-tourism centre. “To increase the state’s economy through health and tourism, the state will be made a hub of AYUSH wellness. AYUSH wellness centers will be opened in the guest houses of Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) and Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN),” the CM added. Foundation Day was celebrated in other parts of the state as well. In Nainital, an event was organized on the DSA grounds, with divisional commissioner Sushil Kumar as the chief guest. Kumar, in his address, said that migration is a big problem for the state due to problems such as scarcity of water and lack of fertile land. He said the agriculture sector is being reformed so that migration can be stopped. He added that the government, with the help of the migration commission report, will take a call on how to best use financial resources to stop migration. Agitators who contributed to the state building also addressed the public. Activities such as a marathon, sailing regatta, kayaking race, and a boat race were organised. A Himalayan food festival was also arranged, which not only featured traditional dishes, but also innovative versions of them. Deputy inspector general of police Nilesh Anand Bharane, district magistrate Dheeraj Garbiyal, chief minister's representative for the programme Dinesh Arya, district panchayat president Bela Tolia, vice-president of the scheduled caste commission P C Gorkha, additional district magistrate Ashok Joshi, and senior superintendent of police Preeti Priyadarshini were present.

---||Pune||Commuters fleeced as MSRTC staffers’ strike enters 2nd day||Pune: Sanjib Das and his two friends were all set to make a trip to Baramati, around 100km from the city, to join as waiters at an eatery. But when they reached Swargate depot to catch a bus on Tuesday, they were in for a shock. “We weren’t aware about the strike. The bus fare to Baramati is some Rs150. With no buses around, an autorickshaw driver started continuously asking for Rs800 per person. We don’t have that kind of money. Only one of us could go for Rs650. We are now waiting in the hope that buses start plying again, or we will be forced to take a lift in some truck,” Das told TOI. As the strike called by Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation MSRTC employees entered its second day in Pune on Tuesday, there was heavy fleecing of hassled commuters by varied transporters. At Swargate depot, despite the presence of police, stranded travellers were asked for astronomical fares by small and big private buses, cabs and even autorickshaws waiting to cash in. A family of six headed to Nagpur sat hapless at the depot, a woman desperately calling relatives for help, while one of the men roamed around for help. “A family member passed away and we landed here from Pimple Saudagar this morning — only to find no buses. A private bus operator is asking for Rs1,200 per person. We have no choice,” one of them said. Yet another couple, in urgent need of reaching Kolhapur, paid Rs2,000 in total. “They are taking at least Rs600 extra per passenger. We had to borrow money from a relative. Why is no official looking into this looting?” they demanded. Revan Joshi, who went to Mumbai on urgent business on Tuesday morning, paid a private cabbie Rs1,300 one-way. “No one cares. Even private buses are asking as much as Rs1,200 per person,” he shared. Despite orders from the state government to help commuters by providing any means of transportation possible, no steps had been taken by officials in Pune until the afternoon hours. “We had a meeting on how to arrange things, but MSRTC should allow other buses to park in their depots. One Regional Transport Office (RTO) staffer will be placed at all the depots. An appeal has gone out to private bus associations to help,” Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane told TOI. He added that they will look into the fleecing without delay. Prasanna Patwardhan, president of the Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI), also said that he had written to all transporters requesting them not to overcharge commuters and ask for fares at par with the MSRTC on all routes. On Monday, the Bombay high court directed the state government has been directed to set up a committee to hear representatives of 28 unions that are staging a protest, demanding “merger of the state transport utility with the government”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/commuters-fleeced-as-msrtc-staffers-strike-enters-2nd-day/articleshow/87613810.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolhapur||Fadnavis demands police protection for Padalkar||Kolhapur: Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has sought police protection for BJP member of legislative council (MLC) Gopichand Padalkar after he was booked for attempt to murder by the Sangli police. Fadnavis said that Padalkar is unearthing the alleged scams of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and, therefore, is facing adversity. “I request chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to grant police protection to Padalkar. He is at the forefront of unearthing scams of the government, which is the job of every Opposition politician,” Fadnavis said while speaking at Pandharpur on Monday. “When I was the CM, I immediately granted police protection to NCP leader Jitendra Awhad when an attempt was made to attack him. I think, the same principle should apply in the case of Padalkar too,” he added. The political atmosphere is heating up in the Sangli district due to the election to district central cooperative bank. According to complainant Raju Jankar, who is an NCP worker, Padalkar and his driver had driven their vehicle over him. Padalkar, however, claimed that he was attacked. He said a mob was waiting at Atpadi town to attack him with sticks and stones. The BJP politician also alleged that several vehicles from the convoy have been badly damaged. On Monday, NCP state president Jayant Patil visited the hospital where Jankar is undergoing treatment. Patil later informed his family members that the police will take legal action against Padalkar and his supporters for causing grave injury to Jankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fadnavis-demands-police-protection-for-padalkar/articleshow/87611971.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maha commits to UN ‘Race to Resilience’ campaign at COP26||Nagpur: Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said in an interview with COP TV on Tuesday that Maharashtra has joined the UN ‘Race to Resilience’ campaign. It focuses on helping the most vulnerable, frontline communities to build resilience and adapt to the physical impacts of climate change — extreme heat, drought, flooding and sea-level rise, in urban, rural and coastal areas. Over the last year, the state government has incurred losses worth nearly Rs15,000 crore ($2 billion) which was paid as compensation for those impacted by extreme weather events. “Our goal is to keep Maharashtra within 1.5 degree Celsius target (limiting the earth’s warming) so as to safeguard millions of livelihoods that would be affected due to climate-related disasters. Maharashtra joining the movement will allow us to report and assess our emissions on a dynamic basis,” said Thackeray. He added Maharashtra is the “most industrialized state” in India and aims to be a leading example for regional governments, inspire climate action and sustainable development. Maharashtra has a three-pronged plan to tackle climate change. Through Majhi Vasundhara (My Earth), the state aims to build resilience and a culture of climate action at every level of the government. Started in 2020, the mission aims to achieve climate resilience in the state by bringing together local administrations, businesses, NGOs, and the citizens of all age groups to enable climate action amongst all stakeholders, states a release. Together, these elements address biodiversity, waste management, water conservation, renewable energy adoption, air quality monitoring, electric vehicle (EV) uptake, green building measures, energy conservation, and creating awareness among citizens. Majhi Vasundhara has saved 11,145 million litres of water in its first year of operation, which is equivalent to one day of water supply in the entire state. Majhi Vasundhara also aims to bring down CO2 emissions, take water conservation measures and use power-saving electrification steps. The Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (PoCRA for rural areas) is a project to enhance climate resilience and profitability of smallholder farms across Maharashtra. The project aims to support investments in farm, community, and post-harvest agriculture infrastructure and adopt climate-resilient technologies. Mangrove conservation is the third step. Last year, 9,800 hectares of mangrove forest has been classified as reserved forest providing them statutory protection by law, states the release. This work is undertaken by the mangrove cell set up by the state government with support from UN Development Programme and the Green Climate Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-commits-to-un-race-to-resilience-campaign-at-cop26/articleshow/87614555.cms||---

Officials said the special police would assist the city police in patrolling and vehicle checking. Coimbatore city has 15 police stations. Of them, Singanallur, Peelamedu and Saravanampatti police stations cover comparatively more area than other stations and many house break-ins were reported in these station limits in the past two months. “A company of special police personnel from the Kovaipudur battalion and another company from the Pochampalli battalion in Krishnagiri district are roped in for preventing crimes. The personnel from Pochampalli are staying in dormitories on the police recruitment school premises here. As of now, 10 special police personnel were allotted to Singanallur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti, Saibaba Colony and Rathinapuri police stations each,” a senior police officer said. Race Course, Kattoor, RS Puram, Big Bazaar, Variety Hall Road, Ramanathapuram, Selvapuram, Podanur and Kuniyamuthur police stations were allotted five special police personnel. Since the Ukkadam police station limits had not reported any major house break-ins, no additional manpower was provided to the station. “The special police personnel ware working on shift basis. They are assisting the city police during vehicle checks and beat patrol. After deploying them, the number of house break-ins reported in the city has come down considerably,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/spl-police-roped-in-to-curb-crime/articleshow/87614570.cms||A Subburaj

---||Lucknow||How Chhath moved from homes to ghats||Lucknow: Chhath Puja, which brings lakhs of devotees to the banks of the river Gomti, was predominantly a family affair for Lucknow residents till the 1980s. What was earlier limited to a small occasion in the bylanes of the city now attracts devotees from across Lucknow and adjoining districts to celebrate the festival in a befitting manner with all traditional rituals. The credit of bringing the puja to the ghats goes to city resident and president of Akhil Bharatiya Bhojpuri Samaj (ABBS) Prabhunath Rai, who started organising the puja at Laxman Mela Ground in 1985. Since then, due to rising population of Purvanchalis, the festival which is celebrated six days after Diwali has grown into a phenomenon. Not only devotees, but famous Bhojpuri celebrities also take centrestage and create a mini-Purvanchal in Lucknow. Rai recalls that when he shifted to Lucknow in the 1980s, the puja was limited to homes. “There was no Chhath or Bhojpuri community back then. People were hardly familiar with the festival and those who celebrated did so in their houses. Since my family used to celebrate the festival in a grand fashion at ghats in our village, we decided to begin the celebrations here too,” he said. With only four people—Rai, his sister-in-law and two friends—the first puja at the ghat began 36 years ago, along with ABBS. “We did not even have shops selling puja items. When we began holding mini-celebrations at the ghat, there was no help from civic bodies. Only a handful of volunteers helped us in arrangements. We used to clean the ghat ourselves and prepare ‘bedis’. Slowly, the festival gathered momentum and civic bodies started providing us what we needed. From a private affair, it grew into a public affair with artists from the Bhojpuri fraternity,” he added. “We have been working at Laxman Mela Ground for years and have our families with us. The city is now our home,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-chhath-moved-from-homes-to-ghats/articleshow/87615291.cms||---

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu passed the order on Tuesday, citing a Supreme Court order mandating provision of such ex gratia to Covid victims. ‘Order doesn’t prevent state from adding to Covid ex gratia’ The upshot of the discussion (in Reepak Kansal case by SC) is that a minimum of Rs 50,000 per person has to be paid as ex gratia out of the state disaster response fund. The directions are binding,” the bench said. Further, nothing in the order prevents any state government or the government of any union territory from paying any further amount, the court added. “The state reports that there have been more than 36,000 deaths thus far due to Covid-19. It is for the state to decide if any further amount is to be paid over and above the minimum amount of Rs 50,000 as indicated in the relevant Supreme Court order,” the judges said. The state should also put the machinery in place to deal with the grievances in terms of the Supreme Court order and ensure that there is quick disposal of matters at all levels, the court said. The bench then adjourned the hearing to November 19 for the state government to come up with its own guidelines or set of instructions for disbursement of the ex gratia. The court passed the interim order on a PIL moved by R Vijayagopal of Madurai seeking a direction to the authorities to provide financial assistance to the kin of Covid-19 victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pay-rs-50000-to-covid-victims-kin-orders-hc/articleshow/87614565.cms||Suresh Kumar

While PILs from 2009 and 2014 are still being heard in the in High Court, recently, individual plot owners filed cases against setting up of bars and commercial establishments. Illegal parking, rash driving, noise pollution, lack of fire safety are the prime concerns. Jubilee Hills Cooperative Housing Building Society president, Bollineni Ravindranath, said, “We have made several representations to the GHMC regarding proliferating shopping establishments, including pubs. Apart from blocking the road traffic, noise pollution is the biggest issue in the residential locality. Most of the vehicles are parked on the roads in front of these establishments as they don’t have parking.” Road numbers 36, 45 and 10 have over 15 pubs that are always buzzing with the activity. Advocate Pradyumna Kumar Reddy, a resident of Jubilee Hills, who filed a case in the High Court, said, “In Hyderabad, there are around 103 roads declared as commercial including Road No. 10. We don’t have issues when it is a commercial area. But amidst residential areas, coffee shops are being set up. How disturbing is it when a kitchen to serve 200 people is going to be set up right abetting your bedroom. The timings of pubs and bars on regular days is till midnight and at weekends it is extended to 1am.” Reddy said, “In 2009, the PIL was filed regarding residential and commercial zonal regulations. The order was not to convert residential to commercial. In 2014 PIL the order was to allow only for ayurvedic and laser treatment. The government has issued orders declaring Road No. 10 as commercial. Now, all pending PILs and my case were all clubbed together.” Reddy added, “GHMC recently issued orders that residential plots used for commercial purposes without permission can be regularised. As per new excise policy, there are no restrictions on bars, expect near temple and school.” Locals alleged that most establishments lack fire safety. In addition, drive-in restaurants cause massive inconvenience where there is spillage of cars as there is not enough space in the drive-ins. Residents of Road Number 44 also filed a complaint with GHMC Zonal office against setting up boutique. Jubilee Hills Inspector of Police S Rajashekar Reddy said, “In three years, we have booked around 60 cases against pubs for violations. Trade licences are given by GHMC and liqour licences by excise department. We were told traffic police NOC is not taken while granting licences though there is no parking space. We are keeping regular vigil to prevent law and order issues. The case is posted to November 15. We will be filing our reply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bar-peace-cant-coexist-say-jubilee-hills-residents/articleshow/87614499.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Under the scheme, a child who lost both his/ her parents to Covid-19 would be given Rs 2,500 each month till attaining the age of 25 years. This would significantly support their education and upbringing till they become mature and employable. The largest number of applications had come from North West district, followed by West. Out of 11,240 applications received, 8,047 were approved and 1,250 rejected. The others were pending at various stages. Most applications pertain to the one-time compensation. According to a report accessed by TOI, 18,912 cases were cleared for disbursal of the one-time ex gratia amount of Rs 50,000. The overall percentage of disposal in all districts was 89.2%. The highest percentage of disposal was in Shahdara (96.4%), followed by South (95%), North (94.6) and East (94.2). North district had disposed of only 70.4% applications. A revenue department official said all districts had been asked to attach importance to the scheme so that its benefits reached applicants as soon as possible. On October1, Kejriwal had expressed strong displeasure over the pendency of applications and directed officials to disburse the amount claimed by the families at the earliest. Within a month, things have improved significantly. Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said that the Kejriwal government was standing with people in distress. “We provide all kinds of assistance to eligible people, right from filing applications to getting the necessary documents. Some applications were rejected due to different reasons, like the deceased not being a resident of Delhi,” he added. After the devastating second Covid-19 wave, Delhi government launched the financial assistance scheme in July, which was aimed at helping people recover from the setback suffered due to deaths in the family. Many children were also orphaned. So far, over 25,000 deaths have been reported in Delhi since the pandemic broke out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-fast-tracks-relief-for-those-ravaged-by-pandemic/articleshow/87614580.cms||AlokKNMishra

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Monday night issued a notification under Break the Chain, making two vaccine doses mandatory for employees working at various establishments and all citizens visiting government offices. Besides, double vaccination was also made mandatory for citizens above 18 years of age travelling by Aapli Bus, autorickshaws or any other mode of public transport. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that many visitors who had not taken two vaccine shots were denied entry to NMC offices and premises. He said that the motive of the new diktat is to ensure all citizens are vaxxed. TOI on Tuesday visited many places, including markets, bus stops and even some government offices. However, at most places, including government offices, people were unaware of the new rule. Even NMC’s transport department was unaware of this new rule. “As we have not received any communication, the department could not alert any of the Aapli Bus operators,” said a senior official from the department. However, the Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) of NMC led by commandant Viresen Tambe was on its toes since morning. Tambe said he had received the notification on Monday itself and subsequently alerted all zonal teams of NDS. During a visit to the Cotton Market area in the morning, TOI spotted civic cops from Dhantoli zone making surprise visits to shops in the vicinity. At most places, the NDS team found shopkeepers had not displayed the double vaxxed certificates. Similar inspections were also made in other commercial areas including Sitabuldi, Jaripatka, Sadar, Kalamna, Dharampeth and Sakkardara, said Tambe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/double-vax-diktat-lax-implementation-on-day-1/articleshow/87615304.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Chhaya Bhoyar, who had mistaken a cop in plain clothes to be a customer, was arrested after she walked into a jewellery shop to steal valuables. She had hoodwinked sales girls at the same shop a couple of weeks back to steal valuables. Police have also arrested her husband Rakesh and seized valuables worth Rs 3.12 lakhs from them. She had stolen valuables from yet another jewellery shop in the vicinity last month. Bhoyar had returned to the same shop to try her luck. Tehsil police stations team under head constable Laxman Shende was already present at the same shop to collect descriptions of the woman thief who suddenly walked in front of them. “Seeing the woman thief again walking into the shop, the saleswomen and men raised an alarm. We immediately nabbed her,” said Shende who works under the supervision of senior inspector Baban Yedge and assistant PI Sandeep Bagul. The woman had befriended Rakesh who worked as a waiter at the same five-star hotel that Chhaya used to work in. They tied the knot and left the job. Police said that driven by need of money, the woman took to stealing. The city is witnessing a spurt in thefts by women gang operating at inter-district bus stops and also in autorickshaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-jewel-thief-returns-to-rob-same-shop-arrested/articleshow/87614583.cms||Soumitra Bose

After several complaints from banks that charged him with defrauding them to a tune of Rs 5,000 crore, the CBI began a probe. Now the ED has been issuing summons to Surendra and another director of the company to appear before it to explain charges of money laundering. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas informed the court that Surendra recently underwent valve replacement surgery and has sought interim protection from arrest. The judge asked Surendra to appear before the investigators when called and furnish all the relevant documents sought by them, while directing the ED not to take any coercive steps for the next two weeks and file a counter. ED counsel B Narasimha Sarma informed the court that Surendra has evaded three notices issued to him so far. The judge warned the petitioners the court will take a serious view of the matter if they fail to appear before ED. The case was adjourned to November 22. The banks in the past have declared the account of Coastal Projects as a fraud. But the company was allowed to contest the decision of the banks, the HC, however, gave free hand to CBI and ED to proceed against the promoters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/file-counter-in-coastal-projects-bank-fraud-case-hc-to-ed/articleshow/87614589.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University semester 1 PG classes likely from November end||LUCKNOW: If all goes well, Lucknow University (LU) will begin semester I classes of its 41 postgraduate (PG) courses by the month end. After the third round counselling for allotment of seats in various courses got over on Tuesday, candidates desirous for admission were directed to submit fees by November 11. It will take at least two weeks for all the formalities before classroom teaching can start. This year, the session of the first semester has been delayed by about five months. LU offers PG in about 41 subjects. Altogether, there are around 3,900 seats in these courses. The classes of semesters II-VI began in July as per the academic calendar. However, the admission process of PG semester I - which normally is completed by June end - got delayed this year because of the restrictions imposed during the second wave of the pandemic. The distribution of application forms began in August and entrance tests for various courses were held in the first two weeks of September. The plan was to begin semester I classes soon after Diwali, but since a number of seats in various PG courses remained vacant even after two rounds of counselling, the admission process took another week to complete. Now, candidates who have been allotted seats will have to report with original documents for verification, which is expected to consume one more week. Thereafter, classes are expected to start. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava claimed, “Varsity has almost finished with the PG admission and the classes of first semester will begin shortly.” Explaining why seats in some courses remained vacant, a senior faculty member said that although sessions of all universities and colleges have been delayed due to the pandemic, the admission process has stretched longer. As a result, many candidates took admissions in other institutes fearing that if they fail to get into LU, their entire year will go waste, he added. Meanwhile, the delay in the start of classes has left candidates, who had opted for seats in the first round, apprehensive about their future. “Six months delay will impact our future studies and career because we won’t be eligible for competitive examinations conducted by various agencies that follow July-June the academic calendar,” said Ashutosh Singh, a candidate. Another candidate, Prashant Srivastava, said that academic sessions of all the education institutes across India were delayed, but LU’s delay is longer. “I am worried that in a bid to cover the delay, syllabus will be covered in a short period, which many students may find difficult to follow and learn,” he added. LU officials, however, said that session will be regularised by holding extra classes and suspending vacations. “We have decided to continue classes even in winter and summer vacations, so that syllabus can be completed on time without putting extra burden on students,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-semester-1-pg-classes-likely-from-nov-end/articleshow/87615308.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: My wife wants man who threw acid at her to suffer same fate, says husband||NEW DELHI: Standing outside the burns ward of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital was a distraught man whose wife had been admitted in a serious condition after facing an acid attack by her stalker when she rebuffed his advances. He said that in their brief exchange of words, his wife wanted her attacker to suffer the same fate. “Just like she is struggling for survival every day, she wants her attacker to suffer. She wants him hanged till death. My wife is swinging between life and death. It’s been six days since my three children have seen their mother’s face. Her attacker wants to kill me and my entire family. I’m praying each day, but her treatment will take time,” said the husband. The family was also worried about the medical expenses required for reconstructive surgeries if the woman pulled through. Police were pitching in and also trying to raise funds to help them. Three policemen, head constable Chetan Yadav and constables Pradeep and Naveen, donated blood to the victim since the burns had damaged her blood vessels. Talking to TOI with tears in his eyes, the husband said, “In May 2021, I saw the stalker calling my wife and realised there was something amiss. My wife told me thathe would call and trouble her, so I brought my entire family back to my hometown in Bihar. Later, I sent my wife and three children to her parents’ house. I am a daily wager, so I returned to Delhi in June and shifted my house from Badli to Bawana hoping that the stalker would not follow us. My wife and children returned to Delhi in August.” On the day of the incident, the woman was going to the market when the stalker called her on some pretext and tried to force her to marry him. It was only when she came out screaming that people identified her and took her to a hospital and informed her husband. The accused was identified as the woman kept taking his name before falling unconscious. “My children are living with a relative. I now fear that the stalker may kill me. I can’t even see the condition of my wife. Police have been supportive and are trying to contribute in whichever way they can for her treatment on humanitarian grounds,” said the husband. Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, chief dermatologist and director, MedLinks, who visited the victim, said that DCP Brijendra Yadav had contacted him and his organisation would offer help to the victim to ensure that her treatment was not delayed. “The priority is to prevent sepsis and to make her vitals stable. Once she is out of danger, we will evaluate the extent of tissue damage. The damaged tissue will be removed and grafting done. In case of loss of eyebrows or hair, a transplant will be done. Once healing starts, we will put her on physiotherapy to prevent any contracture. Later, we will use lasers and fillers to normalise her facial features,” added Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/my-wife-wants-man-who-threw-acid-at-her-to-suffer-same-fate/articleshow/87614628.cms||Sakshi Chand

The maximum sound levels recorded in Pune over the three-day period — a day prior to Diwali, the day of Diwali and Bhau Beej — were around 83 decibels (dB) and 74.7 dB during the day and night-time, respectively. The corresponding readings in 2019 were 87.6 dB and 77.6 dB. The permissible sound limits are 65 dB and 55 dB in commercial areas during daytime and night-time, respectively, In the residential areas, the levels are 55 dB and 45 dB during day and night respectively. This year, the noise levels were measured at 14 locations in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic areas, an MPCB official said. According to the readings, areas such as Karve Road and Laxmi Road were the loudest places during the day, while localities such as Swargate were louder at night. The noise levels recorded at a number of locations violated the permissible noise limits, especially in the residential areas. “Overall, the noise levels are definitely lower than that of 2019, while it is slightly higher than that of 2020.Almost no Diwali festivities were observed last year, which is why the data could not be compared. This time, people refrained from buying crackers due to various reasons, be it financial difficulties due to the pandemic, or awareness regarding the link between air-borne diseases like Covid-19 and others,” said Nitin Shinde, the regional officer of the MPCB in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diwali-this-year-slightly-louder-than-2020-quieter-than-2019/articleshow/87613833.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

With many spurious bottling plants selling branded water, officials said this is just the tip of the iceberg. The raid conducted on Monday evening was a result of a tip off. When officials went to the manufacturing unit of M/s S B Beverages, Malkapur Village in Sangareddy district, they found many spurious bottles. “A large quantity of packaged drinking water, packed in different sizes of two litres, one litre and 500 ml pet bottles, with different brand names having unauthorised BIS standard mark were found in the raid,” said Avinash V, scientist C, BIS, Hyderabad branch. Explaining what a unauthorised mark means, he said it could be a mark associated with an expired licence for manufacturing packaged drinking water or mark without having valid licence at all. “Such products are used by common consumers and some of these are supplied to hotels too,” said Avinash V, adding that several raids had been carried out this year. “Although most manufacturing plants take required permissions, some errant ones exist, which are a hazard to public health,” he added. Consumption of uncertified packaged drinking water is unsafe and may be harmful to health, experts say. K V Rao, scientist E and Head BIS, Hyderabad branch, in an official statement said, “Action is being initiated against the offenders under the BIS Act, 2016. The offence is punishable by imposing maximum amount of fine up to Rs5 lakh or two years imprisonment or both under section 29 of BIS Act, 2016.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-bottling-plant-raided-bis-mark-misuse-rampant-say-officials/articleshow/87614625.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Kolkata||16 fail drink-drive test in first 3 hours in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Traffic Police, which re-introduced the breathalyzer test after a gap of 20 months, realized the necessity of this exercise within the first three hours of a special drive against drink-driving and rogue biking on Monday night. The 25 traffic guards ended up prosecuting 16 bikers and motorists under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act (driving by a drunken person). The average drink-driving cases registered each night between October 1 and November 7 stood at six. During pre-Covid times, the city witnessed close to 18-20 odd such cases only in the peak winter months. “The high numbers (16) reported in the very the beginning of November — and that too on a Monday — show that motorists have started taking their chances, perhaps confident that they will not be caught if they could hold on to their drink (since action was being taken based solely on perception of the cop vis-a-vis the motorist). We now hope that with the re-introduction of the breathalyzer test, motorists will become more responsible once again. Overall, we hope that the breathalyzer test will act as a deterrent now,” said an officer from Ultadanga Traffic Guard that prosecuted two people for drink-driving on Monday night. “We carried out the checks in two shifts. The first one lasted between 9pm and 11pm. This was the time when there was no night curbs. We ended up nabbing 10 motorists who were drunk. The second phase was launched after the night restrictions kicked in around 11pm. We continued this check a little after midnight and ended up nabbing another six,” said an officer at Lalbazar. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said they will be carrying out these special checks throughout the festive season. The Jorabagan traffic guard, which caters to a number of bars and pubs, reported five incidents of drink-driving, the highest in the city. The other guards that reported cases were the Headquarters Guard (the Dalhousie area), Ultadanga, Beliaghata, Sealdah, Park Circus, Tollygunge, Kasba, Purba Jadavpur, Tiljala and James long Sarani guards. “It is rare that 11 guards report drink-driving cases on a single day,” said an officer. The drive began after sergeants across 25 traffic guards were provided specific instructions from Lalbazar. “Concentrate your teams near bars, intercept two-wheeler riders and give them tests to perform (asking them to walk straight and to try and fetch a particular car-related document from multiple documents). If they fail, use the breathalyzer test and send them to hospital through local police. Use body cameras compulsorily during interception (so that cops cannot be challenged later). Follow all Covid guidelines,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/16-fail-drink-drive-test-in-first-3-hours/articleshow/87613847.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai commuted the death sentence, which was awarded by a trial court and upheld by the high court, after considering his young age at the time of committing the offence, his weak socio-economic background, absence of any criminal antecedents and his satisfactory behaviour in jail in the last ten years, as mitigating factors. “There is no doubt that the appellant has committed an abhorrent crime, and for this we believe that incarceration for life will serve as sufficient punishment and penitence for his actions, in the absence of any material to believe that if allowed to live, he poses a grave and serious threat to the society, and the imprisonment for life in our opinion would also ward off any such threat. We believe that there is hope for reformation, rehabilitation, and thus the option of imprisonment for life is certainly not foreclosed and therefore acceptable,” the bench said. In this case the convict had raped the girl, killed her by strangulation, and then disposed of her body, tied in a gunny bag, into a stream in December 2010. A trial court awarded the death sentence to him in 2012 which was upheld by the high court in 2017. The convict then approached the apex court. Granting his relief, the Supreme Court said that the high court was wrong in saying that there were no mitigating circumstances at all. “To begin with, it is clear that the appellant had no criminal antecedents, nor was any evidence presented to prove that the commission of the offence was preplanned. As submitted by the counsel for the appellant, there is no material shown by the state to indicate that the appellant cannot be reformed and is a continuing threat to the society,” it said. “The appeals are, however, partly allowed by commuting the death sentence to that of life imprisonment with the stipulation that the appellant shall not be entitled to premature release/remission before undergoing actual imprisonment of 30 years for the offence under Section 302 of the Code and further the sentences awarded shall run concurrently and not consecutively,” it said. Referring to the Supreme Court verdict in Shatrughna Baban Meshram case in which 67 judgments of the apex court in the previous 40 years were surveyed wherein death sentence had been imposed by the trial court or the high court and where the age of victims was below 16 years, the bench said, “It appears from the above data that low age of the victim has not been considered as the only or sufficient factor by this court for imposing a death sentence. If it were the case, then all, or almost all, 67 cases would have culminated in imposition of the sentence of death on the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hope-for-reformation-supreme-court-reprieve-for-rapist-killer/articleshow/87616215.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Head of nephrology department at SGPGI, Prof Narayan Prasad said, “As a result of the disease, children lose heavy amount of protein in the urine and swelling appears all over the body. Gradually, it may lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis and renal transplantation. The treatment for this disease rests on steroid, but while some children are resistant to steroids since the beginning, many develop resistance during treatment”. At least 8,000 cases of this common renal disease are reported at SGPGI alone each year. About 10-20% of children do not respond to steroid therapy. Nearly one-third of the remaining 80% develop steroid resistance after initial response, while another proportion develop it in the later stages. Prof Prasad said that prolonged resistance to steroid leads to a kind of toxicity in the body, which predisposes them to infections, weakens their immunity, results in to stunted growth, produce bony weakness, many metabolic conditions like diabetes, cataract and moon facies. “The challenges became the base for research and evolved into an innovation, which earned the Australian patent. Valid for eight years, the patented method recognised new biomarkers — called P-gp and MRP-1 in this case — to identify steroid resistance so that the alternative regimen may be introduced,” said Prof Prasad, adding that other members in the inventors’ team included Prof Vikas Agrawal, Akhilesh Jaiswal, Saurabh Chaturvedi and Harshit Singh. He said that in case of resistance, the body treats steroid like a foreign substance and triggers release of glycoproteins P-gp and MRP-1. These proteins on the body cell surface work like an efflux pump and bloat to prevent penetration of the medicine inside. As a result, the medicine doesn’t work and the symptoms show up. The puffiness goes up further as the medicine doesn’t act. Prof Prasad said that exposing children to tests to determine P-gp and MRP-1 levels in blood can help. He said the study establishing the success of the method has been published in high impact medical journal Nature’s publication Pharmacogenomics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oz-patent-for-pgi-study-on-steroid-toxicity-in-children/articleshow/87615328.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Coimbatore||Scrap import duty on raw materials, govt told||Coimbatore: The Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) has urged the Union government to cut the import duty of raw materials to nil rate and fix the MRP price for at least three months as rising raw material prices, including steel, copper, iron ore, aluminum, paper, plastics, PVC, cotton and chemicals, has impacted cost of operations. President of Codissia MV Ramesh Babu said the association has made a representation to the Prime Minister seeking his intervention and remedial measures for the MSME sector. The remedial measures include an immediate ban on export of iron ore and raw materials to ease domestic supply and to appoint NSIC as a consolidation agency to hedge steel for all MSMEs. On support from public sector units (PSUs), the association has asked the units to accept cancellation of orders from MSMEs with no penalty and blacklisting. “PSUs like SAIL should focus on MSMEs for supply of materials on priority basis and all steel industries should allocate at least 50% of their production for Indian MSMEs,” a press statement from the association said here on Tuesday. All MSMEs under government contract and suppliers to PSU, should be allowed to revise their price with fresh quotes. For all finalised government and PSU supplies, MSMEs should be allowed to invoke escalation clauses and requote. Also, requests have been made to arrange an enhanced working capital limit at 40% of the turnover from the banking sector to tide over the present crisis being faced due to the raw materials price increase. The affected product manufacturers are unable to observe the cost of raw material and due to this, end-product prices increase also not observed in the market. Hence, MSMEs have slowed down their production, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/scrap-import-duty-on-raw-materials-govt-told/articleshow/87614639.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Septage dumping continues unabated||Kochi: The city corporation turns a blind eye dumping septage waste at its septage treatment plant, which suspended operations since May this year, in Brahmapuram, thereby polluting Kadambrayar river. The local body is sitting on a notice submitted by health authorities in Brahmapuram, citing all the issues pertaining to illegal dumping of septage waste. The notice submitted on October 12 says that the functioning of the septage plant in the waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram was suspended since May 11 this year as part of inviting new tenders. “Since the gate of the plant cannot be closed, it has been found that septage waste is dumped on the corporation land near the plant. There is a possibility of the waste reaching Kadambrayar river,” said the notice, requesting further action. However, the local body has initiated no action so far. A senior health official of the corporation said he is unaware of the illegal acts at the plant. Usually health officials issue around three passes for a night to transport septage waste to the plant. Each pass is for transporting waste in one trip. Instead, vehicle operators transport the waste in multiple trips. It has been alleged that the illegal waste dumping is in connivance with those in charge of the plant’s security. T K Ashraf, chairman, health standing committee, said he was unaware of the developments at the plant, which remains closed for months. “A private agency has been assigned with the maintenance and operation of the plant. The next council meeting will approve the work assigned to the new agency,” he said. Surveillance cameras have been installed at the plant but those with vested interests have managed to erase all the footage, said a health official. “Currently, the corporation has not been issuing any passes since May 11. But vehicles continue to transport waste and dump it here. Though it is not in the CCTV footage, we could gather proof of vehicles reaching the site, from the tyre marks on the ground. We fear that they have managed to dump around 1,000 loads of waste illegally so far,” he said. With the rains, all the waste dumped illegally in the plant compound has reached the river. It has been alleged that those in charge of protecting the plant manage to extract Rs 200 per trip from those transporting the waste. C R Neelakandan, environmentalist and who is part of the Kadambrayar Samrakshana Samiti, lashed out at the inaction of the local body. “They treat Brahmapuram as a waste dumping yard to dump all kinds of waste generated in and around Kochi. The issue can be resolved only when the Brahmapuram plant is closed just like other closed plants in other districts. Closing of a centralised plant will help to open up a decentralised system,” he said. Other than the septage treatment plant in Brahmapuram, another one is functioning at Willingdon Island.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/septage-dumping-continues-unabated/articleshow/87613874.cms||T C Sreemol

Green activists who had earlier petitioned the NGT to save the 289-hectare wetland from drying out, have welcomed this development. Recording the complaints from Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP) and NatConnect Foundation, Raigad collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar has informed the NGT that now there is no blockage of water and 70 sluice gates adjoining the wetland have also been lifted. Nandkumar Pawar of SEAP had moved the NGT’s western zonal bench after the authorities did not comply with an earlier order from the environment department. The NGT asked Cidco and Raigad collector to file an action taken report. The Collector in his report explained that an on-the-spot inspection was done to ensure that the orders were complied with. He also submitted photographs of the gradual restoration of water flow. NGT will take up the next hearing on December 15. NatConnect director BN Kumar expressed hope that this will pave the way for conserving the wetland as Mumbai metropolitan region’s biodiversity park. The chief minister has referred this suggestion to the environment department. Kumar also appealed that nature lovers be allowed to enter Panje wetland as winter birds have started flying in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/panje-wetland-will-choke-no-more-authorities-restore-tidal-water-flow/articleshow/87615652.cms||---

The Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded in the “severe” category, according to the data compiled by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Among the UP cities, the pollution in Firozabad and Agra rose to alarming levels at 489 and 472, respectively. However, the AQI levels in Delhi were recorded at 404. Experts believe that the air quality might deteriorate in the coming days due to the current weather conditions and stubble burning. Track the pollution level in your cityThe air quality in Agra continued to remain in the “severe” category despite the interventions of the apex court and the National Green Tribunal. A thick blanket of smoke and dust enveloped the region, reducing visibility to a few meters. According to CPCB report, Firozabad recorded 489 AQI and most West UP and NCR cities also stayed in the “severe zone” — Agra (472), Vrindavan (454), Ghaziabad (451), Baghpat (442), Meerut and Hapur (433), Noida (426), Greater Noida (412) and Muzaffarnagar (410). Five other cities across the country also recorded worse air quality — Jind (403), Delhi (404), Ballabhgarh (412), Kaithal (418), and Faridabad (430). An AQI ranging from 0 to 50 is considered “good”, and “satisfactory” if it falls between 51 and 100. Similarly, from 101 to 200 it will be “moderate”, 201 to 300 is considered “poor”, 301 to 400 is taken as “very poor”, and above 400 it’s “severe”. Dr Hemendra Agarwal, a physician in Agra, said the increasing PM 2.5 level is dangerous for health, especially for heart patients and those that were asthmatic. He added that children aged between three and 10 are more prone to allergy and asthma. “Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 levels beyond safe limits can harm the respiratory system, as the ultra-fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream,” Dr Agarwal said. The PM-10 (presence of particles in the air with a diameter of less than 10 micrometres) is considered less dangerous than PM 2.5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ups-10-cities-among-15-most-polluted-in-country/articleshow/87613861.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

As TOI made the rounds of the neighbourhood off VIP Road, knocking on the doors of several houses within 100 metre radius of Saha’s house at Sachindralal Sarani, almost every alternate house had a patient suffering from dengue-like symptoms, either in hospital or bedridden at home. The blame game between residents and the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation notwithstanding, fresh water accumulation, which make for an ideal breeding ground for Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue fever, was found at many places. “My wife was down with dengue in 2019 as well and was hospitalised for six days. But this time, she couldn’t survive. Our neighbourhood is infested with mosquitoes. At the back of our house, there is an empty plot that has turned into a dumping ground. I have been writing to the authorities for the last two years but with no response. My wife had to pay the price for the authorities' laxity with her life,” said Sanjay Saha, Satabdi’s husband. Jolly Bagui, another local resident who has just recovered from dengue, said: “Several of our neighbours are down with fever and I am living in constant fear. I have luckily survived but what if something happens to my daughter?” As TOI went around the area, multiple residents of Sachindralal Sarani and Baguipara joined in pointing out the breeding grounds of mosquitoes — from an illegal khatal right in the middle of a residential neighbourhood and a clogged canal to a drainage channel. BMC officials blamed incessant rain that had led to stagnant water accumulation at many places as the primary cause behind the late surge of dengue this year. Four police officers of Baguiati police station alone got affected with dengue, prompting the civic authorities to conduct an inspection on the police station premises and Karunamoyee bus terminus area. “About 137 dengue cases were reported in October alone and 10 have been affected from dengue this month till date,” said a civic official. BMC has formed six quick action teams of civic officials, health and conservancy workers that will work till end of this year across the entire BMC area divided in six boroughs to conduct anti-dengue and Covid drive. The teams will start their work after Chhath Puja. BMC board of administrators’ member Pranay Roy said that a dengue and Covid task force has been formed under which the quick action teams will be working. “Each of the teams will have seven health and conservancy workers along with the respective ward coordinators and supervisors. One assistant engineer will supervise the work of each of the team. All the 41 wards will be visited and inspected by these teams on a regular basis,” said Roy, who is heading the task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-down-with-fever-dengue-fear-lurks-in-baguiati-after-late-case-spike-this-year/articleshow/87613859.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

This is the longest ever debarment of any infrastructure firm by the NHAI. The company’s managing director and four others were arrested by Jaipur Police on charges of murdering an authority engineer engaged by the NHAI. Sources said the order was issued last week and the NHAI has also filed a caveat in the Rajasthan high court requesting the court to listen to its side before deciding any matter brought before it in this case. Earlier, the highways authority had terminated the contract for construction of foot over bridges (FOBs) on the Gurugram-Jaipur highway. “Debarring any company from bidding five years is the highest ever penalty the NHAI has imposed on any company. This was the first such case and so an exemplary penalty has been imposed. There is zero tolerance for any such acts by any stakeholder in the sector,” said an official. The murder of 63-year-old Rajendra Chawla and arrests in September first week had sent shockwave across the construction industry. Police had claimed that the main accused had developed animosity towards the Gurugram-based engineer as he had refused to approve a design prepared by the company for the FOBs on the Gurugram-Jaipur highway. The company had bagged the bid to build 14 foot over bridges on this stretch at a cost of Rs 35 crore. When the company couldn’t complete the work in the one year deadline due to design issues, the NHAI had imposed a penalty of Rs 3.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/engineer-murder-case-nhai-bars-ggn-firm-for-5-yrs/articleshow/87614638.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Kolkata||PIL for Sputnik trial participants’ certs||Kolkata: A doctor on Tuesday filed a PIL at the Calcutta High Court, seeking CoWIN-generated vaccination certificate for participants at the Phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V vaccine. Even as clinical trial participants of the other two vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — have already got the certificate, Sputnik V volunteers are yet to get it. “The CoWIN-generated vaccination certificates are still not issued to the participants after repeated reminders to government authorities and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories even though the trial has ended in July 2021 at our site,” said Peerless Hospital clinical reaserch and academics director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, who was the principal investigator of the trial. Fifty volunteers were part of the trial at the Kolkata hospital as part of a pan-India study that went on from December 2020 till July 2021. After the study, those who received placebo during the trial was even offered the actual jab by sponsor Dr Reddy’s. “I hope this PIL will help seek a timeline by which the CoWIN-generated certificates will be available for the Sputnik trial participants who are facing difficulties in travelling in the absence of the certificate,” added Bhowmick. The Russian jab got emergency authorization in April 2021 on the basis of efficacy and safety data generated during the trial. “It is quite an irony that trial participants on who the vaccine’s efficacy and safety were tested have been denied the vaccination certificate so far whereas the rest of the vaccine recipients are being given the CoWIN-generated certificate. I am hopeful of the PIL being taken up next week,” said advocate Mohit Gupta, who filed the PIL on behalf of Bhowmick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pil-for-sputnik-trial-participants-certs/articleshow/87613870.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Lucknow||Mayawati tears into BJP, SP; accuses both of communalising UP assembly polls||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Tuesday tore into the BJP and SP accusing the two parties of striking a covert nexus to add communal colour to the forthcoming UP assembly elections. Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, Mayawati categorically cited the example of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “Jinnah comment” and BJP’s repeated reference of previous SP government ordering firing on Kar Sevaks in 1990 as deliberate attempts to make the upcoming state polls into a “Hindu versus Muslim contest”. Akhilesh had recently stirred a huge controversy by comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. His comment was swiftly picked up by the BJP to train its guns at the SP boss accusing him of “minority appeasement”. “Dono partiyon ka andar andar ye prayas chal raha hai ki Vidhan Sabha chunav mein Hindu-Muslim ho jaye...,” Mayawati charged, asserting that this exposed “politics of self-interest” of the two opposition parties. Maya’s pointed attack on BJP and SP comes a day after UP CM Yogi Adityanath visited Kairana in Shamli which had allegedly witnessed exodus of Hindu communities after 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots. The issue had played a pivotal role in BJP’s overwhelming performance in UP during the 2014 Lok Sabha and then in 2017 state elections. “The politics of BJP and SP have always complimented each other,” Mayawati said, insisting that BJP feels emboldened whenever SP is in power and vice-versa. “Both of them are driven by casteist and communal mindset,” she said, while expressing confidence that people will remain “unaffected” by the “conspiracies” of the two opposition parties.Mayawati said that the government’s decision to reduce taxes on fuel was taken with an eye on assembly elections in various states, including UP. “The BJP will withdraw the favour once the elections are over,” she alleged, flaying the ruling BJP for the rise in inflation. “Likewise, the free ration distribution to the poor will be withdrawn soon after the elections,” she said, in an apparent reference to the UP government decision to extend the sop till Holi. The BSP supremo said that the opposition parties making a flurry of promises much before the announcement of elections also “raises a question over their intentions’‘. She categorically hit out at the ruling BJP for inaugurating uncompleted projects. She also derided the Congress for making tall promises which people were “not willing to believe”. Mayawati’s attack on Congress comes days after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra made women centered promises including granting 40% tickets to the women. “The Congress would not have been routed from the Centre and the states had it fulfilled 50% of the promises it made to the people,” Mayawati said. BSP chief Mayawati said that like CM Yogi Adityanath she does not have a family. “CM Yogi Adityanath however showcases himself as a “sanyasi” by wearing saffron robes, which I don't,” she said. Mayawati said that Yogi’s main family was RSS while she considered people of various sections as part of her family. She also attacked Yogi for taking interest in one particular community. Mayawati also said that if any of her relatives worked in the interest of the party it did not come under nepotism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-tears-into-bjp-sp-accuses-both-of-communalising-up-polls/articleshow/87615336.cms||Pankaj Shah

Parents say their children are complaining about how many of their classmates are shifting back to online mode. “Yesterday, my child told me that two of his classmates who opted for offline mode started attending class online as they have fever. Today, five students took to online mode,” said a parent, whose child is studying in a school in Begumpet. Students and their parents claimed that quite a few schools are not following Covid-19 norms and this is resulting in students catching cold or fever from their classmates. “Now and then, our section is being clubbed with another section for a period or two. When we complain about four students being made to sit on a bench, the teachers are asking us to adjust. Is one period not sufficient for us to contract Covid-19 if someone in the room is already infected with Coviid-19,” asked a class 10 student, studying in a private school in Kukatpally. Teachers, meanwhile, said that the attendance percentage in schools is hardly 50 in high schools and about 20 to 30 in upper primary and primary classes. “Apart from the fear of Covid-19, many are still hesitant to send their children to offline classes as they are suffering from cold, fever, dengue, among ailments,” said B Shivaraj, a private teacher. He said that teachers have no option except to combine two different sections to complete the syllabus as many managements have retained only one teacher for a subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-kids-catch-viral-fever-in-schools-many-find-online-classes-a-safe-bet/articleshow/87614643.cms||---

A resident of Aehroli village, Altaf, 22, was accused of kidnapping a Hindu girl. According to family members of the deceased, Altaf was picked up by the police from his home on Monday evening. His father alleged that his son was murdered at the police station. The family only learnt of the incident through local reporters at 6 pm on Tuesday. However, police claimed that the accused had committed suicide by strangulating himself inside the washroom of the lock-up. Later in the evening, five policemen, including the station house officer, two sub-inspectors, a constable, and the head clerk posted at the Kasganj police station were suspended for negligence on duty. The father of the deceased, Caahat Miyan, who works as a labourer, said, “The police came to my home on Monday evening and claimed that Altaf had kidnapped a girl. I handed over my son to the police at 8 pm. I went to the police station to get further details and a copy of the FIR but the policemen misbehaved and warned me not to come to the station again. On Tuesday evening, I got information from local reporters that my son had died inside the police station itself. By the time I reached the station again, he was taken to a nearby hospital. Doctors there declared him dead. My son was innocent, he had no criminal past. He was murdered in police custody.” Family members said that Altaf was not produced in front of a magistrate in court on Tuesday. Superintendent of police, Botre Rohan Pramod, said, “Altaf was accused in a case of kidnapping. He was brought to the police station early morning on Tuesday. During questioning, he had requested to go to the washroom. He was sent to the washroom inside the lock-up. There, he strangled himself, using a drawstring in the hood of his jacket, attached to a pipeline of the washroom. He was found unconscious by the police and was rushed to CHC Ashok Nagar. After 5-10 minutes of treatment, he died at the hospital. The dead body has been sent for post-mortem examination. Five policemen have been suspended for negligence on duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-accused-of-kidnapping-dies-in-police-custody-family-alleges-murder/articleshow/87613876.cms||Deepak Lavania

In the attack on a woman by her stalker, the accused had procured the acid from a shop in Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur. Police are conducting raids to arrest the shopkeeper. The accused, Montu, was acquainted with the shop owner and had told him that he needed it for cleaning toilets and tiles. He had even kept car battery acid as backup in case he was unable to procure it. TimesViewIf acid is easily available in the city despite the ban, then both shopkeepers and authorities are to be blamed. The shopkeepers should be punished for indulging in this illegal activity and authorities should be censured for turning a blind eye to the problem which has such a terrible fallout. Employing decoy customers to catch such errant shopkeepers could be a way of forcing them to change their habit.Swati Maliwal, chairperson, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), told TOI that she would meet the victim on Wednesday at RML Hospital and ensure all possible help to the family.“Acid continues to be freely sold in the city. We must run a campaign against it and ensure that it’s not available in the neighbourhood. I will meet the victim on Wednesday and provide rehabilitation to her. At DCW, we have several acid attack survivors who are starting their lives afresh. It’s a long journey of recovery for them even after the treatment is over. The ban on sale and purchase needs to be implemented on the ground level too,” added Maliwal. Yogita Bhayana, a women and child rights activist, said the availability of acid despite the ban showed how as a country we play around with people’s lives for a few rupees. “Such incidents take place as men consider women and girls mere objects. We need to work on the social fabric of our country,” she added. “The most unfortunate part is that every household uses acid as many plumbers recommend it. There are better options available in the market, but people use acid to save money. I will blame people who buy or sell acid equally. The law and order agencies ignore what is happening right under their nose. It means they are a part of the nexus. Courts should form a monitoring body to check the availability of acid,” said Bhayana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/acid-easily-available-in-city-despite-ban-activists-stress-on-need-for-campaign/articleshow/87614651.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Delhi||Submit status report on dengue steps, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday sought response from the city government and North Delhi Municipal Corporation on a plea for taking steps to control the dengue outbreak. Filed by a dengue patient, the plea sought regular steps to check the mosquito-borne disease, including fogging, forming inspection teams to check any growth of mosquito larvae on the premises and imposing penalties for violations. Justice Rekha Palli issued a notice and granted one week’s time to authorities to file their status reports in the matter and listed the plea for further hearing on November 18. The petitioner, a resident of Model Town in north Delhi, said she was also suffering from dengue and highlighted the plight of all such patients. The plea said her area was facing an onslaught of dengue, like much of the city, and alleged that due to the inaction of the authorities in controlling the vector-borne disease, many cases were reported every day and hospital beds were being occupied fast. Petitioner Ananya Kumar sought a direction to authorities to take proper measures to control dengue outbreak in the surrounding area of her residence, including regular fogging, door-to-door awareness campaign and helpline numbers. On its part, the Delhi government assured the court that authorities are taking necessary steps so that the dengue outbreak in the city is curtailed and that they are coordinating with the corporations. The plea said the petitioner was living in fear that children and senior citizens might also suffer from dengue fever, which could be fatal in their age. According to the report on vector-borne diseases released on Monday, nine deaths and a total of 2,708 dengue cases have been recorded in Delhi in this season till November 6, which is the highest count since 2017 for the same period. The capital city had reported about 1,200 cases of dengue in the month of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/submit-status-report-on-dengue-steps-hc/articleshow/87614652.cms||---
---||India||No foreign funds for NGOs if purpose not declared: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said NGOs should not be allowed to receive foreign funds if the donor did not declare the purpose for which the money is to be spent and said the Centre has diluted the intent of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by not insisting on such a provision. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar said as per Section 8 of the Act, disclosure has to be made at the outset regarding the purpose for which a contribution has been made and asked the Centre to make its stand clear on the issue. Section 8 says every person who is registered and granted a certificate or given prior permission under the Act and receives any foreign contribution, shall utilise such contribution for the purposes for which the contribution has been received. Referring to the section, the bench said the purpose of the contribution has to be disclosed and only then would inflow of funds be allowed. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta contended that an NGO can use the fund for activities for which they are registered which could be social, cultural, religious purposes. But the bench said that even in cases where an NGO is registered to carry out various activities, the organisation is bound to spend foreign contributions only for the purpose for which money was transferred. It said that in such cases an NGO has to maintain separate accounts for carrying out different activities. “You are diluting the whole proceedings and intent of the Act. Disclosure has to be made by the donor at the outset regarding for what purpose the contribution is being made.Purpose of the contribution has to be disclosed only then inflow should be allowed. It is another matter that you are not following it. We need a clear stand of the governemnt on the issue,” the bench told the solicitor general. While justifying Centre’s decision to amend the Act to regulate foreign contribution to NGOs, Mehta contended this was to stop NGOs from making chain-transfers of foreign funds a business. He said that there are Intelligence Bureau inputs on NGOs misusing the funds and and they cannot claim to have a fundamental right to receive funds from abroad. However, while the Centre too sought higher accountability of funds, the court called for the donor to also state purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-foreign-funds-for-ngos-if-purpose-not-declared-supreme-court/articleshow/87616196.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Police suspect that the arrested gang was part of an interstate drug peddling network and had smuggled in the contraband in the past too. Kalapurakkal Anas, of Perumbavoor, Faisal, of Okkal, and his wife Varsha, who were arrested by police in the case, were remanded in judicial custody by the Angamaly judicial first class magistrate on Tuesday. K Karthick, district police chief (Ernakulam Rural), said that the accused will be brought in police custody for further investigation. They were intercepted by a combined team of Ernakulam rural police and district anti-narcotic special action force on national highway in Karukutty on Monday based on specific information about the smuggling attempt. The 225kg contraband was found concealed in 123 packets in the boot and beneath the seats of the vehicles they used. According to police, the gang, which procured the ganja from Paderu village in Andhra Pradesh, had been under police surveillance for over a month based on information received about their involvement in the smuggling network. Ganja from Paderu is being smuggled into various states and there are many takers in Kerala too, police said. “Many people, including Malayalis, are working in the ganja smuggling network in Paderu. They deliver the vehicle to the buyers at the village border after collecting the money in advance. The accused Anas had reportedly been to Paderu many times over the last one-and-half years and Faisal too accompanied him sometimes. It is yet to be known whether they had any accomplices in the operation. More details about the network will be collected through further interrogation,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rural-police-begin-detailed-probe/articleshow/87613894.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The campaign, which was started from Sector 7, was led by Congress general secretary H S Lucky, the party’s chief spokesperson. Congress workers gathered in front of the petrol pump in Sector 7, where they went around government quarters and the sector market distributing pamphlets highlighting issues of price rise and price difference during the Congress and BJP regime. Lucky accused the BJP of fleecing people and said that prices of essential commodities had increased manifold. On petroleum, he said that petrol and diesel prices were increased by almost Rs 40 in the past one year but the relief given was only Rs 5 and Rs 10, which was “too little, too late.” He said that people were disillusioned with the policies of the BJP. Youth Congress co-incharge Richi Bhargava said that the campaign would continue in the days to come and that Youth Congress activists would go to every part the city to campaign against the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youth-congress-starts-campaign-targeting-bjp-over-inflation/articleshow/87613892.cms||---

He is facing charges of allegedly evading nearly Rs 1,000 crore to banks. The company was dragged to NCLT by the aggrieved lenders and it was declared insolvent. Consequent to failure to revive the firm through the corporate insolvency process, the firm was sent to liquidation. Its bank account was declared as fraud by banks in tune with RBI circular that asked banks to be wary of suspicious accounts and to declare such accounts as fraud accounts. Srinivas Prasad’s counsel Vikram Pooserla informed a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy that several companies were aggrieved with the unilateral declaration of their accounts as fraud without hearing them and obtained interim relief from further action. He sought a similar relief to them as well. The bench made it clear that it would like to hear the version of RBI, bankers, CBI, and ED. “Till then, we cannot issue any order granting you any interim relief,” the bench said. Following complaints from banks, CBI booked a case against directors and was proceeding against them. HC too had made it clear that any stay on RBI circular and actions of banks would not be hindrance for CBI and ED to proceed against promoters and errant directors who defrauded banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-relief-for-aster-director-in-rs-1000cr-loan-default-case/articleshow/87614648.cms||---
---||Kolkata||KMC official fined for misleading affidavit||Kolkata: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday slapped a Rs 5,000 fine on a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) official for submitting a misleading affidavit on pollution caused by its hotmix plants. The tribunal has asked KMC to submit a fresh action taken report at a least a week prior to the next hearing on December 12. The fine was imposed on KMC executive engineer (mechanical) Parag Bhushan Bhattacharyya for submitting an affidavit on June 30, 2021, that claimed the KMC hotmix plants at Palmer Bazaar and Goragachha were not causing any pollution even though the PCB report on which it was based did not contain the SOx and NOx data. "We, therefore, impose a personal cost of Rs 5,000 on Parag Bhushan Bhattacharyya for having filed the misleading affidavit without caring to examine the PCB report of March 1, 2021," read the order by judicial member Amit Sthalekar and expert member Saibal Dasgupta. It also directed KMC to file a fresh affidavit with the SOx and NOx reports from both the plants at Palmer Bazaar and Goragachha. The Central Pollution Control Board's regional director has also been asked to be present in person at the next hearing to assist the court. Environment activist Subhas Datta, who had filed the original petition on pollution caused by hotmix plants in the city, said that not only was the pollution report incomplete in the absence of NOx and SOx data, the very claim that asphalt plants were non-polluting was not tenable as it continued to emit pollutants.  While the PWD had adopted mechanised mastic asphalt technology to reduce pollution, KMC was yet to act on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-official-fined-for-misleading-affidavit/articleshow/87613886.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Lucknow||BSP chief back to drawing board to fortify vote-base||Lucknow: The aggressive positioning of Samajwadi Party vis-a-vis BJP in run-up to polls is learnt to have stirred BSP chief Mayawati to sit up and go back to her political drawing board. Highly placed sources in BSP said the deft Dalit politician has opened her cryptic channels to conduct a detailed profiling of assembly constituencies to select “winnable” candidates for assembly polls due early next year. The move assumes political pertinence with the former UP CM being pushed to the wall amidst SP and BJP’s concerted bid to nibble at the very foundation of her key Dalit-MBC vote-base. With a host of expelled BSP MLAs hopping on to the Opposition bandwagon, ostensibly SP, Mayawati, sources said, has decided to prop candidates who could fit into the local caste matrix and have “considerable influence” to neutralize a potential polarization of voters between SP and BJP. “We are working silently at the ground level before the party moves into a full-fledged campaign mode,” said a senior BSP leader, asserting that issues like farmers’ stir against new farm laws, unemployment and poor law and order were high on the party’s agenda. The BSP leader said, Mayawati has also asked party leaders to strengthen the party’s organizational structure to counter the well-oiled poll machinery of BJP, which is resolutely backed by cadres of its ideological mentor RSS and its Hindutva arm, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Mayawati’s stress on a robust organisational structure, party sources said, stems from the need to amalgamate cadre who can help improve the party’s vote percentage that has been on a decline since 2012 assembly elections. The development comes months after Mayawati whipped out a Brahmin card to play her tried-and-tested social engineering formula that propelled her to power with absolute majority for the first time in 2007 assembly elections. Party sources said, Mayawati keenly seeks to play ‘soft Hindutva’ to woo the upper caste, which has traditionally been voting in favour of BJP. She had set the idea rolling by asking party MP and party’s Brahmin face SC Mishra to organize ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelans’ across the state to woo the upper caste. The move, political analysts said, may essentially help in 80 reserved seats, where BSP has not been performing well in the past. Nevertheless, experts said, stakes are high for Mayawati who faces a looming political crisis in UP where she has been out of power for nearly 10 years. Her worries have escalated even as SP and BJP brass manage to set the political narrative oscillating between themselves. The aggressive entry of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has only added to the concerns of the BSP boss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-chief-back-to-drawing-board-to-fortify-vote-base/articleshow/87615345.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||RBI restricts withdrawals from Yavatmal’s Bapuji Datey Mahila Coop Bank||Yavatmal: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed various restrictions on Yavatmal-based Babuji Datey Mahila Cooperative Bank Ltd under section 35A read with section 56 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949. The restrictions came into force from Tuesday, November 9. The RBI restrictions state that the bank is allowed to let its savings account holders withdraw only Rs5,000 in the next six months. Besides, the bank is restricted from accepting any fresh deposits without the prior permission of RBI. The directions add that considering the bank’s liquidity position o account holder can withdraw a sum exceeding Rs5,000 of the total balance across all savings bank or current accounts for the next six months. The bank has been in heavy losses and reported NPAs to the extent of over Rs200 crore. There was heavy rush of concerned depositors at the bank on Tuesday itself. No senior officials or directors were present at the bank, which added to confusion among depositors. Chief officer Sujata Mahajan later confirmed the RBI action and said there was failure in recovery of loans, which led to the RBI action. “We have expedited recovery proceedings and in next two months we shall recover the defaulted amount, and recoup the current situation,” she said, appealing to depositors not to panic as their money is safe. Deputy registrar of cooperatives Ramesh Katke said he has limited control over cooperative banks as they are governed by RBI. “Today, I summoned a meeting of the Board of Directors and instructed them to act strictly by the rules, which they agreed to comply with hereafter,” Katke said and urged the public not to panic. Their deposits are safe and the current situation will be overcome within two months, he added. Bank account holder Akhtar Firdos Mohd Razak had launched an indefinite hunger strike in front of the main branch of the bank from October 25 with his family. He claims to have incurred heavy losses due to faulty service of the bank, which made him a defaulter. He accused bank directors of giving loans to their favourites recklessly, which caused heavy loss to the bank. The bank said Razak is angry because of recovery proceedings by the bank after he defaulted on his loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rbi-restricts-withdrawals-from-yavatmals-bapuji-datey-mahila-coop-bank/articleshow/87614649.cms||---

Two veterinarians had been trying to revive the elephant, which had collapsed on a patta land close to the reserve forest on Monday morning. While there was no external injury, they said the elephant had fallen sick as it was dehydrated. T K Ashok Kumar, district forest officer, said samples of vital organs and blood were collected from the carcass of the elephant and sent them to a laboratory in Chennai for testing. “As per the autopsy report, the elephant’s liver was weak and the normal blood circulation was affected. It was also dehydrated completely. The exact cause of the elephant’s death could be known only after we receive the test results.” Another forest officer said a team of frontline staff was closely monitoring the elephant after it was rescued from the pit with the help of an earthmover. Before releasing the elephant into the forest, veterinarians had administered glucose and other medicines on the animal. “However, it collapsed on the patta land that was just 250 metres from the Periyanaickenpalayam range of forests on Monday morning. The veterinary officers were trying to revive the animal, which died on Tuesday early morning. The carcass was buried on the day itself after postmortem,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/6-yr-old-male-elephant-rescued-from-pit-dies/articleshow/87614653.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Classes 3 & 5 must attend national education survey in school but parents ‘reluctant’||MUMBAI: The BMC on Tuesday allowed classes 3 and 5 of city schools participating in the nation-wide survey of students’ learning achievement to attend physical school for a day. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 is to be conducted by the ministry of education on Friday. This is the first time since the March 2020 pandemic lockdown that students of these classes will enter classrooms. The exception for classes 3 and 5 has been made for a day; classes 8 to 12 have been permitted to attend school since October 4. The 140 schools selected in the city for NAS made frantic calls to parents to send in their children. One principal said most parents are either away for the Diwali vacation or do not want to send in their children. “Parents of class 3 and 5 students are not willing to send them to school,” said a Thane school principal. Field investigators and observers appointed to conduct the survey will be visiting the allotted 140 schools between Wednesday and Thursday. All other class 3 and 5 students will continue to attend online classes when schools reopen after the Diwali vacation on Thursday.  Meanwhile, across the state, a total of 7,330 schools and 2.3 lakh students from classes 3, 5, 8 and 10 have been selected for the 90- to 120-minute optical mark recognition (OMR)-based survey in their respective schools. Late on Monday, the state education department issued a circular directing selected schools to ensure 100% attendance of students of a particular standard selected for the survey. No parental consent is required. While some schools have to call only classes 8 and 10, many have to bring back classes 3 and 5 too. The survey of a particular standard, say, Class 3 should not exceed 30 students, but the school will have to call all. From among those present, chits of students will be prepared and 30 chits will be randomly selected. In cases where the total students are 30 or less, all will take the survey. “It will be very difficult to even get a handful of class 3 and 5 students,” said the principal of a school in Byculla. The survey will be on OMR sheets and students will have to mark the right answer by darkening the circles. For classes 3 and 5, the field investigator will help fill the OMR sheets. Classes 3 and 5 will write the test from 10.30am to 12pm. Classes 8 and 10 will take the test from 10.30am to 12.30pm. After the test, students will have to fill a pupil questionnaire. The state has already curtailed the Diwali vacation till November 11. “We were under the impression that all classes will begin post Diwali. Parents of smaller children are not willing to give their consent though,” said the principal of a school in Bandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-classes-3-5-must-attend-national-edu-survey-in-school-but-parents-reluctant/articleshow/87614655.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Jaipur||Farmers threaten stir against Centre’s opium policy from Nov 12||Jaipur: Opium cultivators of seven districts have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from November 12, demanding changes in the new opium policy. The opium farmers’ joint society is demanding the Central government to change the criteria for issuing licences to grow opium under the opium policy. The provision of growing a minimum of 5.9kg of pure morphine from one hectare of land to get the licences renewed in the following year, is being opposed by the farmers. Farmers have been contending that change in rainfall pattern and weak winters every alternate year is leading to poor yield per hectare. Also, the farmers have been questioning the lack of transparency in the processing of morphine by the Central Bureau of Narcotics. “Farmers provide opium to the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) which processes morphine in its labs in Madhya Pradesh. The entire process taking place without keeping farmers in the loop has led to mass corruption in the system. They inform us of the quality and quantity of the morphine over the phone followed by under-the-table negotiations with them to approve the final product. In case the quality and quantity doesn’t match the permissible limit, the farmer must bear the brunt by losing the licence,” said Mangilal Bilot, president of the committee. He is camping in Delhi to lobby for changes in the policy. Over the years, the body has claimed that productivity has reduced due to the change in climatic conditions. The fine quality of opium and quantity depends upon rainfall and the harsh spell of the winter season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-threaten-stir-against-centres-opium-policy-from-nov-12/articleshow/87615347.cms||---

It had earlier said driving licences would not be issued to unvaccinated people, and made vaccination mandatory for government employees, failing which their salaries for November would be withheld. “Aurangabad district has slipped to 26th position in the state in vaccination. It has achieved only 55% vaccination (first dose) against the state average of 74%,” said district collector Sunil Chavan, who heads the DDMA. In an order on Tuesday, the DDMA said Bibi-ka-Maqbara, Aurangabad Caves, Daulatabad Fort and Pitalkhora Caves are among the tourist hotspots where the ‘no-vaccine-no-entry’ directive would be applied. The order also makes at least part vaccination compulsory for owners and staff of hotels, shops, resorts and other commercial establishments operating around the tourist places in Aurangabad district. Both the Aurangabad municipal corporation and the Aurangabad zilla parishad have been told to arrange for vaccination camps at tourist places. As per official data, Bibi-ka-Maqbara, designed like the Taj Mahal, witnessed the highest footfall of 16,440 visitors from within the country during September. Ellora Caves followed with 14,421 Indian tourists followed by Daulatabad fort (7,977), Ajanta Caves (6,063) and Aurangabad Caves (4,301).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maharashtra-1-vaccine-dose-must-to-visit-ajanta-ellora-daulatabad/articleshow/87614661.cms||---

His parents-in-law and brother-in-law were booked for the murder on Monday. The family did not approve of his marriage with their daughter. Police said Ankit Awasthi’s body was exhumed following a complaint by his wife, who suspected that her family had killed him. Giving details, Vinod Kumar Shukla, station house officer of Farrukhabad police station, said, Neha Chauhan, 21, got married to Awasthi last year, on November 12, against the wishes of her family. The woman’s parents were earlier staying in Noida and ran a grocery shop there. A few months ago, they had moved back to their native village Bhagua Nagla in Farrukhabad. Awasthi, who also hails from Farrukhabad, had been staying in a rented house in Noida's Jalalpur for more than two years. The couple had met in Noida and were staying there after their marriage. Speaking with TOI on Tuesday, Neha said they visited Ankit’s native village Sarha, to meet his parents on Bhai Dooj. They then decided to visit her parents at Bhagua Nagla village on Sunday. They went together but he proceeded alone to her house to make peace with her parents. Neha, who was waiting for him at some distance, called him up, when he did not return. To her surprise, his phone was switched off. After waiting for him for quite some time, she went to her parent’s house and inquired about her husband. On her arrival, her parents beat her up and then locked her in a room, Neha claimed. She told TOI that she suspected that they were planning to kill her as well. “I saw my husband’s broken mobile phone and blood stains in the house,” she said. On Monday morning, when her parents were forcibly taking her to some place in an auto, she managed to slip away on the pretext of relieving herself and approached the police. SHO Shukla said a sharp-edged weapon was allegedly used to kill Awasthi. “An FIR has been registered against Neha’s father, Dharmendra Chauhan, her mother, Uma, and brother, Prashant, under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence and giving false information). Further investigations are on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farrukhabad-family-kills-son-in-law-buries-him/articleshow/87613901.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||‘Misappropriation’ of liquor bottles at Delhi Gymkhana Club: EOW files case||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has registered a case based on the complaint of Delhi Gymkhana Club (DGC) in which misappropriation of more than 50 liquor bottles worth over Rs 2.1 lakh has been alleged. Earlier, the club conducted an internal inquiry that revealed the involvement of three people, including a former secretary, in the alleged misappropriation. The police have registered a case and started an investigation. The complaint was filed by the club’s officiating secretary. “DGC has a valid excise licence under which it procures liquor strictly to be served at its bars at designated areas within the club to its members,” the complainant told the police. Before the lockdown, bar stock inventory was taken on March 19, 2020 by the bar manager. Thereafter, due to Covid-19, DGC closed all its operations on March 20, 2020. “Post Covid lockdown, in June, the bar manager discovered the shortage in the liquor stock. He informed the matter to two members but they kept silent,” the complainant said. The manager later informed the misappropriation to another member, who in turn reported the shortage to the president of DGC and an internal inquiry was conducted. The inquiry revealed that the ex-secretary was present on the premises of DGC during the lockdown. The club’s probe revealed that the ex-secretary used to visit the liquor storage room, select the liquor, and then with the help of staff, bottles were carried to his cottage, the complainant stated. The probe panel also found a handwritten note having details of the allocation of liquor made by the ex-secretary. It had details of withdrawals during April and May 2020 based on records kept by him. Further inquiry by the club revealed that the security head, around the third week of May, was given directions by the ex-secretary on how he should report the withdrawals of bottles to the bar manager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/misappropriation-of-liquor-bottles-at-delhi-gymkhana-club-eow-files-case/articleshow/87614657.cms||---

This kind of unnecessary fogging not only causes problems for the public, but also leads to pollution. Keeping in mind public health, if anyone is found doing fogging illegally, action will be taken as per the direction of the NGT for causing pollution” read an order issued by additional commissioner, EDMC. On October 27, Aam Aadmi Party started a fogging campaign where all the party MLAs were directed to visit every ward, street and conduct fogging. AAP said BJP-run municipal corporations did not take a single step to control the spread of the dengue outbreak in the city. “The public health department of the east corporation is continuously conducting fogging drives in this regard. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme has clearly put out a procedure for fogging, where it is explained how much pesticide is to be used in what quantity,”said the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-act-against-illegal-fogging-drives/articleshow/87614658.cms||---

In response to Gehlot’s letter to PM Narendra Modi, state BJP president Satish Poonia has shot a letter to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi urging her to direct Gehlot to reduce Value Added Tax on petrol and diesel on Tuesday. Poonia argued that Gehlot has increased the VAT on fuel four times including three times in the Covid period citing the reason for the poor economy. Gehlot, on the other hand, demanded that the Centre should further reduce excise duty by Rs 10 on petrol and Rs 15 on diesel. If the Centre reduces excise duty, then automatically VAT in the state will reduce by Rs 3.40 on petrol and Rs 3.90 on diesel. As a result, Rajasthan is ready to bear a revenue loss of Rs 3,500 crore, he said in the letter. Gehlot said after 2016, Centre has reduced the state share in excise duty on fuel and states do not get any share from additional or special excise duty charged by it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cut-excise-duty-on-fuel-further-gehlot-to-modi/articleshow/87615373.cms||---

But such a decision cannot be imposed on any employee and stopping his salary is like giving him a punishment. We will definitely oppose this decision and stage a bitter protest if the administration implements it,” said Ravi Rao, president, Municipal Labour Union. Traders, also on the TMC radar, said while a majority of them have taken the jabs it would be difficult to force those who don’t wish to get one.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Advocate seeks to reopen case against Kangana Ranaut, Rangoli Chandel||MUMBAI: A lawyer has moved the sessions court after a magistrate court dismissed his complaint against actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister, Rangoli Chandel, for allegedly posting defamatory and hateful statements against the Muslim community. The plea will be heard next week. In July this year, the magistrate’s court dismissed the case against the sisters. “Sanction of central government, state government or district magistrate is must. Without sanction, order of issue process cannot be passed against accused,” metropolitan magistrate Bhagawat T Zirape had said. Among the offences were promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration and deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings. In his revision application, advocate Ali Kaashif Khan said that the case cannot be dismissed over non-availability of sanction order, but could be kept for compliance of the same. He also said he had filed an application for issuance of sanction from the collector. In his complaint, Khan had submitted that on April 15, 2020, Chandel allegedly posted a defamatory statement against a community on Twitter. The plea said her account was subsequently suspended. The plea further accused Ranaut of supporting Chandel. It added that on April 18, Ranaut too posted a video on her social media platforms, labelling a religious sect as “terrorists”. The advocate told the court that he had approached the police but no action was taken against the sisters. He said that offences under the Indian Penal Code, relating to promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, were made out against the siblings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/advocate-seeks-to-reopen-case-against-kangana/articleshow/87615690.cms||---

In the day, Gehlot, accompanied by a couple of ministers, had flown to Jodhpur. Late evening, he flew to Delhi from Jodhpur. Cabinet expansion and political appointments in the state have been long overdue, considering the persistent demands by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. There is already vacancy for nine for in the council of ministers, while two cabinet ministers—Raghu Sharma and Harish Chaudhary—are likely to be dropped since they have been made Congress in-charges of poll-bound states Gujarat and Punjab. The chief minister is likely to keep two seats vacant even in the cabinet rejig that may take place earliest by the weekend. The expansion may see induction of nine ministers. Of these, four could be from the Pilot camp and five from the Gehlot camp, said Congress sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-reaches-delhi-cabinet-reshuffle-soon/articleshow/87615357.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra hits 10 crore Covid vaccine doses, nearly 75% adults get at least 1 shot||MUMBAI: Maharashtra completed 10 crore vaccinations on Tuesday, the second state after Uttar Pradesh (13.5crore) to reach the milestone. It took Maharashtra over nine months to deliver 10,01,37,366 doses. UP reached 10 crore vaccinations on September 26; West Bengal is a distant third, having administered 8.2crore doses till now. Maharashtra has now immunised close to three-fourths (6.80crore) of the adult population with at least a single shot and fully vaccinated 35% (3.20crore). To fully vaccinate 9.14crore adults, the state has to administer another 8crore doses. Mumbai and Pune have given more than one crore doses each. Mumbai has touched 1.45crore doses, and Pune 1.22crore. Mumbai is the only district where 99.5% have got the first dose and 62% both. Among 36 districts, barely a dozen have covered more than 80% of population with at least one shot. The full immunisation proportion is less than 30% in 21 districts. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health) said the state would aim to cover its entire eligible population with at least one shot by November 30. “We have started the har ghar dastak campaign and are proactively approaching those who missed their second doses and those who are yet to get the first dose. We will attempt that all eligible receive at least one dose by November 30,” he said. However, immunizing more than 2crore in the next 20 days would require administering nearly 12 lakh doses in a day, which seems a tall order given that the daily average is barely 5lakh. Authorities say it’s achievable since doses are in abundance. Dr Vyas confirmed that Maharashtra currently has 1.05 crore doses of Covishield and 15 lakh doses of Covaxin. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and public health minister Rajesh Tope applauded health workers for achieving the feat and said funds and manpower were provided to accelerate vaccination. The minister reiterated that districts have been asked to draw up micro plans to maximize coverage in the next 20 days. The ‘har ghar dastak’ drive has been initiated nationally from November 3 to speed up coverage of both first and second doses. Experts said Maharashtra has reached a stage where teams could face hesitancy in accepting the first dose and complacency in taking the second. “It has to be tackled with micro-strategies,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and health systems expert. He also cautioned people against taking vaccination lightly merely because Covid cases are low. “Vaccination has a different role. It’s an insurance from future waves,” he said. A positive sign is that vaccination has started picking up in Mumbai. For the second day in a row on Tuesday, there were more than one lakh vaccinations (1,23,362).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hits-10cr-doses-nearly-75-adults-get-at-least-1-shot/articleshow/87614686.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In 2020, the royalty revenue collection stood at Rs 2,316 crore and Rs 2,325 crore in the first seven month of 2019. Royalty collection has increased by 27% this year compared to the seven months last year. Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, said, “The increased royalty revenue is the result of curbing illegal mining and regular monitoring”. Agarwal said surveillance during night time has been effective in reducing illegal mining activities which will be continued. State has been battling illegal mining which has led to law and order situations in the past.

---||Agra||2 months on, 50k Agra varsity students awaiting roll number to get admission into new session||Agra: For the past two months, first-year students of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University here have been making the rounds of the university offices for their roll numbers. The students said they cannot apply for admission for the next academic session without their roll numbers necessary to procure their marksheet that says they have been “promoted”. University officials claim they are working on the allotment of roll numbers to the students and expect the process to be completed by next week. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the university authorities, on the orders of the state government, had “promoted” more than three lakh students enrolled in different undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered by its 700 affiliated colleges without conducting an exam. But more than 50,000 first-year students of the 2020-21 session were not provided with their roll numbers, valid for the entire course period, as the admission process was closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Students of second and third year undergraduate courses and final-year post graduation already had their roll numbers which were issued in the 2019-20 session. Hence, they got their “results'' which stated they had been “promoted”. However, both undergraduate and postgraduate first-year students continue to suffer as they are yet to be allotted their roll number. The academic session for 2021-22 began in August. Shivam Kumar, an MA student, said, “I have been visiting the university offices since the last two months. We were ‘promoted’ to the next academic session without writing the exam. As first-year students, we were not provided the roll numbers. Now, I do not have a copy of my ‘result’ that says I am ‘promoted’ and so, am unable to get an admission for the next academic year.” Kunal Chaudhary, a B.Sc student, said he had applied for a roll number and first-year result five times in the last two months. “We are losing out on our studies. The university administration needs to take a time-bound action in the matter,” he added. AK Yadav, examination controller of Agra university, said, “The process to allot the roll numbers to the students will be completed in the next one week. We have informed the management of all the affiliated colleges in this regard. Students will get their roll numbers from their colleges and can check their results on the varsity website.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-months-on-50k-agra-varsity-students-awaiting-roll-number-to-get-admission-into-new-session/articleshow/87613942.cms||Deepak Lavania

The SP chief attacked CM Yogi Adityanath for his remarks that previous UP governments indulged in criminal politics. “Now look who is talking about governments being involved in criminal politics ... which UP chief minister had been booked for heinous offences … someone should at least list out the Indian Penal Code sections that were included in the criminal cases against him,” he said. UP CM should list the charges that he was accused of in the criminal cases against him which he has withdrawn,” he said. Akhilesh said now that the Supreme Court’s observations in the Lakhimpur incident have not only questioned the quality of investigation into the case but should also be seen as the stark reality of the situation prevailing in the state. “What is the Supreme Court saying? Why questions are being raised on the Special Investigating Team probing the case?” he said, adding that the SC’s suggestion that the case should be monitored by an ex-judge from another state, should be seen as a sad commentary on the state of affairs in UP. “Who is the government trying to save? The SIT has been assigned the responsibility of saving whom ?” he asked. He also accused the BJP of maintaining a well-oiled machinery to churn out ‘propaganda based on falsehood’. He said: “Ek jhoot bola jata hai uppar se, wohi jhoot chalta hai neeche tak (A lie is floating from the top and the same lie seeps down to the bottom)” he said, adding: “They (BJP) are masters in propaganda.” Asked about the government’s plans to inaugurate the Kanpur Metro, Akhilesh said it was yet another project whose foundation was laid by him and the then BJP MP was also present on stage with him. He said the BJP government should name one project it had conceived, laid foundation of and completed during its 4.5 years stint. He said the BJP should celebrate the birthday of Khanjanchi – the boy who was born (on November 9, 2016) while his mother was standing in a queue outside a bank to exchange currency following demonetisation. Akhilesh also celebrated Khanjanchi’s birthday on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sc-remarks-on-kheri-probe-show-state-govt-in-poor-light-akhilesh/articleshow/87615388.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The government is making arrangements for the puja at nearly 800 sites in the city. The district authorities are creating artificial ponds and making necessary arrangements, including tents, lights, drinking water and toilets, for the rituals on November 10-11. Rai said that no other state government was making preparations like the Kejriwal government and all the sites would be fully ready by Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, he accused the BJP of ‘ruining’ the festivities. “The BJP is threatening to perform the puja on the banks of the Yamuna despite restrictions. The restrictions have been put by the lieutenant governor who is appointed by the Centre. CM Arvind Kejriwal has not imposed any of these restrictions,” said Rai. BJP MP Manoj Tiwari blamed Kejriwal for restrictions on holding Chhath puja on Yamuna riverbanks and said that the CM was a member of DDMA, but he did not raise objections in the meeting when the ban was decided. Tiwari took a boat ride in the foam-covered Yamuna to highlight water pollution. About the pollution, Rai said: “The water in the Yamuna comes from Haryana where BJP is in power.” AAP has blamed the negligence of UP and Haryana governments for pollution in the river. Tiwari on Tuesday also visited Wazirabad and said that the untreated water flowing into the Yamuna was the main cause of pollution. “The water coming from Haryana is clean, it gets polluted mainly due to untreated water from Najafgarh drain flowing into it. Kejriwal failed to check this even after six years of coming to power,” he claimed. AAP MLA Atishi inspected Chhath ghats at Giri Nagar, Tilak Khand, Gali Number 1, Gurdwara Park, Pravasi Park, Ward 91, Astha Kunj Park and Karpuri Thakur Camp. “Our only wish is to help the people of Delhi, of Purvanchal to celebrate Chhath puja without any obstacles. Amidst the enthusiasm and the preparations, I would like to urge the people to practise great caution and strictly adhere to Covid-19 guidelines. The role of the BJP here is that of exercising and imposing its politics, while the responsibility of AAP is to help organise the puja. BJP is doing its part and we are doing ours,” Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-readies-800-ghats-across-city-for-chhath/articleshow/87614692.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Congress, BJP demand VAT cut on petrol and diesel||NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress workers on Tuesday held a dharna outside Delhi Secretariat and Delhi BJP MLAs staged a sit-in outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence for the second consecutive day demanding a reduction in value added tax on petrol and diesel by the AAP government. Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly said, in 2015, the AAP government had promised that VAT rates in Delhi would be the lowest in the next five years, but the opposite has happened. He claimed that Delhi government was charging the highest VAT on petrol and diesel in the country. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ch Anil Kumar, who led the dharna outside Delhi Secretariat, claimed that many state governments had reduced VAT on petroleum products following a nominal reduction on excise duty by the Centre, but Delhi government had not followed suit. Bidhuri also said, while the central government had given relief to people by reducing excise duty, Delhi government was not doing the same. Kumar demanded Delhi government should cut the petrol and diesel prices by Rs 10 and Rs 5, respectively, by reducing VAT on both. He said Delhiites were finding it tough to overcome financial difficulty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, unemployment and soaring prices of essential commodities. Despite repeated attempts by TOI, Delhi government did not comment on the demand made by both the parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-bjp-demand-vat-cut-on-petrol-and-diesel/articleshow/87614687.cms||---

Padma Shri Hajabba says he did it in memory of his parents||MANGALURU: Hajabba, the orange seller who was given the Padma Shri for building a school in his village, said he went barefoot to receive one of the country’s top civilian honours because he was reminded of the poverty his parents had faced. “You have seen my background,” an overwhelmed Hajabba said, when he was asked why he met the President of India barefoot. “I’m an ordinary person with no background, born in a nondescript village called Harekala. Such a person goes to receive one of the highest civilian honours, and whom do I see seated there? The President, the Vice-President, the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and a host of dignitaries,” said the fruit-seller, who was given a hero’s welcome when he landed in Mangalore airport from Delhi on Tuesday. “Then, all of a sudden, thoughts about my parents came rushing to my mind.

The treatment of non-Covid children will begin at Bytco hospital after around one-and-a-half years. An NMC health official said the number of Covid patients has reduced in the city and there are only 15 patients admitted to the Covid ward in Bytco hospital. “The civic body has decided to start non-Covid pediatric ward with 40 beds on the ground floor of the Bytco hospital. The paediatric ward is expected to start within a week,” he said. The treatment of non-Covid patients at civic-run Zakir Hussain and Bytco hospitals was stopped since March last year. The NMC had converted both the facilities to Covid hospitals last year where patients from Nashik city, rural and nearby areas were treated. While Zakir Hussain hospital had a total of 150 Covid beds, including 130 with oxygen support, Bytco hospital had a total of 800 beds — 600 with oxygen support. “We already have a pediatric ward at the old Bytco hospital with 20 beds, but it is inadequate. Hence, we have decided to expand our pediatric beds by adding a special pediatric ward at Bytco with 40 beds,” the official said. “We already have six pediatricians at both the new and old Bytco hospital. We have given a proposal to municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav and will start a pediatric ward once we get his approval. The municipal commissioner has already instructed us to start non-Covid treatment gradually at both the civic hospitals,” he added. Zakir Hussain hospital, which is located in the heart of the city, has already provided 100 out of the total 150 beds for treatment of non-Covid patients. “The major objective is to complete vaccination of all the beneficiaries in the city at the earliest to prevent spread of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-start-non-covid-paediatric-ward-at-bytco/articleshow/87612073.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Nagpur||Bhandara fire puts big question mark on govt duty to provide healthcare to poor: HC||Nagpur: Terming the fire incident at Bhandara District General Hospital where ten newborns were killed as “horrifying”, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court said it puts a big question mark on the Maharashtra government’s duty of providing health services to poor strata of the society. Though the judgement came earlier, the government seems to have failed to learn the lessons, as 11 Covid-19 patients died in similar fire incident at Ahmednagar’s government hospital on Saturday morning. “The occurrence puts the entire society in shock and requires a thorough investigation. Since the petitioners were only on duty to take care at the relevant time, their custodial interrogation is necessary,” Justice Vinay Joshi held, before rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of two nurses who were charged with the alleged negligence. A massive fire at 2 am after midnight at the Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) of the hospital on January 9, probably due to short circuit, had sparked off a massive outrage in the entire country with the Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordering a probe. Petitioners – Shubhangi Sathawane and Sunita Masulkar – had approached the HC after the Bhandara police booked them under Sections 304 read with 34 of IPC for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Pointing out that the Section 304 did not apply to them, they contended that the were not responsible for the tragic accident. The judge, who had earlier granted an interim protection to both petitioners, clarified that undeniably, at the relevant time both were on duty and were entrusted with the work of taking care of babies throughout the night. “The CCTV footage disclosed that there was continuous sparking for 11 minutes at outborn ward. It was a glass unit, meaning thereby, visible from outside. It was the primary duty of staff nurses to monitor the ward, but it went unnoticed, which prima facie speaks about their total non-attentiveness. “Moreover, a sweeper in his statement stated that Shubhangi was talking on mobile for hours together. These facts primarily show that though it was an accidental fire, the petitioners failed in their duties to take reasonable care, for which they were meant for,” he said. Stressing that no opinion can be formed whether the case falls outside the purview of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the judge said there is prima facie material directly pointing towards inaction on the part of both petitioners. “Being staff nurses on duty, they can easily foresee the consequent result of their inaction. In view of that, these are not the fit cases to grant pre-arrest protection. Hence, both applications are rejected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bhandara-fire-puts-big-question-mark-on-govt-duty-to-provide-healthcare-to-poor-hc/articleshow/87614706.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The gang of robbers that has several cases of dacoity registered against it has been booked under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized Crime (GujCTOC) Act. “The three members of the gang were remanded to police custody for seven days by the court on November 6. The gang was nabbed in October and was remanded to three days of police custody earlier. But the police later booked them under GujCTOC Act and sought its remand again,” said Raghuvir Pandya, special public prosecutor. The gang of three including Jaysinh Palash, Dilip Baria and Nikesh Palash, all residents of Dahod, are booked for 16 offences in 13 districts of Gujarat. Pandya said that they have committed loot and dacoity in Junagadh, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Dwarka, Dahod, Morbi and other districts. “The remand was sought for gathering details about the gang’s modus operandi and how they managed to do recce in different districts. They must have got local support so the cops are now trying to find out if any more persons are involved in the crime,” Pandya told TOI. The gang will be taken to different districts during the period of remand.

The Karnataka health and family welfare department issued a circular on Monday that said passengers must carry a valid return ticket and must be vaccinated against Covid-19 with both doses of vaccine to enjoy the exemption. Also, the travellers must have no Covid symptoms and provide a mandatory self-declaration form on arrival by road, air or train. Those coming from Maharashtra for a stay beyond two days must carry a negative RT-PCR report at the time of entering Karnataka. The decision follows a meeting of the technical advisory committee which recommended that RT-PCR relaxation could be offered to short-term visitors coming in from Maharashtra following vast improvement in the Covid-19 situation. The meeting noted that Maharashtra’s test positivity rate is slightly higher than that of Karnataka in terms of daily caseload.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 9-year-old’s blood not detected on clothes of accused, say cops||NEW DELHI: Police have told a Delhi court that semen could not be detected from the clothes of the four accused or burnt cloth pieces of a 9-year-old dalit girl who was allegedly gang-raped and forcefully cremated at Delhi Cantonment area in August. According to the FSL report filed with the supplementary chargesheet filed in the case, semen was also not detected from the bedsheet seized from the room of the accused at the crematorium. In the supplementary chargesheet filed before Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar against four accused— Radhey Shyam, Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan—the FSL report further stated that the victim’s blood was not detected from the clothes of the accused, the bedsheet or on the burnt clothes of the deceased. Police, however, said that Singh’s own blood was found from his shorts and handkerchief. “DNA profiling performed on the exhibits provided is sufficient to conclude that the DNA profile generated from the source of exhibit ‘12’ (blood on gauze) of accused Kuldeep Singh was found to be matching with DNA profile generated from the source of exhibit 8‘d’ (short/nikar) and ‘8e’ (handkerchief) of accused Kuldeep Singh,” the chargesheet stated. It further said that the entry made in the “dead body entry register of cremation ground” on August 1 matched with the specimen signatures of the accused, Shyam, who was the crematorium priest. “Hence, it is evident that the entries in the register were made by accused Shyam,” it claimed. Police, in its first chargesheet, had alleged that Shyam had manipulated the timing of death of the minor girl in the register to destroy evidence. Police had filed the chargesheet for the offences of rape, wrongful confinement, murder, destruction of evidence, and under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It was alleged in the chargesheet that the minor girl was suffocated to death during sexual assault by Shyam.

The blood test is conducted after 8pm to identify the presence of microfilaria which causes lymphatic filaria. The health department’s plan is to eradicate indigenous cases from Ernakulam by 2023. Posing a challenge to the initiative, 18 guest workers have been found carriers of the infection this year despite limited screening due to Covid. The health department conducted mass drug administration against lymphatic filaria in all populations in the district from 2004 to 2016. The current blood test is conducted in children born after the drug administration. The blood test of around 800 children will be conducted at 16 centres in Ernakulam. “No indigenous cases have been reported in Ernakulam in the past five years. We had also conducted blood tests of around 3,000 children in the same age group in 2015, 2017 and 2019. No indigenous case was reported then too and that is why the district has been selected by the health ministry for the eradication programme,” said Abdul Jabbar, senior biologist in vector control unit. The screening among guest workers has been strengthened. Those susceptible to the infection have been given three DCC tablets of 100mg each and Albendazole-400mg as a single dose per year. Those testing positive have been given treatment for 12 days. Lymphatic filaria affects the legs, hands, breast and genitals. Surgery is conducted on genitals to cure the infection. If there is delay in approaching hospitals, the infection can adversely affect the fertility of the patient. One can get infected by mosquito biteas it is a carrier of microfilaria worms. During the day, the filaria worms remain dormant in the blood and liver. It comes out after 8pm and hence blood tests are conducted at night. An adult worm can reproduce microfilaria worms for up to five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/blood-tests-done-in-kids-to-eradicate-lymphatic-filaria/articleshow/87613951.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The picture of BHU founder Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya, was, however, missing from the poster, they said. The students, who met the dean to register their protest and submit a memorandum in this episode, alleged that Urdu department authorities not only skipped the image of Pt Malviya in their poster but they used a photo of Allama Iqbal. Both acts were unacceptable, said the students demanding action in this episode. Following an uproar on social media, the poster was removed from the FB page and the Urdu department apologized. The dean of the faculty of arts also formed a committee to probe into the matter. The Urdu department authorities replaced the poster on its Facebook page and tweeted, “Urdu Department, Faculty of Arts, #BHU, is organizing a webinar as per the details given in the poster. Sincerest apologies for the inadvertent mistake in the earlier poster that went viral on social media.” BHU spokesman Rajesh Singh said, “The Urdu department of the faculty of Arts (BHU) had organised a webinar on the role of Allama Iqbal in the growth of Urdu on the occasion of Urdu Day on Tuesday. The department had uploaded the poster of the webinar on its FB page on Monday carrying the photograph of the Urdu poet. When attention of the Urdu department officials was drawn towards the issue, they removed the poster on Sunday late evening.” “The poster was replaced by another poster which contained the image of BHU founder.

---||Mumbai||Prioritise kids with conditions like obesity for vaccination: Task force to Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The state’s paediatric task force has advised priority Covid-19 vaccination of children with obesity, malnutrition, juvenile diabetes and nine other medical conditions in its recommendations submitted to the Maharashtra government recently. The task force comprising eminent child specialists made it clear vaccination was not mandatory for attending school. They urged parents to send children to school and not to unduly suspend/delay school attendance over vaccination. The two Covid vaccines — ZyCoV-D and Covaxin — meant for children in the 2-18 years age bracket are likely to be introduced together under the country’s Covid immunisation programme by December-end. “The Centre will prioritise Covid-19 vaccination for children with pre-existing illnesses. For this, we have shortlisted 11 underlying medical conditions (and those kids who have been operated on). We have recommended the state government to prioritise these children with co-morbidities as Covid shots won’t be available for healthy kids initially,” senior paediatrician and task force member Pramod Jog told TOI. “The task force has made the recommendations after studying the data of children in Maharashtra who developed serious Covid illness during the second wave. The recommendations are expected to help the state government prioritise Covid vaccination among the state’s high-risk adolescents ahead of the nationwide rollout of ZyCov-D and Covaxin,” said Jog. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, was the first vaccine in the country to receive the emergency use authorisation (EUA) for children aged 12 and above. Covaxin also received EUA for 2-18 year olds. The Union government will also be issuing guidelines on vaccinating high-risk children. “We analysed the common risk factors that made some children vulnerable and those that went on to develop serious Covid illness. Our recommendations are expected to lend deeper insights while prioritising vaccination among the high-risk adolescents,” said Jog. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, stressed on parents’ education about not delaying school attendance over vaccination. “The task force has made it clear time and again that Covid vaccination is not a prerequisite for attending schools. Besides, the Covid vaccines will not be available to healthy children initially. Hence, we appeal to parents to send children to schools. The benefits of sending children to school far outweigh various risks involved in not sending,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prioritise-kids-with-conditions-like-obesity-for-vaccination-task-force-to-maharashtra/articleshow/87614710.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Maharashtra registered 982 cases, including 274 cases from Mumbai. Deaths increased in Maharashtra from 15 on Monday to 27 on Tuesday. Mumbai registered only one death—the daily toll was zero on October 17 and one on September 21. “We conducted over 31,000 tests and plan to increase it further now that the festival season is over,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Monday.

Again, the timing could not have been better as November and December has 13 auspicious dates. Weddings are a big driver of hospitality business in the tourist state. While corona may have receded, the industry is not out of woods given the fact that foreign tourist movement is yet to start. After the new Covid guidelines lifted the cap on number of people in weddings, the hospitality industry is upbeat about making the most of the season. “The removal of restrictions will give the much needed relief that the industry was looking for. Bigger weddings will all the ecosystem players. The full impact will help the economy shift to a higher gear,” said Rajesh Rajpurohit, general manager of a leading hotel in the city. Hoteliers said that the industry has been recovering but the new guidelines quicken the pace of recovery. Rishi Mattu, general manager of another leading hotel, said, “There are a large number of vendors and ancillary service providers who constitute a critical part of any wedding. Also, the operations would require a large number of people. The government decision will have a huge positive impact on the industry and the general economy.” Despite the recovery, many hotels have not been able to operate fully. The workforce engaged in the industry is still far below the pre-Covid levels. The restriction had a major role to play besides the obstacles the tourism industry faced. Experts in the industry said that the growing wedding segment has been a major reason for many investments in the hospitality industry. The revenues of many hotels are hitched to the segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lifting-of-covid-curbs-is-key-to-recovery-of-hospitality-industry/articleshow/87615392.cms||---

The domino effect is affecting the quality of education, and to some extent denting the university’s stature. The state government’s ban on recruitment of teaching posts has stopped the varsity from filling up the remaining approved posts. The varsity has contracted 100 teachers through its funds to fill the gaps in some departments. The vacant posts constitute nearly 55% of those that have got the approval. Registrar of SPPU, Prafulla Pawar, said, “The university has to allocate a part of its funds for contractual staff in order to lessen the burden on the present staff with the large amount of vacancies.” Annually, the SPPU spends Rs 3.5 crore for their salaries. About 100 teachers have been appointed on contractual basis through the university funds burdening the university’s annual budget. The geography and chemistry departments have the highest number of vacancies. For instance, in the chemistry department, posts for professor, associate professor, assistant professor as well as the post of assistant librarian are vacant. Member of the management committee of SPPU, Rajesh Pande, said that the state universities, association of university teachers and professors and also some experts in education field have constantly been demanding that the vacant posts be filled up. “We have communicated this to the state ministry of higher and technical education. However, the state government has only been making promises, without any action. Against this background, the recruitment of university staff must begin immediately. A proposal to this effect has been sent to the state government,” he added. In January 2020, state minister of higher and technical Education, Uday Samant had announced that 111 vacant teaching posts in SPPU, would soon be filled as there is a shortage of teaching staff. “SPPU has been expanding, enrolment of students has increased, and several professors have retired. Hence, the university has outsourced professors to run the varsity smoothly. But this cannot be a long-term solution,” Samant had then said. Better research quality without duplicity, impetus to industrial and social problems, interdisciplinary approach in undergraduate courses, re-imagining courses with help from industry experts were suggestions from academicians and industry experts for the university’s post-pandemic plan for the next 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/recruitment-ban-over-55-sppu-teaching-posts-vacant/articleshow/87613955.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Freshers may not go to campus right now||KOLKATA: Campuses may reopen on November 16 but undergraduate first-semester students, who have just taken admission, are not likely to get a taste of campus life right away. Jadavpur University, which held a stakeholders’ meeting on Tuesday, decided to reopen in phases and to allow all its PhD and MPhil students to resume on-campus work from next Tuesday. For the rest, it wants the different departments to decide which semester students to call for offline studies. Presidency University has also left it to individual departments to decide. Following a meeting with the heads of 68 departments on Tuesday, Calcutta University has decided to call only third-semester postgraduate students to the campus from November 16. Rabindra Bharati University held two meetings with the teachers’ organisation and students’ body and decided to start with both UG and PG terminal-semester students. RBU wants to prioritize practical classes. “Heads of of 68 departments took a uniform decision to start offline classes with third-semester students. Departments with large number of students, like commerce and business management, may have blended mode and they will set their own timetable,” said CU vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee. First-year PG students will continue to have online studies. The university authority might provide hostel facility to the third-semester students if they applied, she said. At JU, where all PhD and MPhil students will be allowed on the campus from next week, the Arts faculty will call one UG year and one PG year first. But it is up to each of the departments to choose the year. Science faculty will call UG-II and PG-1 after November 16 and engineering PG first-year. Different engineering departments will take their own decisions on PG-II and PG-III semsters. Engineering UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV semesters would continue with online learning, sources said. Presidency registrar Debajyoti Konar said, “The government order on Covid-safety protocols will be followed. Academic and administrative committees will discuss in detail and finalise the method”. RBU said its terminal-semester students will attend offline classes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and online classes on Mondays and Fridays.

---||Delhi||Street vendors in Delhi: Temporary stalls, permanent row||NEW DELHI: Who is a street vendor? This answer to this question can ease the chaos in the city markets but for the moment, there is no certainty on which individual is an approved street seller. Not everyone can be allowed to start hawking wares on the streets, Delhi High Court recently noted. It directed Delhi government and the civic bodies to properly implement the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The court expects the three municipal corporations and New Delhi Municipal Council to tell it of the steps taken on the problem of illegal hawking at the next hearing on November 18. While the basic outline for hawking in the capital was presented in 2004’s Hawking Policy of the then Congress government, the Street Vendors Act, passed by Parliament in 2014, is the touchstone of the business. This legislation empowers town vending committees (TVC) to identify hawkers and hawking zones and is considered the one-stop solution for problems related to street vending in Delhi. Each TVC comprises 30 members drawn from among the stakeholders. The panel has the power to identify hawking zones, authorise a vendor and cancel the hawking certificate, among other important responsibilities. Of the 30 members, 12 are street vendors elected by identified street vendors in specific areas. The problem has been in constituting the TVCs and in 2016, Delhi High Court questioned the delay in forming the panels. In September 2019, the state government, for the first time, notified 28 committees across Delhi. The first task of the panels was to conduct a survey to identify street vendors. Though supposed to be completed in a month, the process is still going on at the moment. The distrust between the hawkers and the TVCs has been a spoke in the wheels. “Delhi High Court has been misled by the traders and based on the complaints of a few residents’ and market associations, it is directing the treatment of street vendors as encroachers and squatters,” argued Anil Bakshi, secretary, National Hawkers’ Federation. “Thousands of livelihoods are under threat and this is a violation of the right to life and livelihood. The Street Vendors Act recognises the hawkers as an inseparable part of the urban economy.” However, traders’ associations in major markets like Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar and Chandni Chowk have approached court on the issue of hawking. “We do not have a problem with people carrying out business, but this has to be done in an organised manner without creating problems for others,” reasoned Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association, a union of shop owners of Connaught Place. “We are fighting to preserve the beauty of this iconic market and its unique atmosphere.” Bhargava added that market associations were handicapped in presenting their views because they are underrepresented in the TVCs. The president of Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal, Sanjay Bhargava, similarly complained, “Delhi government has ignored the recommendations of the municipal corporations regarding the membership of the vending committees. Such lopsided committees will not be able to resolve the problem.” At Sarojini Nagar, Ashok Randhawa, president of the Mini Market Association, talked of the woes the shop owners faced because of the proliferation of hawkers in the area. “Our market is facing a very bad situation, with so many illegal hawkers coming into the market and crowding the lanes. They are a huge security threat as well,” said Randhawa. “We are fighting our case in the court, but the civic authorities are turning up with no answer. We aren’t against anyone, just that designated spots are required for business activities.” Under the Act, the TVCs are responsible for identifying hawking and non-hawking zones in specific city areas. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said, “We have constituted the committees. The survey work is now over, so we will soon identify the vending and non-vending zones.” A Delhi government official confirmed that the three municipal corporations, tasked with carrying out the survey, had completed the step. “There was some delay because of the Covid-19 lockdown and the assembly elections earlier,” the official said. “However, NDMC is unnecessarily delaying the survey. We have given it two more months to finish the survey and enable us to take the next step.” According to the government, 70,000 street vendors have been identified by the three corporations till now. Their personal details have been obtained. Proof in the form of civic body or police challans establishing that they were engaged in hawking before 2014, when the Act came into effect, have also been collected. The street vendors have been geo-tagged for monitoring of their presence and location. The Street Vendors Act mandates 2.5% of the city’s population as being eligible for street vending. The Act recognises two types of vendors — mobile and stationary sellers. In Delhi, there are around 6,500 hawkers authorised under the tehbazaari system. Since 1957, these vendors have been getting relief from various courts to prevent their ouster from the streets. The fee for this kind of street vending ranges from Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 per month, depending on the location. National Hawkers’ Federation’s Bakshi hold firmly to the belief that the solution to the problem of illegal hawking is their validation and identification of their business zones by the TVCs. There is ambiguity in these areas at the moment, and there is ample reason to think that the hawkers are currently operating in connivance with civic officials, the cops and the traders themselves. As Madan, who sells cloth masks in Lajpat Nagar Market, admitted to TOI: “I pay money every week to the shop owner to stand here and carry on with my business. Police personnel too ask for their share, and if we do not give in, they seize our goods. It is better to pay a certain amount and keep the business running than to fight with the cops and the traders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/street-vendors-temporary-stalls-permanent-row/articleshow/87634486.cms||---
---||Goa||Navy extends submarine rescue support in IOR||Panaji: In a rare tour of the capabilities of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV), the Indian Navy on Tuesday offered delegates from foreign navies a potential opportunity to formalise a pact for submarine rescue support. Heads of maritime forces from 12 Indian Ocean nations, including Bangladesh, Comoros, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand were given a chance to witness the capabilities of the DSRV and the destroyer INS Kochi at Mormugao Port Trust. “The Indian Navy has already proven the capability to carry out a rescue operation using the DSRV for submarines operated by the Navy. The purpose of this visit by the foreign delegation is to show the other submarine operating nations who do not have the rescue system,” said Captain Koushik Hota, officer-in-charge of the submarine rescue unit (West). Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, Singapore and Malaysia are among the few friendly nations that operate submarines in the Indian Ocean Region. The Indian Navy is one of the few countries around the world to operate two DSRVs that are capable of rescuing crew from disabled submarines that are at a depth of up to 651m. “There are some nations that have their own rescue system but they would like to collaborate for a submarine rescue exercise or in an actual eventuality. The purpose is to introduce them to our system and should any of them be interested, we can have further implementing agreements with details of how we will cooperate in case of an actual incident or for an exercise,” Hota told reporters. In April, the Indonesian submarine KRI Nanggala 402 sank off the coast of Bali, killing all the 53 crew on board. India mobilised the DSRV to assist in the search but the mission was called off after the disabled submarine was found, broken into at least three parts, at the bottom of the Bali Sea. The DSRV system consists of a Submarine Rescue Vessel, a Remote Operations Vehicle, Side Scan Sonar and associated equipment. The system can be rapidly mobilised by air or road to facilitate submarine rescue operations even at distant locations. There are about 40 nations that operate submarines around the world but only a few have any form of submarine rescue capability. In January this year, India and Singapore inked an agreement on submarine rescue support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-extends-submarine-rescue-support-in-ior/articleshow/87614721.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Speedy start: Kanpur Metro trials beat Lucknow’s by 69 days, claims UPMRC||Lucknow: For Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, a key agenda to zip state economy on a growing track is direct and fast connectivity, which becomes evidently visible when the state’s ambitious project of Metro connectivity is considered. According to Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation, trail run for Kanpur Metro priority corridor beat Lucknow’s priority corridor trails by a margin of 69 days. The unique record became the centre of attention also because the project was halted for four and a half months during the corona pandemic period. The Corporation claimed that it took 795 days for the Lucknow Metro to start. The construction of Lucknow Metro started on September 28, 2014, and trail run was conducted on December 1, 2016. While in Kanpur Metro project, the construction started on November 15, 2019, and first official trial will begin on Wednesday post flag off by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In total, it took only 726 days for Kanpur Metro to start trials. Speaking on anonymity, a senior engineer of UPMRC said, “There are four prime reasons behind the unique record of Kanpur Metro. First, we used double T-girders to erect the station concourse. It was for the first time in India for the Metro project that girders were pre-casted at the factory floor and then brought to the construction site which were installed with the help of heavy lifter cranes. This method helped us to save time.” “Secondly, we utilized the corona pandemic lockdown as an opportunity by expediting the construction in those areas of the Metro corridor which were often heavily congested during normal days. In order to ensure that labour is available during the corona pandemic, we constructed a labour colony and provided a food canteen, shelter with attached toilets and drinking water facilities. In fact, the project was halted for four and a half months in the pandemic and we arranged transportation facilities for those labourers who wanted to visit their villages to meet their dear ones. Such steps built confidence and motivated them to return and work for the project,” said the officer. “Thirdly, we had crystal clear understanding with construction contractors. If they had any issues be it financial, material or anything else the contractors were asked to directly contact senior officials for immediate remedies. Lastly, we kept the uniform standard for the entire project — which means almost every girder or pillar is similar, which helped contractors to expedite the construction,” said the corporation engineer. Kanpur Metro priority corridor is 9-km-long and stretches between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel with nine stations, while Lucknow Metro trail stretch had eight stations in 8.7- km-long stretch between Transport Nagar and Charbagh. The Kanpur Metro project is funded by the European Investment Bank. Around 650 million euros (Rs 11,076 crore) is being pumped into the project to construct two corridors, including a 23.7-km-long stretch between IIT-Kanpur and Naubasta and 8.6-km stretch between Agriculture University and Barra - sector 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/speedy-start-kanpur-metro-trials-beat-lucknows-by-69-days-claims-upmrc/articleshow/87615402.cms||Arvind Chauhan

But this time, things will be a little different with fewer restrictions. Marriage managers facing slump since March 2020 when the government had introduced many restrictions due to outbreak of Covid-19 are now upbeat about the coming season. Since the government in its fresh guidelines permitted closed and open spaces for organising marriages with Covid protocol, the marriage managers and all those involved in a wedding function from food caterer, decorators, bandwallahs and other are hoping to get an increased number of guests for full-fledged functions. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, people had to organise their weddings on their own when the respective homes of bridegrooms and brides worked as the marriage venue with lowest number of guests. In its guidelines the state government on September 17 had allowed 200 guests in weddings, while in Monday’s guidelines no number is given. “We are told that we can have 50% guests of the total capacity of a marriage venue,” said Arshad Hussain, a Jaipur-based wedding planner and event manger. Marriage managers stated that their clients have now arranged marriages as three-day affair. “They have now asking us to organise the three functions from mehandi, ladies sangeet and the main function. After March 2020, this would be the time when we have got bookings for winter marriage season,” said Mohit Sand, a Jaipur-based wedding manager who organises marriages in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Delhi. Though no NRI weddings have been planned so far in Rajasthan, marriage managers are hoping if Covid-19 cases continue to drop globally till January, the February marriage season will certainly bring NRIs to Rajasthan. “Presently we are only getting queries from them to know the status of Covid and restrictions but no bookings so far,” said Sand. Likewise, marriage managers will have to make some extra additions in the weddings. “We will have to provide masks and sanitisers to the visiting guests and also sanitiser dispensers need to be kept. That has been cleared to our clients and this will add to the cost. Hopefully winter marriage season starting from November 15 will bail us all out of crisis,” said Arshad Hussain, another wedding planner and event manager said. As per the Hindu calendar in the month of November the auspicious dates for weddings are November 15, November 16, November 20, November 21, November 28, November 29 and November 30. “For November 15 we are booked in six weddings in Jaipur. Hopefully it goes well and Covid-19 cases further dip so that we may continue with the work,” said Aadil Rafique who owns a marriage band in the walled city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/band-baaja-baraat-season-back-planners-upbeat/articleshow/87615398.cms||Ashish Mehta

Delhi Police told Justice Yogesh Khanna, who was hearing the parents’ petition for the constitution of an SIT for a court-monitored probe, that after the filing of the chargesheets, the matter was now listed for framing of charges before the trial court. On providing fulltime security to two other witnesses, it said there were many cases pending against them and there was no cogent material to show any threat perception. The investigating agency informed that the four accused were still in judicial custody. Considering that the matter was now under trial, the court said that nothing further was required and disposed of the parents’ petition even as it clarified that, in case the two other witnesses in the case seek assistance, the mobile numbers of the beat constable should be provided to them. The minor girl died under suspicious circumstances on August 1 even as her parents alleged that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a crematorium’s priest in southwest Delhi’s Old Nangal village. In their plea, the parents had stated that they had “no faith in the present investigation.” They claimed that they belonged to the poorest section of society and were illiterate and under the force and influence of various groups having vested interest.

Talking to reporters in the city on Tuesday, Senthil Balaji refuted the allegations that the DMK government lacked preparedness to handle the monsoon. “If opposition parties who are criticising us had done their job well, this situation wouldn’t have come,’’ he said. Senthil Balaji wanted the critics to point out what exactly was lacking on the part of the state government rather than issuing sweeping statements. He said the electricity department was taking efforts to ensure uninterrupted power supply across the state despite heavy rains. “Electricity board staff have been put on alert to redress complaints immediately and sort out supply related issues,’’ he said. He said that committees have been formed in all districts headed by the respective collectors in which TNEB officials are members to monitor the situation and take necessary action. He said that one lakh electric poles, besides other equipment, are kept ready to meet any demand. “Chief minister M K Stalin has instructed that there should not be any hinderance to power supply,’’ he said. Accusing the previous AIADMK government of poor maintenance of the power supply apparatus, he said that during an inspection in Chennai it was found that electricity sub-stations were below surface level. “These things could have been identified earlier and should have redressed. The CM has instructed that the pillar boxes in substations should be at a height of one metre above ground level,’’ he said. As far as Coimbatore is concerned, he said the district administration is geared up to tackle the situation. On his Makkal Sabhai meetings in Coimbatore, Balaji said he has visited 44 places so far across the district and collected 27,000 petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/min-blames-aiadmk-govt-for-flooding-in-chennai/articleshow/87614741.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||NCRA team spots pulsars’ eclipse mechanism cause||Pune: A group of scientists working at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune have unravelled the eclipse mechanisms for millisecond pulsars (MSP) using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Pulsars are dead stars that act like celestial lighthouses sending periodic flashes of radio light. Eclipses in millisecond pulsars have been known since the 1980s, but the exact cause of these eclipses have not been understood till now. Being extremely stable rotators, MSPs act as laboratories for the study of matter in extreme conditions. MSPs often have orbital companions. Devojyoti Kansabanik, a PhD student at NCRA, and other scientists could distinctively spot a spider MSP, J1544+4937, discovered by GMRT in 2013. The unique wide bandwidth sensitive observations allowed the authors to clearly measure how the eclipse depends on the radio frequency, particularly during the transitions as the pulsar went into and came out of the eclipse. Lead author Kansabanik said, “We could determine the mechanism of the eclipses for a spider MSP unambiguously for the first time. There are several possible mechanisms like refraction, scattering and different types of absorptions of radio emission from the pulsar by the materials ejected from the companion star. Our study could distinctively spot that the eclipse is caused due to absorption by the magnetized materials ejected from the companion star and ruled out other possible mechanisms.’’ Their study was published in the Astrophysical Journal on October 13. The team observed a spider MSP, which had been discovered earlier at the GMRT in 2013, using the upgraded uGMRT. The unique wide bandwidth sensitive observations of the radio telescope allowed the scientists to clearly measure how the eclipse depends on the radio frequency, particularly during the transitions as the pulsar went into and came out of the eclipse. Kansabanik’s guide, Bhaswati Bhattchayya also from NCRA, said, “Using the wide bandwidth capability of the uGMRT, we could study the eclipsing seamlessly from 300 to 850 MHz, and determine the starting frequency of the frequency-dependent eclipse with 20 times better accuracy than the previous estimations. This allowed us to study the cause of frequency-dependent eclipsing for the first time by studying broadband radio spectrum, a crucial discriminator between different eclipse mechanisms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncra-team-spots-pulsars-eclipse-mechanism-cause/articleshow/87613959.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

They said they carried out the search in the evening following clashes earlier in the day. However, jail officials have remained tight-lipped about the recovery, refusing to comment, saying the developments are part of an ongoing judicial inquiry. This comes after a post-mortem on Monday confirmed that an undertrial prisoner, Shivam Thakur, 26, had died due to a “gunshot injury”. A senior IPS official confirmed the seizure of arms to TOI but refused to divulge details. Superintendent of police of Fatehgarh, Ashok Kumar Meena, also confirmed the seizure of at least one country-made pistol and said that it was found inside the main boundary of the jail. He added that efforts were on to find out how it reached there. TOI had earlier reported that the investigation will be carried out by a three-member "high-level team" of jail officials, which would go into the reason that triggered the violence that left many prisoners and 30 cops injured. When contacted, director general (prison), Anand Kumar, said that the team will probe all aspects of the case. He said that as a corrective measure, concertina wires (a type of barbed wire that can be shaped in coils) are to be installed in the jail, as many prisoners had climbed on the terrace on the day of the riots. Other steps will be taken after the probe team submits its report. On Tuesday, a joint initial report prepared by the inspector general of police (Kanpur range), Prashant Kumar, and divisional commissioner of Kanpur, Raj Shekhar, was submitted to the government in connection with the riots and arson inside the jail. Meanwhile, contrary to the claims of the Fatehgarh police that a convicted prisoner, Sandeep Yadav, whose death sparked the violence on Sunday, had died due to Dengue, medical authorities at the University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, where he was admitted, have said that he had tested negative for the disease. Confirming this, medical superintendent of the university, Dr Adesh Kumar, said that Yadav’s report for Dengue was “negative”. He said that the patient’s medical diagnosis was “acute febrile encephalopathy with sepsis” (infection) and "severe thrombocytopenia" (low blood platelet count) with septic shock (a serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure levels). He was admitted to the hospital on November 5 at 9:54 pm and died the next day at 7:54 pm. He was on a ventilator during his stay and was brought to the hospital in a state of "dizziness". Meena claimed that Yadav, who had been in the district jail since 2012, was sentenced to life in prison in a dowry death case, and was suffering from Dengue. He said that he was taken to Saifai PGI for treatment, where he died due to the disease. TOI had earlier reported that jail inmates blamed authorities for callousness as Yadav had told them he was feeling "very unwell" on October 28. A letter, purportedly written by Yadav to district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Singh, mentioned that, sources said. Despite being informed about his condition, deputy jailor S K Sonkar allegedly didn’t shift him to a hospital. "I was only given some tablets, which did not give me relief," the letter states. Fellow prisoners had also requested the district magistrate to send Yadav to a hospital outside the jail as his condition was deteriorating and he was unable to eat anything.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/police-find-illegal-weapon-live-cartridges-in-fatehgarh-jail-after-riots/articleshow/87613960.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

City police commissoner N Shashi Kumar said on Tuesday that four teams with ACP (South sub-division) Ranjith Kumar Bhandaru as the investigating officer, have been working on the case, and are making efforts to trace the accused. “We have sent a requisition to banks to freeze his 12 bank accounts. Further, the police have also issued a lookout circular. On information that he has travelled to Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Goa, the police in these states have been alerted, and information has been shared in Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, English and Telugu about the accused. The lookout circular has been issued against K S N Rajesh and Achut K B,49, a resident of Uttarayana Halli, Bengaluru, for assisting and harbouring the accused. They are both absconding in a Renault Duster vehicle. On October 18 two cases were booked at the women’s police station against the accused. The police had booked advocate and special public prosecutor for the Lokayukta K S N Rajesh on the charge of sexually harassing a law student. In another complaint, a friend of the victim had accused activist Pavitra Acharya of taking her to a police station and abusing, threatening and forcing her to sign a document. The city police commissioner had also suspended a police inspector and constable pending inquiry based on the complaint filed by the victim’s friend. Shashi Kumar said that two people have been arrested so far in the case. The police have arrested K Ananth Bhat,48, from Bondel, the friend of the accused, and Pavithra Acharya. Recently, the sixth additional district session court had rejected two anticipatory bail petitions filed by Rajesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/sexual-harassment-lookout-notice-issued-against-advocate/articleshow/87612929.cms||---

Activities like walking, running, cycling, skating, street games, music band, painting, dancing, performing arts, yoga, aerobics and Zumba will be organised during the event. The first event will be organised on November 14 in Patparganj. The central idea of these events is to allow people experience a street without cars, which can help them reimagine what the streets can be, and inculcate important behavioural changes in how one sees the streets and environment. “It is our collective duty to come forward and reduce pollution on individual and community level. We can together build a foundation for a healthier Delhi by taking small steps, such as switching off vehicles at traffic signals and switching to public transport,” said deputy CM Manish Sisodia. Vice-chairperson of DDC Jasmine Shah said Raahgiri Foundation had pioneered the model of bringing together communities around the issues of sustainable mobility, safe streets and reducing environmental footprint since 2013. “It is our pleasure to collaborate with them to take this message to different parts of Delhi through six events over the next three months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dialogue-panel-to-hold-6-raahgiri-day-events/articleshow/87614746.cms||---

---||Pune||Bhimnagar residents slam trash dumping near stream||Pune: Residents of Bhimnagar in Kondhwa have urged the civic authorities to clean a stream leading to the Bhairoba nullah while expressing strong resentment over its use as garbage dump. The stream is located next to a slum with about 350 settlements. A resident of the area said, “The boundary wall, damaged during the flood two years ago, has not been reconstructed despite repeated requests and follow-ups with the corporator. During rain, the garbage along with water floats into our homes.” “The waste creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes and insects. Dengue cases have been reported from two-three homes this month,” said another resident. Rohan Gaikwad, MNS (Maharashtra Navnirman Sena) prabhag president, NIBM-Mohammedwadi, submitted a memorandum to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday. After meeting residents at his office, Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC, said, “Instructions have been issued to the concerned department to clean the stream and its banks. We have to check the ownership of the land before we can build a boundary wall. Work is on to clean the chronic spots, which can be done through efficient and frequent collection of garbage. Corporator Nanda Lonkar said she has received a sanction of Rs10lakh to rebuild the boundary wall. Dead newborn found amidst garbage During the Diwali weekend, some residents spotted the body of a baby on the bank of the Bhairobanala.

---||Nagpur||Deny ‘Covid hospital’ status without fire safety compliance: Divisional commissioner||Nagpur: Getting ‘Covid hospital’ status without meeting the set standard of fire and electrical safety protocols would now be difficult. On Tuesday, divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma urged the collectors of six districts, during a review meeting in the backdrop of Ahmednagar tragedy, to act tough with the hospitals not complying with the fire and electrical safety norms and standard protocols set forth during the expert audits. The senior IAS officer has asked the collectors to act ‘consciously’ and ‘judiciously’ with the hospitals not having fire safety compliance while approving their Covid status in case there is a spike in numbers of cases. The district administrations has been urged by the divisional commissioner to start meeting with the stakeholders to ensure fire and electrical safety norms are being complied and adhered to by the private hospitals. Lavangare-Verma has also asked the collectors of six districts to release budgets through District planning council’s (DPC) Covid fund for the government hospitals to meet the fire and electrical safety standards as per the audit requirements. The divisional commissioner has also stressed on the Nagpur pattern measure where the collector has already released DPC Covid funds for upgrading the fire and electrical safety measures at government hospitals following safety audits post Bhandara tragedy of January this year when the fire at district government hospital had claimed lives of around 10 new-borns at the neo-natal intensive care unit. Apart from Nagpur, Gondia and Bhandara collectors are also learnt to have released DPC Covid funds for complying with the fire and electrical safety norms. Lavangare-Verma has also asked the collectors and technical experts from different departments to contemplate installing ‘gas detectors or alarms’ following a deliberation at chief secretary level review meeting. “These gas alarms or detectors would be able to detect any concentration or accumulation of any combustible gases like oxygen inside the ICUs or such spaces at hospital where their usage is higher,” she told TOI. Lavangare-Verma has also instructed the district administrations to ensure that the private hospitals do not get their ‘B form’ approval meant after complying with safety standards, like conducting mock drills, if the compliance with fire and electrical audit standards are not met. She has also urged the administrative heads to ensure the vacancies of the fire safety officers are filled up at the local civic bodies through a recruitment process. Meanwhile, statistics shared by the fire department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation showed that only 45% hospitals have submitted their ‘B forms’ this year, 20% have fire fitness certificates, 27% have done their fire audits and 71% have completed mock drills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deny-covid-hospital-status-without-fire-safety-compliance-divisional-commissioner/articleshow/87614752.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Godrej & Boyce to keep land as transfer may attract huge stamp duty’||Mumbai: Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company (G&B) will continue to retain around 3,401 acres of its land even as a division in the family business is expected soon.  TOI has learned that senior directors across group companies have been sworn to secrecy not to talk about the negotiations. Besides, there is an embargo on them not to sell or trade in Godrej stocks till then. An insider, when contacted by this newspaper, said it makes sense for G&B to retain the entire land. “While the probability of apportioning the land through a separate vehicle was discussed, it was difficult to execute it as it would attract a huge stamp duty payment based on the ready reckoner value of the land,” said the source, adding, “The 5% stamp duty would kick in even if the land were to be transferred from one group company to another.” The decision to vest the land in G&B will, in turn, boost the valuations of the company, said sources. It could make the family business separation an expensive proposition for Jamshyd Godrej’s side. Turnover wise, the unlisted G&B (Rs 11,400 crore in 2019-20) is half the size of Godrej Industries & associate companies (around Rs 21,000 crore). It is not clear whether Godrej Properties, which is part of Godrej Industries and associate companies, would continue to benefit by developing properties on land owned by G&B following the family separation. However, even earlier, when property development was undertaken by Godrej Properties on G&B’s land, it was done through a joint arrangement between the respective companies. Over and above the 3,401-acre land which belongs to G&B, there is a separate land parcel on which the Godrej Group has been in dispute with the state government since 1973 over who controls the land. The state claimed the land belonged to it and had filed a suit against G&B that year. The dispute is pending before the Bombay high court. However, that’s a completely separate matter, said sources, and it is outside the purview of the current family division. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), during a survey in 2015, had estimated that at least 300 acres near Vikhroli station are encroached upon. The family acquired its land in the eastern suburbs from the Bombay high court receiver in the 1940s. This land was originally given by the East India Company to Parsi merchant Framjee Banaji in the 1830s till it came up for sale in 1941-42. After acquiring this land, the Godrejs started buying up adjoining plots by negotiating with 200 plot owners. In response to TOI’s query on this matter, the Godrej family said in a joint statement: “The Godrej family has been working on a long-term strategic plan for the group for the last few years to ensure best value for its shareholders. As part of this exercise, we have also sought advice from external partners. These discussions between the family remain ongoing.” Sources said the family division at the 124-year old, $4 billion Godrej Group has progressed significantly and could be announced in a couple of months. They told TOI the restructuring is being done in an amicable way with no emotions attached. Five family branches under Adi Godrej, Nadir Godrej (brother of Adi), Jamshyd Godrej, Smita Crishna (sister of Jamshyd) and Rishad Godrej (cousin of Adi, Nadir, Jamshyd) hold 15.33% each in G&B, while the Pirojsha Godrej Foundation holds around 23%. The trusts invest in environment, health and education. Dividends from various group companies are used to fulfill these philanthropic activities. G&B, in turn, has holdings in various group companies. As such, G&B and Godrej Industries and associate companies have been operating independently for decades, although family members sit on the boards of group companies and directly or indirectly hold stakes in group entities. Members of the fourth generation of Godrejs are now occupying leadership positions at the Group. Adi Godrej, who recently stepped down from the listed companies’ boards, continues to be on the board of G&B. His younger brother Nadir Godrej has taken over as chairman of Godrej Industries. On Monday, Vijay Crishna, the executive director at G&B, resigned from the board of Godrej Industries from the position of non-executive, non-independent director. Crishna, 76, is the brother-in-law of Jamshyd Godrej. His daughter Nyrika Holkar is seen as a successor to Jamshyd Godrej at G&B. The privately held G&B is into appliances, construction, precision engineering, furniture retailing and aerospace, among other sectors, while Godrej Industries is the holding company which has interests in consumer goods, agriculture, real estate, chemicals and financial services, other than incubating new businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-godrej-boyce-to-keep-land-as-transfer-may-attract-huge-stamp-duty/articleshow/87614767.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Goa||A mining village still recalls its agro past in Surla||Keri: The village of Surla in Bicholim, now mostly known for iron ore mining, was once a predominantly agro- and horticulture-based economy. The village was known for its paddy and millets, besides horticultural crops. The annual Dasara rituals at the Shree Mallikarjun temple of Surla still recall this history during the festivities.  “In the past, our village was known for its rich and varied agro biodiversity. We cultivated paddy during the monsoon and winter, and were self-sufficient. After Ganesh Chaurthi, we cultivated Vaigan paddy. Our ancestors would invoke lord Mallikarjun on the occasion of Dasara seeking his blessing for a good yield,” Devanand Surlakar from Ghadiwada in Surla said.  However, haphazard mining forced the village’s farmers to give up their traditional occupation after their agricultural and horticultural fields were left heavily silted.  Vitho Timlo Ghadi said that the villagers’ ancestors had originally moved to Surla from Canacona in South Goa and had brought their deity Mallikarjun with them. “As Mallikarjun freed the villagers from the terror of Betal, the village deity Siddheshwar offered him status of significance in Surla,” Ghadi said. The five swords that are worshipped in the sanctum sanctorum of the Mallikarjun temple are brought out in a procession along with the insignia (tarang) of Mallikarjun to the tune of the local drum, dhol. After blessing the devotees, the insignia visits the temples of Siddheshwar, Navdurga and Siyadev. Part of the Dasara rituals also sees the tradition of cutting of an ash gourd (kuvalo) which has been placed on a devotee’s abdomen. A sword is used to cut it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-mining-village-still-recalls-its-agro-past-in-surla/articleshow/87614787.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Elderly Ghatlodia couple killed for Rs 500, say police||Ahmedabad: Two men killed an elderly Ghatlodia couple hoping to scoop up a substantial booty on the day they struck, Dhanteras, but managed to find only Rs 500 after the massacre. Ahmedabad crime branch officers revealed the information on Tuesday and said that they have captured the murderers. Dayanand and Vijayalakshmi Shanbaug, aged 90 and 80, were killed on November 2 evening at their house in Parasmani Flats. According to police, the killers are Mukut Hapgadada, 19, and Eeman Topno, 26, both residents of Khunti district of Jharkhand and construction workers. Police said the two were in dire need of money so they decided to find a vulnerable target. “The accused were broke because they had sent money to their families on November 1. They zeroed in on the building as only five of the total 12 flats are occupied,” said a police officer. “Topno stayed on the ground floor to keep watch, while Hapgadada went up looking for easy prey.” The officer said that Hapgadada saw the door of the Shanbaugs’ house open and he slithered inside. When Dayanand saw him and asked who he was, Hapgadada silenced him by fatally slashing his neck. He then slit Vijayalakshmi’s throat before she could even register what had happened to her husband, said the officer. Then Hapgadada began ransacking the house but found only Rs 500. As the couple began bleeding heavily, he ran down and he and Topno left the building swiftly, said police. After the murders, the city crime branch was roped in to investigate the case. Sources in the city crime branch said that as there was no CCTV camera in the area, cops relied on CCTV cameras in nearby locations to capture any suspicious characters. The local informers’ network was also activated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/target-half-empty-building-open-door/articleshow/87613987.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED seizes BSL, BEL promoters’ assets worth Rs 61 crore||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached assets worth Rs 61 crore, including agriculture land in Raigad district and warehouses, in a money laundering case they are investigating against promoters of Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL) and Bhushan Energy Limited (BEL). The ED initiated the money-laundering investigation based on a complaint at Faridabad in Haryana and Guwahati in Assam against BSL and BEL filed by the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) for siphoning of public funds. The ED alleged that Neeraj Singal along with B B Singal (ex-promoters of BSL) and others had diverted funds from the company through an elaborate web of transactions by routing public funds in the garb of unsecured loans given by Bhushan Energy Limited to their associate companies, which were ultimately utilized for the acquisition of various immovable properties. The elaborate and complex web of transactions was structured to project these assets as untainted. Last month, the ED attached a residential bungalow worth Rs 191 crore, adjoining Ceejay House, Worli in a connected case they are investigating against Bhushan Power & Steel Limited (BPSL) and others. A portion of the plot where Ceejay House and the bungalow were constructed by Millennium Developers (a company of NCP leader Praful Patel), once owned by late drug smuggler Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi. In this instance, the ED has registered the money laundering case against Sanjay Singal, ex-CMD of BPSL and others based on the CBI FIR in April 2019. It was alleged that BPSL availed loan facilities and defaulted payment of Rs 47,204 crore of 33 banks-financial institutions between 2007 to 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-seizes-bsl-bel-promoters-assets-worth-rs-61-crore/articleshow/87615711.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||Yamuna froth a gift from UP, Haryana to Delhi, says Raghav Chadha||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board’s vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said that the toxic foam floating over the Yamuna was a “gift” to Delhi from governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Blaming the neighbouring states for the problem, Chadha said that the polluted water was being discharged into the river. “The foam in the Yamuna is in the Okhla Barrage area, which comes under Uttar Pradesh irrigation government, it is the UP government’s responsibility. But like every year, they failed this year too. The polluted water is not Delhi’s, it is a gift to Delhi by the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments,” said the AAP functionary. According to Chadha, Central Pollution Control Board in its report to Yamuna Monitoring Committee has admitted that around 150 million gallons per day (MGD) of flow is being discharged by UP and Haryana into the stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi, which is highly polluted and contains industrial waste of surrounding industries. “This is another major factor behind foaming. In the past, directions have been given to them by the National Green Tribunal to install STPs so that no untreated sewage is discharged in Delhi drains. Unfortunately, no concrete action plan has been implemented by both the states so far,” Chadha added. The installed capacity of sewage treatment plants in Delhi is about 597 MGD with a utlisation of about 90 per cent. It is going to increase up to 707 MGD by December 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yamuna-froth-a-gift-from-up-haryana-to-delhi-chadha/articleshow/87614757.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Smartphone link behind most Pocso cases: CWC||Mangaluru: Easy access to mobile phones has seen predators using social media platforms to lure children and nearly a third of Pocso cases in the district has seen victims having first contact with the perpetrators online. Last week, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) recorded seven cases registered under the Pocso Act, of which five were fresh cases and two cases were reported late. In two cases, it was only after the parents got to know about the incident that took place a few months ago, a complaint was filed. A CWC member observed a rise in the Pocso cases in which the first contact with the survivor was through mobile phone. CWC chairman Renni D’Souza told TOI that nearly 70% of the offenders are ‘online’ friends. With the pandemic and classes going online, children had easy access to mobile phones and during counselling, the survivors have admitted they first got in touch with the perpetrator either on Facebook or other social media platforms. Most of the survivors are aged between 13 and 17, he said. Between 2012 and 2020, 731 Pocso cases were recorded in the court, of which 328 were reported from Mangaluru city police limits and 403 from Dakshina Kannada district police station. “Government hospitals are playing a crucial role in detection of cases. Most cases come to light during medical examination of the survivor. Meanwhile, as part of Makkala Masotsava, programmes on online safety and cybercrime awareness will be held. Further, the CWC has got in touch with several counsellor groups and psychiatrists to help students,” Renni said. He also observed that in a few cases, smartphone technicians were the culprits. The parent would have visited a local mobile repair shop, and the data and the phone number were allegedly misused by the technician. It all begins with a chat, often not revealing the true identity, and goes to the level of sexual abuse,” he said. Important to encrypt phone Cyber security expert Ananth Prabhu G said, encrypting the phone is important and nearly 80% of the people do not do it. A simple step can prevent data on the phone from being misused. When the phone is handed over to a service centre for repair and it is not encrypted, it means that the customer is giving access to all the data including public, private and highly confidential ones. “Data is the new oil and there have been several instances of blackmail and sextortion being reported after a phone was given for repair. Also, it is highly recommended to read the IT Act,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/smartphone-link-behind-most-pocso-cases-cwc/articleshow/87612958.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

In the meantime, after the first round of admission was completed, classes for engineering degree programme seats have already begun. The state is presently awaiting the schedule from the central authorities for admissions to medical programme seats. Admissions to degree programmes in medicine, dentistry, ayurveda, homeopathy, nursing and five allied health programmes offered at Goa Medical College take place through the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) (UG) 2021. The results for NEET were delayed this year and only declared last week. Only after the first admission round is completed for programmes based on NEET, the second round for engineering degree programme seats will be conducted. After the GCET results were declared in August, first round of admissions for engineering and pharmacy programmes was held. However, the second round for engineering programme seats can only be held after the first round of admissions for NEET-based programmes is completed, as some students may opt to switch over to NEET-based programme seats. “Some students answer both NEET and the Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) and a few of these students, who have got admissions to engineering programmes, may qualify and want to shift to medicine programme. Also, admission process is on for national engineering institutes like IITs, NITs etc. Some students will opt for national institutes if they get a programme of their choice. Only then we will have a correct picture of how many vacancies are there in state engineering institutes,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/second-round-of-engineering-admissions-likely-after-nov-20/articleshow/87614781.cms||---

The water was released through the dam’s power house and tunnel power house. The officials maintained the water level in the dam around 119ft since Tuesday morning. The inflow to the dam was 19,000 cusecs while the outflow was 20,000 cusecs. “We initially released 5,000 cusecs of water starting at 5am on Tuesday, increased it to 10,000 cusecs at 5.30 am, 15,000 cusecs at 6am and 20,000 cusecs at 6.30 am,” a PWD official said. The dam’s total water storage level is 120ft with a storage capacity of 93.47 tmcft. The dam’s water level stood at 96.81ft on June 12, when the officials released water through sluice gates for irrigation needs in delta districts. “The water level then fell to 70ft. However, on October 24, the dam once again reached the 100ft-mark for the 65th time in the dam’s 88-years of history,” the official added PWD officials said their counterparts in Karnataka were releasing water continuously from KRS and Kabini dams. The monitoring officer of Salem district and the managing director of Poompuhar shipping corporation S Sivashanmugaraja, collector S Karmegam and PWD officials inspected the dam and the riverbank areas on Tuesday. After the inspection, collector Karmegam told reporters that villagers residing along the riverbank were instructed to move to safe places. The collector also stated that the PWD has set up a flood control room at the dam’s left bank to monitor the situation. PWD officials said that it would be the 41st time in the dam’s history if the water level reaches the full capacity of 120ft.

As the substantial rainfall filled up all the canal-fed tanks after 16 years, the public works department (PWD) has started regulating water levels between 70%-80% in the tanks to avoid breaches.Officials said that Trichy district has 98 non-system tanks and 76 system tanks. While non-system tanks depend on rainfall in catchment areas, the system tanks were fed by the Cauvery river beside the rainfall in the catchment area. Much before the northeast monsoon, Trichy district recorded an average rainfall of 260 mm till mid of October, the highest in the past 10 years. The rainfall in the rain-fed areas of Manapparai, Thuraiyur and part of Manchanallur has further increased the water level. While 12 tanks in the Ariyaru division and 15 in the river conservancy (RC) division were full, around 35 tanks in both divisions filled up to 70% of their capacity. Those tanks are likely to reach their full capacity in the next few days. “We are monitoring the status to maintain the storage level at a safe limit. Breaches are unlikely as bunds were strengthened,” a senior official with PWD, Ariyaru basin division, said.Since the tanks in the RC division are river-fed, the PWD officials said that discharge will be regulated to prevent breaches. “All the tanks in RC division have already achieved their full storage level, but we are maintaining water level at around 80% of the capacity. As the rainfall in catchment areas have decreased, the inflow will reduce,” a senior official with the PWD river conservancy division said. In Thuraiyur, nine tanks that were rain-fed have reached their full capacity after a period of 15-20 years. Since around 54 tanks in the rain-fed areas have only less than 50% of their storage capacity, more rain will benefit such tanks, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ne-monsoon-filling-up-trichy-tanks/articleshow/87614769.cms||Deepak Karthik

Soon, the state government will sign an MoU with the defence estate office in Chennai to launch the civil work,” the MP told TOI. The defence land is valued at Rs 8.45 crore. The development was conveyed to the state highways only after the President of India had given his approval.Around 134m-long arm of the RoB linking Trichy-Chennai NH with the rest of the elevated structure remains incomplete. State highways may take six months to complete the pending portion.“The cost of the pending work is estimated at Rs 3 crore. We will launch the work within two months. A tender will be floated soon. A service road will come up too,” a state highways official said. The department will also launch the preliminary work for phase II of the RoB proposed with three elevated arms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/defence-ministry-awards-enter-upon-nod-for-trichy-rob/articleshow/87614782.cms||---

The ritual involves preserving water in a vase from the 17th century. The documentary titled ‘Bhumchu- The Drops of Eternal Life’, which sees the ritual from the lens of water preservation, has made it to the The River to River Florence Indian Film Festival organized by the Indian Embassy in Italy and the Fiorenzo Serra Film Festival, hosted by the Sassari University. It will also be preserved at the Sassari University for research on ethno-cultural groups across the globe. “While the world is striving hard today to spread awareness on saving water, rendering gratitude to water and its conservation has been in the realm of Tibetan philosophy and the Buddhist consciousness for centuries,” said Sinha. The documentary begins with an elaborate introduction to the contributions of Guru Padmasambhava (also known as the Guru Rinpoche), Lhatsun Chenpo and the history of Tashiding monastery before highlighting the festival. General secretary of Tashiding monastery Phurba T. Tsechutharpa, who is featured in the documentary, is happy that the government of Sikkim has taken this effort to archive the history behind this ritual. The shooting in progress“Every year, the festival is held on the 14th and 15th day of the first month of Tibetan calendar. Usually that happens between February and March. The vase contains 21 cups of water. We take out three cups of water and refill it. The water is then sealed and kept and the vase is again opened next year. Twice I have myself seen the water level of the pot rise,” said Phurba T. Tsechutharpa. These three cups of water are then mixed with the water from the Himalayan glaciers and distributed among devotees. However, Covid-19 played spoilsport in 2020 and 2021 and devotees are now waiting for next year to take part in the ritual. In one section of the docu, Sinha follows the 90-year-old Jangtay Bhutia who was the water bearer of this ritual till five years ago. Age, however, has forced Jangtay to hand over the responsibility. On the day of the event, the Bhumchu is taken out of its mansion. The pot is opened at midnight and three cups of water are taken from it. The first cup is for the royal family, the second for the lamas and the third is distributed among the pilgrims on the day of the full moon. Resident Tashiding village Denzongpa Chungkila Sikkimes has kept this water at the altar. “The main constituent of the water has been preserved in the pot for 375 years. Yet, it still smells as fresh as before. I am so proud of Abanti and her team and the efforts she took to shoot this documentary. This means a lot to us,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docu-on-monastery-ritual-to-compete-in-italian-fests/articleshow/87613991.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC agrees on one-time compensation for fisherfolk||MUMBAI: In view of the increasing protests by the fishermen of Worli to BMC’s Coastal Road Project the civic body earlier this month decided to compensate the fishermen accordingly for a temporary period. Worli is also the MLA constituency of environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. A senior BMC official said, “The BMC held a meeting with the fishermen’s representatives on November 1 and took into account their concerns. They have been assured that any loss during construction will be compensated for.” A decision on how much compensation is to be given is yet to be decided, said civic officials. The Tata Institute of Social Sciences has been appointed by the BMC to draft a compensation policy. A working group of the BMC has also been formed and many of its meetings have been held with fishermen. Nitish Patil from the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavsay Sahakari Society Limited said that they did meet the concerned civic authorities on November 1 over their issues, but a one time compensation will not be enough. “The reclaimation in our area is affecting the fishes which we would be able to catch at the sea shore. They hardly come towards the Worli shore and are now are more towards Khar Danda, Mahim waters,” said Patil. Regarding the concerns about insufficient navigation span of the Coastal Road bridge for the passing of boats, the civic body said it is as per permissions received by respective authorities. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-agrees-on-one-time-compensation-for-fisherfolk/articleshow/87614794.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Trichy||Not rains, but encroachments, violations inundate Trichy||TRICHY: Though Trichy city has two major rivers, the Cauvery and Kollidam, that together can drain 3.50 lakh cusecs of discharge water, the residential areas witness inundation during monsoon. The average rainfall the city received for the past few days has exposed the encroachments on waterbodies, violations and mismanagement of natural water draining infrastructure. For the second straight day, parts of the city including Woraiyur, Lingam Nagar, Ramalinga Nagar, E Pudur and JK Nagar saw inundation. The reason stated by the experts and residents was the lack of a well-designed storm water drainage infrastructure that could drain the run-off water to nearby waterbodies. “We are not properly utilising the natural terrains and major rivers. Unless the canals of yesteryears are restored as storm water drains, we will be facing the problems from time to time,” Vijayakumar Sengottuvelan, a senior architect in the city, said. Lingam Nagar has more than 500 houses, but it still lacks a proper storm water drain system. Although the residents’ welfare associations had petitioned Trichy Corporation more than a dozen times, the authorities turned them down citing lack of funds. Now, the entire neighbourhood has been inundated. While the fertile land was converted as residential plots, revenue officials said that channels flowing through the land were encroached or converted as saleable plots. “We have removed an encroachment on a drain channel that caused inundation on Kuzhumani Road,” a revenue department official said. While officials blame the real estate developers, the residents have raised a question on how and why the civic body or relevant authorities gave their approval for buildings that violate norms. “Water carriers that drain surplus rainwater to nearby rivers have been encroached periodically,” J Kennedy, an advocate from Kuzhumani, said. However, Trichy Corporation cited technical difficulties in establishing storm water drains in the areas that are now flooded. “Post the monsoon, we will work on a plan to prevent such inundation in low-lying areas,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/not-rains-but-encroachments-violations-inundate-trichy/articleshow/87614775.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Central Vista: ‘India House’ at proposed executive enclave to host meetings with foreign dignitaries in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The proposed Executive Enclave close to South Block in the Central Vista would get a “India House”, which will be used for high-level meetings with foreign dignitaries. This will be on the lines of Hyderabad House where such meetings are currently held. The Enclave will have the cabinet secretariat, national security council secretariat (NSCS) and PMO as well. Sources said the designs are in the final stage and the tenders for these would be floated soon. “The integrated planning has been made to ensure that there is less movement of VIPs and dignitaries for official engagements. That will reduce traffic restrictions in Lutyens’ Delhi which people currently face during such visits,” said an official. When contacted, the spokesperson of the HCP Design, Planning and Management, the firm engaged for the project said, “The design for the Executive Enclave is under progress. The Executive Enclave will have facilities for hosting foreign dignitaries, the prime minister’s office, the cabinet secretariat and the NSCS.” So far, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has bid out tenders for three projects - New Parliament, redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue (Rajpath) and three office building for Common Central Secretariat - and the bidding process is underway for the Vice President Enclave. The next tender to be floated is for the Executive Enclave. While India House in London is the official address of the Indian Embassy, another India House was set up in July 1905 as a hostel in North London. With the patronage of then lawyer Shyamji Krishna Varma, it was opened to promote nationalist views among Indian students in Britain and became a hub for political activism for overseas revolutionary Indian nationalism during the colonial rule. Sources said the proposed “India House” would come up close to the cabinet secretariat and NSCS, and these would be big buildings. The other side of the Enclave would have the PMO, which will be able to accommodate over 500 personnel. TOI on March 4 had reported how the entire Central Vista redevelopment has been planned to minimise traffic disruptions in Lutyens’ Delhi because of VIP movement. There is a plan to build three underground tunnels linking the proposed PM residence that will come up close to the Executive Enclave, Vice-President’s house and chambers of MPs to the Parliament building, which is under construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-india-house-at-proposed-executive-enclave-to-host-meetings-with-foreign-dignitaries/articleshow/87614784.cms||Dipak K Dash

The NEP — which replaces the National Policy on Education, 1986, and aims to transform the country’s education system by 2040 — could not be implemented during the current academic year due to pandemic-related restrictions, the chief minister said. “After 35 years, a new education policy has been envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which contains many changes to shape the future generations. The policy document is now ready after much discussion and debate, and will be implemented on a trial basis in most educational institutions from the next academic year,” he said. The government has already begun implementing syllabi in coding and robotics for Class VI, Sawant said, while assuring that it would be introduced in a majority of schools from next year. He also said trainers and master trainers have already completed receiving instruction. “We want to provide them with the necessary equipment required for the course, but for some reasons, we have not been able to,” he said. The chief minister also said that while he was taking a review, he noticed that around 40% of seats in engineering colleges — civil, electronic and IT — are vacant. “Studying BA, BCom and BSc is not enough. Children have to take up technical education. Some students were hesitant to join private engineering colleges because the fees were high, but the state government has now reduced fees by 50%,” he said. Referring to the teachers sitting on a dharna, Sawant said that since he has become education minister, he has resolved maximum issues in the education sector. He added that Goa not only leads other states in the area of education, but also has the best human resource and infrastructure in the sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-edu-policy-on-trial-basis-from-next-yr-cm/articleshow/87614789.cms||Murari Shetye

The three-day drive, which started on Monday, comes after TOI reported about the poor condition of the public toilets in the city limits in its edition that was published on Monday. The report had delved into the pathetic condition of the toilets, which lacked basic amenities like water supply, water taps, lights, buckets, doors, latches and wash basins, forcing people to urinate and defecate in the open. There are 371 public washrooms in the city corporation limits - 91 in east zone, 79 in west zone, 64 in north zone, 65 in south zone and 72 in central zone. Most of the toilets are also poorly maintained. A civic body official said they were carrying out the mass cleaning drive based on the instructions of corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. Health teams in each ward would clean the toilets in their areas with water first and disinfect them later, he said. “While all the toilets will be cleaned, special focus is being given to the ones in crowded areas and at bus terminals. Plumbing and electrical work will also be carried out. Pipeline will be provided wherever required and it will be replaced in the case of leakage,” the official said. A health department official said while the corporation employees used to clean the toilets periodically, it was difficult to ensure their cleanliness without the cooperation of users. “Many users leave without flushing water after using the toilets. This should stop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-launches-mass-drive-to-clean-toilets/articleshow/87614788.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a memorandum to the chief minister M K Stalin, state general secretary of the association, P Chinnathambi said that the fishermen have no avenues to air their grievances. “Around 11 lakh fishermen are residing along the 11 coastal districts in Tamil Nadu. This apart there are around three lakh inland fishing folk who are engaged in fishing in 39,000 tanks, 144 small and big dams, rivers and canals. Several lakh labourers are benefiting indirectly in fishing,” Chinnathambi said.The Sri Lankan navy too attacks fishermen alleging that they are crossing the international waters in the Bay of Bengal due to which they lose their catch and even trawlers, he added. This apart, due to natural calamities fishermen have lost their properties. However, they have no avenues to express their grievances and nobody takes their complaints to the concerned officials or to the notice of the chief minister, he said. “As November 21 is being celebrated as World Fishermen Day, the state government should conduct grievance meetings in all the districts across the state to listen to our grievances. Despite several representations to the officials of the fisheries department and district collectors, no action has been taken to convene grievance day meeting till now. So, the chief minister should instruct district collectors to conduct the meeting for the benefit of lakhs of fishermen in the state,” Chinnathambi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stalin-urged-to-hold-grievance-meets-on-world-fishermen-day/articleshow/87614790.cms||---

Sources in Gandhinagar police said that Thakor, 26, a resident of Vansjada village, had a month ago targeted an 80-year-old woman in Santej. “He had hit an 80-year-old woman on the head with a stick when she was walking alone in Santej. Thakor targeted the woman to rape her and hit her as she resisted,” said a cop of Gandhinagar police. Police suspect Thakor may have tried to rape the elderly woman, but she was unable to say what had happened because she fainted after the attack. “We learned that he was hunting for elderly women for about five months and had targeted around four women so far. He attacked them and molested them. But we are still trying to identify the victims so that they can come forward and file a complaint against him,” said a police officer. Meanwhile, Santej police filed another rape complaint against Thakor, for raping a seven-year-old in Bhoyan village. He first fled with her mobile phone and when she chased him, he drew her to a secluded place and sexually assaulted her. Police officers said Thakor had to struggle a bit in targeting elderly women after which he decided to hunt for the small girls. Thakor, who worked for a private company in Gandhinagar, was caught by the Gandhinagar police on Sunday for three offences of rape and one murder. After targeting and raping the seven-year-old girl ten days ago, he had picked up another girl, 5, from Rancharda and raped her on November 4. On November 6, he picked up a three-year-old girl from a labourer’s family near Khatraj Crossroads and killed her as she was screaming and crying. He then violated her corpse.

He added that failure to produce the correct birth certificate has “falsified the plaintiff’s case to a great extent.” Malik stated that the “evidence” produced by him has helped the government machinery “to take corrective steps against Sameer Wankhede.” He referred to news reports about a vigilance inquiry and transfer of six cases from the Mumbai unit headed by Sameer Wankhede to the NCB’s Delhi unit. “Thus initiation of action against Sameer Wankhede shows the authenticity of evidence produced by the defendant (Malik),” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/min-evidence-i-produced-helped-govt-take-steps-in-mumbai/articleshow/87615718.cms||Rosy Sequeira

In parts of the state, a mandap kind of a structure is made around the pedestal with bamboo or banana stems for the wedding. To not use the plant based material and avoid the waste generated from it, a Rivona-based agriculturist Pandurang Patil has designed a structure from U-PVC pipes, which can be reused. The structure can be disassembled and can be easily replicated. “The Tulsi Lagna usually starts at 6pm and ends by 10pm during which we use bamboo shoots and banana stalks to set up the structure. This is discarded after the pooja, causing a lot of waste every year. The collapsible structure made from U-PVC pipes can save a lot of wood and will last 15 years,” Patil said. He further said that using the collapsible structure also saves the time and labour put into bringing the shoots and stalks and building it only to be discarded the next day. “The structure can be assembled in 10 minutes. This can be done annually thus enabling families to save the environment instead of cutting trees for the pooja,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rivona-man-builds-reusable-tulsi-lagna-structure/articleshow/87614820.cms||Nida Sayed

School heads are relieved that the on-campus test for the nationwide survey will, after all, be possible. The CBSE, which is conducting the survey on behalf of the ministry of education, has selected 3,615 schools in Bengal, where students of classes III, V, VIII and X will be tested for their general academic proficiencies. When schools had first told parents about students’ compulsory attendance for selected classes, guardians had expressed unwillingness in sending their kids to campuses even before schools in Bengal officially reopen on Tuesday next week. Schools sent out consent forms to parents, saying attendance was compulsory for the survey and that all Covid-safety precautions were being taken. “We sent out invitations to our parents to send their children. In our school, VIII and X are the selected classes, making it easier on parents. Happily almost every child is participating. Three to four children are ill and they will submit medical certificates,” said Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujoy Biswas. At South Point, 25% parents of class VIII students had already sent their consent to send their kids to school and more approvals were likely to come in, said spokesperson Krishna Damani, adding parents were warming up to the survey gradually. The school has allowed classes III and V to be exempt from the survey as the primary section is not affiliated to the board. In some schools, such as St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, almost all parents of class III students have given their consent and the school has started practice sessions, too. “I am happy parents have not only consented but also shown a lot of enthusiasm towards the survey. They are taking this as a step towards normalisation,” said principal Father Rodney Borneo. Parents of class V students, selected for NAS at Sushila Birla Girls’ School, will be addressed at a virtual meeting by principal Koeli Dey on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-gear-up-for-nas-as-parents-send-consent/articleshow/87614868.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

As per IMD forecast, a low-pressure area has formed over the southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood and it is likely to concentrate into a depression over southwest and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal. The depression over the east-central Arabian Sea lay weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area on Tuesday. It is likely to move west-southwestwards during the next couple days thus bringing rain to Goa.  Weather warnings have been issued for fishermen for one more day over parts of east-central Arabian Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/met-office-forecasts-more-precipitation-in-coming-days/articleshow/87614808.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 cops extorted money from builder at Param Bir Singh’s behest, says CID||MUMBAI: Police inspector Nandkumar Gopale and assistant police inspector Asha Korke allegedly pressured and threatened builder Shyam Sunder Agarwal and extorted money from him at the behest of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, the state criminal investigation department (CID) informed the court on Tuesday. Gopale and Korke, arrested on Monday, were produced before the 8th metropolitan magistrate court which remanded them to seven days’ police custody. The extortion case pertains to a complaint lodged by Agarwal at Marine Drive police station against Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde, businessman Sanjay Punamia and six police officers in July. Special public prosecutor Shekar Jagtap claimed that Singh and Punamia were the masterminds. “They wanted to extort Rs 20 crore from Agarwal and hence Singh framed him in a false case at Juhu police station and the two officers (Gopale and Korke) threatened and pressured Agarwal. Korke collected Rs 50 lakh from Agarwal’s nephew which he got from a hawala operator, Momin, by showing the token torn note on her mobile phone,” Jagtap told the court. Momin is a friend of Punamia and is connected with Korke, he added. Aniket Nikam, representing Gopale, said his client has been framed, while Punamia got bail before the chargesheet was filed. “Gopale is an upright officer... he has been cooperating with the CID. The prosecution’s case is that on March 5, Korke’s team raided Agarwal’s offices and Gopale called up Pathan in front of Agarwal and demanded Rs 50 lakh to not arrest him. How can a PI call up the DCP and demand extortion? The entire FIR is absurd and has false information,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-cops-extorted-money-from-builder-at-singhs-behest-says-cid/articleshow/87614816.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Pune woman loses Rs 6L to KYC update fraud||PUNE: A 45-year-old Bibvewadi resident was cheated out of nearly Rs6 lakh by cybercrooks, who used the KYC update trick. The suspects, posing as representatives of a cellular service provider, sent the woman an SMS in August and told her the mobile number would deactivated if she doesn’t update her KYC (know your customer) information. The woman contacted the number mentioned in the SMS and the person who answered the call sought many details, including those of her bank account, which she operated jointly with her father. The woman directed the suspect to her father, who gave the caller key details. The woman’s father received five SMSs with one-time passwords (OTPs), which he shared with the crooks. The culprits siphoned Rs5.94 lakh in five transactions. So far, the police have established that the transferred money went to bank accounts in Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. Senior inspector Sunil Zavare of the Bibvewadi police said the woman worked in the administration unit of a private company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-loses-rs-6l-to-kyc-update-fraud/articleshow/87614024.cms||---
---||Kolkata||High-rises in Kolkata plan rooftop Chhath for second year||KOLKATA: Multiple highrise complexes in Kolkata and New Town have been decking up their existing water bodies inside the premises or are constructing temporary ones to facilitate Chhathh devotees pray and perform the rituals within the comfort of their homes and ensure they do not head out compromising the Covid safety stipulations and national green tribunal instructions. The move comes in tune with a “Chhat pe Chhathh” plea issued by the Rashtriya Bihari Samaj on Monday that asked revellers to stay within the safety of their homes and celebrate the rituals like last year, several complexes have been making arrangements to facilitate the same. “At Silver Spring, we have an embanked zone within the complex which was once a waterbody. But we had drained out the water to avoid breeding mosquitoes. But on Wednesday, we will refill it again and clean the premises around it to make the area comfortable enough where devotees can come and perform the rituals in the water,” said Indranil Chowdhury, secretary of Silver Spring Residents’ Association. At South City, temporary water carriers are being made beside a water body within the premises but with a caution that none of the puja offerings should be put in the water body. Devotees of the Chhath Puja offer Arghya in a water body and believe that doing this without taking any solid or liquid diet can absorb the Sun's energy into their bodies. The devotees stand in a water body with a portion of the body submerged in the water and perform the puja offering (Arghya). At Uniworld City in New Town, a special team of volunteers has been tasked to oversee an elaborate arrangement being made in which the entire complex is celebrating at the amphitheatre within the complex. “We are organising the Chhathh puja just like any other community puja where every resident within and outside the Bihari community are invited and participate. We cook the Prasad together and distribute it among all the residents. During the evening and morning offerings, we set up around 20 odd small inflatable balloon tubs beside the complex pool where devotees offer the prayer in a safe and clean environment,” said Pritesh Kumar, the joint secretary of the cultural wing of the complex association. Similar arrangements are being made at DLF Newtown Heights as well that has around 15 odd families of the Bihari community. “We have been making arrangements of Chhathh celebration within our complex premises since last year. We have two pools within our premises – one for the seniors and one for kids. During Chhathh we make arrangements for the devotees beside the baby pool where they can get down and pray before the Sun and submit their offerings. After the festival, we drain out the water and clean it up thoroughly,” said Sameer Sharma, a senior member of the complex residents’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-rises-in-kolkata-plan-rooftop-chhath-for-second-year/articleshow/87614028.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

As per norms, it is mandatory for private hospitals and nursing homes to conduct fire audits twice a year via government recognised agencies and get NoCs from the NMC’s fire brigade department. They must conduct the half-yearly fire audits by June and December. Rajendra Bairagi, senior official of NMC’s fire brigade department, said the city has 585 private hospitals and nursing homes. Of them, 469 obtained NoCs. “There are l 116 private hospitals that are yet to comply. We have sent them notices, asking them to conduct fire audits and get NoCs,” said Bairagi. — Tushar Pawar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-issues-notices-to-116-pvt-facilities-for-not-conducting-audits/articleshow/87612156.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Pune||Freshwater tardigrades found in W Ghats fuel new interest||Pune: Freshwater tardigrades, fondly called ‘water bears’, have been reported from the Western Ghats by researchers from zoology department of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Kalyani Bhakare and Kalpana Pai, after six years of study. Tardigrades are microscopic eight-legged animals that look like miniature bears. Around 1,300 species of tardigrades are found worldwide. They were first reported in India during the early 20th century, but since then there have been scant reports. They can survive in outer space as they can tolerate extremely high and freezing temperatures, survive in vacuum, extreme radiation and can live for many years in a desiccated state. Pai said, “There has been a huge gap in reporting of species of macro invertebrate due to meagre funding. This report should bring excitement into tardigrada research for their unique life forms and life history. Research can bring out their secrets of adaptation to extreme conditions.” The researchers investigated the freshwater habitats of Northern Western Ghats (NWG) in Maharashtra region to study the diversity and distribution of tardigrades. They found species of six genera of which Dactylobiotus and Thulinius were the most common. Of the 211 samples collected from temporary pools, wells, ponds, streams and reservoirs in 79 localities from 2012 to 2018 throughout the year, only 12 samples were tardigrade positive. Pai added that in the present study, though the number of tardigrade species is low (species belonging to only six genera) compared to temperate region, it at least showed prevalence and diversity of freshwater tardigrades in Northern Western Ghats of India, a region which was never explored before for freshwater tardigrades. “Data on tardigrade densities in freshwater compared to terrestrial habitats are scarce, and a lot of variation could be seen in terrestrial as well as freshwater habitats,” she said. The discrepancy in finding more individuals in some sites and less in others could be attributed to rainfall patterns in NWG as samples which were collected mostly in the monsoon were found to be positive. Some sites receive more than 3,000mm of rainfall annually. The increased water level at sampling stations like Raireshwar (pool), Amboli (well) and Deoghar (reservoir), may have flushed out tardigrade communities or they may have migrated to other locations with suitable environmental conditions. Tardigrades can be used for space studies. “ISRO should fund studies on astrobiology as we need to study the effect of space conditions on organisms,” Bhakare said. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said the study is important for biodiversity and space research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/freshwater-tardigrades-found-in-w-ghats-fuel-new-interest/articleshow/87614031.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||Delhi: Pragati Maidan readies for trade fair after Covid pause||NEW DELHI: India International Trade Fair will be back at Pragati Maidan after skipping last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 40th edition of the annual event will run from November 14 to 27. With the exhibition ground now three times its earlier size after redevelopment, perhaps there will be less of the customary congestion at the fair. An official of organiser India Trade Promotion Organisation said on Tuesday, “The trade fair wasn’t organised last year because in the period when the Covid lockdown was being relaxed, the central government only permitted business-to-business exhibitions. The IITF at Pragati Maidan is largely a business-to-consumer event. This year, there is a considerable interest among Indians and foreign businesses because they are eager to regain their business targets and place their brands among the right buyers following the coronavirus-affected commerce.” The 40th IITF will be inaugurated by commerce and textiles minister Piyush Goyal at 10am on November 14. The ITPO official said ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ was the theme of the fair. Nine countries —Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Nepal and UAE — have so far confirmed their participation, while Bihar is the partner state and Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are the focus states. Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Tripura, Manipur and Assam, among others, are scheduled to host cultural programmes at the event from November 15 onwards. About 1,500 exhibitors from India and overseas are expected to participate. More than 25 Union ministries and PSUs are hosting their pavilion in the new and old exhibition complexes at Pragati Maidan. The ministry of minority affairs will host the Hunnar Haat pavilion, while the rural development ministry will have the Saras Mela. The ministries of health and family welfare, railways and micro, small and medium enterprises are among the others participating at the fair. Self-help groups are also participating in large numbers. The first five days at the fair will serve as business days before the fair opens up for the general public. Tickets on weekdays for the public are priced at Rs 80 and on weekends at Rs 150. Senior citizens will be allowed free entry. While tickets are available online on a popular ticketing site, they will also be available at the counters of 60 metro stations across Delhi and NCR, including at Dwarka Sector 21, ITO, Huda City Centre, INA and Rajeev Chowk. AT Pragati Maidan metro station itself, the tickets will not be available. Those planning to attend the popular annual event will have to take care to adhere to strict Covid precautions and protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pragati-maidan-readies-for-trade-fair-after-covid-pause/articleshow/87614814.cms||Zumbish

The trend, experts said, was indicative of the pandemic slowing down, but a clear picture was expected to emerge only in the coming days. “A close watch on the next few weeks will make it clear if the trend is here to stay. Any spike in cases could be attributed to people’s laxity during the festivals,” a health expert said. The active cases have come down in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits too. In PMC limits, the tally has dropped to multi-month low of 645, while it has shrunk to just 445 in the Pimpri Chinchwad area, taking the PMR’s overall active case count to 2,059 — a 17% drop since the beginning of this month. Health officials said the drop in daily detections and rise in recoveries were the prime reasons for the reduction in active caseload in the region. “The rural areas have been reporting less than 200 cases daily for the last few days, without any spurt in case count. Daily case count in the PMC and PCMC limits has continued to stay below 100 for some time now,” a health official said. The active caseload in the rural parts was way ahead of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits for almost three months (July, August, September), making them the area of concern for the health authorities . It was only last month that the cases started declining. “For last five consecutive days, the rural parts have added less than 100 new cases every day. We are expecting a similar trend to continue. A drop in cases has also led to decline in the hotspot areas in the rural parts. We are tracking the cases and appealing citizens to continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” another health official said. PMC officials said they would be monitoring daily cases as the next two weeks were crucial. “Citizens should not ignore the symptoms and undergo test. The swab collection centres are operational at every ward. Teams have been deployed for collection of swab and testing,” a civic health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/active-covid-cases-drop-below-1000-in-rural-parts/articleshow/87614032.cms||Sarang Dastane

The truck driver fled, leaving the vehicle behind. Police have filed an FIR against the owner of the vehicle. Police said Krishnapal Singh was on his way back home in Meerut after celebrating Diwali at his village in Baghpat when the truck rammed their bike. It took hours for police to identify the victims as they had no identity papers with them and their mobiles were locked. “Though Krishnapal Singh was wearing a helmet, his head was crushed under the wheels of the truck. His wife, Meenu (38), and son, Anshul Singh (11) also died on the spot,” said Subodh Saxena, SHO of Kankarkhera. Anuj Singh, nephew of the deceased, said Krishnapal was a Naik Subedar in the Army and took voluntary retirement in 2018. He was working in a private factory since then and was living with his family in Indrapuram area of Meerut. As the family was busy with the cremations on Tuesday, they could not file a complaint but would do so on Wednesday, SHO Saxena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/retd-army-jawan-wife-son-run-over-by-speeding-truck/articleshow/87614030.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Cong: Levy tax at panchayat rates in newly merged areas||Pune: The Congress wants the civic administration to collect property taxes from residents in the villages merged with the PMC at the rates charged by the gram panchayat. The party has sent a letter to the civic administration citing lack of infrastructure in those villages as the reason. “These areas do not yet have public amenities. Charging property tax as per the rates in other civic areas will be an injustice to the residents living in the newly merged areas,” said Sanjay Jagtap, MLA and district president of Congress. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has expressed concerns over the funds crunch and favoured higher property tax rates even in the merged areas. “The expenses for building infrastructure in these villages are high. It will be difficult for the civic administration to handle the increased financial burden, considering the current revenue of the civic administration. It will be essential to start charging property taxes at the increased rates in the merged areas,” said a senior PMC official. Property owners in merged villages said the gram panchayat charged Rs2 per square ft as property tax per annum. The PMC charges Rs2 per month. So the tax amount per square foot would go up by Rs24 per year in the villages merged in PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cong-levy-tax-at-panchayat-rates-in-newly-merged-areas/articleshow/87614037.cms||---

The airport, which is managed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), is ready with night-landing and night-parking facilities. Sources in HAL said passenger footfall at the airport has increased since the relaxations in Covid restrictions. At present, the airport has flight connections to Ahmedabad, Delhi, Indore, Belagavi and Pune. Three airlines, including the state-owned Alliance Air and two private airlines, are nowoperating from the airport. “We will soon approach private airlines to start operations from Nashik. Our aim is to increase flight movement and connect Nashik to all the major cities,” said the HAL sources. A low-cost private airline, which had started air service on three different routes from Nashik — to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Delhi — in November 2020, had stopped operations in April this year due to the pandemic. The airline is yet to restart its operations. HAL sources said they are going to approach this private airline to restart operations.

---||Ahmedabad||Enforce quota in IIM-Ahmedabad’s PhD course: PIL||AHMEDABAD: A PIL filed in the Gujarat high court is seeking the SC/ST and OBC quota in IIM-A’s doctoral programme, earlier known as Fellow Programme in Management. An alumni association of IIM-A has filed the PIL, requesting the court’s directions to the central government authorities and the premier institute to extend the benefits of the quota to the underrepresented communities in the programme. Last week, the Global IIM Alumni Network filed the PIL “in the interest of candidates belonging to communities of Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes and persons with disabilities…”. It has claimed that ten other IIMs including those in Bangalore, Calcutta, and Kozhikode have decided to implement the reservation for SC/ST and OBC candidates and for disabled people. The doctoral programme at IIM-A, which began in 1971, does not have reservation for the underrepresented communities. The quota system is not followed by IIM-A though it is governed and funded by the Union education ministry, the PIL has said. The institute has been acting contrary to the reservation policy and this calls for serious and immediate actions, the PIL has claimed. The PIL has sought a stay on the admission procedure in IIM-A’s PhD programme, stating that the present admission process is in gross violation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006. The PIL has said the institute is not providing reservation as stipulated by the Constitution. It has also sought directions to the authorities to enforce the quota system by making appropriate provisions for reservation under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2017. The PIL wants the HC to declare that IIM-A is bound to follow and implement Article 15(5) of the Constitution, which provides for reservation in educational institutes. This alumni association had filed a similar PIL in 2018. But it remained non-prosecuted for more than a year. In 2020, the high court disposed of it by saying that in case a person is aggrieved by IIM-A’s policy, he or she may approach the court. The new PIL is likely to come up for hearing after the Diwali vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/enforce-quota-in-iim-as-phd-course/articleshow/87614851.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Book fair might end on either Feb 10 or 13||KOLKATA : The executive committee meeting of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild tentatively decided on Tuesday that the International Kolkata Book Fair might end either on February 10 or 13. Guild officials however said that the members were divided in their opinion about the duration of the fair and a few more meetings were needed. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has given a green signal to the fair and announced on Monday that the fair would start from January 31. The Guild will make formal announcements on Friday. Covid related safety precautions remained the focus of the EC meeting and members suggested that just like pandals with three sides open were in vogue this time, book stalls might also follow that same route. While the Guild might not cut down on the number of stalls, it is likely that the space allotted to them will reduce so that a lot of space is kept around them for better people movement. Some publishers re allotted huge spaces to set up ther stalls as part of the fair tradition but this time such large stalls might not be set up, members who attended the meeting said. Architects have been invited by the Guild who will suggest the new layout of spaced out stalls and the possibility of open stalls. “The possibility of rains cannot be ruled out because it often rains during the fair. So we will have to check feasibility of open stalls,” said president of the Guild, Sudhangshu Dey. “Bangladesh is the theme country this time but we will have to see how many days participants from there would be willing to stay. Covid has changed everything and the biggest challenge would be to negotiate the health posers so that the fair can finally happen,” Dey added. The Guild might also mull the possibility of staggered entry to keep the numbers low. Only those who have received both the vaccines will be allowed inside the fair premises. Children’s vaccination is also a major cause of concern, Guild members felt because it would be risky to allow unvaccinated kids into the fairground. “One EC meeting is not enough to take a call on such multiple challenges. We will now debate on all the suggestions and finally arrive at a solution,” said Guild general secretary, Tridib Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/book-fair-might-end-on-either-jan-10-or-13/articleshow/87614055.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Reduction in taxes causes petrol pumps Rs 200 crore loss||MUMBAI: Petrol pump owners across Maharashtra faced losses to the tune of Rs 200 crore during Diwali due to a drop in petrol and diesel prices following a reduction in taxes. The cut in Central excise duty on fuel and the subsequent automatic reduction of VAT on excise duty in the state brought down the price of petrol by Rs 5.87 and that of diesel by Rs 12.48 per litre on November 4. The petrol pump owners incurred losses for having stocked huge quantities of fuel three days prior to the announcement about the reduction in taxes leading to the drop in fuel prices. They had purchased the fuel at ‘hefty rates’, dealers told TOI. The Federation of All Maharashtra Petrol Dealers Association (FAMPEDA) gathered data of losses incurred by hundreds of pumps across the state. FAMPEDA president Uday Lodh said, “There are 6,500 petrol pumps across the state, and we found that the collective estimated loss incurred by pump owners was Rs 200 crore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reduction-in-taxes-causes-petrol-pumps-rs-200cr-loss/articleshow/87614836.cms||Somit Sen

Malik, refuting allegations, said the land transition was legal and there were no irregularities. Fadnavis alleged the land was bought by Solidus Investments, in which Malik’s son Faraz is director, “for just Rs 30 lakh and Rs 20 lakh were paid. They bought the land for Rs 15 per sq ft, while market rate is Rs 8,500 per sq m and Rs 2,000 per sq ft, which means the land is worth Rs 3 crore,” he said. Fadnavis said the land belonged to the Goawala family in Kurla, and Salim Patel, “ driver, bodyguard and frontman of Haseena Parkar,” had irrevocable power of attorney for it. “The land was bought from Patel and from Shahawali Khan, a convict in the 1993 blasts case who is in jail serving a life term. Khan was part of the conspiracy and did the recce for planting bombs at BSE and BMC building. He had undergone arms training and was part of the group that filled RDX in vehicles at Tiger Memon’s building in Mahim. Malik’s son Faraz signed registration papers,” Fadnavis alleged. Fadnavis said the transaction began in 2003 and was completed in 2005. “Khan was convicted under TADA, where all property belonging to such convicts can be seized by government. So Malik’s family bought the land from Khan and Patel to protect it. They must answer if there was black money involved or if there were other reasons. Why did they buy land from a terror convict and those with underworld links? I will send all documents to the appropriate agencies and to NCP chief Sharad Pawar,” he said. He alleged Malik’s family bought 4 more properties from those with gangland links. “Nawab Malik himself was director in Solidus Investments for a short duration. This means he has business relations with the underworld,” he said. Malik, in his reply, said he would “detonate a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday” on “Fadnavis’s underworld links.” He claimed, “Fadnavis has made a mountain out of a molehill. He said he will hand over documents to investigating agencies. We are ready to go face any probe. Fadnavis gave information about Salim Patel and Sardar Khan. Khan’s house is still in Goawala compound. For 70 years, Khan’s father has been working as watchman for the Goawala family. When we took the property from the Goawala family, Khan claimed ownership of a 300-m patch. We bought only a 300 sq m plot from him. We did not buy under pressure or from an accused.” Malik added, “We were tenants on the property. When the landlord asked us to buy the land, the watchman (Khan) put his name on the land, so we paid for it legally. I don’t know Haseena Parkar, we have no link with gangsters. I have no idea if Salim Patel is absconding or is a goon.” Malik said his daughter would send a legal notice to Fadnavis for alleging cannabis was found on his son-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-family-bought-kurla-land-cheap-from-93-blasts-case-convict-fadnavis/articleshow/87615760.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In a major milestone for the 82-km-long high-speed corridor, the first span of the viaduct of the Delhi stretch has been completed near New Ashok Nagar. The upcoming New Ashok Nagar RRTS station was also the location where the first pillar of the elevated section of the Delhi stretch of the corridor had come up in June this year. A spokesperson of National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is executing the project, said that the first constructed ‘span’ was about 34 metres long and had been constructed over pillars that were about seven metres in height. “The span is being made with the help of ‘box segments,’ which are being precasted at the Ghazipur casting yard,” he said.“Generally, 12 box segments are used to make a span for the RRTS viaduct,” he said, adding that these segments are brought to the site by large trailers from the casting yard and then installed ‘launchers’ by heavy cranes. The elevated RRTS viaduct is being constructed using launching gantries, which are installed between two pillars and help join the pre-cast box segments by the process of gluing and stressing, after which these form a span as the part of the viaduct. “The entire process of gluing, stressing, and tying the pre-cast segments by wires onto the slung launcher is conducted under the supervision of infrastructure experts and all safety and security measures are taken care of,” he said. The Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor has a total of 25 stations, out of which four are in Delhi and 21 in Uttar Pradesh. The spokesperson said that the foundation work for Sarai Kale Khan RRTS elevated station was in progress and work on the Anand Vihar underground RRTS station was also being done at a fast pace, with the work of launching Tunnel Boring Machine being under process. The Delhi section starts from Sarai Kale Khan and passes above the existing Barapullah flyover in the way of crossing the Yamuna to reach New Ashok Nagar station. NCRTC is also working on the construction work of RRTS bridge over the river, which would come up parallel to the DND Flyway, for the viaduct between New Ashok Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan. “All the prescribed guidelines to mitigate pollution are being religiously followed at the RRTS construction sites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-section-of-rrts-takes-shape/articleshow/87614828.cms||Sidharatha Roy

On November 8, the railways ministry gave its green light to the proposal of South Eastern Railways (SER) of running the train through the new route. As per the Railway Board’s directive, the 12353/12354 Rajdhani Express will operate through the new route every Thursday. However, it will not make stops at the Lohardaga station and will have stoppages at Daltonganj, Garhwa Road, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Junction and Prayagraj station. “At present, the Ranchi Rajdhani Express operates four days a week. It reaches New Delhi via the Ranchi-Muri-Barkakana route in two days and takes the Ranchi–Bokaro route in the next two days. After the new directive, it will run through Muri and Barkakana once a week,” Pradeep Gupta, the divisional railway manager of Ranchi railway division, told TOI on Tuesday. “The travel time between Ranchi and New Delhi stations will be reduced by at least 90 minutes,” Gupta added. The SER had formally pitched for running the Rajdhani through the 112-km long Lohardaga Tori railway route in July this year, nearly eight months after Ranchi railway division completed the route’s electrification and speed trials. Though the Railway Board had given its in-principle consent, the announcement came on Monday late evening. The Railway Board also gave its nod to the operation of a special express train between Ranchi and Chopan railway station in Uttar Pradesh from Wednesday onwards. The train, which will operate every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, will leave Ranchi at 8:20 am and arrive at Chopan at 4 pm. It will have stoppages at Piska, Lohardaga, Latehar, Barwadih Junction, Datonganj, Garhwa Road, Garhwa, Ramna, Nagar Untari, Duddhinagar and Renukut stations. Palamu MP V D Ram will flag off the train at Garhwa Road station. Jharkhand Passengers’ Association welcomed the decision to run the Rajdhani on the new route. “It was a long standing demand and we welcome it. But we also demand that the train must have a stoppage at Lohardaga station. If the platform is unfit for a stoppage, then adequate infrastructure may be done,” JPA secretary Prem Kataruka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-rajdhani-to-run-via-lohardaga-route-every-thursday/articleshow/87613895.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The officials said they are now trying to collect scat and other samples such as prey killed by the big cat to further validate their findings. PTR’s field director Kumar Ashutosh said Bareysarn ranger Tarun Kumar Singh and his team of six trackers had a direct sighting of the tiger. “We have all the reasons to trust the version of our ranger and the trackers. Nevertheless, we need to look for the kill, pug marks and scat of the tiger,” Ashutosh said, adding that Tarun is a dedicated ranger and knows the importance of a direct sighting of the tiger. The last sighting of a tiger was reported in early 2020 through a trap camera. At the moment, there is no consensus on the official figure of the tigers in the PTR. While the NTCA, in its last nationwide census, has found zero tigers in the PTR, officials of the reserve claimed around three to four tigers are in the national park. PTR is spread over 1,100 sq kilometres with more than 400 sq kilometres earmarked as the core area. In another development, the deputy director of the PTR’s north division, Kumar Ashish, said they have captured images of two leopard cubs at the cross junction of road number 3 and 5 in compartment number 2 of the Betla National Park. “The leopard cubs were not physically sighted but their images were recorded in a high super sensor camera installed inside the Betla National Park. The cubs were recorded on November 5 at 5.54 pm,” he said, adding that the cubs look healthy and energetic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tiger-2-leopard-cubs-sighted-in-ptr/articleshow/87613954.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the industrialization and consequent migration have contributed majorly to increase salinity in the state. In its latest book titled ‘Revisiting ecology of the Gujarat coast: Trends of last two decades’, city-based Gujarat Ecology Society (GES) tried ascertaining how coastal dynamics have been altered over a span of 23 years. In their study, researchers at GES found that livelihood of people have changed, sex ratio has been disturbed, urbanization has increased, which have all added to salinity. “Soil and groundwater salinity has increased due to increasing agricultural activities, too much use of groundwater for irrigation and domestic purposes,” said Dr Jayendra Lakhmapurkar, director of GES. He added as population along the coastal areas has increased, people go on digging tubewells and water table has gone down. While the overall state population between 1991 and 2011 increased by 23%, in coastal areas, the population during the same period increased by 38%. “Besides over exploitation of groundwater, damming the river and untreated sewerage water also play major role,” Lakhmapurkar added. In 1960, Khar Land Development Board had found that 12,164 sq km land in the state was saline which increased to 16,899 sq km in 1992 as per the study done by Central Soil Salinity Research Institute. In 2019, Indian Space Research Organisation’s research found 18,073 sq km of land saline. “As salinity increases, there will be an affect on several health hazards like kidney diseases or fluorosis if fluoride content is high,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/coastal-salinity-in-gujarat-increasing-by-the-day-study/articleshow/87613055.cms||Jay Pachchigar

A division bench of Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad and Justice Ananda Sen made the observation while hearing habeas corpus filed by Vardhan’s wife Sweta Priyadarshini after her husband was thrashed and taken away by Patna Police and its Sukhdevnagar police station counterparts at 10.30 pm on Saturday. The judges also questioned Bihar and Jharkhand governments to explain why Vardhan was picked up without following the procedures established in law. The bench also hauled up Ranchi Police for its assistance in the picking up of Vardhan from his house at Sukhdevnagar. In her petition, Sweta said her husband was mercilessly beaten by the Bihar police and forced him inside the vehicle. She has further said despite requests made by her and he husband, the policemen did not reveal why Vardhan was being taken away or in what case is he involved. Soon after her husband was picked up, Sweta informed the Advocates’ Association, which helped her filed the habeas corpus with the high court immediately swung. The court then agreed to hear her petition on Tuesday despite being closed for the ongoing Diwali-Chhat holidays. After hearing the state and Bihar government counsels, the court has sought a reply from Patna and Ranchi SSPs as well as the Danapur SP (Bihar) under whose jurisdiction Vardhan was arrested. The court has also ordered the chief secretary of Jharkhand to be made a party in the case. The matter will be heard again on November 25. Meanwhile, the Advocates’ Association secretary Navin Kumar said the police have flouted the procedures to be followed while arresting a person. “Such high-handedness of the police cannot be accepted at any cost,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-lawyer-abducted-by-bihar-cops-hc/articleshow/87613962.cms||---

But on Diwali this year, the ghats on Vishwamitri River came alive with hundreds of diyas lit there. A group of Barodians had come together and illuminated the ghats near Kala Ghoda Circle on November 4. The ghats that were once a popular spot among the residents of the erstwhile Baroda state used to be lit with diyas during the Gaekwadi era. “Over the period of time, we forgot our heritage and importance of such sites. So, we decided to celebrate Diwali on these ghats this year,” said Vishal Thakur, who has been organizing programmes to spread awareness about Vishwamitri River. Thakur, Sanjay Soni and some other citizens came together and cleaned up the ghats on the eve of Diwali. “We removed all the garbage and cleaned the ghats that were in shabby condition. On the day of Diwali, we drew rangoli and then lit the ghats with diyas. It was a mesmerizing experience as Vishwamitri ghats resembled the ghats in Ayodhya,” Thakur told TOI. “Many citizens turned up for the programme and we discussed how to revive the river and restore the ghats. By organizing such events, we can involve more citizens and revive the river that has such historical significance for us,” Thakur added. This group has been organizing several programmes and working to save not just the river but hundreds of crocodiles who reside in Vishwamitri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vishwamitri-ghats-come-alive-with-diyas-rangoli/articleshow/87613064.cms||Tushar Tere
---||India||If citizens put duties over rights, India can achieve great heights: Rijiju||NEW DELHI: Union law minister Kiran Rijiju on Tuesday said the government and judiciary are duty bound to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens, but the country would reach great heights only when everyone put their fundamental duties above their rights. "Only preservation and protection of citizens' fundamental rights does not make a country great. Everyone must understand the importance of constitutional duties. If everyone treats constitutional duties above constitutional rights, no one can stop our country from scaling great heights," Rijiju said at a function in Greater Noida to mark the 26th anniversary of National Legal Services Authority, celebrated as Legal Services Day across the country. However, the law minister said the trial courts, where nearly four crore cases are pending, required the maximum support from the higher courts and the government. "So many common people are not getting justice. It is not easy for the commoners to get justice. It is the bounden duty of the judiciary and the government to work together to popularise the free legal aid mechanism to bridge the gap between justice and commoners," he said. Rijiju praised Chief Justice of India N V Ramana as the man who has strengthened the judiciary and said "such a judge is a true blessing for the country". He also praised Justice U U Lalit, the executive chairman of NALSA, as the one who infused new vigour into NALSA activities. CJI Ramana said Justice Lalit has travelled to the four corners of the country in an effort to invigourate the legal services authorities upto taluka level to live the dream of reaching free legal aid to the last man standing in queue for justice. If the law minister praised the judges, the CJI and Justice Lalit, who will be the next CJI, too praised Rijiju for his wholehearted support to the judiciary in speedy appointment of judges and extending help in making legal aid reach to the maximum number of needy. CJI said, " In the recent past, Rijiju is the only law minister who understood the hard work put in by the judges and the judiciary. Justice Ramana said, "While the concept of legal aid was institutionalised in 1995, the actual legal aid movement started much before our independence and during our freedom struggle. Several legal stalwarts used to offer their pro-bono legal services to our freedom fighters and fought against the might of the colonial powers." He said, "Over the course of 26 years, the legal services authorities have broken the traditional notions of legal aid and have given an expanded meaning to access to justice. Today, the role of legal services authorities is not constrained merely to the provision of court based legal representation. They also work towards legal awareness, legal literacy, social action litigation, settlement of disputes through Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanisms, among others." Justice Lalit said the law students must act as paralegal volunteers to spread awareness about existing free legal aid among the people who reside in even the remote corners of the country. "These law students, acquiring knowledge about the problems faced in access to justice by people, could tomorrow become NALSA panel counsel," he said attempting to incentivise the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-citizens-put-duties-over-rights-india-can-achieve-great-heights-rijiju/articleshow/87616397.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Cost overrun of 65 lakh per day due to Chardham case: Government estimate||NEW DELHI: The cost overrun of the strategic Chardham road project is nearly Rs 65 lakh per day as the works are stuck due to a pending case in the Supreme Court, according to an estimate prepared by the government. TOI has learnt that the cumulative cost overrun is close to Rs 240 crore in the past one year. The ambitious Chardham Chardham road connects Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The project is stuck as the apex court is hearing a case filed against the road transport and highways ministry alleging violations of environmental norms for this project. The court is yet to give its verdict on the lane width of the strategic road project, which extends close to the China border in Uttarakhand. Recently, the cabinet secretary had asked all departments to consult with the solicitor general and state governments concerned for effective settlement of court cases, which are impacting major infrastructure projects and also causing losses to the exchequer. At least 93 infrastructure projects are impacted due to court orders and they have an associated cost of approximately Rs 14,700 crore, a source said. TOI has learnt that the Chardham road project was divided into 53 works and 40 of them with a cumulative length of 672 km has been sanctioned for Rs 9,475 crore. Out of the 40 sanctioned works, 38 have been awarded, which have a total length of 646 km. One work has been foreclosed based on technical unviability and the remaining one requires revision of the project report based on the final decision on the width of the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cost-overrun-of-65-lakh-per-day-due-to-chardham-case-government-estimate/articleshow/87616425.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||As traffic snarls continue for 2nd day, more cops deployed to ease congestion||PANAJI: For yet another day, traffic snarls at the Merces junction and along the Siridao-Agassaim stretch saw bumper to bumper traffic. Goa police blamed ongoing highway works and the closure of the Ribandar causeway for the congestion, which has become a daily occurrence. In view of the massive traffic congestion witnessed in Panaji on Monday, Goa police roped in additional personnel from various traffic cells and deployed them at the entrance of the city to streamline vehicular movement and ensure smooth flow of traffic. Director general of police (DGP) Mukesh Kumar Meena also held a meeting with various authorities and officials to find ways to ease the traffic congestion. On Tuesday, traffic was seen backed up on Atal Setu and near the Merces junction. A similar logjam at Siridao brought all vehicles heading to Vasco and Margao to a grinding halt. Traffic was diverted through Goa Velha since the bypass was closed for south-bound traffic. Meena said that due to the closure of the Ribandar causeway, all vehicles have been diverted on one road, and also many choke points have developed owing to maintenance works. “We have deployed additional manpower. We have also asked the authorities to repair the roads as early as possible,” Meena said. He also said that the police department has issued instructions to identify vulnerable points and deploy additional staff at night time wherever there is a high volume of vehicles and traffic congestion. “Travelling on Goan roads has become a nightmare not just due to potholes, but also traffic mismanagement,” said a disgruntled motorist, Harshal Naik. Several ambulances were seen stuck in the traffic jams, which also inconvenienced office-goers, tourists and those rushing to catch flights. With domestic tourism in full flow, vehicles parked outside the off-shore casinos in the state capital also create a nuisance and a bottleneck. Meena said that he has also asked police stations to identify at least one or two places where round the clock personnel can be deployed to avoid untoward incidents during the tourism season. “We have provided new vehicles to the police control room, and these are being used for patrolling,” he said. The DGP said that while there is no rise in theft cases in the state, the detection rate of such cases is satisfactory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-traffic-snarls-continue-for-2nd-day-more-cops-deployed-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/87615061.cms||---

Congress South Goa district president Joseph Dias had issued an ultimatum to the government to repair and hotmix the road at Navelim bypass within 15 days, failing which he had warned of a larger agitation and of blocking the NH66. Congress working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco termed the Pramod Sawant-led government as “the most corrupt government which has turned deaf ears to the plight of the poor people who are suffering due to the poor policies and mishandling of the economy”. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, while addressing Congress workers, said that during the recent assembly he has suggested to the government to repair the roads, mainly the national highways as they are clogged due to substandard road construction and shoddy workmanship, which has resulted in the deterioration of the roads. The government, he said, has failed to act positively to alleviate the suffering of the regular commuters. President of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) Girish Chodankar, speaking on the occasion, stated that the government has no plan of action to ease the suffering of the general public on any of the issues. Mahila Congress president Beena Naik, GPCC secretary Subhash Faldesai, GPCC vice president Vithoba Dessai, North Goa district Congress president Vijay Bhike, besides others, participated in the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/people-suffering-due-to-poor-roads-govt-unconcerned-cong/articleshow/87615072.cms||---

The university will construct the hostel building with support from corporate sector. The proposed hostel building for which support has started pouring in will be the tallest building at the university campus.  Earlier this year, Linde Engineering India Private Limited had given a letter of intent to MSU to participate in the construction of the girls hostel building.  The university is proposing to construct the new hostel building at the current location of chief warden’s office which is near to the existing Halls of Residence (girls campus).  Linde is contributing in the project as part of its CSR activities. “We are also trying to rope in other corporates,” said MSU registrar Dr K M Chudasama. Over the years, the number of girl students enrolled at the university has seen a significant rise. Even as university has carried out extension works at the existing hostel buildings, it continues to face space-crunch when it comes to accommodating all the girl students.  The university has already formed a committee to draw out and recommend a firm plan for the project. The committee is also looking into feasibility of constructing additional floors at the existing boys hostel campus of the Halls of Residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/seven-floor-hostel-building-for-msu-girl-students/articleshow/87613080.cms||---

He lost his left leg in a landmine blast while fighting with the Indian contingent for the Allied forces in Italy on December 15, 1944, and was discharged two years later on a basic pension reserved for soldiers invalided out of service for war wounds. Singh, enlisted in 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943 and transferred to Rajputana Rifles following his return from WWII, had applied for a pension that the government introduced in 1972, guaranteeing “100% of the last salary drawn” to Indian soldiers discharged from service because of wounds in various wars since Independence. However, soldiers who lost their limbs or were maimed for life fighting in the two World Wars were excluded from this retirement scheme. More than 2.5 million Indians fought in WWII alone. A New Delhi bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal — taking over the case from its Jaipur unit that was hearing it since 2010 — ruled in favour of the nonagenarian soldier on Tuesday. An administrative member from Chennai said Singh would get 100% pension from 2008 along with arrears, which is prior to three years before he filed the case. Singh’s counsel Col (retired) S B Singh said the WWII veteran and his family were delighted with the news. “Balwant Singh’s disability is 100% as he lost his left leg. We are happy that he got at least some of the dues denied to him.” Singh served in the pre-Independence Indian Army for three years, two months and 16 days before he was retired prematurely for having lost a leg. His son Subhash Singh said he was happy with the tribunal’s decision, but the family could have done better had the state come forward to help it. “We live in a village and knew nothing about the pension for the battle-wounded. We came to know of it only after the Kargil War (summer 1999),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-97-wwii-veteran-wins-battle-for-disability-pension/articleshow/87616360.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Goa||Oppn criticises govt for diverting traffic police for parl programme||Panjim: The opposition on Tuesday came down heavily on the government over the traffic chaos and for diverting police personnel as well as using buses to transport attendees for a parliament programme being held in Taleigao. TOI frontpaged a report of hundreds of commuters stuck in mega traffic jams on all three Mandovi bridges, including Atal Setu, and the Panaji-Merces, Panaji-Miramar and Agasaim-Verna stretches lasting hours. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that the government has been unable to handle the pressure of traffic. “We are still in the month of November and traffic management has been at its lowest. All the police personnel are accompanying VIPs at the five-day women’s parliament programme but there is not a single police personnel for traffic management on the highway,” he told reporters. “Travelling from Mapusa to Panaji has turned into a one-hour journey and is worse if one is going from Panaji to Canacona. This government doesn’t know what the people need,” Khaunte added. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat questioned the state of governance and said that the Zuari bridge contractor has begun transporting bridge material on cranes during the daytime. “Earlier the transportation of the beams was happening at night,” he told reporters. At the last two-day legislative assembly session, Kamat had advised that all bridge work be stopped until the road is made motorable. “Several office-goers travelling from Margao to Panaji were left waiting for public transport as buses were diverted to the women’s parliament programme and as a result regular commuters couldn’t reach work on time,” Kamat said. “For whom is this parliament being held?

It’s everyone’s money,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-criticises-govt-for-diverting-traffic-police-for-parl-programme/articleshow/87615090.cms||---

Congress has neither a strong candidate nor a sound base in the suburb where Khaunte has strengthened his hold in the last two terms. For the past few months, the party has been wooing Khaunte, but haven’t got a firm response from him yet. Khaunte on Tuesday admitted that he has been in talks with Congress. “Working in that direction, some of our people have joined Congress. In the days to come, after talking to our supporters, a decision (about me joining the party) will be taken in the interest of Goa,” Khaunte said responding to a query about his plans to join the party. He said that for the past two months he has worked to ensure that all like-minded people come together and fight against those out there to divide secular votes, and to protect Goa’s identity. He said that they were in touch with Congress at the Centre and state level. “All coalition partners have to come together on a common platform to defeat the BJP government and for that to happen we need a majority,” he said. “We are putting bricks to build a wall. In the days to come we will inform you about what’s being done. Right now, I’m an independent candidate, and I can’t join till my term ends,” he said. Khaunte said that they have to ensure that whatever plans that Congress has are defined and definitive — whether it be bringing coalition partners together or regional forces, drawing an election strategy or giving new faces a chance. We have asked Congress to work on those factors, Khaunte said. “We have a role to play in Tiswadi and Bardez and we will play it,” he added. ZP member Gupesh Naik, chairperson of women’s federation, Porvorim, Marina Moraes, Agnel Pereira, panch of Salvador do Mundo, Hemant Borkar, panch of Penhe de Franca, Shyamsundar Kamat, coopted member of Socoro panchayat, Subhash Halarnkar and several others joined Congress in the presence of opposition leader Digambar Kamat and president of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Girish Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/supporters-join-cong-khauntes-decision-awaited/articleshow/87615097.cms||---
---||Goa||‘CM should stop MPT’s interference’||Margao: Congress working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant pointing out to “harassment” meted out to some shack owners in South Goa by the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) by insisting that they obtain its NOCs for erecting shacks on beaches, which it claims are within the port limits. He has sought immediate intervention of the chief minister with a view to ensuring that “state’s assets and people are protected from MPT’s nefarious designs”. “For the past many years, I have been repeatedly stating both within and outside the House of the Goa legislative Assembly that MPT is arbitrarily and malafidely interpreting the port limits notification to suit its own vested interests. By interfering with shack owners in South Goa, MPT, in anticipation of its impending corporatisation and privatisation under the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, is now testing the mood, patience and perseverance of Goans,” Lourenco said in his letter to the chief minister. The Shack Owners Association, objecting to the MPT’s insistence on obtaining its NOC for setting up shacks, has also urged Sawant to intervene and resolve the issue. The Curtorim MLA, in his letter, further expressed his apprehensions that the MPT’s larger plan was to “control and take over Goa’s waters and vast coastline falling within the port limits to enable its exploitation by corporates and private players in the near future”. The Major Ports Authorities Act 2021, he pointed out, was an integral part of the Sagarmala project initiated by the union government, “whose sole aim appears to be wholesale privatisation of public assets.” Pointing out that he has repeatedly brought the issue of the “draconian” Major Port Authorities Bill within and outside the assembly much before its enactment by Parliament, Lourenco also sought to underscore MPT’s “expansionist tendencies”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-should-stop-mpts-interference/articleshow/87615100.cms||---
---||Goa||MPT halts setting up of two beach shacks at Baina||VASCO: The Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) stopped the erection of two shacks at Baina beach citing permission issues. The port officials visited the site at Baina and asked the operators to first seek permissions from MPT. Shack owners Kalidas Phadte said he and one more person have the requisite permission from the tourism department. As there were some issues with the Mormugao Municipal Council, they had approached the court and won the case. When they started erecting the shacks, MPT personnel told them that they cannot carry on with work without taking their permission and paying certain fees. “MPT has started harassing shack owners at South Goa beaches. This cannot be tolerated,” founder member of Goencho Ekvott, Orville Dourado said. President of the Goa Shack Owners Welfare Society, Cruz Cardozo has warned that shack owners will oppose MPT’s decision tooth and nail. He said that MPT cannot dictate terms as permission has been granted by the tourism department and the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority. A couple of days ago, Arossim shackowners also questioned MPT officials on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-halts-setting-up-of-two-beach-shacks-at-baina/articleshow/87615111.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Daily tractor march to Parliament by farmers during winter session, says SKM||NEW DELHI: To observe one year of the movement against the Centre's three agri laws, 500 farmers will participate in a peaceful tractor march to Parliament every day during the winter session starting November 29, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Tuesday. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the laws, which were stayed by the Supreme Court in January, at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year. An umbrella body of 40 farmer unions, SKM is leading the stir. It announced the tractor march after it held a meeting. Farmer leaders, who were present in the meeting, said that those participating in the tractor march will sit wherever police stop them. In a statement, the amalgam said that it will observe one year of the movement on and after November 26 in a massive way all over India. "The morcha decided that from November 29 till the end of this parliament session, 500 selected farmer volunteers will move every day to Parliament in tractor trolleys peacefully and with full discipline, to assert their rights to protest in the national capital," the statement said. This will be done to "'increase the pressure" on the Centre "to force it to concede the demands for which farmers across the country have launched a historic struggle", it said. Earlier in March too, farmers had taken out a foot march to Parliament to oppose the contentious three farm laws. On January 26, a tractor rally had turned violent with protesters breaking barricades, attacking security personnel and storming the Red Fort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-daily-tractor-march-to-parliament-by-farmers-during-winter-session-says-skm/articleshow/87616476.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Gurnam Singh Charuni stuck on Punjab polls, names candidate of unnamed party||BATHINDA: Despite objections being raised by farmer organisations of Punjab, Haryana-based farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni is going ahead with his plan to take the political plunge in Punjab when the state goes to vote next year. Charuni, who heads the Haryana-based Charuni faction of BKU, had announced ‘Mission Punjab’ some months ago, aimed at contesting assembly elections in Punjab. Giving shape to his agenda on Tuesday, Charuni announced a leader who would represent Fatehgarh Sahib assembly segment, saying he will be the candidate after his party is registered. Charuni said they could not expect any welfare from traditional political parties and to get their issues solved, farmers and workers would have to grab power and that could be ensured by contesting elections. On August 10, traders from Punjab and Haryana had assembled in Ludhiana and announced to form a political party, naming it Bhartiya Arthik Party, with Charuni as the chief ministerial face. Irked over it, farmer organisations from Punjab had asked Charuni to stop pursuing ‘Mission Punjab’ on political lines, as farmers awere more concerned about getting their demands of getting farm laws repealed and implementation of a law on MSP. In a meeting on Monday, farm groups had decided to hold a press conference in Chandigarh either on November 11 or 13 to ask Charuni not to go ahead with his agenda. Charuni did not respond despite numerous calls to him through the day. Every time, his support staff said that he was busy in meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/charuni-stuck-on-punjab-polls-names-candidate-of-unnamed-party/articleshow/87615139.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||8.3 lakh cameras in Telangana, Hyderabad turning into surveillance city: Amnesty||HYDERABAD: Hyderabad is on the brink of becoming a total surveillance city. Extensive surveillance is putting human rights at risk, Amnesty International has said in a statement, bringing sharp focus on CCTV camera network and the facial recognition technology (FRT) of Telangana police. It also raised serious security concerns over the upcoming Command Control Centre (CCC) at Banjara Hills. In a statement on ‘Automated Harassment in Hyderabad’ released on Tuesday, international NGO Amnesty said that in recent years, Telangana has been a test site for increased usage of “dangerous facial recognition technologies against civilians”. As part of its ‘Ban the Scan’ campaign against FRT, Amnesty observed that extensive surveillance of Hyderabad is putting human rights at risk. “Hyderabad is on the brink of becoming a total surveillance city.” “It is almost impossible to walk down the street without risking exposure to facial recognition,” Amnesty International’s AI and Big Data researcher Matt Mahmoudi said. “In addition to CCTV, we are concerned that law enforcement (personnel’s) practice of using tablets to stop, search and photograph civilians without charge could be used for facial recognition.” he added. Amnesty, Internet Freedom Foundation and ARTICLE 19, which work on freedom of expression and information, mapped visible outdoor CCTV infrastructure locations in two areas in Hyderabad. Sampling was done at Kalapathar and Kishanbagh with the help of local volunteers. “Based on geospatial analysis, it was estimated that in these neighbourhoods 530,864 (53.7%) square metres and 513,683 (62.7%) sqm, respectively, was covered by CCTV cameras.,” an Amnesty study said. Amnesty also made serious observations on the Command Control Centre, dubbed Police Twin Towers with real-time FRT and surveillance infrastructure. “The Command Control Centre reportedly supports processing of data from up to 600,000 cameras at once, with the possibility to increase this scope much further across the region. These cameras can be used in combination with Hyderabad Police’s existing facial recognition software to track individuals,” Amnesty said. “Facial recognition technology can track who you are, where you go, what you do, and who you know. It threatens human rights, including the Right to Privacy, and puts some of the most vulnerable in society at risk. The construction of CCC has chilling consequences for the Right to Freedom of Expression and assembly.” said Quinn McKew, executive director at ARTICLE 19. “There is currently no legislation in place to protect the privacy of citizens – facial recognition is a harmful and invasive technology and it is imperative that Indian authorities immediately stop the use of this dangerous technology,” said Anushka Jain of Internet Freedom Foundation’s associate counsel for surveillance & transparency. Amnesty International said that the footage of dozens of incidents shared on social media between November 2019 and July 2021 showed Hyderabad police asking civilians to remove their masks and photographing them in the streets. Other cases have shown police randomly demanding both facial and fingerprint reads from civilians. “Under the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920, it is not permitted to take photographs of persons by police, unless arrested or convicted of a crime, and neither was the sharing of such photographs with other law enforcement agencies,” it said. In addition, a study by Internet Freedom Foundation found that Telangana has the highest number of FRT projects in India. In early January 2021 , a report on Surveillance Cities by Surfshark had ranked Hyderabad second in the world with 480 CCTV cameras per square kilometre. Chennai, London, Delhi and several cities in China were named in it. Another report in July 2020 by Comparitech, a consumer portal, which analysed public CCTV cameras in the 150 most densely populated cities in the world, had ranked Hyderabad 16 among the world’s top 20 surveilled cities, which includes London and some cities in China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-3l-cameras-in-t-hyd-turning-into-surveillance-city-amnesty/articleshow/87615657.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Amritsar||Centre’s limit on paddy procurement, Punjab decides to close mandis||BATHINDA: The state government, going by the paddy procurement limit of 170 lakh MT set by the Centre, has decided to close many mandis, inviting criticism from farmers. The move comes as Punjab food and civil supplies department has directed district officials to check land sowing entries and land mapping for paddy procurement. Officials have been directed not to release payment where land entries of a farmer have been made by different arhtiyas or where land mapping of same khasra number has been mapped for more than one farmer. The action is learnt to have been taken on the central government’s directions for not accepting more than 170 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. Punjab was looking to procure 190 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. Earlier, there had been complaints of paddy being brought from other states at rates less than MSP and being sold in Punjab at MSP. The director of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, in a letter to all district controllers of food and civil supplies, about land sowing entries on Tuesday directed that no payment should be released in case where the same khasra number of the land had been mapped for more than one farmer, where the arrival from a particular land/farmer exceeded the yield fixed for the particular district, where same khasra number has been mapped by two arhtiyas for the same farmer. The directions have been made in light of a letter written by Punjab state agricultural marketing board’s secretary to district mandi officers on Monday. In the letter, it was mentioned that during mapping of farmland and the resultant confirmation of paddy sowing land details, if a land entry had been mapped over and above the available land, such an entry was highlighted by the system as a red entry. Such red entries had been provided in the login IDs of DMOs and SMCs. To ensure land mapped and paddy sowing details are not over and above the land availability, DMOs will from their logins take a printout of such a red entry and undertake reconciliation with the arhtiya concerned. There may be cases where the same land had been mapped for farmers by different arhtiyas, so DMOs need to reconcile such entries with all concerned arhtiyas. The land reconciliation exercise has to be undertaken on priority. “It all is being done under pressure from central government, while still 15% paddy is yet to arrive in mandis,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan. Rashtriya Sheller Sangh general secretary Prem Goyal said the state government had not clarified about purchases of paddy above 170 lakh MT as the state had already procured the paddy nearly 170 lakh MT. The government should clarify about it at the earliest, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/centres-limit-on-paddy-procurement-punjab-decides-to-close-mandis/articleshow/87615195.cms||Neel Kamal
