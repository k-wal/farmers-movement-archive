IRF was termed as an "unlawful association" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on November 17, 2016 for a period of five years. The ban was due to expire on Tuesday. An MHA notification extending the ban said that the Central government is of the opinion that the IRF and its members, particularly, its founder and president, Zakir Abdul Karim Naik alias Zakir Naik, has been encouraging and aiding its followers to promote or attempt to promote, on grounds of religion, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious communities and groups which are prejudicial to the integrity and security of the country. It referred to his statements and speeches saying that they were objectionable and subversive, and added that Naik, through such speeches and statements, was inspiring youths of a particular religion in India and abroad, to commit terrorist acts. It further noted that Naik had made radical statements and speeches to millions of people worldwide through international satellite TV, internet, print and social media. The notification stated that if the unlawful activities of IRF were not curbed and controlled immediately, it will take the opportunity to continue its subversive activities and re-organise its activists who are still absconding; disrupt the secular fabric of the country by polluting the minds of the people by creating communal disharmony; propagate anti-national sentiments; escalate secessionism by supporting militancy; and undertake activities which are prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and security of the country. "Islamic Research Foundation has been indulging in activities, which are prejudicial to the security of the country and have the potential of disturbing peace and communal harmony and disrupting the secular fabric of the country," the MHA said while exercising its powers under Section 3 of UAPA to declare IRF as an unlawful association for a further period of five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-extends-uapa-ban-on-zakir-naiks-ngo-islamic-research-foundation-by-5-years/articleshow/87724254.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Border areas deserve peace and development: Mehbooba Mufti||R S PURA: Emphasizing that friendly relations between India and Pakistan were paramount for sustainable peace and development of the whole subcontinent, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said that people living in border areas were the worst affected and deserved peace the most. She also lambasted the 'callous attitude' of the J&K administration towards farmers who suffered massive losses due to recent adverse weather conditions. The former chief minister said rice cultivators in the border belts of Jammu and those growing apples and dry fruits in Kashmir contribute a major portion towards the economy of J&K, and in both the regions the losses suffered by them due to rain and snowfall ran into crores of rupees. “I am told that the government has assured peanuts as compensation to the farmers of R S Pura, Bishnah, Samba and other plains of Jammu where farmers have suffered extensive damage to their standing crops,” Mufti said. She said that the sudden change in weather has damaged the crops of farmers and brought them to the verge of starvation. “But the government, I am told, has fixed Rs 600 compensation per kanal, which is disgraceful and disdainful for this hard working class of society,” she said. She also lambasted the BJP-led central government, stating that it had adopted a hostile attitude towards farmers across the country and J&K was no exception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/border-areas-deserve-peace-and-development-mehbooba-mufti/articleshow/87724438.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: PM Narendra Modi to launch Purvanchal Expressway on November 16||LUCKNOW: The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway, connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, just months ahead of crucial UP assembly elections. It would be the longest operational expressway of India, overtaking Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which is 301-km long. PM Modi is scheduled to arrive in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft that will land on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Kurebhar stretch of the Access Controlled Greenfield expressway in Sultanpur and will dedicate the project to the people almost three years after laying its foundation on July 14, 2018, in Azamgarh. The Purvanchal Expressway project was launched to spur development in the remote east UP region that has lagged in infrastructure and industrialisation. Experts said the expressway could give BJP an advantage over its political rivals in the eastern UP region that also comprises PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. Starting from village Chand Sarai on Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH-731) in Lucknow, the expressway passes through seven districts — Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh and Mau — before ending at village Haidariya on National Highway No.19 in Ghazipur, just 18 km away from UP-Bihar border. “The expressway has been the dream project of the state government and CM Yogi Adityanath. The project was completed in record time despite severe restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic,” said UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO Awanish Awasthi on the eve of the inauguration. All the preparations for the inauguration by the Prime Minister have been completed, he added. CM Yogi on Monday had an inspection of the site of the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration will also witness the landing of fighter aircraft on the 3.2 km long and 34 mt wide emergency air strip at Sultanpur. Constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 22,496 crore (including the land cost), the expressway has eight packages. UPEIDA officials said the tenders received were around 5.19% less than the estimated cost, resulting in a profit of around Rs 614 crore to the authority. The six-lane expressway (expandable up to eight lanes) has 18 flyovers, seven railway over-bridges (ROBs) and 271 underpasses. According to a UPEIDA document, the work of setting up eight toilet blocks and four petrol pumps is in progress. In the event of an accident, a total of 16 ambulances (two each in every package) will be available for quick assistance and speedy transport of the injured to the nearest hospital. The expressway will provide the much needed connectivity from the east UP region to the state capital and then to Delhi through Lucknow-Agra Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The state government also plans to set up 21 industrial points in the hinterland of the expressway in an area of 9,171 hectares. The state government has identified handloom industry, food processing units, storage plants, mandi and milk-based industries for the purpose. Opportunities will also be available for establishment of Industrial Training Institute, educational and training institutes, medical institutes near the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-pm-narendra-modi-to-launch-purvanchal-expressway-on-november-16/articleshow/87724207.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||World||Battle underway for release of Mountbatten diaries which UK says could compromise relations between UK, India and Pak||LONDON: A tribunal is underway in London which will determine whether all of the private diaries and letters of the Mountbattens should be released to the public despite concerns by the UK cabinet office that they will be "prejudicial to international relations between the UK, India and Pakistan" as well as a breach of the Queen’s personal data. British author Andrew Lownie has spent £250,000 (Rs 2.5 crore) of his own money on his court battle with the university of Southampton and the cabinet office to get all the diaries and letters released in the "name of academic freedom". "The material relating to India and Pakistan is very important as there is a huge debate as to how impartial Mountbatten was on independence and the degree of relationship Nehru had with both the Mountbattens, and so what they said is of great importance to historians and the material around the abdication and royal family could provide new insights too," Lownie said during cross-examination on Monday. The university of Southampton bought the Broadland Archives — which include the papers of the Mountbattens — from a Mountbatten family trust in 2011 for £4.5 million. But immediately the university closed off some of the archive, citing directions from the cabinet office. Following a complaint from Lownie, the Information Commissioner’s Office ordered the university to disclose all the Mountbatten diaries and correspondence in December 2019, but the university and the cabinet office appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) against this decision. That hearing is currently taking place. On Monday Clara Hamer, representing Lownie, said: "A total of £4.5 million of almost exclusively public money was spent to obtain for the nation the very documents that are now covered in redaction. Although we take an educated guess of what has been redacted, what we find is information that has been redacted as prejudicial to international relations between the UK, India and Pakistan, is there in the Mountbattens' daughter’s own book." She said in her book Pamela Mountbatten refers to the Jinnahs coming to dinner and says that "Jinnah’s attitude to the Sikh situation was unsound" and that "her mother vents in her diary he is already a megalomaniac so God help Pakistan." She also refers to another book, Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire, which she says shows that "Mountbatten and Jinnah were never friends". "In that the former calls latter various unpleasant names … so less than complimentary remarks about Jinnah are already in public domain," Hamer said. "It is a waste of time for the cabinet office to redact information that was in books about the Mountbattens for 35 years. Some of the information is utterly innocuous, such as a conversation between Moutbatten and the Queen at his 70th birthday party when he asks her what time he should go to bed and the Queen says ‘It’s your birthday — you have to stay up longer.’" Rory Dunlop QC, representing the university of Southampton, pointed out that 99.8% of the Broadlands archives had been released to the public and accused Lownie of "running an aggressive campaign in the media attacking the university and its staff".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/battle-underway-for-release-of-mountbatten-diaries-which-uk-says-could-compromise-relations-between-uk-india-and-pak/articleshow/87724469.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Explosion outside Liverpool hospital was suicide bomb attack, police say||LONDON: A taxi explosion outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital on Remembrance Sunday was a terrorist attack in which a male suicide bomber self-detonated, the UK police confirmed Monday. The UK terror threat level was on Monday raised to severe, meaning a terror attack is highly likely. Video footage shows the taxi exploding after pulling up in front of the hospital reception and the driver, named as David Perry (45), running out of the car whilst black plumes of smoke billowed out seconds before it went up in flames. Emergency services rushed to the scene and put out the fire. On Monday night the dead man was named by police as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. UK media reported he was born to parents of Syrian and Iraqi heritage, spent a large amount of his life in Iraq and entered Britain as an asylum-seeker. Perry was initially hospitalised for injuries and burns but has since been released. A local fundraiser has so far raised £20,000 (Rs 20 lakh) for him and Liverpool mayor Joanne Anderson praised him for "diverting what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital", which specialises in the health of women and babies. Chief constable Russ Jackson, counter-terrorism North West, said the suicide bomber had "asked to be taken to the Liverpool Women's Hospital", after hailing the taxi from the Rutland area of Liverpool, which is 10 minutes away. But UK media speculated his intended target may have been the Remembrance Sunday service at Liverpool Cathedral, 20 minutes walk from the hospital. At least 2,000 military personal, veterans and relatives of the fallen, together with civic dignitaries, had gathered in the cathedral on Sunday for its annual Remembrance Day Service. The taxi exploded outside the hospital at 10.59 am, just one minute before the annual two-minute silence to pay respect to the fallen. "This is being treated as the ignition of an explosive device," Jackson said. Enquiries "indicate that the device was brought into the cab by the passenger. Our enquiries indicate that an improvised explosive device has been manufactured and our assumption so far is that this was built by the passenger in the taxi. We believe we know the identity of the passenger," he added. "It is not clear what the motivation for this incident is. The reason why he took it to the women’s hospital is unknown, as is the reason for its sudden explosion. We are of course aware that there were remembrance events just a short distance away from the hospital and that the ignition occurred shortly before 11 am. It is a line of inquiry we are pursuing," Jackson added. Enquiries led officers to two addresses in Liverpool. The first was Sutcliffe Street in the Kensington area where three men aged 21, 26 and 29 were arrested under the Terrorism Act on Sunday. A further man aged 20 was arrested in the Kensington area under the Terrorism Act on Monday. The Sutcliffe Street address was searched overnight and a second address was searched at Rutland Avenue in Sefton Park. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Meeks said searches were still ongoing at both addresses. "We believe he lived at the Sutcliffe Street address for some time and had recently rented the Rutland Avenue address. Our focus is the Rutland Avenue address where we have continued to recover significant items." This attack comes after MP Sir David Amess was stabbed to death in his constituency surgery on October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/explosion-outside-liverpool-hospital-was-suicide-bomb-attack-police-say/articleshow/87724524.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The owner of the house in which the militants had been hiding, who was injured in the gunfight, succumbed later to his injuries, the police said. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said that according to their sources, and digital evidence, the house owner had " been working as a militant associate". A search for any remaining militants was still on, he said. "#SrinagarEncounterUpdate: 01 unidentified #militant killed. #Operation going on. Further details shall follow," the Kashmir zone police had tweeted. A little later, they had added: "01 more unidentified (militant) killed (Total 2). Operation going on. Further details shall follow (sic)." The police said the encounter between security forces and terrorists in Hyderpora area of Srinagar city began at around 6.15 pm. On Sunday evening, terrorists had injured policeman Gulzar Ahmad when they attacked a police party at Nawa Kadal, in central Srinagar, and then escaped. Intelligence sources say there are two dozen terrorists active in Srinagar city, including a few foreign terrorists. Security officials have been issuing advisories to protected persons asking them to restrict their movements in view of the terrorist threat in various localities, the sources said. Terrorists have been targeting civilians since October this year. A dozen civilians, including several non-Kashmiris and a few non-Muslims, had been killed till last week. The security agencies have so far failed to bust the terrorist sleeper cells, according to intelligence sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/2-unidentified-terrorists-house-owner-killed-on-srinagar-airport-road-police/articleshow/87724573.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ali Zaidi unanimously elected new chief of Shia Waqf Board||LUCKNOW: Ali Zaidi of Lucknow, who was earlier nominated to the UP Shia Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) by the state government, was unanimously elected as the chairperson of the Board on Monday. Out of eight members, six participated in the election. Former chairperson and current member Waseem Rizvi and another member Syed Faizi boycotted the day’s proceedings which were undertaken after getting the green signal from newly appointed principal secretary of the minority welfare, Haj and Waqf department, Himanshu Kumar. The members who participated in the election were former Congress MP from Rampur, Noor Bano, advocates Zaryab Jamal Rizvi of Amroha and Syed Shabahat Husain of Sidharth nagar, cleric Maulana Raza Husain of Lucknow and senior consultant at district women’s hospital, Prayagraj, Dr Noorus Hasan Naqvi. After the announcement of the election result, state minister for minority welfare, Mohsin Raza, termed Zaidi’s win as the victory of BJP and of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Zaidi is the son-in-law of the cousin of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad and is the youngest person in the board. Jawad has been at loggerheads with Rizvi and has been accusing him of indulging in corruption. Jawad also led several protests during Rizvi’s two terms as the Board’s chairperson. Due to his controversial statements against Islam, the Quran, Prophet Mohammad and madrasas, Rizvi had also drawing the ire of other clerics and organisations. “My priority will be to clean the Board of all corruption, as is the CM’s roadmap. Corrupt persons will not be spared. Shia waqf properties encroached by land mafia and waqf mafia will be taken back and the profit from earnings of these land will be honestly utilised,” said Ali Zaidi. “The Waqf Act is very clear but the Board was not being run according to it. People who benefitted from selfish management of the Board will be stopped. Honest people will be given responsibilities,” he added. Meanwhile, in a press statement, Waseem Rizvi termed the election result would lead “to the hold of Taliban over the Board much as it is in Afghanistan”. “Clerics, in collaboration with the minority department, have usurped the Board. The Waqf Act clearly states that the number of nominated members will not be more than elected ones but this was not the case for the chairperson election. Only three out of the eight board members are elected, while the remaining five members are nominated by the government. Syed Faizi will wait for the high court’s decision on our writ petitions on the subject,” Rizvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-ali-zaidi-unanimously-elected-new-chief-of-shia-waqf-board/articleshow/87723916.cms||Pravin Kumar
---||India||Government amends rules to spur extension of ED, CBI chiefs’ tenures||NEW DELHI: Amid protests by opposition to the twin ordinances promulgated on Sunday to provide for extension in tenure of chiefs of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and CBI by a possible 3 years beyond their mandatory two-year term, government has moved swiftly to encode the change in the relevant service rules. The government on Monday amended the Fundamental Rules, 1922 to bring them in sync with amendments to Central Vigilance Commission Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which govern the ED and the CBI respectively. The Acts, amended through ordinance route, had extended the maximum tenure of CBI and ED director to five years. The original Rule 56(d) of FR 1922 pertained to top functionaries like home secretary, defence secretary, foreign secretary, and chiefs of the Intelligence Bureau and Research & Analyses Wing, whose tenures could be extended by the government up to a maximum of two years and beyond as specified. The amended Rule 56(d) mentions the directors of the ED and the CBI along with defence secretary, home secretary, director of Intelligence Bureau and R&AW secretary. Curiously, foreign secretary does not figure in the grouping, leading to speculation whether the omission was deliberate or an oversight. The original Rule 56(d) rule provided for a two-year term for foreign secretary, extendable by another year. The notification of the rule intensified the buzz that the twin ordinances may have been designed to secure further extension of tenure for ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra after his term runs out on Thursday. The amended rules do not change matters for home secretary, defence secretary and the chiefs of the IB and R&AW since the earlier rules also provided for an extension of their service for a period or periods deemed proper by the government, with reasons to be recorded in writing, provided their total term does not exceed two years, which may include a period beyond their superannuation age. In the case of home and defence secretaries, a three-month extension beyond two years is also provided for, though this can be made longer by allowing a relaxation in Rule 56. The latter provision, which is replicated in All India Services (Retirement-cum-Death Benefits) Rules, was used to grant a one-year extension to the present home secretary, DIB and RAW chief after they completed their respective two-year terms. The amendments to DSPE Act and CVC Act, made on Sunday via Ordinance route, provide for a maximum five-year tenure to CBI and Enforcement Directorate chiefs, including a two-year fixed term that may be extended “in public interest” by up to three years, one year at a time. As per the amended Rule 56(d) of FR 1922, the maximum tenure of CBI and ED chiefs shall now be as laid down under the DSPE Act and CVC Act respectively. “The amended tenures for the two posts are now reflected in the Fundamental Rules, leaving no scope for anyone to question the maximum five-year term on the ground that there cannot be continuous extensions in service for a bureaucrat who has superannuated,” said a senior DoPT functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-syncs-service-extension-rules-with-amended-dspe-cvc-act-to-enable-5-year-term-for-cbi/ed-chiefs/articleshow/87724667.cms||Bharti Jain

One should carpool with family members while keeping social distancing norms in mind, and try to cut down the commuting time by requesting the management to allow work from home as much as possible. Cover their nose and mouth completely with a good quality N95 mask. One should ideally step out for a stretch of two-three hours and then take rest indoors before stepping out again. Elderly, young children and those with lung diseases, diabetes, hypertension or cardiac diseases should avoid venturing out at all. Avoid exercising outdoors early in the morning and in the evening. Also, avoid running and marathons during this time. It is better to limit your exercises to minimum.” He advises that large gatherings should also be avoided during this time. “These are dangerous from the COVID-19 and the pollution point of view. Limit your movement to as little as possible,” he shares. Keep windows closed, use air purifiers, avoid outdoor physical activities and stay in touch with your docs, say doctorsDr Vineeta Tandon, Consultant, Internal Medicine, PSRI Hospital, Delhi, says, “Pollution has a huge impact on our health, and it is a misnomer that it impacts only the lungs. Yes, it does impact our lungs but it also has a damaging impact on our eyes, heart, and even skin. Children and the elderly who have compromised immune systems are highly vulnerable. Apart from staying indoors, keep windows closed and use air purifiers at home. Wear an N-95 mask while stepping out as a cloth mask would not help in protecting you from polluted air. Remain hydrated as it improves the blood flow and can improve oxygen levels in the body, while keeping your skin exfoliated. Wear sunglasses while driving a two-wheeler. When you return home, wash your eyes with fresh running water. Those who have respiratory problems should avoid stepping out and should get in touch with their doctors. Those with cardiovascular problems should also monitor their health regularly and watch out for any alarming signs.” ‘Wear goggles; avoid contact lenses and over-the counter eye drops’Experts share how to take care of your eyes during this weather||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/delhis-air-emergency-stay-indoors-take-extra-care-if-youre-in-the-vulnerable-category-caution-doctors/articleshow/87720909.cms||Riya Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai kids go cycling on Children’s Day||Cycling is a great way to stay fit and it’s also being seen as a way to commute, especially amid the pandemic. And this time around, it was a group of children who advocated that as they got onto their bikes on Children’s Day. The youngsters embarked on a special ride in the city and as expected, it was full of fun, laughter and some outdoor adventure, too! ‘Children can help us ride into a more sustainable future’Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh flags off the eventOrganised by the Cycle Chala City Bacha group, the event saw 50 kids gather at 6.30am in Santacruz. The happy, buzzing cyclists took off and rode via S V Road, then headed towards Jalsa and Juhu Beach and rode back. They took a short break at the beach, where they enjoyed fun games. Three other rides took place in South Mumbai, Chembur and Mulund as well. Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh, who organised the ride, says, “We cannot undermine the benefits of cycling; it can impact not just adults’ but also kids’ lives in a positive way. Many teachers report that kids who walk and cycle to school are more alert and ready to learn than those who arrive by car. I feel that it’s the children who are the superheroes who can help us ride into a more sustainable future.” Pedalling towards a memorable dayParents wore their old school uniforms to celebrate with their kidsThe kids had a fun time on wheels. Dr Viswanathan Iyer, brain and spine surgeon, and bicycle councillor (T-Ward), says, “The adults also came by wearing their old school uniforms, as everyone wanted to feel like a child again. I wore my son’s uniform and a few parents did the same. We had a slow cycling competition and everyone rode from Mulund west to east. At the end, we all went to a park and the kids spoke about cycling and its impact on the environment.” Happy participants during the ride at Marine Drive The event at South Mumbai saw a joint participation from A-Ward and C-Ward. Says marine engineer and bicycle councillor (A-Ward), Kayhan Irani, “Our entire stretch was along the sea face. The weather was great and everyone enjoyed refreshments at Nariman Point at the end. We definitely can do with more such rides in Mumbai to inculcate the value of cycling in our kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-go-cycling-on-childrens-day/articleshow/87723310.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||India||Hold emergency meet to tackle air pollution: SC to Centre, NCR states||NEW DELHI : A slight reduction in toxicity of ambient air quality did not deter the Supreme Court on Monday in directing the Centre and three NCR states — UP, Punjab and Haryana — to follow the Delhi government in adopting work from home for their employees to reduce vehicular traffic and called for an emergency meeting of all five governments to devise emergency measures to tackle pollution within 48 hours. Lack of concrete measures by the Centre and states to reduce the severe pollution levels in Delhi and NCR made a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant vent its anguish, saying, “We don't think the executive governments will sit together and take a decision as we had expected on Saturday. It is very unfortunate that we have to set an agenda for them and the areas they have to focus on for taking urgent decisions." “We find that major contributors of air pollution in the National Capital Region are — construction activities, running of nonessential industries, transport and running of coal-fired power plants. We find that some initiatives have been taken by the ‘Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas’ as also by Delhi government in compliance with directions passed by this court. We appreciate the steps taken by them,” it said. “However, after going through the actual exercise undertaken at the ground level, we find that the authorities have not yet indicated the broader steps that they are going to take to control the factors responsible for poor air quality,” the bench said, and directed the Centre to call an emergency meeting on Tuesday with all stakeholders and discuss the areas underlined by the court, and decide what further steps can be taken, along with the implementation mechanism. The SC highlighted that stubble burning was not the major contributor of pollution, even though the Centre said it affected Delhi and NCR air for two months in a year. The bench said, “So far as the air pollution caused by stubble burning is concerned, the affidavits filed in the matter do indicate that the stubble burning is not responsible for causing air pollution to that extent except for the two months of October and November,” it said. At the same time, the CJI-led bench conceded that there has been a spike in stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana. It asked both these states “to persuade the farmers and impress upon them not to set fire to stubble at least for a period of two weeks”. “We direct the Union of India and the NCR states to consider allowing their officers and officials to work from home, as is done by the Delhi government, to minimise vehicular traffic,” the bench said and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday, with a rider that the Centre and concerned states must come out with a concrete action plan. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre has been coordinating with the states and Delhi government, who are not only cooperating but doing their best to tackle the crisis situation. He agreed with the SC, which had said that sources other than stubble burning contribute nearly 70-80% of the pollution in NCR, and said that stubble burning contributed around 4-10% of air pollution. The CJI-led bench said, “Stubble burning is not the major cause of pollution. Dust, industry and vehicles are main contributors. If you take steps relating to these three issues, pollution will come down. Stubble burning we can tackle by taking long term measures.” Justice Chandrachud said, “Stubble burning contributes 4% to the pollution as per your affidavit. So, till now we were targeting a source of pollution which is insignificant.” But petitioner Aditya Dubey's counsel Vikas Singh, Nikhil Jain and Meenesh Dubey protested and said that forthcoming elections in Punjab are forcing the government towards fudging data on stubble burning. “Stubble burning cases in Punjab are not being reported and no action is being taken as the crucial elections are approaching,” Singh argued. The bench said it was not concerned either with elections or politics. “All we want is concrete measures on the ground level to reduce pollution.” SG said the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been enforced since 2017 and has yielded results.

Second dose. Corona vaccine. Anybody left out?” The act may have amused many, but seen in the context of India’s imposing inoculation target and the anxiety of the health establishment over unused vaccines going past their expiry date, there is suspicion this goes beyond comic relief. Most officials TOI spoke to, however, scotched fears of vaccine wastage, or those about to expire being offered as booster shots secretly, or expired doses being dumped. Hospital administrators, particularly those in the private sector, have adopted ingenious methods to clear their vaccine stockpile — including cutting the price of shots, using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to vaccinate people for free, and exchanging doses with other hospitals to use up the idle stock. The Serum Institute of India (SII), makers of Covishield, has been encouraging private hospitals to buy from those having doses in excess, instead of placing a fresh order. “We paid SII and it diverted the money to another hospital that gave us the required cache,” said Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital in Pune. Such measures are seen more in the case of Covishield as its shelf life is just six months, as opposed to Covaxin’s one year. Health experts hope India will soon come up with a policy to vaccinate children below 18 years, which will push up demand and help clear out near-expiry doses. As of November 12, India had vaccinated 36.2 crore people, or 26.2% of its population, with its supply chain reaching places off the map. Private hospitals in Pune district have around 2.5 lakh doses, a large chunk of which will expire either in January or February. "We are struggling to clear 6,000 doses of Covishield for more than two months. We marked down the price of each dose by Rs 100, but there’s not much hope as their use-by date is February 28," said Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Hospital in Pune. Private units charge around Rs 800 for a jab. According to Dr Prince Surana from the Surana Group of Hospitals that has tied up with business houses to inoculate slum-dwellers, hospitals approached him to offload their stock, particularly Covishield. "I was offered a discount of up to 30%," he said. Private players stocked up on Covid vaccines after availability improved in June, anticipating the summer’s high demand to stay. The peak of the pandemic's second wave had coincided with a reported shortage of vaccines. "They (private hospitals) failed to factor in the public sector that picked up at least three times more doses than private units and gave shots without charge," a hospital administrator in Mumbai said, explaining the correlation between falling demand in private hospitals and about-to-expire vials remaining on the shelf. The concern over "dead stock" has been more acute in big urban centres. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said: "The bigger issue is wastage as we lose about 5-6% of our stock to unused vaccines." Most states, however, have reported little wastage in the public sector. Some like Maharashtra are unaware of the volume due for expiry in the private sector that held more than 45 lakh doses till a week ago. Hospitals have been limiting procurement to small batches, and vials nearing the expiration date were used first. In Tamil Nadu, camps for free shots with CSR funds covering the expenses helped several private hospitals exhaust their stock, said health minister Ma Subramanian. UP has restricted the private sector’s role to prevent wastage. In Madhya Pradesh, immunisation in-charge Dr Santosh Shukla said the state’s current stock of over one crore doses is within its targeted requirement. "As for waste, MP’s consumption is +3% (extracting the 11th dose from a vial of 10)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-improvise-as-unused-covid-vaccine-doses-near-expiry/articleshow/87725570.cms||---

Special prosecution officer S P Yadav said since the probe report has mentioned Ashish as the prime accused and an SIT had gathered sufficient evidence against him, bail was denied to him and two of his aides, Luv Kush Rana & Ashish Pandey. ‘Over 60 farmers said Ashish was present at Kheri mowing spot’District governmen counsel (DGC) Arvind Tripathi told TOI, “The defence hid Ashis’s criminal history. Also, an SDM and a circle officer recorded statements saying Ashish was seen running away from the spot after the farmers were mowed down.” He said this was corroborated by over 60 farmers who had given statements that suggested Ashish’s presence at the incident spot. “The statements also said that he was sitting inside the Thar jeep in the co-driver seat. His presence was further confirmed by the SIT investigation, which said the mobile location of Ashish showed that he was there during the violence. The investigation also showed that he ran towards a cane field firing towards the farmers. The ballistic report of his rifle was also found positive in the forensic test. Since allegations against Ashish are grave and the investigation is still pending, the judge rejected the bail plea,” Tripathi explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kheri-case-bail-denied-to-ministers-son-and-2-aides/articleshow/87725669.cms||---

Around two dozen men, who onlookers said belonged to right-wing outfit Bajrang Dal, staged a demonstration in front of the house, where they burnt an effigy of the Congress leader, vandalised his house, and set fire to a portion of the residence. An FIR has been registered against around 20 people, police said. Only one of the accused has been identified by the caretaker, who said one of the agitators pointed a pistol at his daughter-in-law. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book, ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other portions of his vandalised house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?” He further said, “So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Calling the attack “disgraceful”, fellow Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted: “The mounting levels of intolerance in our politics should be denounced by those in power.” At the time of the incident, the caretaker of the house, Sundar Ram, and his family were present. Ram said that around 1pm, a mob of around 20 people gathered in front of the house. “We tried to reason with them but they started pouring diesel on the front door and set it on fire. One of them whipped out a pistol and pointed it at my daughter-in-law. They then opened fire at the window and broke the window panes. They must have fired around six to seven rounds,” Ram said. The caretaker added that he recognised two people in the mob, one of whom has been named in the FIR. Police reached the spot after Ram informed them. DIG Kumaon Nilesh Bharane told TOI, “Apart from one accused, identified as Rakesh Kapil, a resident of Mouna village, 20 others, yet to be identified, have been booked. For now, police cover has been provided at the house.” The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (punishment for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night), 552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/book-protesters-vandalise-salman-khurshids-nainital-home/articleshow/87725731.cms||---

Also, the total percentage of international students in US campuses dropped below 5% for the first time since 2015-16 and total international students in the country is now at a seven-year low. For India with 1.68 lakh students, though US institutions continue to be the top choice and represent the second-largest (18.33%) cohort among international students as per the 2021 Open Doors Report released on Monday, the Covid-19 period witnessed a decline in the numbers. As per the latest report, total international scholars in US campuses is now at 9.14 lakh, of which 2.04 lakh are in the ‘optional practical training’ period. Undergraduate and graduate students with F-1 status, who have completed or have been pursuing their degrees for one academic year, are permitted to work for one year on student visa to obtain practical training to complement their education. Data on year-on-year international students enroled revealed that the numbers peaked in 2016-17 when it breached the nine-lakh mark at 9.03 lakh. Since then it has been a gradual decline though the percentage of international students has been maintained at 5.5%. In 2020-21, the numbers came down to 7.10 lakh, which is lower than 2012-13 numbers of 7.25 lakh. The percentage of international students too came down to 4.6%, which again is a seven-year low. The India story follows a declining trend during the Covid-19 period since breaching the two-lakh mark in 2018-19. From 2.02 lakh in 2018-19 it dropped to 1.68 lakh in 2020-21. The three top countries which account for the largest number of international students in the US are China (35%, down 14.8 percentage points), followed by India (18%, down 13.2 percentage points) and South Korea (4%, down 20.7 percentage points). However, given the pandemic situation, the US authorities are happy with the numbers stating that over 62,000 visas were issued to Indian students this summer alone, more than in any previous year. Highlighting that US states remained open and welcoming to international students throughout the global Covid-19 pandemic, minister counsellor for consular affairs Don Heflin, at the launch of the report said, “Despite the global pandemic, Indian students were able to apply for visas and travel to the United States. We issued over 62,000 student visas this summer alone, more than in any previous year. This goes to show that the United States remains the destination of choice for Indian students looking to study abroad. We look forward to issuing many more visas in the year to come, to help Indian students achieve their dreams of US study.” Counselor for cultural and educational affairs, Anthony Miranda said, “International student mobility is central to US diplomacy, innovation, economic prosperity, and national security. The United States is the gold standard for higher education, providing world-class practical application and experience that gives our graduates an advantage in the global economy,” adding, “we value Indian students, as they build life-long connections with American peers to maintain and grow international partnerships, and to collectively address current and future global challenges.” The officials added that the 2021 Fall Snapshot?of the Open Doors report, which looks forward to the 2021-22 academic year, shows a substantial increase in student numbers this year,?further affirming that international students value a US education and remain committed to pursuing higher education in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-effect-indians-in-us-varsities-fell-by-13-in-2020/articleshow/87725957.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||India||Swede kindness takes over after midair stroke||MUMBAI: Last week when a Rajkot couple boarded an Air India flight to Chicago, they were just headed to attend their son’s wedding, but a midair medical emergency—the wife suffered a brain stroke—landed them in Stockholm, a city they had never heard of. However, right from the moment the flight was on ground, the hapless couple found helping hand everywhere, thanks to Sweden’s socialism and Indian diaspora’s resourcefulness, reports Manju V. The hospital didn’t ask whether his wife was eligible to be treated there, whether he had the money, said Dr Jaysukh Makwana (60), a dentist. The Indian embassy contacted Indranil Sinha, a researcher who worked nearby, who took the Gujarati and Hindi-speaking Makwana to places where he could find agreeable vegetarian, meals, helped him withdraw money and did a myriad other jobs to assist them. The Gujaratis then took over. Makwana said they were midair when his wife Usha (63) suddenly found herself immobile, her speech slurred. Luckily, a neurologist was on board the flight. “At one glance, he said, brain stroke,” recalled Makwana. The AI flight 127 was approaching the Norwegian sea then. The pilot, Capt N S Billimoria, had the Boeing 777 turn for a medical emergency, landing in Stockholm. “Had she suffered the stroke later, over the Atlantic, help would have been 5-6 hours away, too late,” said Makwana. In 45 minutes, the flight was on ground, the patient put into a waiting ambulance, while the local police escorted the husband for an emergency visa to the Stockholm Arlanda airport terminal. “I heard them say ‘Orlando’ terminal and was relieved we had landed in the US as my son is here,” he said. But they were in Stockholm. “I didn’t know where this place was. The only country we had travelled to was the US where our son works,” said Makwana. Air India had their bags delivered in no time. “The police was immensely helpful with the visas and dropped me to a hotel,” said Makwana. By the time he reached the hospital, Suresh Kumar from the Indian embassy had contacted Indranil Sinha, who worked in an institute located near the hospital. “I went to see him. I knew merely seeing an Indian in a foreign country would bring him some comfort,” said Sinha. In the following days, Sinha did myriad jobs to assist them. “I contacted my Gujarati friends and the word spread among their community,” said Sinha. On November 13, Makwana’s wife was moved from ICU to the general ward, while Kaushik Patel, a Gujarati Stockholmer moved him from the hotel to his home. “They drop me to the hospital in the morning, pick me up in the evening, daily. Another family brings me Gujarati lunch daily. Someone gave me a SIM card, another Indian bought me sweaters, the temperature is 3 degree Celsius. Someone else got me a mobile charger,” he said. “It’s the benevolence of the hospital staff, police, embassy officials and the local Indians. I have never experienced anything like this,” said the dentist. His son, living in Florida, US, will get married on November 20. It’s not known yet whether the Makwanas will be able to make it for the ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/swede-kindness-takes-over-after-midair-stroke/articleshow/87726007.cms||Manju V

Four more batches will land in Antarctica by mid-January 2022. Four batches will reach Antarctica by air using DROMLAN facility (a coordinated project between 11 countries for logistics service) and onboard chartered ice-class vessel MV VasiliyGolovnin. Once the entire contingent reaches the icy continent, it will launch two major programmes. The first project will encompass geological exploration of the Amery ice shelf at Indian Bharati station. This will help explore the link between India and Antarctica in the past. The second one will involve reconnaissance and preparatory work for drilling of 500m of ice core near Maitri that will help in improving the understanding of the Antarctic climate, westerly winds, sea-ice and greenhouse gases, a release from the ministry of earth sciences said. The ice core drilling near Maitri will be done in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey and the Norwegian Polar Institute. In addition to these programmes, the team will replenish annual supplies of food, fuel, provisions and spares for operations and maintenance of life support systems at Indian stations. The Indian Antarctic programme, which began in 1981, has completed 40 scientific expeditions till now and built three permanent research base stations, Dakshin Gangotri (1983), Maitri (1988) and Bharati (2012). As of today, Maitri and Bharati are currently fully operational. The Goa-based National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research, under the ministry of earth sciences, manages the entire programme. As India is committed to maintaining the icy continent free of Covid-19, the contingent has reached Antarctica following a strict medical exam at AIIMS-Delhi; training for snow-ice acclimatisation and survival at the mountaineering and skiing Institute of ITBP in Auli; and a stringent sanitary protocol, including a 14-day quarantine at Cape Town, South Africa. The crew is expected to return to Cape Town in late March/early April of 2022, leaving a team of 48 members for winter. It will also bring back the winter team of the preceding 40th expedition. The 41st expedition is being led by Dr Shailendra Saini, Scientist of National Centre for Polar & Ocean Research (voyage leader), Huidrom ageshwar Singh, metrologist, IMD (leader, Maitri station) and Anoop Kalayil Soman, scientist from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (leader, Bharati Station).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-sends-fresh-batch-to-antarctica-for-studying-climate-greenhouse-gases/articleshow/87726282.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||PM woos tribals, says earlier govts ignored their welfare||NEW DELHI : In a major tribal outreach to mark the first “Janjatiya Gaurav Divas”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bhopal attacked Congress -- without naming the party -- saying tribal welfare had been ignored and the role of tribal communities in the freedom struggle was denied the importance they deserved by previous governments in office. Stating that the government made tribal welfare a priority, the Prime Minister said, "the contribution of tribal society was either not told to the country, and even if told, very limited information was given" by those in power previously. This was because “those who ran the government in the country for decades after independence, gave priority to their selfish politics”. On Monday, Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is in power and which also has the largest tribal population in the country, became the platform for the Centre's political outreach. Last week at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Modi, the central government decided to observe tribal icon and anti-colonial warrior Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as “Janjatiya Gaurav Divas” annually to celebrate tribal history and culture. Addressing the large gathering in Bhopal, the PM said, “For the first time in the country after independence, on such a large scale, the art-culture of the entire country's tribal society, their contribution to the freedom movement and nation building is being remembered and honored with pride.” Earlier in the day, the PM inaugurated the Bhagwan Birsa Munda Freedom Fighter Museum in Ranchi. Addressing the audience virtually, PM also remembered former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee highlighting the latter’s role in the formation of the state of Jharkhand in 1999 and during whose tenure the tribal affairs ministry was carved out. The PM added that as part of the celebrations to mark 75 years of Independence an attempt is being made to revive the stories and history of tribal icons who were denied the recognition that they deserved in the decades gone by. During his address in Bhopal, the PM asserted that by not giving the tribal society the due importance, "the previous governments have committed a crime" and "this issue should be raised again and again". "A discussion on this should happen at every platform," Modi said. He remarked that the tribal region of the country has always been rich in terms of wealth and resources. But “those who were in the government earlier, followed the policy of exploiting these areas. We are following the policy of utilising the potential of these areas properly,” he said. Giving examples of how tribals were being mainstreamed through welfare schemes, the PM spoke about work being done in aspirational districts which include tribal areas. “Today, products by the artisans of the tribal section are being promoted nationally and globally. More than 90 forest produces are being given Minimum Support Price compared to 8-10 crops earlier. More than 150 medical colleges have been approved for such districts. More than 2,500 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras have been connected with more than 37 thousand self help groups leading to 7 lakh jobs,” the PM shared. He further shared that 20 lakh land ‘Pattas’ (rights) have been given to forest dwellers. “Emphasis on mother tongue in the New Education Policy will help the tribal people,” the PM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-woos-tribals-says-earlier-govts-ignored-their-welfare/articleshow/87726277.cms||---

He was arrested on November 2. After the defence moved a plea seeking home food for Deshmukh, the court said the jail had rules and told him to eat the jail food for now. “If there is any complaint, then I will consider,” the court said. “So far as the prayer of home food is concerned, let the accused be admitted to jail. The appropriate order will be passed later on dependent upon the complaints in the light of health issues of the accused,” the court added. The court remarked that home food could have also caused Deshmukh’s acidity after his lawyer listed his ailments. Urging the court to send Deshmukh to judicial custody and not release him during the pendency of the investigations, the ED in its plea submitted through special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar said he is an influential person, having served as state home minister, and if his judicial custody is not granted, he may tamper with evidence. “During the interrogation of Deshmukh, many crucial facts have been revealed, which are in his exclusive domain, as he (sic) being the key personnel, deeply and directly involved and having in possession of proceeds of crime,” the ED said. The ED alleged that Deshmukh had not provided the required information regarding the laundering of proceeds of crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-jail-food-for-now-court-tells-maharashtra-ex-home-minister/articleshow/87726323.cms||Rebecca Samervel

October also saw the emergence of five new unicorns – CoinSwitchKuber, Acko General Insurance (both fintech), Faasos, Licious (both food tech), and Vedantu (edtech).Domestic consolidation continued to dominate the M&A segment, with 79% of M&A deal volumes. This included a marquee deal – Tata’s acquisition of Air India. Compared with September, although the volumes almost doubled, it fell 48% by value. “October has been encouraging, both in terms of deal volume and deal value, indicating the continuum in deal activities. While volumes recorded a 2x increase over October 2020, deal values saw a strong 24% increase. The economy is being bolstered by the rapid improvement in high-frequency indicators such as the e-way bills, GST collection, power demand, rail freight and exports growth. The current pace is likely to re-establish economic growth momentum,” said Shanthi Vijetha, partner, Grant Thornton Bharat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/deal-volumes-double-value-rises-24-to-9-2bn-in-oct/articleshow/87726365.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Offer technical edu in mother tongue: VP||Bengaluru: Emphasising the need for education in the local language, Vice-President of India M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said technical and medical education should be offered in the mother tongue. “The President of India, Vice-President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice have all studied in their mother tongue as a medium of instruction. What more proof do you want?” he said while speaking at PES University convocation here.“I find that many technical books used by engineering students in India are published by foreign authors. It would be good if our learned academicians could promote knowledge economy by authoring books... I say so because Indian authors can better contextualise engineering course content with regard to Indian socio-economic conditions,” he added. Asking educational institutions to take the new National Education Policy seriously, Naidu said there is an urgent need to align university classrooms with emerging global trends such as 5G-based technologies, which find application in a wide range of areas, including agriculture, medical, administrative, commerce and industrial management. “I urge institutions to focus on agriculture and make it viable so that people continue in this profession. Universities must come out with new ideas to make agriculture more viable and profitable,” he added. Naidu also called for increased participation of private universities in space activities as the government has been boosting the role of private players in this sector. Karnataka governor Thawar Chand Gehlot congratulated the government for implementing NEP. “Impressive use of digital learning tools has increased classroom participation and has helped teachers manage lessons better. High- standard technical education is going to play an important role in any country’s success,” he added. ‘Be job creators’MR Doreswamy, chancellor of PES University, asked graduates to be not just job seekers, but also job creators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/offer-technical-edu-in-mother-tongue-vp/articleshow/87726367.cms||---

The federations are also running an online petition with over 1,000 signatories.The demands raised include making BTM Layout-KR Puram Metro line a multi-tier one running through Iblur; reviving Iblur-Carmelaram line and extending it to Sarjapur, upgrading Carmelaram station into a major interchange, putting in place a holistic mobility plan with “pedestrian-first” designs, and providing last-mile connectivity for Iblur-KR Puram and Iblur-Carmelaram corridors.“All this is part of the masterplan. We are giving the plan a relook and seeing how we can connect to Carmelaram,” said a BMRCL source.Sudarshan Shastry, secretary of Kasavanahalli Development Forum, alleged that civic agencies were chalking out development plans without proper planning. “Public consultation has never been a streamlined process,” he said.“Iblur is a major junction. Civic agencies are planning to create Metro, bus stations and other things, yet they fail to look at last-mile connectivity,” an Iblur resident said.Vishnu Prasad, a member of Bellandur Development Forum and one of the signatories to the online petition, said, “Bellandur houses eight SEZs, lakhs of IT employees and accounts for $30 billion exports, all in a 5km radius. It has the highest BBMP tax contribution and yet has three of the city’s 10 congested zones.”“All we are asking for is to make Carmelaram station an interchange and provide a holistic multi-tier Metro solution for Sarjapur Road and ORR,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rwas-seek-revival-of-carmelaram-metro-line/articleshow/87726369.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Water entered five houses in Kaval Byrasandra, three in Kammanahalli and one in a low-lying area behind Banaswadi railway station. The evening rain reduced traffic movement to a crawl and lowered visibility on flyovers, prompting motorists to move with their parking lights on. According to the weatherman, the sky will remain cloudy over the next two days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/evening-rain-floods-roads-houses-in-city/articleshow/87726370.cms||---

Considering this, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi disposed of the petition, filed by Bengaluru resident S Gowrishankar.The bench said in case of any specific violation of the rules, a complaint could be filed with the higher authorities. The petitioner claimed during driving tests, Rule 15 was being ignored as most tests were conducted on RTO premises. He claimed if Rule 15, with so many stipulations, is strictly adhered to, it will not be possible for RTOs to conduct 50 to 100 tests a day, as they are claiming now. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-hc-dl-testing-norms-are-stringent/articleshow/87726372.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Road accidents fell for 5th straight year in 2020||BENGALURU: As many as 7,523 people have been killed and 33,864 injured in 28,036 road accidents reported in Karnataka till October 21 this year, shows data with state police. The statistics are in sync with the trend of previous five years, when road accidents and injuries due to them declined. The year 2020, when Covid-19 struck, forcing the government to enforce lockdowns and restrict people from moving around, saw the lowest number of road accidents and related deaths during 2016-20. For the first time in this time period, the number of road accidents (34,718) and deaths (9,760) due to them dipped below 40,000 and 10,000, respectively, in 2020. The number of persons injured in road accidents too has come down over the last five years. While 54,556 persons were injured in road accidents in 2016, the number stood at 39,492 in 2020. Senior IPS officer and commissioner for traffic and road safety, Pratap Reddy, said strict enforcement of road laws and quick action by Emergency Response Service Support (ERSS) vehicles, which are extensively deployed along state and national highways, have resulted in fewer accidents and deaths. “Interceptors are deployed at various places to trace and fine over-speeding vehicles. Also, other routine measures such as drunk-driving checks have helped in bringing down accidents. Further, quick response by ERSS staff, who reach the accident spot in the fastest possible time, saved lives of many injured people. In urban areas, ERSS vehicles reach the accident spot within 20 minutes of getting an alert, while they take around 30-40 minutes in rural areas. Currently, we have around 700 ERSS vehicles patrolling different highways of the state,” said Reddy. Another senior IPS officer said good roads and widened lanes too have contributed to the dip in accident count. “Many national and state highways have been broadened into four or six lanes with grade separators and medians. Also, road engineering is getting better,” he said. “However, better roads and wide lanes are also leading to high-impact accidents. Vehicles moving at a high speed collide with one another, often killing more than two persons on the spot. If the same accidents were to occur on normal roads, fatalities would be less. Increasing highway patrolling is the best way to tackle such accidents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/road-accidents-fell-for-5th-straight-yr-in-2020/articleshow/87726375.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt owes Rs 20,000 crore to five Escoms||BENGALURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said a panel headed by former IAS officer K Jairaj will be set up to revitalise Escoms (electricity supply companies) of the state, but with dues of Rs 20,000 crore, the government is the biggest defaulter. While various departments and local bodies have to pay about Rs 5,975 crore cumulatively to five Escoms — Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Company (Cescom), Mysuru, Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (Gescom), Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (Mescom), and Hubli Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) — the finance department owes Rs 12,912 crore towards subsidy for 30.6 lakh irrigation pumpsets. Energy department officials said unless the government settles pending dues, Escoms cannot be revived. But the government is facing acute fund shortage and finance officials said they have informed the chief minister the dues are so huge that it will take a long time to settle them in phases. “Jairaj will have a daunting task on hand to revamp Escoms, given the huge amount of pending bills from the government itself. A cosmetic makeover will not help unless his panel recovers the outstanding dues. It is to be seen how he achieves this when the government is complaining of empty coffers,” said MG Prabhakar, energy expert and former advisory council member, Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission. The government order constituting the Jairaj committee is expected shortly. Bommai selected the former bureaucrat considering his vast domain experience as energy secretary for about 10 years. “I am waiting for the government order. The main issue is the financial crisis Escoms are facing. I am confident we can revive the companies with the CM’s guidance,” Jairaj said. Energy minister V Sunil Kumar said the outstanding dues are highest for Bescom. The company, which supplies power to eight districts (Bengaluru Urban, Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Ramanagaram, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, and Davangere) has to recover Rs 3,750 crore. Of that, BBMP and BWSSB owe Rs 3,310 crore. Gram panchayats cumulatively owe Rs 2,444 crore to all five Escoms. “The indifference of BBMP and BWSSB and lethargy of Bescom officials to ensure timely bill collection are the reasons for pending dues. It is important to recover them, else Escoms cannot settle what they owe to the power-generating companies, which is about Rs 2,500 crore,” said Sunil Kumar. He said as a strict measure, the energy department plans to fix prepaid metres at government departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-owes-20000cr-to-five-escoms/articleshow/87726377.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Police identified the deceased as Bhupat Singh from Madhya Pradesh. He was working with a construction firm as a drilling machine operator and stayed in a temporary shed at the site. Singh and his friend had finished dinner and stepped out to have cold drinks. They were walking towards a shop around 9.30pm when the gang of five miscreants asked them to stop. The miscreants asked Singh and his friend not to use the road where they were drinking and partying. But Singh and his friend did not listen and went towards a shop to buy cold drinks. As the shop was closed, they walked back on the same road when the miscreants intercepted them. A gang member took out a knife and stabbed Singh multiple times before fleeing. Singh rushed to a nearby hospital with the help of his friend, but succumbed to injuries by 11pm. Byappanahalli police detained a few suspects for the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-of-5-drinking-on-road-stabs-youth-to-death/articleshow/87726378.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru man cleaning bike with engine on loses finger||BENGALURU: It is common for bikers to clean their vehicle in the morning while the engine warms up. Riders often think that revving the engine will result in better on-road acceleration. However, a Bengaluru professional who was doing the same, lost a finger after it got stuck in the bike’s chain. On the morning of September 28, Rahul (name changed), who works with a logistics firm, was prepping his new motorcycle to head to work. He had the engine running and kept it on first gear, so that the tyre could spin and he could clean it faster. But to his bad luck, the cloth touched the chain of the vehicle, got dragged into it, severing two of his right-hand fingers. However, thanks to timely action, one finger could be saved after an eight-hour surgery by a team of doctors at Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road. Rahul, 35, who lives in Varthur, told TOI his family quickly covered the fully severed finger in a clean cloth, stored it in an ice pack and rushed him to hospital. He said the high RPM (revolution/rotations per minute) of his new bike’s engine and a lack of casing around the chain caused the accident. “I’d clean my old bike too the same way, which, however, had a casing around the chain. After I bought the new bike, during the first servicing, I was told the chain must be cleaned. On that particular day, I saw the chain spinning faster and was looking to clean it with a toothbrush. But as I was getting late, I decided to clean it with a cloth wrapped around my finger,” said Rahul. Rahul said the pain was so unbearable that he couldn’t even think of surgery at that time. “I wanted them to cut off even my index finger, which was partially severed, and let it heal,” he said, adding that his family members and doctors convinced him to undergo the reattachment surgery. Rahul underwent a plastic and microvascular surgery – from 12.30pm to 9pm — in which arteries, veins and nerves are joined using sutures thinner than human hair under microscope magnification along with fixation of bone, tendons, soft tissue and skin. However, after two days, his middle finger, which was reattached, began turning black due to blockage of blood supply and had to be eventually removed. Dr Kartik Shrinivas Tallam, consultant — department of plastic surgery, Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road said Rahul was discharged with a plaster and followed up for weekly dressing. After physiotherapy, he has even started writing now, the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-cleaning-bike-with-engine-on-loses-finger/articleshow/87726380.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Hit by insider jobs and leaks, BJP is in bitcoin fix||BENGALURU: That all is not well in the ruling BJP is best demonstrated in the ongoing political crisis emerging out of the bitcoin issue. The developments arising out of discord among some senior ministers and half-a-dozen chief ministerial aspirants are a testament to the inner conflict within the ruling party. “We are not sure whether there is a scam or not. Only an investigation will reveal that. But undoubtedly a lot of vital information is being leaked to opposition parties and media by our own party men,’’ said a senior minister. In a scathing attack on Bommai post the recent Hangal bypoll defeat, a senior minister was heard saying: “There is no collective leadership in the party. Only two people take decisions and others implement them...Let them give us the mantle. We will ensure 135 seats.” There is also talk within the BJP that two ministers, who are reportedly not on the most cordial terms with the chief minister, could be next in the line of fire with some sort of ignominy. They had expressed their desire to be chief minister of the state before Bommai was selected. Despite a volley of personal tirades against Bommai by the Congress on the bitcoin issue, some senior ministers, who were very vocal in defending his predecessor BS Yediyurappa, have maintained a studied silence suggesting that the cabinet is not in sync. According to some Bommai loyalists, Union home minister Amit Shah has reportedly directed party president JP Nadda to rein in disgruntled BJP functionaries in Karnataka who are indulging in spreading rumours to create confusion in the political scenario. Bommai had reportedly complained to Shah about two ministers who were allegedly leaking information to Congress leaders on the bitcoin case. Nadda has sought a report from the state unit to initiate action, sources said. Senior minister CN Ashwath Narayan said he is not aware of any such meeting between Bommai and Shah and also the direction given to Nadda. Several anonymous letters, including one by an ABVP leader, were also reportedly shot off to the party brass and the PMO about the issue. It was shared with media indicating the involvement of some party functionaries. The opposition, which had no documents to substantiate their allegations on the issue, picked up the content from these letters to slam the ruling party, thus embarrassing them. While the BJP is in damage-control mode, opposition leaders are upbeat that they’re able to put the saffron party in the state and the Centre in a spot. However, the whole scenario has exposed infighting in the opposition camp as well. There is apparently a feeling among a section that Siddaramaiah and DK Shiva Kumar are soft-pedalling the issue by making bland statements. This has prompted MLAs led by Priyank Kharge to pursue Congress general secretary in-charge of Karnataka and party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala to take up the issue at the national level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hit-by-insider-jobs-and-leaks-bjp-is-in-bitcoin-fix/articleshow/87726382.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||Ooty planter’s ‘daughter’ dupes two Bengaluru businessmen of Rs 19 lakh||BENGALURU: Two businessmen from the city have approached Sampigehalli police after a woman, posing as the daughter of a planter in Ooty, duped them of money. While the 28-year-old realtor lost Rs 6 lakh to Kamala of MCECHS Layout, Sampigehalli, the 34-year-old businessman hailing from Kanakapura claimed she took Rs 13 lakh from him. Police said the businessmen knew each other formally as they were common friends of the suspect.  Police have no other details of Kamala who befriended the men saying her father owns a tea estate in Ooty. Saying her black money got stuck in Kerala and she needed some cash to get it, Kamala borrowed money from them. Cops have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Kamala under IPC 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). “Our probe is in the initial stage now and the accused’s mobile phones are switched off,” a police official said. The businessman stated in his complaint that he met the woman earlier this year through a matrimonial website. “We became friends and one day, she took me to her house. Later, she took me to an under-construction building in Dollars Colony and said it was her house. That day, she requested me for Rs 3 lakh, saying she needs to pay towards interior decoration. I gave her the amount. One day, she displayed a video showing currency bundles and claimed her black money was stuck in Kerala. She took Rs 7 lakh from me to get it back. Some days later, she took Rs 3 lakh more, saying she will be shifting to a rented accommodation. Also, she has purchased a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) after raising a vehicle loan from a bank in my name. After that she remained incommunicado,” he said. The realtor’s complaint too ran on similar lines. “We became friends in January 2020 when she approached me seeking a house on rent. Later, she told me she owns many properties in the city and I should look after them as a manager. However, I refused. One day, she displayed a video of a currency bundle and stated that it was her black money. A few months back, she took Rs 6.5 lakh from me saying she needs it to bring back the black money,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ooty-planters-daughter-dupes-two-bluru-businessmen-of-19l/articleshow/87726383.cms||---

Apparently, Bangalore University’s physical education department had prepared the cheques but could not give them away owing to the university norm that financial transactions must be done online. The list of awardees with their bank account details are yet to reach the University finance department for transferring the amount and that has led to the delay, it is learnt.Speaking to TOI, university physical education director Dr T Lingaraju said that the list would be sent to the finance department by Tuesday and the amount would be credited to the students’ accounts in a day’s time. As one of the awardees pointed out, the money is crucial as it would help them in their education or pursuing sports, now that training camps and tournaments have resumed.While the Bangalore University awardees have to wait longer for their cash prizes owing to administrative delay, it is worth noting that Bangalore Central University (BCU) athletes received the amount in January itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/athletes-still-waiting-for-cash-awards/articleshow/87726388.cms||---

On their home ground, the Veda Krishnamurthy-led team will go into the contest as favourites having put up a commendable show in the league phase with both bat and ball.The Karnataka middle order has been hardly tested as the top order has been on a roll. D Vrinda was the top-scorer for the state with 340 runs from four league matches including two centuries and an equal number of half-centuries. G Divya has accumulated 306 runs from five matches (one 100, two 50s) while S Shubha has contributed 214 runs (three 50s). On the bowling front, off-spinner Chandu V has led from the front claiming 12 wickets in four matches with an economy rate of 3.34. She has been well-supported by Monica Patel and C Prathyusha.MP’s batting will be led by international Pooja Vastrakar and Neha Badwaik, who has been effective with her leg spin. Off-spinner Priti Yadav is their other prime wicket-taker.A major cause for concern is the weather. Though the Chinnaswamy stadium is equipped with one of the best drainage facilities, rain could play spoilsport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-face-mp-in-last-8/articleshow/87726390.cms||---
---||India||Government to move SC against Kerala HC relief for Swapna in gold case||NEW DELHI: In a politically-sensitive case involving the Left Front government in Kerala, the Centre has decided to move the Supreme Court against an order of the Kerala High Court quashing the detention of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case, under the stringent Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act). Suresh was recently released on bail after 15 months in jail by the Kerala HC under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) imposed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The gold smuggling racket was busted in July 2020, leading to seizure of 30 kg gold worth Rs 15 crore from an official consignment of the UAE consulate at Trivandrum International Airport. Later, Suresh and seven other accused were arrested and a probe by the Enforcement Directorate and the customs department revealed involvement of IAS officer M Sivasankar, then principal secretary of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The customs department has in its recent chargesheet in the case named Sivasankar as an accused who, it claimed, knew about the gold smuggling racket and was involved with Swapna Suresh. The government has taken an opinion from the law ministry to challenge the Kerala HC order quashing Cofeposa against Suresh. The quashing of the Cofeposa detention order came on October 8, two days short of Suresh completing an year in detention under the stringent act. Completing one-year detention under Cofeposa allows agencies to confiscate assets of all the accused, their relatives and associates and the burden of proof lies on the accused (that the properties are not illegally acquired from the ‘proceeds of crime’). In the same case, sources said, the Cofeposa imposed on six others have been retained, raising eyebrows in the government about the dual approach adopted in dealing with the particular case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-to-move-sc-against-kerala-hc-relief-for-swapna-in-gold-case/articleshow/87726396.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||India||Post-sunset autopsy allowed to boost organ donation||NEW DELHI: The government has made changes in post-mortem protocols to allow conducting post-mortem after sunset in hospitals with proper infrastructure, except for cases of homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies and suspected foul. The new protocol will come into effect from Monday. While the move is expected to bring some relief to mourning relatives and friends of deceased, it is also aimed at promoting organ donation and transplant as organs can be harvested in the stipulated time window after the procedure, the health ministry said. The ministry had received several representations on the matter, which were examined by a technical committee in the Directorate General of Health Services. It was ascertained that some institutes are already performing night-time post-mortem. In view of the rapid advancement and improvement in technology, especially availability of required lighting and infrastructure required for post-mortem, performing night time post-mortem in hospitals is now feasible, the ministry said. The protocol stipulates that post-mortem for organ donation be taken up on priority and be conducted even after sunset at the hospitals which have the infrastructure for conducting such post-mortem on a regular basis. The government further said that fitness and adequacy of infrastructure etc., shall be assessed by the hospital-in-charge to ensure that there is no dilution of evidentiary value. Also, video recording of post-mortem will be done for all post-mortem conducted in the night to rule out any suspicion, and preserved for future reference for legal purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-sunset-autopsy-allowed-to-boost-organ-donation/articleshow/87726481.cms||---

The development come amid indications that the party candidate list will pack surprises. This will be the first elections the party will face after it introduced its one-person-one-post formula. Several KMC councillors and MMiCs are also MLAs. Over the past few days, the party leadership, including Subrata Bakshi, Firhad Hakim and Atin Ghosh, cautioned workers from indulging in anti-party statements. “We shall bring out a list which will reflect our idea of combining youth power with experience,” said a senior leader. Like its assembly election candidates list, octogenarian ward councillors will make way for younger candidates. According to senior leaders, another aspect the party is weighing on is whether sitting MLAs will contest the KMC polls. Led by Hakim, the state transport minister and chairperson of KMC’s Board of Administrators, this list includes BoA members Ghosh, Debasish Kumar and Debabrata Majumdar. While juggling heavyweight candidates, Trinamool is also unlikely to give multiple tickets to candidates from the same family. But what is more important is to bring in the north-south balance in the KMC office-bearers, said senior leaders. “South Kolkata and the added areas have a numerical superiority in the number of wards in the 144-ward KMC. While north and central have 50 wards, south and added areas have 84. Hence there is disproportionate representation in the MMiC demographically,” a leader said. However, one thing is clear — the Trinamool list is likely to see a lot of women and youths as candidates. “Even while renominating candidates, performance will be a key factor,” a leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zero-tolerance-of-indiscipline-over-kmc-ward-nominations-tmc-to-party-workers/articleshow/87724216.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 21 teams to nab motorists flouting pollution rules||KOLKATA: In the last four months, Kolkata Traffic Police has prosecuted 5,918 motorists for failing to comply with the vehicular emission norms — an average of 43 prosecutions per day. Now, as Delhi stares at a pollution-related lockdown, Lalbazar has deployed 21 teams to prosecute motorists who refuse to abide by pollution rules. The decision is a direct fallout of the rising number of pollution cases in the city, clearly noticeable ever since Lalbazar asked traffic guards to begin checking pollution levels in vehicles from July 1. Till then, only the anti-pollution cell was carrying out these checks. “We have asked everyone to pitch in. We want to play our part in keeping the city clean,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. Cops prosecuted 973 people for failing to display a pollution certificate (369) or not having one at all (603). By September, this number went up to 1,501 — 734 people in September could not produce their PUCs while 763 did not have one. In the past four months, 3,328 vehicles were asked to get fresh PUC done within seven days. Of these, 2,746 never bothered to get back to the department for a recheck within the stipulated time, inviting a Rs 1,000 fine under section 116 (6) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. Those without PUC were prosecuted under section 115 (7) of the CMVR. A few prosecutions also took place under section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act — not controlling air and noise pollution — which attracted Rs 2,000 as fine. While 18 of the 25 traffic guards who had begun the tests issued 505 notices, they ultimately prosecuted 114. The anti-pollution cell, on the other hand, served notice to 2,823 motorists and prosecuted 2,632 vehicles. “The focus of the AP cell is only on pollution, unlike the guards. The guards are learning the tricks and the numbers will definitely go up in the next few months,” said an officer. While TOI had reported in July that even guards have been asked to conduct anti-pollution drives, this will be the first time that as many as 21 teams will carry them out. This will include three teams from the anti-pollution cell and 18 from the guards. Sources said BS-III vehicles — mostly yellow taxis and small trucks — are the worst violators. “A few BS-IV and BS-VI vehicles, too, have been served notices,” said an officer. Sources said drivers will now have their smartcards seized at the time of getting notice. “We will release them as soon as the PUC is in order. So far, we were seizing multiple documents. But if we seize important documents, the driver will get the PUC problem rectified sooner,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/21-teams-to-nab-motorists-flouting-pollution-rules/articleshow/87724186.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The 45-day drive will focus on saving electricity by preventing power theft and misuse of feeders. According to the officials, an FIR was lodged against 31 customers of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (PESU) for their involvement in power theft on Day 1 and a penalty of Rs 13.55 lakh collected from the violators. As many as 1,768 buildings and houses were inspected by different teams in Patna at 13 locations, including Ashiana Nagar, Danapur, Khagaul, Dak Bungalow, Patliputra, Gardanibagh, Bankipore, Gulzarbagh, Patna City, Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, and New Capital. Dilip Kumar Singh, the general manager (GM) of the PESU that undertakes power supply work in Patna and some peripheral areas, told this newspaper on Monday that all the transformers and the houses connected to them would be checked during the campaign. “In case of theft, action will be taken against the consumer, FIRs lodged and penalties collected. All the grievances related to bills or faulty meters will also be addressed,” he said. The PESU GM continued, “The aim of the campaign is to ensure that people do not tamper with the meters for stealing electricity.” PESU has nearly 7,200 transformers and 6.5 lakh consumers under its jurisdiction. Singh said, “Almost 7% of the 100-odd houses our team inspects in a day are found to be stealing electricity. Most cases of pilfering are witnessed in eastern Patna that includes Gulzarbagh and Patna City.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/31-booked-on-first-day-of-drive-against-power-theft-in-city/articleshow/87723277.cms||Faryal Rumi

This, in turn, has put smiles on the faces of all the people associated with the hospitality sector and wedding industry who had been struggling to make ends meet amid the pandemic. Hotels, marriage halls, banquets, clubs and grounds in the city are fully booked till next year as many people who cancelled their wedding due to the pandemic, have decided to hold a grand wedding after Kartik Purnima on November 19. The general manager of a five-star hotel near J P roundabout B D Singh told this newspaper that he has no slot left as all the dates have already been booked for November and December. “People have even booked the hall, for April and May next year, in advance,” he said, adding that the hotel will hold at least five ceremonies in a day and hoped that his business will bloom after all the hardship he faced during the pandemic. A Nair, general manager of another hotel at Beerchand Patel Marg said, bookings are almost full for banquet halls, rooms and suites. “We still get lots of queries about the availability of banquet halls,” Nair said. An owner of a hotel at Bailey Road Ziaul Haque claimed that the trend of big-fat wedding is back among the clients. As people say that a wedding is incomplete without ‘band-baja’, they are rushing to make last-minute booking for an orchestra group. The owner of an orchestra band Sanjay Kumar said, the rate has been fixed as per the number of artists and duration. “It costs anywhere between Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 per procession,” Kumar said, adding that the demand has increased as the ‘lagan’ is approaching. Meanwhile, city markets are crowded as the bride and groom are moving from one shop to another in search of best dresses, shoes and accessories. Aniket Singh, owner of a garment shop at Khetan Market said, these days brides are opting printed and embroidered ‘lehenga’ in pastel colours. “Rajwada-style sherwani and collared-kurta with pants are in demand among the grooms,” he said. Another garment shop owner at Raja Bazaar Amit Choudhary has imported all the bridal dresses from Kolkata and Delhi. “I have matching dresses for the bride and groom and even for their parents,” Choudhary said. Not only gold jewellery is in demand but the artificial ones are also selling like hot-cakes. Dharmendra Kumar, a salesman of a shop at Churi Market said, he has a huge range of earrings, gold-plated bangles and necklaces. “There is a lot of craze of imitation jewellery as they offer a wide range to design and pattern,” he said. Besides, beauty parlours are also making a brisk business as both bride and groom want to glam-up for their D-day. The manager of a beauty salon at Frazer Road Soni Singh said that she has to hire more stylists because of the huge number of bookings for pre-bridal and bridal make-up. “I charge extra Rs 3,000 if the groom and bride ask for getting their make-up done at the venue,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-hope-to-revive-business-as-lagan-season-begins/articleshow/87723607.cms||Faryal Rumi

Earlier, on Sunday evening, unidentified criminals looted Rs15 lakh after shooting at a businessman, Dinesh Bhadani, under the Malsalami police station area in Patna City. The injured has been admitted to the PMCH. In Munger, the criminals pumped 4 bullets into the body of 28-year-old Deepika, the wife of CISF jawan Ravi Sharma, when she was going to the washroom in her house under the Kasim Bazar police station area in Munger at around 5am. The CISF jawan is posted at Dhanbad in Jharkhand. Reports reaching the police headquarters said Deepika was living with her mother-in-law Jayanti Devi and two brothers-in-law. Her brother Sanu alleged that Deepika had survived a murderous attack in 2017, three years after her marriage. Kasim Bazar police station SHO Dharmendra Kumar said the reason behind the murder was being ascertained. Meanwhile, two girl students were allegedly raped by a youth at a village under Akbarpur police station area in Nawada on November 8. However, the case was lodged with the police station concerned on Sunday after a video showing the crime went viral on social media. A police officer posted at Akbarpur police station said the accused, stated to be the son of a schoolteacher, called the girls on the pretext of helping them in practical examination and raped them. The accused was absconding. In West Champaran, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped by three youths from the Gaunaha police station area and taken to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh where she was gang-raped for over over a month. The girl was found in an unconscious state behind her house on Sunday. On October 20, the victim’s father had lodged a missing case with the Gaunaha police station. SDPO Kundan Kumar said the victim’s statement would be recorded under Section 164 of CrPC in the court. All the three accused were evading arrest, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-shot-in-munger-trader-robbed-of-rs-3l-in-madhepura/articleshow/87723305.cms||Ramashankar

Responding to a media query on Ranaut’s statement after his weekly ‘Janata ke Darbar mein Mukhyamantri’ programme, Nitish said, “Who does not know when the country got freedom? Such statements should not be given any importance. In fact, they should be made fun of. I do not pay attention to such people.” In a recent interview, Ranaut had said India got its freedom in 2014 (when PM Narendra Modi came to power) and what it got in 1947 was a “bheekh”. Asked for his comment on Ranaut’s ‘bheekh’ remark, Nitish replied, “I am surprised how such statements get published? Is there any importance of such things?” Nitish’s JD(U) is an ally of the BJP in Bihar and also at the Centre. The NDA government had recently awarded the Padma Shri to Ranaut. Two days ago, senior JD(U) leader and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha had demanded withdrawal of the Padma Shri given to Ranaut. Asked for his response on the ‘Hinduism is not about hate, Hindutva is’ remark made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Nitish said, “One should ask this question to Rahul Gandhi. Such people have their own method… They want to be in the limelight by saying something.” Without taking names of any opposition leaders, he added, “In Bihar, too, some people speak against me only to get publicity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kanganas-freedom-remark-should-be-made-fun-of-nitish/articleshow/87723253.cms||Madan Kumar

The target is to procure 45 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers across the state till January 31, state cooperative department minister Subhash Singh said. “The selected primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) and vyapar mandals have been asked to procure paddy from farmers at the minimum support price (MSP). The farmers who sell their produce at the procurement centres of the selected agencies will get their money without delay. Instructions have been issued to make all arrangements in this regard,” Singh said. The state has over 8,000 PACS and over 100 vyapar mandals, but only the selected among them have been pressed into paddy procurement. After purchasing paddy from farmers, the two agencies will get it milled at the identified rice mills in the state before delivering the rice to Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation (BSFCSC). The farmers will be paid Rs1,940 per quintal. Each of the ‘ryots’ (land owning farmer) will be able to sell 250 quintals of paddy, and a ‘bataidar’ (sharecropper), 100 quintals. The state cabinet has already given bank guarantee to the BSFCSC to raise Rs5,000 crore from the commercial banks to facilitate the timely payment to the farmers. The money has been made available to the district level central cooperative banks. Incidentally, the paddy procurement was first started on November 1 in the districts of Purnia and Kosi division, followed by the districts of Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran divisions on November 10. The paddy procurement in the districts of the remaining divisions, including Patna, Bhagalpur, Munger and Magadh, started on Monday. Due to the four-phase floods and heavy rain this year, including in October, the paddy harvesting was delayed and only 9,000 tonnes of paddy could be procured in 19 districts till November 14. In Patna district, 80.4 tonnes of paddy were procured from the farmers in 11 blocks, a district administration communique said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paddy-procurement-begins-in-19-south-bihar-districts/articleshow/87723773.cms||Abhay Singh

However, passengers are unable to avail full facilities as yet due to certain glitches in the passenger reservation system (PRS) server. According to ECR chief public relations (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has reverted train fares to pre-Covid period and started updating its PRS database by loading old numbers of the regular trains. All PRS booking counters are being kept shut daily for six hours from 11.30pm to 5.30am to update the database with old train numbers. Railways intends to complete the data feeding work by November 21, he said. Railways will do away with the ‘0’ digit used for special trains to the original numbers after upgrading the PRS system, he said, adding that information related to reservation, cancellation and enquiry will be available to passengers after upgrading the system. According to Railway Board sources, even though old fares have been restored in the regular mail and express passenger trains, railways will not make any refund of the excess fare to those who have already booked their tickets in special passenger trains. Besides, concession to senior citizens and in other different categories will not be given to passengers as per the new guidelines, sources said, adding the Board’s directives have also no clarity on the issue of providing meals, water bottles, bedrolls and other services to the passengers. According to sources, railways has restored 1700 special trains as regular passenger trains from November 14 across the country, including 148 from ECR. The special trains have registered about 113% revenue growth as these trains have been running as ‘special trains’ for the past 15 months across the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-restores-148-regular-trains/articleshow/87723589.cms||Kumod Verma

The comment comes at a time when India has been under pressure globally to reduce dependency on coal-fired power plants and cut emissions. Patra said this in his keynote address in the conference on ‘Growth and development in the BRICS economies’ organised by the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which was released by the RBI on Monday. “Medium-term challenges for the BRICS arise in the context of climate risks and emission commitments, which may engender energy shortages, technology gaps and hence pose risks to medium-term growth and inflation, especially for countries with large total emissions,” said Patra. He added that the immediate challenge was from elevated commodity prices for net importers like India, although they confer terms of trade gains for net exporters like Brazil and Russia. “For all the BRICS, rising food prices on account of natural calamities and demand-supply imbalances caused by the pandemic involve elevated inflation risks,” said Patra. In his address, Patra said capital accumulation is the biggest contributor to India’s growth and a striking feature of Indian investment is that it is financed primarily by domestic savings, with capital flows from abroad playing only a supplemental role. However, the saving rate has started slowing down after the global financial crisis (GFC). Eventually, this pulled down the investment rate from 2012-13. “Reversing this trend is critical to achieving higher growth,” said Patra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/emission-cut-vows-a-risk-to-growth-inflation-rbi/articleshow/87725727.cms||---
---||Business||No need to re-register for GST: AAR||Mumbai: The Karnataka bench of the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that a separate GST registration is not required in the state (the place of supply) by a subcontractor who was executing an infrastructure project. Upholding the spirit of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in its recent ruling, the bench said the subcontractor can raise the invoice by charging integrated goods and service tax (IGST) from its office in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. IGST is levied in case of an interstate supply of goods and services. Rulings given by the AAR have a persuasive value. Tax practitioners say that if this ruling is adopted pan-India, it will go a long way in reducing costs — both the cost of registration and other administrative costs for business entities. On the downside, the AAR also held that in the absence of an office in Karnataka, the subcontractor cannot register as an input service distributor. Such registration was required to avail of the input tax credit against goods/services procured from suppliers at the site and distribute such credit onward to its Noida registration. In this case, GEW India, a private limited company that had a unit in Noida and a registered office in Pune (Maharashtra), obtained a work order from Larsen & Toubro to execute a works contract inside a naval base at Karwar in Karnataka. It entailed a composite supply of goods and services, such as installation of a steel structure for harbouring of ships. The steel was fabricated at its Noida unit and installation was on-site. GEW India explained that they are likely to provide accommodation in Karnataka for the resident engineer and others who may visit the work site, but will not have any office or administrative staff. The AAR noted that the applicant company had only one principal place of business — Noida, for which GST registration had been obtained. Thus, there was no requirement for a separate registration in Karnataka for executing its contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-need-to-re-register-for-gst-aar/articleshow/87725724.cms||Lubna Kably

Town planning committee chairman at AMC Devang Dani in said on Monday that the estate department officials have been instructed to remove egg and non-vegetarian food carts from major arterial routes, very specifically from outside schools, colleges, religious places, parks and gardens etc. The diktat applies to both licensed and unlicensed street food vendors. The civic body officials such egg and non-veg food carts can conduct their business on internal roads but ensure it is not visible to those who use the arterial routes for commute. When asked to clarify on the conditions applied to operate from internal roads, Dani said, "All raw materials used for non-veg food preparations should be covered. The fish, poultry and meat should kept covered boxes," said Dani. In another significant decision, the town planning committee said that those persons who have a valid license for selling mutton, will have to do so in a closed enclosure. Moreover, the items being sold at such shops cannot be hung from a hook, he added. “If these rules are not adhered to, shops selling mutton will also be sealed,” the official said. Ahmedabad is fourth city after Rajkot, Vadodara and Bhavnagar municipal corporations have issued oral directives, especially ensuring that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ in the public eye. CM Bhupendra Patel when quizzed about removal of non-veg stalls from roads of major cities said the the decision has been taken by civic bodies like municipalities and municipal corporations. “People can eat vegetarian or non-vegetarian food. The state government has no objection whatsoever in this matter. But civic bodies can remove laaris if they are an obstruction in traffic. And the food sold should be hygienic,” said Patel. Patel said that the issue for the state government is whether food sold from such laaris is hygienic and whether such laarris are an obstruction for traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-bans-sale-of-eggs-non-veg-food-on-main-roads-out-of-sight-out-of-mind/articleshow/87724865.cms||---

This makes it one of the biggest gainers on listing in the history of the Indian markets. Compared to its IPO price of Rs 163 per share, the stock listed at Rs 575 and closed the first day’s session on the bourses at Rs 604 — an appreciation of 253% over its offer price, according to BSE data. The IPO frenzy that’s currently gripping Dalal Street also helped PB Fintech, which operates under the PolicyBazaar brand, to list at a 17% premium to its offer price and close the day with a gain of 5% for its shareholders. Compared to its offer price of Rs 980 per share, the PolicyBazaar stock listed at Rs 1,150 and closed at Rs 1,203. The two blockbuster listings of Monday followed another by online cosmetics retailer FSN E-Commerce Ventures, which operates under the Nykaa brand, last week. The stock, offered at Rs 1,125 per share, was listed at Rs 2,001 — a gain of 77%, which also catapulted its main promoter Falguni Nayar into the league of richest Indians. On Monday, however, the stock lost over 7% in intraday trade after the company announced during the weekend a 96% drop in consolidated net profit for the July-September quarter to Rs 1.2 crore. It ended over 3% down at Rs 2,281 by close of Monday’s trade on the BSE. However, there were some listing disappointments as well on D-Street. On Monday, SJS Enterprises, a decorative aesthetics manufacturer for the automotive and consumer appliances industries, listed at a marginal discount to its offer price of Rs 542 per share. It lost further ground through the session to close at Rs 510, a discount of nearly 6% to the offer price and down 6% on the day, BSE data showed. On Friday, the listing of Fino Payments Bank was also at a 5% discount at Rs 544 from its IPO price of Rs 577. On Monday, the stock — one of the leading payments banks in India — closed over 5% down at Rs 516, a discount of more than 10% to the offer price. The markets are now gearing up for the listing of tech-driven payments solutions pioneer One97 Communications, which operates under the Paytm brand, on Thursday. The company closed its Rs 18,300-crore IPO, the biggest in the country’s history, last week with the issue subscribed 1.9 times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sigachis-listing-gain-one-of-d-sts-biggest/articleshow/87725717.cms||---

Gujarat saw an estimated Rs 582 crore being spent by firms—public and private sector—for CSR activities in 2020-21. Of this, Rs 318 crore or 55% went towards the healthcare sector, shows data available on the National CSR Data Portal, an initiative of the union corporate affairs ministry. In percentage terms, this is the highest share that the sector has received ever since 2014-15, when it was mandatory for companies to spend 2% of their 3-year average net profit for CSR projects. The healthcare sector accounted for 33% and 23% of Gujarat’s total CSR expenditure in 2019-20 and 2018-19, respectively. “The companies changed their CSR priorities in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Since the pandemic started at the cusp of a new financial year, several companies made provisions and created special projects in response to the pandemic,” said Bhomik Shah, founder and CEO, CSRBOX, an Ahmedabad-based CSR research and advisory firm. “The funding which was to go towards education, water projects or any other initiatives was channelized towards battling the pandemic,” said Shah, adding that the trend of healthcare having higher share of the CSR spend is expected to continue partially in 2021-22 because companies have prioritized healthcare in the first half of the current fiscal as well. After the pandemic, the central government added expenditure incurred for fighting against Covid-19 to the list of eligible CSR activities. Companies wholeheartedly made contributions to the relief funds of the prime minister and state chief ministers. Corporate firms took up several initiatives such as distribution of masks, PPE kits, hand sanitizers as well as provided oxygen cylinders, put up oxygen plants and created Covid care facilities. The amount of funds spent towards CSR across Gujarat in 2020-21 is expected to increase further as the current estimate is based on the data reported by 280 companies. The estimate will be updated when more companies submit their figures. More than 1,200 companies spend money every year for CSR in the state, said people operating in CSR space. The ministry data showed that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Limited and Torrent Power Limited spent the maximum amount towards overall CSR activities in the state during fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/healthcare-sectors-share-in-states-csr-spend-jumps-to-55-after-pandemic/articleshow/87724835.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat ATS nabs 3 with 120kg heroin worth Rs 600 crore from Morbi||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat anti-terrorism squad (ATS) arrested three persons from a village in Morbi district with 120kg of heroin on Sunday night. The seized drugs have an estimated international value of Rs 600 crore, DGP Ashish Bhatia told reporters here on Monday. This drug consignment was allegedly sent by a resident of Pakistan, Zahid Bashir Baloch. He is a wanted absconder in the 2019 case in which 227kg of heroin was seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. Acting on an input received by deputy superintendent of police, ATS, K K Patel, a team of the Gujarat ATS led by DSP Bhavesh Rojiya raided an under-construction house belonging to one Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed near the Dargah of Kotawala Pir in Jinjuda village of Maliya-Miyana in Morbi. The heroin was seized after the raid. Patel had received an intelligence input to the effect that one of the accused, Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodiya, and Ghulam Bhagad, residents of Jodia in Jamnagar and Salaya in Devbhoomi-Dwarka respectively, had smuggled in the narcotics through the sea route. According to the input, the two accused were going to meet at night at the house of the third accused, Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed alias Pirzada Bapu. Consequently, an ATS team nabbed the accused with the heroin at Saiyyed’s house. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the consignment of heroin was brought by Hussein and Bhagad via the sea route and they had received the delivery from a Pakistani boat. Isa Rav Hussein, brother of Mukhtar Hussein, was in contact with Pakistani-resident Baloch and had exchanged the coordinates for the delivery of the drugs in a mid-sea operation. The drug consignment was delivered in the last week of October and it was initially hidden in the coastal region near Salaya. It was subsequently moved to Saiyyed’s house in Jinjuda village in Morbi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-ats-nabs-3-with-120kg-heroin-worth-rs-600-cr-from-morbi/articleshow/87724782.cms||---

Facilities like ELISA test, blood platelets and separate wards with sufficient number of beds are already available,” Pandey told this newspaper, adding that the number of patients suffering from dengue had declined considerably. The minister further pointed out that in the first week of November, the government had sent a health alert to all the district magistrates, civil surgeons, principals and superintendents of medical colleges and hospitals in the state and asked them to take urgent steps for preventing the spread of dengue. They were requested to undertake necessary steps for sensitization of medical and paramedical staff in government and private hospitals. “The health department has also instructed the officials concerned to organize medical camps in the dengue-affected areas and conduct fogging,” the minister said. The deputy superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Dr Satish Kumar, also admitted that there had been a decline in the number of dengue patients in the last few days. “Now, only four or five people suffering from dengue are admitted in the hospital. Most patients are only visiting the outpatient departments,” he added. In the last two months, dengue had spread its tentacles in different parts of the state. More than 200 patients had officially been admitted to government hospitals and active dengue cases were reported in as many as 24 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-minister-dengue-is-under-control-in-bihar/articleshow/87723532.cms||B K Mishra

The Yadav scion claimed that a series of such meetings had been conducted before and raised questions on their outcome. Interacting with the media before leaving for Siwan to attend the wedding ceremony of former RJD MP Shahabuddin’s daughter, Hera Shahab, Tejashwi alleged, “All the meetings called by the CM are high level ones which are attended by the same set of officials. They are not really review meetings because they are meant to find out the amount of revenue generated by different departments. Those who fail to bring money get transfer threats.” The leader of opposition also lashed at the Nitish government over “lawlessness” in the state. “Incidents of murder, corruption, kidnapping and rape have been occurring regularly under the present government’s regime,” he said, recalling the murder of Vishwajeet Singh, a former district board member from Dhamdaha, the killing of Buddhinath Jha, a journalist, and the gang rape of a woman in Nalanda during Chhath. Tejashwi continued, “The people of the JD (U) and the BJP were involved in the Srijan scam and the Muzaffarpur shelter case.” He also pointed out that it was his duty as the leader of opposition to raise his voice and hold press conferences. “Even Sushil Kumar Modi used to hold pressers, albeit fake ones,” he said. Meanwhile, JD (U) spokesperson, Neeraj Kumar, responded to Tejashwi’s allegations, saying his USP was false propaganda. “As far as review meetings are concerned, Tejashwi had attended some of them when he was the deputy CM. He, however, may not have understood much because of his poor educational background,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-targets-nitish-govt-over-lawlessness-in-state/articleshow/87723295.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Delhi||Delhi: SC refuses to entertain Centre’s plea on ration||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain the Centre’s plea against the Delhi high court order directing the AAP government not to stop or curtail the supply of foodgrains or flour to fair price shops. A bench of Justices L N Rao and B R Gavai said the September 27 order under challenge is interim and the matter is listed before the high court on November 22 and, therefore, it would not like to entertain it. Delhi government assured the apex court that it will put its policy on hold till the high court hearing.  The high court had passed interim order on September 27 allowing the government to stop supplying foodgrains to fair price shops (FPS) for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over the physical collection. It will again take up the case on November 22 for final adjudication on the issue, which has emerged as another flashpoint between the two governments. At the outset of hearing, the bench said that the issue was still being examined by the high court which passed only an interim order and asked the Centre to raise all contentions on validity of the scheme before the high court. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, contended that the issue could have a wider ramification as other states would also bring similar scheme which is in violation of National Food Security Act and pleaded the court to examine it. He said that the Act provides a mode for distribution of foodgrains and a state government could not be allowed to adopt a mode different from what was prescribed in the law and people have to take grains from fair price shops. “Delhi government is taking help of private agency and there will be no accountability. The high court erred in passing the order which virtually allowed the petition,” Mehta said. The bench again pointed out that it would not be proper to hear the case on merit as it was pending before the high court for adjudication. Countering Centre’s arguments, senior advocate A M Singhvi said that everything under the world was being delivered at home and even liquor was being supplied and raised questioned why the Centre was opposing the scheme for home delivery of foodgrains at the doorstep of poor people. He said that the scheme would put to an end diversion and pilferage of foodgrains. The bench then asked Singhvi regarding the present status on implementation of the scheme and he replied that preparation was going on in full swing but distribution had not started. Singhvi, thereafter, assured the court that the scheme will not be made operational till November 22 as the case was scheduled to be heard by the high court. The high court had allowed Delhi government to divert ration delivery to cardholders at doorsteps, provided that it does not cause any shortage in the fair price shops. It had said, “GNCTD shall first issue communication to each fair price shop holders, of particulars of ration cardholders, who opted to receive rations at doorsteps &, only then, ration, to extent that they're being supplied to such optees, needn’t be supplied to fair price shop holders.” The high court had passed interim order on a plea against Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh, which said that their share of ration will be diverted under this policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-refuses-to-entertain-centres-plea-on-ration/articleshow/87725168.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

He also set a target of laying 46,000 kilometres roads in the state, once the rains recede. The chief minister reviewed the state of roads with officials of the roads and buildings department at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday. He wanted officials to take up repairs in municipal corporations and municipalities on priority. He asked officials to complete repairs of all roads in the state by June 2022. The chief minister asked officials to focus on roads with the maximum extent of damage and start repair works, ensuring that the difference is visible after the work. Officials informed that there was a delay in work due to continuous rains and assured they would start repair on a stretch of 8,268 km by the end of this month after finalising tenders. Officials said all repairs would be completed between December and June. The chief minister directed the authorities to cover all bridges and flyovers and make plans to bring ROBs and bridges under Phase 1. He instructed the officials to focus on restoring roads and take pictures before and after repairing the roads, similar to the Nadu-Nedu scheme. He said to concentrate on repairs and maintenance of existing roads before starting the construction of new roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-directs-road-laying-repair-work-across-state/articleshow/87723934.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ‘Capital region farmers gave up land for better future’||VIJAYAWADA: Establishment of a state’s capital is a one-time exercise and cannot be done again and again as and when there is a change of mind on the part of the state government, said senior counsel Shyam Diwan on Monday, while putting forth his arguments on behalf of capital region farmers who gave away their lands for the construction of capital Amaravati. As the AP high court resumed its hearing on the batch of petitions filed against the government’s move to trifurcate the capital, Diwan built his argument outlining the sequence of events — right from bifurcation which eventually necessitated for creation of a new capital for Andhra Pradesh. Even in the State Reorganisation Act, the Parliament spoke about ‘a capital’, Diwan said, adding that though it does not necessarily mean only one capital, but the intention of the Parliament is to create a capital city for the state of AP to compensate the loss that arose after losing Hyderabad to Telangana. It was for this purpose that the Union government constituted an expert committee to identify probable locations for creation of a new capital city and extended financial assistance to the AP government in accordance with the State Reorganisation Act, he said. The expert committee took the opinion of people from across the state, in which 52% voted for Vijayawada-Guntur as the capital city, 10.72% in favour of Visakhapatnam, while 7% voted for Kurnool as capital city. Following the recommendations of the expert committee, the then state government came up with the Amaravati project and land was taken from the farmers under land pooling scheme by making them partners in the project. The farmers of capital region gave away their livelihood in the hope that they will get better opportunities that were promised to them by the state government in the form of fully developed returnable plots in the world-class capital city, argued Diwan. The Amaravati master plan is a statutory document which is still in force and without delivering on the promises made to the farmers, the state government cannot take away the executive and judicial wings away from the capital as they form an integral part of the capital, he argued, adding that the decision to trifurcate the capital is without reason and rationale. Referring to section 93(3) of the State Reorganisation Act, Diwan said the central government gave funds for the development of essential infrastructure like Raj Bhavan, assembly, secretariat, high court, and other facilities in the capital. Though a specific inference was not drawn in the bill about the location of the capital, a place consisting of these three wings which forms the core of governance can only be said as capital city, he added. The Amaravati master plan was prepared after conducting a detailed scientific study to make it the growth engine for the state by creating employment opportunities and attracting investments, Diwan said, adding that the capital vision was put to implementation by grounding phase 1 infrastructure works to the tune of Rs 51,687 crore, out of which Rs 5,674 crore has already been spent and works are at various stages of completion. However, after the change in government in 2019, all works have come to a grinding halt and turned Amaravati into a ghost city, he said. The hearing will continue on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/capital-region-farmers-gave-up-land-for-a-better-future/articleshow/87723963.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh ‘nurses’ European dreams as Covid-19 pushes demand||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses or graduates of nursing in Andhra Pradesh are now looking to capitalise on the existing demand for their profession in European countries. The Andhra Pradesh Non-resident Telugu Society (APNRTS) is putting forth a proposal to provide jobs for nurses from AP in eastern European countries like UK, Germany and France. The state is the second-largest provider of nurses in the country, with 220 colleges and schools from where 4,000 nurses graduate every year. A significant number of nurses are already shifting to countries such as the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, the UK and New Zealand after attaining three to four years of experience. Eastern European countries are now witnessing a high demand for nurses, especially during the pandemic. According to a survey conducted by Jobfeed, the UK has a shortage of nurses at 790 nurses per 100,000 inhabitants. In France, this number is 990 nurses per 100,000 inhabitants, 1,050 for the Netherlands, 1,080 for Belgium and 1,330 for Germany. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a nurse-to-people ratio of at least one nurse per 500 people. “There is a demand for nurses in European countries especially UK. The issue with other European countries is that they would prefer nurses who know the local language, which the state might find difficult to cater to. We are looking at the possibility of tying up with recruiters to provide job opportunities for nurses in the state,” chairman of APNRTS Venkat S Medapati said. In Andhra Pradesh and predominantly across the country, the nursing curriculum mostly focuses on the basics and does not include specialisations. Experts advocate that nursing institutions should upgrade their curriculum and include specialisations to prepare nurses for ward-specific roles. “The average salary for a nurse starting her profession in Andhra Pradesh is around Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 which isn’t great motivation and only a handful make it to big corporate hospitals. If nurses hold specialisations, then international recruitment agencies would take hold of them almost instantly,” Kangisetti Radha, a head nurse at a private hospital in Vijayawada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-nurses-european-dreams-as-covid-pushes-demand/articleshow/87723946.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The family is yet to lodge a formal complaint in this case. The police also spoke to locals who reportedly rescued Saha from the manhole. “We are investigating the case from all angles after initial post-mortem opinion suggested head injuries. It also stated death was due to soil and muck blocking the lungs and respiratory tract of the victim. We are waiting for the final post-mortem report to decide on our next course of action,” said an officer. On Monday, PWD and KMC formed a committee to check for open manholes across the city. They have also decided to spread awareness on the issue, especially in the slums. Maintaining the manholes or ensuring that drains are properly covered is the responsibility of the agency that maintains that particular road, like KMC, KMDA or PWD. PWD submitted a report on Sunday where it admitted that Dum Dum Road is maintained “from the office of the assistant engineer PWD Kolkata North sub-division”. The report said “action will be taken for more vigilance along with KMC’s drainage wing officials so that this type of incident is avoided”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manhole-death-cops-speak-to-kin-pwd-kmc-form-jt-panel/articleshow/87724244.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||No child’s play: What hospitals can do if third wave of Covid-19 strikes||NEW DELHI: Those under the age of 18 constitute nearly 41 per cent of India’s population. Several studies have raised the concern that if a third Covid-19 wave were to happen, it may affect them more. The World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Emergency and Trauma (WHO-CCET) of Southeast Asia has formed a committee of experts to develop a toolkit that can be used by hospitals in India to deal with a potential crisis, in case it occurs. According to the toolkit, published in the Journal of Emergency Surgery, Trauma and Shock, 57 million children might be at risk of getting affected if a third wave hits the country. To treat them, the toolkit suggests, resources to cater to 5.7 million hospital admissions and 2.8 million ICU patients need to be readied. It recommends that hospitals should have well-defined areas before a surge in patient volume in the form of the triage or screening area, paediatric ICUs, high dependency units and step-down wards. “Ideally, all beds should have the capability to deliver oxygen. The use of adult beds may be considered. The beds should be set at the lowest possible height from the floor and electronic controls should be done away with,” suggest the experts. Any patient presenting fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and difficulty breathing, or diarrhoea, skin rash and the presence of a recently confirmed Covid-19 case in the household, should be tested for the infection. A child having an unstable airway or inability to ventilate with rising PCO2 levels with respiratory insufficiency and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, among others, should be considered for ICU admission. The experts involved in the development of the toolkit include doctors from AIIMS, Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Manipal Hospital and Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida, US, among others. The toolkit also stresses on the need to train staff to care for the psychological needs of children admitted to hospital with Covid-19. In certain cases, consultation with a mental health professional may be useful. Dr Arun Gupta, a paediatrician, who is also the president of Delhi Medical Council, said the chances of a third wave were low. However, he stressed on the need to prepare on the lines suggested by the expert committee. “Many hospitals are already doing it,” he added. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre recently told TOI they have commissioned two new ICU floors with an augmented capacity of 28 beds. “The ICUs will be operationalised by July 31 complete with the latest, state-of-the-art ventilators and monitors newly acquired for a possible third wave with special emphasis on paediatric care,” he added. AIIMS Trauma Centre has been designated for Covid-19 treatment. Malhotra said they had procured 40 ventilators with paediatric mode, fibre-optic bronchoscopy, laryngoscope and cardiac monitor with paediatric cuffs, among others, with emphasis on managing children with Covid-19. While it is feared that the third wave might affect children more, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-childs-play-what-hospitals-can-do-if-third-wave-of-covid-19-strikes/articleshow/87725200.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Chandigarh||UT adviser to review IT park general housing scheme next week||Rajinder.Nagarkoti1@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: UT adviser Dharam Pal will review the IT Park general housing scheme next week. He has asked Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) officials to submit a status report of the project, which will be reviewed next week. Recently, the UT urban planning and engineering departments approved the plan to construct 728 flats under the general housing scheme on around 16.6 acres of land in two pockets at IT Park for Rs 643 crore. The CHB also filed an application with the Chandigarh MC seeking fire NoC. CHB officials contacted MC officials on Monday, seeking early issuance of fire NoC for the project. The board has got structure, public health, electrical, town planning and architectural related approvals from the departments. All these points were assessed by the urban planning and engineering departments. The scheme, which was approved by the board of directors of the CHB last December, will have 728 flats. Though the exact prices of flats are yet to be decided, the tentative cost ranges between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 2.75 crore. The project land is part of 123 acres that the CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a protracted legal battle. Former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore had given the go-ahead to its design last July but the project could not take off due to the pandemic. The project report was placed before the board of directors in a meeting held last December and the scheme was given in-principle approval. Sources said that the CHB would develop the project on two plots, measuring 10.51 and 6.43 acres. In all, there will be 728 flats of three categories (4, 3 and 2 BHK) in seven-storey towers. The towers will have two basements with provision for parking of two cars for each flat, in addition to surface parking for visitors. CHB got possession of 123 acres after a residential project, Prideasia, failed to take off. The board decided to launch the scheme after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites in an e-auction a few years ago. Due to high reserve prices, not many developers evinced interest in the auction. The board will develop the scheme on two plots, measuring 10.51 acres and 6.43 acres. High-end flats for government officials of the Chandigarh administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of ‘Makkal Sabhai’ programme in the city on Monday, Balaji said it takes 30 minutes to cover a road stretch which can be crossed in 10 minutes. “The reason is the roads are badly damaged. They are neither re-laid nor repaired,” he said. Noting that city residents have demanded that the roads have to be re-laid, Balaji said work on identifying the roads that need attention was going on. Once the roads are identified, a project estimate would be prepared, he said. “Once we figure out the extent of funds required for setting right the road infrastructure, it will be taken to the chief minister,” he said. Similarly, bad roads in rural areas are also being assessed, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-roads-to-get-a-makeover-min/articleshow/87725165.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This will be Patel’s first visit to Vadodara after being elected as the chief minister.The scale of the programme can be guessed from the fact that a large stage and enclosure has been prepared for the event in the Navlakhi Ground. The event may have been termed as a get together in the Gujarati new year, but it will be on the scale of a general board meeting. Sources in the BJP said that around 10,000 people are expected to gather at the event. Members have already been asked to ensure a healthy turnout from their areas. The party has also prepared 114 food counters at the venue. These will be manned by 700 volunteers. It aims at feeding persons from the gathering within 28 minutes and even set a record. It also aims to waste minimum food. The large gathering’s idea has, however, not gone down well with many. Activist Shwejal Vyas who was booked earlier for violating guidelines said that if the large gathering took place, he plans to register a police complaint later. He has already sent a message to the city police commissioner regarding the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/huge-crowd-expected-at-bjps-sneh-milan/articleshow/87725173.cms||---
---||Goa||Long breaks don’t help, players will never be ready to perform at 100 percent during ISL: Ivan Vukomanovic||Panaji: To explain just why the eight-month break between the end of last season’s Indian Super League (ISL) and the upcoming edition is harmful to the health of Indian football, Kerala Blasters coach Ivan Vukomanovic takes the help of a car. “Imagine,” he says, taking a pause. “You have a car and have been driving for several months. Then you just park the car in the garage and leave it there for six months. When you restart the car, there will be some lamps blinking, some starting problems.” Starting problems are common in the ISL as players remain out of action for a long time. Last season, for example, Kerala’s engagements ended on February 26. By the time they play their next match – in a new season – it will be almost nine months. To overcome the problem of being out of action for such a long time, Kerala started early. They were the first, in August itself, to assemble for pre-season training. “All over the world professional footballers don’t have such a long break between seasons. If you have such a long break every year, every season, very often players at the beginning of ISL or during the league will get injured more and more. “If you look at the big picture, it means players will never be ready to perform 100 percent during the ISL. Our idea was to start early, avoid long break, avoid injuries and get the players in normal shape with many friendlies,” said the Serbian coach who took charge of the team this season. Vukomanovic is “happy and content” with how the pre-season has shaped up. The players, he feels, have improved “physically, technically and tactically.” But this could have possibly been even better, if plans for a pre-season abroad were not scuppered by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The idea was that players and, as a team, you get the chance to get in touch with different foreign teams for friendlies. You play (against them) and measure yourself against teams from certain countries, at a certain level. The players can train as much as they wish but the best is playing friendly games. “We wanted to play against strong teams where the team can see the difference and realise how it works at a higher level in Europe. Unfortunately, it didn’t go through because of the pandemic and subsequent restrictions. But, anyway, I am positively surprised and content with everything here in Goa and Kochi,” said Vukomanovic. While Goa and Kochi helped Vukomanovic iron out his team’s flaws, the same cannot be said about Kolkata. Kerala took part in the Durand Cup, fielded a strong side, but they were not just knocked out at the group stage, their training was also heavily disrupted by the weather. Vukomanovic, though, prefers to look ahead rather than reflect on the difficult nights when he didn’t know whether they could train the next day, whether it would be in the morning or afternoon. “I always say that I don’t like to lose time or discuss things that we cannot control. Despite the weather conditions, which were very cruel, the Durand Cup this season arrived in such an unpleasant moment for everyone. “If you speak from a pre-season perspective, not one team was physically or tactically ready to play and many players were busy with the national team. It was a kind of period where we wanted to go through without any injuries. Certain things we couldn’t control were the conditions and training grounds, and we accepted that as part of our pre-season,” said Vukomanovic. Kerala Blasters open their campaign against last year’s finalists ATK Mohun Bagan on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/long-breaks-dont-help-players-will-never-be-ready-to-perform-at-100-percent-during-isl-ivan-vukomanovic/articleshow/87745165.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Father granted pre-arrest bail in son sexual assault case||MUMBAI: Observing that false implication of a 48-year-old father can’t be ruled out, Bombay high court while granting the man anticipatory bail said that the mother sought to co-relate affection of the father for his son to an alleged incident this year so that she could invoke provisions of Pocso Act. The parents of the 15-year-old boy “divorced” in 2019. “Rather, story narrated in the FIR appears to be unbelievable as there is no plausible explanation coming forth for delayed FIR and about suppression of fact of divorce being given by the applicant [accused man],” the court said. The court said that despite the woman claiming she was supported by three brothers, there is no explanation for the delayed FIR. “The alleged sexual assault on son in 2011, 2016 etc is reported in 2021. Affection of father for son is sought to be co-related to 2021 incident to invoke provisions of Pocso. Allegations are not supported by medical evidence,” the court said. The high court also said that the man’s relationship with another woman, at this stage, cannot be termed as ‘illegal’ as second marriage under religious laws by which the parties are governed is permissible. “But for bald allegation, no evidence is discovered to substantiate the same.  Apart from above, it is required to be noted that in March 2019, applicant [accused man] claimed to have given talaq to the complainant and it is subsequent thereto old issues are cropped up by the complainant for registration of offence,” the court said. It pointed out that despite getting divorced, the man and woman lived together until March 2020. The man, a public servant, moved high court after a special Pocso court rejected his plea for pre-arrest bail in June. The man’s lawyer, Madhukar Dalvi, submitted that the entire contents of the June 2021 FIR were completely cooked up as afterthought, as the man had already given divorce in March, 2019. Dalvi submitted that the FIR contains allegations which are as old as eight years for which there is no convincing explanation. The estranged couple married in 2001 and have two children. The woman, in her complaint, also accused the man of domestic violence, dowry harassment and having an extra marital affair. It was also claimed that in 2011 and 2021, the touched his son inappropriately. The court, however, said, that “it is required to be noted that grown-up children have never complained about alleged incidents to any other person than the complainant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sex-assaulter-father-granted-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/87725206.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||Nagpur company develops country’s first armed drones for the forces||NAGPUR: Private defence manufacturer Economic Explosives Limited (EEL) has developed the first indigenous drones and loitering munition systems. These were showcased before chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who visited the company’s facility here on Monday. EEL has expressed readiness to go ahead with the project and offer it to the armed forces in the coming months. The systems are billed to be better suited to the terrain along all Indian frontiers. EEL has said its product costs would also be substantially lesser than what is being imported by the armed forces at present. The Army at present has similar systems from Israel and Polish sources, independent sources told TOI. Apart from the drones, the company has also developed anti-drone missiles, which can fire a salvo and take on a swarm of drones well before it can strike. User trials are planned in the coming months for different versions of the drone as well as the anti-drone systems, said sources. EEL is a fully owned subsidiary of Solar Industries Limited (SIL) — headed by businessman Satyanarayan Nuwal. A press release by the company said a loitering ammunition is also known as a suicide drone. The munition loiters over a given area and swoops down to strike when the target is located. India has so far been dependent on importing these systems. Solar Group will be the first indigenous company to develop it in-house. The company as developed three versions weighing 1.5kg, 4kg and 10kg, with range of 15, 25 and 100km respectively. During the demonstration, a source explained the drones have a fully indigenous computer system, which can spot a target and capture images. Based on it, the control crew can launch an attack. Two fixed winged planes and a hexacopter have been developed. The first round of user trials are expected to be held in January this year for one of the drones. After that, the drones with the capacity of carrying relatively higher payload would be tested. The systems can be used against enemy personnel as well as assets like bunkers or ammunition dumps. The EEL release said it has developed the anti-drone system, which is capable of soft kill, which means impairment of its system, and also striking it down using micro missiles. This is also the first of its kind in India, said sources. EEL had recently bagged an order to make multimodal hand grenades for the Army. Rawat had come to Nagpur for a visit to the Headquarters Maintenance Command of the Indian Air Force (IAF).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-company-develops-countrys-first-armed-drones-for-the-forces/articleshow/87725217.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Drastic jump in poaching of tigers in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The seizure of one more tiger skin and various other body parts from the Gondpipri forest range under Central Chanda Division on Sunday night just shows the drastic jump in poaching of tigers in Maharashtra. The state has recorded 35 tiger deaths, with half (17) of the deaths due to poaching, in the last 10 months. A comparison of the figures of last five years from the database by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), which works with local communities and government agencies to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade across the country, reveals that Maharashtra tops in tiger poaching over the two top tiger bearing states — Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. In 2021, even as MP recorded 39 tiger deaths, including 11 by poaching, Maharashtra tops the chart with poaching of 17 tigers followed by Karnataka, where 17 tigers have died including 4 by poaching. Even in the case of leopards, Maharashtra is on top. Since January 1, 2021, 165 leopards have died. This includes 24 due to poaching and 141 due to other reasons. As per the forest department, 153 leopards have died in the last 10 months in the state. Of this, 61 died in road hits. As per the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018, Maharashtra has 312 tigers. Even as tiger numbers have increased from 190 in 2014 to 312 now, poaching too has gone up. A comparison of the figures of last five years shows in 2017, 22 tiger deaths were reported with 7 poaching cases. In 2021, 35 tigers have died. The poaching and seizure cases have more than doubled to 17. The state forest department figures till November 12, 2021, reveal that 26 tigers have died this year including 8 by poaching. However, the figures don’t include the seizure of body parts since July this year, wherein 58 accused with tiger body parts and bones were arrested by the Nagpur forest division officials. “The seizure involves killing of at least 7 tigers from the region. All the 58 accused have been remanded to magisterial custody (MCR) and investigations are still on,” senior forest officials told TOI. If this figure of 7 tigers is added to the state figure of 26, then the number of tiger deaths comes close to the WPSI database. Nitin Desai, Central India director of WPSI, says, “The way the tiger skin seized in Gondpipri has been skinned, it appears to be a handiwork of local poachers. Organized tiger poaching was effectively stopped due to widespread enforcement actions in 2013.” “This led to a boom in tiger population in Central India. Apart from their historic ranges, tigers are appearing at unbelievable places. They often get killed in electric traps or wire snares set up by local poachers to kill herbivores for bushmeat. It is exactly for this reason that all local poachers must be dealt with strongly or we will keep counting such dead tigers,” Desai said. “A quick look at the statistics reveals that there is a drastic increase in cases of local tiger poaching/seizure of tiger parts in 2021 as compared to the previous four years. It needs to be investigated if local poachers were desperate for money and tried to sell tiger parts, or they were being instigated by someone to do so,” he adds. “Similarly, leopard mortality has gone up drastically in the last three years. The committee on leopard deaths has made some recommendations and the same is being implemented. Only time will tell if they yield any positive result,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drastic-jump-in-poaching-of-tigers-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87725105.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

On November 12, the Bombay high court gave the petrol pump owners in Nashik a week’s time to answer to the show-cause notices issued by the police commissioner. Pandey had issued show-cause notices to three petrol pumps in Panchavati when they were found violating the ‘no helmet, no petrol rule’ at the petrol pumps from August 15. The court has also ordered the police commissioner to pass a speaking order within a week’s time after the hearing of the petrol pump owners. The HC has further stated that no coercive action will be taken against the petrol pump owners for one week from the date of order passed by the police commissioner. Pandey confirmed the orders issued by the court In case the owners are aggrieved by the order, they can approach the appropriate authority or court. Senior office bearers of the petrol dealers’ association told TOI that they would soon be going to the police commissioner to respond to the notices. Ahead of the implementation of the ‘no helmet, no petrol’ rule, Pandey had issued the order for the same and had also held a meeting with petrol pump owners. After the rule was implemented, the police had found that three petrol pump owners were selling fuel even to bikers not wearing helmets. The police had issued them show-cause notices asking why the no objection certificates (NoCs) issued to them by the police should not be cancelled. The petrol dealers association had moved the high court for its intervention into the matter. On November 12, the court gave the association a week’s time to answer to the show-cause notices. Pandey said. “The police want all petrol pump owners in the city to adhere to the no helmet, no petrol rule.” Members of the association of petrol dealers, on the condition of anonymity, said they all were bound to follow all rules, but there were certain difficulties in following the orders like not letting bikers without helmets enter the premises, getting the form filled about why a biker is not wearing the helmet, etc for which they had approached the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hc-sets-deadline-for-nashik-petrol-pump-dealers-to-respond-to-show-cause-notices/articleshow/87722827.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Coimbatore||Agri dept launches drive to make farmers plant trees||Coimbatore: The green cover of the district may increase in the next few years as the agriculture department has launched a drive to get farmers to plant tree saplings and nurture them. The agriculture department has ordered 3.43 lakh tree saplings for Coimbatore under a scheme called Tamil Nadu Mission on Sustainable Green Cover in Farm Lands. While distribution of tree saplings will start in a week, officials are planning to finish it in a month as conditions are conducive for plantation with the state receiving heavy rainfall recently. The main aim of the scheme is not only to increase the tree cover of the state but also the income of farmers. R Chithra Devi, joint director of agriculture, Coimbatore district, said the agriculture department has placed the orders for the saplings with the forest department. “Farmers have to register through the Uzhavan app and can receive the saplings from the designated nurseries free of cost. Small and micro farmers, women farmers and farmers from scheduled caste and scheduled tribe will be given preference,” she said. Timber value species like teak, red sandal, acacia, vengai, sandal, manjal kadambu, rosewood, malai vembu (Melia dubia), mahagony, karumaruthu, poovarasu as well as medicinal value trees such as neem, pungan, tamarind, maruthamaram, thandrikkai, thoobamaram, Indian gooseberry, murungal maram, chinnamon, manila tamarind and vilvam will be distributed. Agriculture officials said farmers will receive Rs 7 per tree for each year as incentives for three years between the second and the fourth year. Farmers will get 50 saplings for one acre if they plant them in bunds, whereas those farmers who want to take up tree cultivation in farm fields will get 160 saplings per acre.

According to the data of the city police, by the end of September this year, the police had registered 327 cases of vehicle theft. It comes to more than one vehicle getting stolen from the city every day. By August-end, the police had registered 269 vehicle thefts, which means that during September, 58 vehicles were stolen from the city. Even on Sunday, three vehicles were stolen from different parts of the city and the day before that, four vehicles were stolen at different police stations. Meanwhile, of the total 327 vehicles that were reported stolen, only 44 have been detected this year, resulting in the detection rate of 13%. Senior police officials said that detecting vehicle thefts becomes a challenge as the burglar has not been seen by anyone. Vehicle thieves commit the crime easily as they find them parked unguarded all over the city. Nonetheless, the police are always working to get information about vehicle thieves so that they can be traced and arrested. Vehicle thieves generally steal bikes and sell them off at cheap prices in the rural areas. When the buyers ask for documents, the burglars tell them that they would take the remaining amount of the deal after bringing the documents. However, on selling the bikes on the part payment of the deal, the burglars never return to the buyers since they do not have the documents of the stolen vehicles. ACP (Crime) Vasant More said, “The police are continuously putting in sincere efforts to detect all cases, including those of vehicle thefts. Citizens on their part should also ensure that they park their vehicles in secure places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/327-vehicles-stolen-in-nashik-till-september-end-this-year/articleshow/87722846.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: First of 2 board exams for CBSE Class 12 from today||MUMBAI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will hold its first of two board exams from Tuesday for class XII students for ‘minor’ subjects. CBSE schools successfully did a dry run on Monday. Class X students begin their exam Wednesday. School heads said no complaints were received from centres during Monday’s dry run. This academic year CBSE decided to have two board exams. The 90-minute objective-type question papers will be answered on OMR sheets — each question has multiple choices; the right answer has to be marked. The exam will cover 50% of the syllabus. The second board exam will be in March-April in offline or online mode, depending on the Covid situation. During Monday’s dry run, schools printed dummy question papers. Students were allotted exam centres. Each class will have 12 students. Question papers will be given to students at 11am and they will get 20 minutes to read it. At 11.20am, the OMR sheets will be distributed to students. Question papers will reach centres via email by 9.30am. Schools did a trial to know how many copies of the question paper can be printed before it is handed over to students at 11am. Students too have undergone practice sessions on using the OMR sheets for the first time. “The OMR sheets have been designed to avoid malpractices by students and teachers too,” said a principal. A student, after circling one of the four answer choices (a,b,c,d), has to write the circled alphabet in another box. The alphabet written in the box will be treated as the answer to be assessed. In case a student does not attempt a question, that too needs to be mentioned in the box provided for that. “This way, even the examiner will not be able to manipulate answers,” explained a principal. Five sets of a question paper will be given in each class to avoid malpractice by way of sign language, said a principal. Invigilators and students must wear masks. Each centre will have an external observer. Differently abled pupils will get 20 minutes extra after the exam ends at 1 pm for others. Schools must upload OMR sheets by 5 pm the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-first-of-2-board-exams-for-cbse-class-12-from-today/articleshow/87725221.cms||Sandhya Nair

A five-member delegation of the state IMA unit visited Ahmednagar on Monday and met the doctors and nurses of the civil hospital, officials involved in the investigation and the lawyers of the arrested doctors and nurses. Talking to TOI, Dr Mangesh Pate, member of the team and national secretary of IMA Hospital Board of India (HBI), said that there is great anguish among members of IMA following the arrest of the doctor and the nurses. “If the authorities do not take measures for the release of those arrested, then IMA would be forced to start a strike. We want justice for the arrested doctor and the nurses,” said Pate. He added that the IMA is pained by the deaths of the 11 Covid patients. “We are also anguished by the manner in which the doctor and the nurses were made soft targets in the incident. Our feedback is that the medical fraternity of the civil hospital and the para medical staff did everything to save the lives of those admitted in the ICU and also helped in preventing the spread of the fire. Had the medical oxygen tank at the hospital caught fire, the consequences would have been more disastrous,” added Pate. In the meantime, the doctors and nurses of the civil hospital are continuing with their agitation due to which the OPD services remain affected. They are rendering emergency services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/release-arrested-doc-nurses-of-ahmednagar-civil-hosp-ima/articleshow/87722848.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Bard of Chhatrapati Shivaji bows out, leaves his mark on Maratha history||Pune: Babasaheb Purandare lived for and breathed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His 10-volume Shivcharitra Raja ShivChhatrapati, thousands of lectures, and the epic play ‘Jaanta Raja’ not only took the illustrious life and battles of the Maratha king to every household in Maharashtra and beyond, but also embedded the mighty warrior’s memory further in the conscience of the people. Purandare, an eminent history scholar, died at 5.07 am on Monday in a Pune hospital of age-related pneumonia. He was 99. His last rites were performed with state honours. For seven decades, Purandare was a ‘Shivshahir’ or bard of Shivaji Maharaj. He trekked to hundreds of forts the Maratha king had conquered, visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji and meticulously preserved every little piece with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent story-teller and narrator, an author, playwright and novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to common citizens in easy-to-understand but vivid language and did not lose sight of the fact that historical research was a science. Renowned humorist P L Deshpande captured the essence of Purandare's commitment to his passion in his pen sketch in the book ‘Gangoat.’ Deshpande appreciated Purandare's command over details which ensured history did not get disconnected from the present. “He reads literature with equal interest. He can watch a Hindi film, listen to Radio Ceylon, attend classical music concerts and knows the score of a cricket match. While trekking to forts he takes equal interest in the birds that nest there or flowers that bloom,” Deshpande wrote. Purandare was so immersed in the life of Shivaji Maharaj that he could almost see events from the king’s life unfold while commuting on Pune’s roads. Deshpande recalled one such instance. He wrote, “We were travelling in a car on the road below the Nava Pul and going towards Sambhaji Park. When we passed the Rokdoba temple near Congress Bhavan, Babasaheb told me to stop. ‘See that spot? Shivaji Maharaj's horses had waited there for him. It was April 6, 1663. Maharaj had severed the fingers of Shahiste Khan at Lal Mahal and escaped. He came straight here, took his horse and rode to Sinhagad’,” wrote Deshpande, adding that one had to be prepared to get delayed while travelling with Purandare as he often ended up narrating exciting episodes from the life of the king.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bard-of-chhatrapati-shivaji-bows-out-leaves-his-mark-on-maratha-history/articleshow/87725233.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Delhi||Delhi safe unless there’s new Covid-19 strain: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that unless there was a new strain of novel coronavirus heading towards the city, Delhi appeared to be safe. After European Union ambassador Ugo Astuto called on the chief minister and discussed the handling of Covid-19 in Delhi and the prevailing pollution situation, the government said in a statement that Kejriwal told Astuto that several serological surveys had been conducted in the national capital and the latest survey revealed great results. “We have found out that 96 per cent of the people of Delhi have developed antibodies to fight the existing strains of Covid-19. So, at a layman level, unless there’s a new strain of the coronavirus heading towards us, Delhi appears to be safe,” Kejriwal said. “This also means that of this 96 per cent, there would have been quite a few people who would’ve caught the virus, but were not consciously aware of it because of its mild or asymptomatic nature,” he added. The chief minister also told the ambassador that the Delhi government was constantly monitoring the cases as well as the trends of Covid-19 and keeping an eye out for any situation where the graphs might seem to increase. “We have been actively working upon our vaccination programme as well. The seriousness that we’ve shown to raise awareness and vaccinate our population has contributed significantly in keeping Covid-19 at bay,” he said, adding that about 50 per cent of Delhi’s eligible population had been fully vaccinated and about 90 per cent had received at least one dose. According to the statement, the chief minister was keen to understand Europe’s experience with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases and asked the ambassador for his inputs in protecting Delhi from a similar scenario. The ambassador replied that it largely depended on the rate of vaccination and ideally it should be easier to handle when most of the population had taken the jab, the statement added. Kejriwal also apprised the ambassador of the Delhi government’s efforts towards controlling pollution throughout the year. He said about 5,000 to 6,000 industrial units of Delhi were made to switch to green fuel in the form of PNG. “We have tied up with IIT-Kanpur to develop a real-time pollution identification mechanism that will help us know what source is causing pollution at what point of time, so we can take immediate action over that information and put curbs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-safe-unless-theres-new-corona-strain-cm/articleshow/87725228.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Void in history and culture after Babasaheb Purandare, says PM Narendra Modi||PUNE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi led people from all walks of life in paying a wealth of tribute to eminent history scholar Babasaheb Purandare who passed away on Monday in Pune of old age. “I am pained beyond words. The demise of Shivshahir Babasaheb Purandare leaves a major void in the world of history and culture,” the Prime Minister said in his tweet. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “A constant adoration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj has remained the source of energy for Babasaheb. No other worshipper of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj like Babasaheb Purandare could be found in the globe. He tried to reach each and every place, where Maharaj had gone. Creating true followers of Maharaj in each household was the mission of Babasaheb.” Veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar said, “I am really shocked by the news of Shivbhakt Babasaheb Purandare’s demise. He took the remarkable works of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to household through his writings of ‘Shivcharitra’. ” Purandare was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital for old age-related pneumonia and was undergoing aggressive treatment, treating doctors said. He is survived by two sons, a daughter and grandchildren. The mortal remains were kept at his house in Parvati areas for people to pay their respects. The last rites were performed at Vaikuntha crematorium with full state honours. Hundreds of followers, including the who’s who of the cultural, social, political and other fields, were present at crematorium. Moreshwar Balwant alias Babasaheb was born on July 29, 1922 at Saswad near Pune. He was passionate about studying and writing on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from childhood. His early writings were complied in the form a book, called ‘Thinagya’ (Sparks). He was honoured with the state’s highest civilian honour, ‘Maharashtra Bhushan’ in 2015, and is a recipient of the country’s second highest civilian award Padma Vibhushan in 2019. Popularly known as ‘Shivshahir’ (bard of Shivaji), Purandare has delivered more than 12,000 lectures on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his valour in the last eight decades. He was seen as an expert and an authority on the history of the Maratha empire, forts built by its warriors, battles fought and works of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He penned and directed the grand historical play Janata Raja in 1985 based on the life and times of his idol. It is a theatrical performance with over 200 artistes, horses and camels and dazzling sets. It has been translated and enacted in different languages. The shows were conducted in India and abroad. Among his scholarly works are Raja Shivchhatrapati, Janata Raja, Maharaj, Shelarkhind, Gadkot Kille, Agra, Lal Mahal, Purandar, Rajgad, Panhalgad, Sinhagad, Pratapgad, Purandaryanchi Daulat, Mujaryache Mankari, Fulwanti, Savitri and Kalawantinicha Sajja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/void-in-history-culture-after-purandare-says-pm/articleshow/87724310.cms||Umesh Isalkar

DDA is set to launch a new scheme next month and on offer will be around 15,000 flats, according to officials. “Although this scheme will not have new flats, applicants will be able to buy flats at rates going back to even 2014,” an official said, adding that the decision had been taken keeping in view Covid-19. The proposal to launch the scheme was to be brought before the authority in its meeting, which was to be chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, but it has been postponed, sources said. In 2014, DDA offered around 25,000 flats, with prices ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore. The price range remained similar in 2017 for 12,000 flats. The next housing scheme in 2019 saw the price ranging between more than Rs 10 lakh for one-bedroom flats in Narela and Rs 1.7 crore for a three-bedroom flat in Vasant Kunj. However, out of the more than 8,400 allotted flats, around 3,000, mostly one-bedroom ones in Narela, were surrendered in a month. The last housing scheme DDA launched was on January 2, 2021 and saw 22,752 applications for the 1,354 flats on offer. The draw of lots was held on March 10 for the 253 mostly three-bedroom flats, 757 two-bedroom, 52 one-bedroom and 291 EWS/Janta flats in areas like Dwarka, Jasola, Vasant Kunj etc. Sources said the new scheme would offer flats in Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Jasola, Narela etc. The bulk of the flats will be one-bedroom or those for the EWS category in Narela, they added. A large number of DDA flats are in different stages of construction, including premium three-bedroom flats and penthouses in Dwarka, but they won’t be offered this time. DDA wants to offer these flats only after the real estate sector witnesses better growth in the near future, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddas-new-housing-scheme-will-offer-flats-at-old-rates/articleshow/87725243.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Pune||Lack of info on availability of guides: PhD candidates||PUNE: Candidates desirous of pursuing doctorate degrees from the Savitribai Phule Pune University have blamed lack of information on availability of PhD guides for various departments for delay in their admission to doctoral programmes. The university recently introduced revised guidelines for admission to PhD courses and based on these, the requirement for PhD guides has also changed. The entrance test for admission to doctoral programmes was conducted recently and results announced, but students are still awaiting allotment of PhD guides. A candidate, who cleared the entrance, said, “Department representatives have still not provided the data regarding the number of guides required under various categories to the admission cell of the university. This has led to delay in admissions and students are suffering due to it.” The entrance exam for PhD programmes was conducted in September for all the departments of Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune division, and also for the research units at its affiliated institutions in Ahmednagar and Nashik. Subsequently, the results were also declared. However, the university has so far not compiled information regarding the guides, claimed PhD aspirants. Prafulla Pawar, registrar, Savitribai Phule Pune University, said, “The university has set up a committee to find a balance between the number of students who have cleared the PhD entrance examination and the available guides. The committee will study the revised guidelines for PhD admission and study the number of reserved category students clearing the exam to strike a balance.” The University Grants Commission has already issued guidelines regarding PhD admissions and the committee will follow the norms. The state higher and technical education department has sought a proposal from the Savitribai Phule Pune University regarding new aspirants who are willing to be guides to PhD students. This will ease pressure on existing guides and give students a chance to select the perfect guide for their thesis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lack-of-info-on-availability-of-guides-phd-candidates/articleshow/87724320.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The activity, which had evoked good public response in past, was halted due to the pandemic more than one-and-a-half years ago. On Monday, historian Dulari Qureshi said Covid-appropriate behaviour was mandatory for those participating in the proposed heritage walk. “The heritage walks conducted so far have covered different monuments and historically important locations in and around Aurangabad. We are glad to resume the initiative, which is spreading awareness on city’s heritage. This, in turn, can be helpful in conservation efforts,” she said. Qureshi said the Daulatabad fort is more popularly known as the ‘invincible fort’ due to its powerful defence techniques. “Historically the fort was founded by the Yadava dynasty’s Bhillama V, in 1187. The fort was later conquered and ruled by different dynasties. Geographically, the fort is very strategic and tactical,” she said. The upcoming heritage walk will start at 8 am and all participants are required to assemble near the ticket counter of the Daultabad fort. Participants need to carry drinking water and food with them. Organisers, including Rafat Qureshi, Aniket Joshi, Swapnil Joshi, Sanket Kulkarni, Aditya Waghmare, Latif Sheikh, Shrikant Umrikar, Kamaji Dak, Kiran Vangujar and Sanjay Paikrao have invited all heritage lovers to join the walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/heritage-walk-to-resume-to-cover-daulatabad-fort/articleshow/87723597.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik Municipal Corporation to hire 500 temporary staff on honorarium basis||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) — reeling under severe manpower crunch that, in turn, is impacting its normal functioning — has decided to recruit over 500 temporary staff on honorarium basis for a period of 11 months. A proposal to this regard will be tabled in the general body meeting of the NMC on Wednesday. Mayor Satish Kulkarni said there is a need for around 350 employees in the property and water tax departments, but currently only 110 staffers are working in these two departments that are involved in collecting revenue for the civic body. “Both property and water tax dues are totally estimated at over Rs 500 crore. The revenue of the civic body through property and water taxes has already been affected due to the pandemic, and inadequate workforce is adding to the problem,” Kulkarni said. “The recruitment of temporary staff will help the NMC increase the property and water tax collection to some extent and the pressure on the existing manpower will also reduce. From sanitation workers to engineers all will be recruited on honorarium basis,” he added. Over 2,000 posts are vacant in various departments of the NMC and around 40 employees and officials are getting retired every month. “Hence, existing staff is under tremendous pressure and it is affecting their health,” he said. “The NMC could not recruit on vacant posts earlier as administrative cost was over 35%. Hence, the civic body is mulling to recruit temporary manpower on honorarium basis,” he added. The fire brigade department is also facing a severe workforce crunch. According to the fire department, the NMC has 151 government-approved posts of firemen, of which, 58 are vacant. Moreover, the civic body has 15 government-approved posts of fire officers of which 11 are vacant. The situation is similar to the other departments of the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-hire-500-temporary-staff-on-honorarium-basis/articleshow/87722869.cms||Tushar Pawar

They can also earn minor degrees in other branches by getting 18 credits in them. This was decided in a recent academic council meeting of Anna University. “If students get high grades till fourth semester in BE, BTech programmes, they will be allowed to select specialised courses in ME or MTech degree programmes. If they clear six specialised courses in a related field or get 18 extra credits, they will be awarded with honours degree,” Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj told TOI. If a mechanical engineering student or civil engineering student completes six courses in artificial intelligence or machine learning, he or she will get a BE mechanical engineering degree with a minor in artificial intelligence or machine learning, he added. The university is also thinking about implementing it for the second year students after making necessary changes in the regulations. As per the 2021 regulations of Anna University, a student needs to secure a minimum 160 credits to get BE or BTech degree. Colleges welcomed the move saying it would increase placement opportunities. B Chidambararajan, principal of SRM Valliammai Engineering College, said, companies are expecting interdisciplinary skills among students with the emergence of newer technologies such as IoT. “In the present trend, a mechanical student should know about programming to improve his chances to get placement. So, interdisciplinary courses are the need of the hour and it is a welcome move by the university,” he said. P Deiva Sundari, principal of KCG College of Technology, said, the move to introduce interdisciplinary degree (minor degree) will improve admissions in core engineering branches. “An honours degree will encourage students to specialise in any particular area in their relevant field. For example, a computer science degree student can specialise in full stag or data science,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/clear-six-addl-courses-get-honours-in-engg/articleshow/87725238.cms||---

The counsel for the association made the submission before Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil in response to the pleas moved by Ansals challenging the jail term awarded to them by a magisterial court on November 8. Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for the association, told the court that the offence of tampering was extremely serious in nature as it affects the entire criminal justice system. “It is direct interference in the administration of justice and thus requires serious consideration,” he said.

The fair began on November 13 and went on till Sunday evening. During the two-day long event, better turnout was noticed on Sunday. Officials said 4,500 candidates visited the fair on Sunday whereas on Saturday 3,300 youths had attended it. Chief executive officer of the authority Ritu Maheshwari said that the Noida authority acted as the nodal agency on behalf of all the three industrial development authorities to hold the job fair. “The employers have been asked to give preference to the local candidates. The response has been encouraging and children of farmers who gave up their land for the development of the city in Noida and Greater Noida will be accorded priority according to their skillset,” Maheshwari said. ‘ Residents said that the authority should also focus on monitoring the outcome of the employment fair. “Though authority may term the response of 7,800 candidates to the job fair as its achievement. It also shows how many youths are desperate to find jobs in the most industrialised part of Uttar Pradesh. Also they need to update the residents with the results,” said Alok Singh, a Greater Noida resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/job-fair-sees-good-response-over-7k-applicants-show-interest/articleshow/87725934.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Declare Panje wetland as ‘bird sanctuary’: Bombay HC issues notice||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday issued a notice to the Maharashtra coastal zone management, national and state wildlife boards and others on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed to declare Panje as a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Act. The PIL filed by environmental NGOVanashakti and its Project director Stalin Dayanand, argued by advocate Zaman Ali, sought directions from the high court to declare “Panje-Dongri Wetlands” as a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 “on account of a scientifically conclusive fact that Panje wetlands is a unique bird habitat that supports a quarter of a million birds that belong to more than a hundred distinct migratory species and provides important ecosystem services, as recommended by internationally renowned scientific organisations...” The PIL said, “If Panje-Dongri wetlands are not protected, migratory birds will pose an extreme high-security risk to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport.”s The PIL also made the central government, through the ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, additional principal chief conservator of forests as parties. The PIL said that in 2015 Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) recorded more than one lakh birds in the winter at Panje wetlands and in 2019 an expert study suggested that wetlands of Panje be declared a bird sanctuary too due to its unique bird habitat. In February, the NGO said it wrote to the secretary of forest department to make a declaration saying Panje-Dongri wetlands holds intrinsic ecological value for Uran and acts as an important bird habitat as it’s a roosting site for more than 100 migratory bird species and a habitat for protected species. The matter is slated to be heard on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/panje-wetland-as-bird-sanctuary-bombay-hc-issues-notice/articleshow/87725265.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan foray: Owaisi's AIMIM takes another step towards going national||JAIPUR/HYDERABAD: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has announced its decision to foray into yet another state – Rajasthan – taking its journey towards becoming a pan-India party forward. AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said the Rajasthan unit would be launched within two months and it would contest the next assembly polls. The state will have assembly polls on its 200 seats in November-December 2023. AIMIM, which was confined to the Old City of Hyderabad and Telangana for decades, has been striving to expand its base in the country for the past few years and has tasted some success too. In addition to having seven MLAs and an MP from Telangana, AIMIM has opened its account in assembly polls in Maharashtra and Bihar. It won an MP seat too from Aurangabad, five MLA seats in Bihar and a number of seats in the urban local bodies of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh besides Telangana. Though it failed to open its account in the recent elections to Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the Owaisi-led party is eyeing state assemblies in UP, Gujarat, MP and Karnataka. Owaisi, during his day-long visit to Jaipur, told reporters, “We hope to receive support from across the state. Rajasthan is subjected to loot and misgovernance by both Congress and the BJP, which has created scope for a third force.” Raising the issue of ‘mistreatment’ of Muslims in Rajasthan, he said, “The ruling Congress has stopped all communication with Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of the voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying core issues concerning them.” Criticising Congress Muslim MLAs in the state, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, these legislators are mere ‘showpieces.’ “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” said the AIMIM chief. This is the second visit of Owaisi to Jaipur in the past 50 days, during which he is attempting to grab some space in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of the voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party will contest but has hinted that it will cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 seats where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-foray-mim-takes-another-step-towards-going-national/articleshow/87728349.cms||---

However, these were not made part of CAG’s final report based on clarifications given by the government in the exit interview, it is learnt. The Congress-led opposition alleged that the state government had hidden this “special report” of CAG against KIIFB from the public. “The state government should clarify why this report was not made public till date. There are serious allegations against KIIFB in this audit report,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. “Besides the report tabled in the assembly, this special report was handed over to the government at the same time. But it was kept as a secret and now it has come out through Right to Information Act. It has listed out all the backdoor appointments being made there and unnecessary expenses being done at KIIFB,” said Satheesan. The government should conduct a detailed probe into the allegations reported in the audit report since the fund mobilized by KIIFB is public money from the motor vehicle tax and fuel cess, he said. CAG, in its initial audit, had raised several queries which included the non-recovery of Rs 31.86 crore, expenses incurred for pravasi chitty, from KSFE. It said KIIFB expended Rs 18.56 crore towards the development of software and technological components for the pravasi chitty and Rs 13.3 crore in connection with the various programmes arranged for its publicity. Due to this, Rs 31.86 crore spent by KIIFB for pravasi chitty remained unrecovered. It had also raised lack of transparency in the appointment of chief project examiner in KIIFB. Violation of government guidelines in contractual appointments, leading to non-adherence to reservation norms, was also raised by CAG in the preliminary audit. It had said that the creation and appointment of posts in KIIFB are without government approval or orders. Enhancing the pay of the official after appointing for a consolidated pay is in violation of the conditions prescribed in the recruitment order, it added. It further said that appointments were made to non-existent posts on the pretext of a recruitment procedure to one existing post and another non-existing post to accommodate certain persons. Irregular payment of allowances and other benefits to employees, including stipends to internees, were found without government approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-targets-govt-over-cags-queries-on-kiifb-anomalies/articleshow/87724358.cms||---

All of them were later released on bail. Police have so far booked 14,673 people in connection with the November 12 rally by Raza Academy to protest alleged atrocities against Muslims in Tripura and the violence that erupted the following day during the bandh called by BJP and other organizations. Sources said Raza Academy had not sought permission to take out the protest march to the collectorate on November 12. While 8,364 people have been booked and nine of them arrested for the violence caused during Raza Academy's march, police have booked 6,309 and arrested 53 of them for causing damage to government and private property during the retaliatory bandh on November 13. A press release by police commissionerate said nine cops, including an officer, were injured in stone-pelting by purported members of the BJP and other organizations. The release said squads have been formed to arrest those booked. Dr Bonde, who was detained at Nandgaon Khandeshwar on Sunday and released later, was arrested from his residence on Monday morning, while other BJP leaders including Chaudhary, Gawande, Kulkarni, AMC House leader Tushar Bharatiya, AMC’s former standing committee chairperson Radha Kuril, corporators Surekha Lungare and Ajay Samdekar, ex-corporator Sanjay Agrawal, party office-bearers Gajanan Deshmukh and Mangesh Khode, VHP’s Santosh Gaharwar and Nilesh Marodkar surrendered before the police in the day. Though police were also on the lookout of MLC Pravin Pote, he has reportedly escaped to Mumbai, it is learnt. Police said property worth Rs 5.15 lakh was damaged during the violence on November 12. Meanwhile, curfew was relaxed for two hours between 2pm and 4pm on Monday, but citizens could not avail of this relaxation as no attempt was made by the administration to convey this to them. Internet services continued to be snapped for the second day on Monday. Amravati CP Aarti Singh told TOI that the situation was being reviewed and final call on the curfew would be taken only after instructions from the home ministry. According to police, on November 12, Raza Academy and several other Muslim organizations in Amravati had submitted a memorandum to the collector against violence in Tripura last month. BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal and other right-wing organizations had called for a bandh the next day and gathered at Rajkamal Chowk for the protest. Later, a mob went on a rampage in nearby Muslim-dominated areas like Itwara Bazaar and Namuna, pelting stones on shops and damaging properties. Following this, police had resorted to lathi-charge and firing teargas shells to disperse the protesters. Later, the police had imposed Section 144 in the city for four days. Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said in Mumbai he will visit violence-hit Amaravati on November 17. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane alleged that Raza Academy was behind the violence in different parts of the state. He alleged, “Raza Academy is a terrorist organization and its founders stay in Afghanistan and follow Taliban ideology. They don’t do any social work and had also opposed revocation of triple talaq.” Rane said, “The state government should arrest all senior leaders of Raza Academy. If any violence happens against Hindus, we will not tolerate.” “Raza Academy had organized a march on November 12 against Tripura violence. I have the pamphlets that they had distributed. I challenge the Academy to show evidence of Hindus burning down masjid in Tripura. Burning of masjid by Hindus was fake news.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amravati-violence-maha-ex-min-bonde-13-others-arrested-let-off-on-bail/articleshow/87725224.cms||---

Students and teachers will have to follow the other guidelines as well, including washing or sanitising of hands before entering classrooms, keeping all doors and windows of classrooms and staff rooms open for proper ventilation, not sharing food and stationery and maintaining social distancing. Ready to step into the campuses after a gap of 20 months, colleges and universities have drafted health and safety protocols for both students as well as staff. At St Xavier’s College, nobody will be able to enter the campus without a mask. Students must either wash or sanitise their hands before entering classrooms. Teachers and students will have to carry their college IDs and all Covid-appropriate measures have to be followed in the canteen and library. “We have issued detailed health and safety guidelines and everybody must follow it,” said Father Dr Dominic Savio, principal at St Xavier’s College. At Maulana Azad College, the authorities have put up posters everywhere on the dos and don’ts to be followed on the premises. “Temperature of everyone stepping into the campus will be checked at the gate. All must wear their masks when inside the college. We have put up banners and posters on the campus, reminding students to follow the safety guidelines. They will be discouraged from huddling, sharing food or crowding in the library, lobby or classrooms,” said Maulana principal Subhasis Dutta.

---||Pune||When Purandare spoke, he brought Shivaji Maharaj to life before the audience||PUNE: Babasaheb Purandare lived for and breathed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His 10-volume Shivcharitra Raja Shivchhatrapati, thousands of lectures and the epic play Janata Raja not only took the illustrious life and battles of valour of the Maratha king to every household in Maharashtra and beyond, but also infused the ideals of the mighty warrior in the very conscience of the people. Purandare, an eminent history scholar, passed away at 5.07am in a Pune hospital of old-age related pneumonia on Monday. He was 99. The last rites were performed at Vaikunth crematorium with state honours. For more than seven decades, Purandare was a Shivaji Maharaj bard (Shivshahir). But his words were grounded in solid proof and facts. He had trekked to hundreds of forts that the Maratha king had conquered and had visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji Maharaj. He meticulously preserved every little acquisition with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent story-teller and narrator, an author, a playwright and a novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Renowned humorist P L Deshpande captured the essence of Purandare’s greatness in his pen sketch in the book ‘Gangoat’. Deshpande wrote: Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to the most common people in an easy-to-understand and vivid language, but he never lost sight of the fact that history research is a science. He displayed the openness of mind to study new material and incorporate it in his writings provided it was based on facts and solid proof, he said. Deshpande was appreciative of Purandare’s command over details which ensured that history did not get disconnected from the present. “He reads literature with equal interest. He can watch a Hindi film, listen to Radio Ceylon, attend classical music concerts and knows the score of a cricket match. While trekking to forts, he takes equal interest in the birds that nest there or the flowers that bloom,” Deshpande wrote. Purandare was so immersed in the life of Shivaji Maharaj that he could almost see some of the events from his life unfold while commuting on Pune’s roads. Deshpande recalled one such instance in his pen sketch: “We were travelling in a car on the road below the Nava Pul and going towards Sambhaji Park. When we passed the Rokdoba temple near Congress Bhavan, Babasaheb told me to stop. ‘See that spot? Shivaji Maharaj's horses had waited there for him. It was April 6, 1663. Maharaj had severed the fingers of Shahiste Khan at Lal Mahal and escaped. He came straight here, took his horse and rode to Sinhagad’,” wrote Deshpande, adding that one had to be prepared to get delayed while travelling with Purandare as he often ended up narrating some exciting episodes from the life of the king he adored. Purandare leaves behind a wealth of unparalleled work on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

She suffered injuries while resisting the attack. The incident exposed the poor security near the park. Ironically, no one witnessed the assault. Actress Shalu Chaourasiya went to KBR Park for an evening walk around 6.30pm, Banjara Hills police said. Around 8.30pm, when she was walking on the outer track and reached a location, opposite a popular coffee shop on Road No. 93, Jubilee Hills, a miscreant came from the rear and pulled her aside. Lighting at the location was poor. “After pulling me, he stuffed a cloth into my mouth. Later, he pushed me against a rock and banged my head thrice. Then, he threw me to the ground, stomped and hit me,’‘ Chaourasiya told police. The culprit then grabbed a big stone and tried to hit her. “That is when I pushed him aside and jumped on to the other side and saved myself. He asked for money and gold ornaments. When I did not give in, he tried to kill me. He was saying, I’m not going to leave you alive,’’ she said in her complaint. He dragged the actress on the ground for some distance, continuously beating and kicking the victim. He then snatched her phone and fled from the spot. She suffered injuries to her head and legs. He also even punched her in the face resulting in injuries to her lips too. Later, she called ‘Dial 100’ with the help of a passer-by and police reached the spot. When they verified nearby CCTV cameras, they found that they were not working. Police are now relying on CCTV footage of nearby establishments besides tracking the location of the victim’s phone to nab the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/actor-assaulted-at-kbr-park-phone-snatched/articleshow/87725955.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Nearly 50% drop in number of critical patients in Maharashtra||PUNE: With a consistent drop in fresh Covid infections, the number critical patients in the state has reduced by nearly half, from 5,048 last month to 2783 till November 8, as per public health department data. There were just 1,132 Covid patients in intensive care units across Maharashtra, the data further showed. Nineteen districts in Maharashtra are reporting fewer than 50 active cases, with nine districts reporting a single-digit caseload, the health department data till November 15 showed. Covid task force members said that the state appears to be slowly moving towards an endemic stage, though they satded it was too early to say for sure. “Critical patients, meaning those in need of oxygen support, are reducing significantly. The number has dropped even in terms of daily critical patients being reported at hospitals. Though the percentage of critical patients among total active patients is the same, the absolute numbers of severe infections have fallen considerably, and Covid-19 vaccination seems to have played a major role in this reduction,” a state public health department official said. The official added, “The main purpose of the vaccination is not a reduction in reinfection, but a reduction in severe Covid cases/critical admissions and therefore, mortalities — a trend seen post-vaccination.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force told TOI, “We are slowly and surely moving towards endemicity, though it is too early to say we are there. Maharashtra must wait for another two weeks for the Diwali-effect on Covid cases to become apparent. If there is no significant surge in cases by the month-end and, depending on how fast we can vaccinate the rest of the population, the state could quickly move towards achieving Covid endemicity. But all this will depend on the emergence of a new variant” Pandit said another seven to 14 days will have to elapse for any festival-related surge in Covid cases to show. “Reduction in Covid mortalities and single-digit active cases in several districts is, however, indicative of the pandemic being under control with low test positivity rates in various districts. Some districts have had active cases in single digits for weeks now, which is significant,” Pandit said. Around mid-September, at least 14 districts in Maharashtra had an active Covid caseload of below 50, while seven of these had active cases in single digits. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “The number of Covid patients being admitted at the hospital is six currently. The single digit Covid admission trend has persisted for four weeks now. There have hardly been any Covid mortalities at our hospital in the last two months, a trend indicative from zero Covid deaths in Pune city for some days recently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nearly-50-drop-in-number-of-critical-patients-in-state/articleshow/87727371.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Pune||Pune: Health department sets sights on 60k shots per day across district||PUNE: The district health office (DHO) is aiming to administer at least 60,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine per day under the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive, with 30,000 being aimed at the rural population and 15,000 each in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. In its action plan, the DHO has identified 241 villages and 16 wards in rural and urban areas of the district which are low performing in vaccine coverage. It has formed around 2,500 teams to achieve its daily target. Pune ZP’s district health officer Bhagwan Pawar told TOI that the drive began last week with teams visiting the low performing villages and households. “The response has been quite dull. We are targeting at least 30,000 shots per day, however, the response is not satisfying. Teams are reporting that unvaccinated beneficiaries do want to get vaccinated now, as the pandemic has eased across the region,” said Pawar. According to Pawar, hesitancy and reluctance to get vaccinated is worrying officials. He said that to convince people about the advantages of getting vaccinated, the health teams are working on large scale awareness drives in the region. “Each team comprises two people and they are visiting every household in the 241 villages which are low performing in terms of vaccination,” he said. Meanwhile, the action plan said only the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is does not have any low performing ward tag. On Monday, the district recorded the vaccination of 45,615 beneficiaries across 647 government and private vaccination sites until 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-department-sets-sights-on-60k-shots-per-day-across-district/articleshow/87724391.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Delhi: 13 days after acid attack by stalker, 26-year-old loses battle of survival||NEW DELHI: After struggling for 13 days, a 26-year-old woman who was attacked with acid in Outer North Delhi’s Bawana area breathed her last on Monday afternoon at RML Hospital. The victim’s husband told TOI that he wants the accused to be hanged till death. “I don’t know how to bring up my children now, or what to tell them. We don’t even have money. I am a daily wage labourer and we live by the day. I did not have money for transportation so I stayed back at the hospital. They said they would give the body on Tuesday,” he said. Two days ago, the woman had lost her eyesight and her kidneys had developed complications as well. On November 3, the woman had sustained severe burn wounds after a man who allegedly wanted to marry her threw acid on her for refusing his marriage proposal. Police arrested the accused, Montu, from Bihar on November 8. He was later taken to Outer North Delhi for recovery of a weapon where he fired at the police party and in retaliation, the team also fired and he was injured. He was known to the victim as he was living in the same neighbourhood in Samaypur Badli. The victim was also from Bihar. The victim’s husband said, “I want my children to study, but we need to have money for that. They have been at my brother’s house since my wife was attacked. Our lives are over now. After her demise, it will be tough to bring the kids up on my own. I want that accused to be hanged now. If my wife is no more, he should also not live”. Doctors treating her earlier said that she suffered damage in her internal organs too. The victim had around 45% third degree burns, mostly on her face, upper torso. The victim had also suffered a lot of blood loss and was transfused blood earlier. Police had earlier also arrested the man who sold the acid to Montu. He was booked under Section 285 of the IPC. Police said he was nabbed after several raids were carried out in parts of Uttar Pradesh. The accused has been identified as Ram Sewak who hails from Shahjahanpur but resides at a rented apartment in Outer Delhi. Sewak had procured the acid from Nangloi and the cops are trying to trace its source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13-days-after-acid-attack-by-stalker-26-year-old-loses-battle-of-survival/articleshow/87725299.cms||Sakshi Chand

There is no reason for violence in here based on what has happened in Tripura,” Pawar told reporters in Nashik. Responding to questions, the NCP chief said he suspected that such violence is being unleashed by vested interests as the assembly elections are due in some states, including Uttar Pradesh. Lauding chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Pawar said the CM is doing a good job and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its term. “The Opposition has predicted the MVA government’s downfall since the day the three-party coalition came to power. I am confident that the MVA will complete its term,” he said. According to him, the state is facing a severe financial crisis and the ongoing ST employees strike is inconveniencing the common people. Pawar said he did not agree with the demand to merge the transport utility with the state government. “The state government and MSRTC representatives should sit down and find a solution to the problems,” he added. Later, he inaugurate the two-day convention of the Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal. Saying that the state’s financial condition was not very good, Pawar added that only the proper demand of the mahamandal would be addressed. Pawar, Bhujbal condole death of Purandare NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal condoled the death of noted historian and author Babasaheb Purandare.

The pandemic is not over – it has popped up again in China, Russia, and Europe. People should seek Covid treatment under the guidance of the health department only. Vaccine is a must, and everyone must get both doses.” The town of Vitthal-Rukhmini temple has witnessed high footfalls of over 5 lakh devotees. The administration put in place all preparations anticipating a high turnout. Last year, Kartiki Ekadashi was celebrated in a low-key manner due to Covid-19 restrictions. The bhakt niwas facilities in Pandharpur, Tuljapur and Akkalkot have been fully booked. Due to the high number of devotees, Covid safety norms took a backseat.

We have lodged a complaint with the police to investigate the matter further.” “On Monday, our team distributed the stock among farmers in the presence of Derabassi tehsildar,” he added. DAP is a preferred fertilizer in India because it contains both nitrogen and phosphorus, which are primary macro-nutrients and part of 18 essential plant nutrients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/suspected-dap-black-marketing-case-in-lalru/articleshow/87724395.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Lucky draw, street plays to boost immunization||PUNE: From offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students for motivating unvaccinated population, health officials in Maharashtra are going the extra mile to woo citizens to take the Covid shot. The officials are using creative methods like organising street plays and providing door-step counselling to push vaccination, besides deploying educational tools like posters and hoardings. State immunisation officer Sachin Desai said, “District collectors are making use of different creative methods to achieve 100% vaccination coverage.” In Chandrapur, the civic body is offering electronic and home appliances under a lucky draw to ensure that 39,000 unvaccinated citizens come forward to take the first shot. “We don’t want to leave any stone unturned. An LED TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine and 10 mixer grinders would be awarded to the citizens through the lucky draw initiative. This move is improving the vaccination numbers to some extent in Chandrapur,” municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite said. “The winners will be announced after November 24,” Mohite said. The district administration in Chandrapur is also pasting stickers outside commercial establishments with unvaccinated staff to keep customers informed. In Yavatmal, where over 10 lakh citizens are yet to take the first dose, the administration is seeking the help of schoolchildren. Akola resident deputy collector Sanjay Khadse said they would give ‘Sanman-Patra’ (felicitation certificates) to children who convince unvaccinated people in their homes and localities. The vaccination in Nashik city and rural parts of the district has crossed 74%, but the vaccination has remained slow in the limits of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) where only 27% of the beneficiaries have been administered the first dose of the vaccines. Aurangabad’s immunisation officer Smita Nalgirkar said, “We are carrying out door-to-door visits of health teams. Besides, we are making phone calls and spreading public awareness in general,” Nalgirkar said. Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 3 had held a virtual meeting involving authorities from Aurangabad and other districts where vaccination coverage is relatively lower.

He said that only dialogue is the way out of all problems between India and Pakistan. While talking to the media on his two-day private visit to Jodhpur, Abdullah, in a veiled attack on the centre, said that China was already in our territory and advancing everyday, and still we are talking to it. “If we can talk with China, why cannot with Pakistan. China is in our territory and is advancing everyday,” said Abdullah citing CDS Bipin Rawat that China was the biggest enemy of India. Emphasising on improved Indo-Pak relations, he said that relations of Hindus and Muslims are affected due to this strained relation. “If we have to improve our relationship, we will have to ease these differences and will have to find some ways. And the only way for this is dialogue,” he said citing the Pakistan visit of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to have a dialogue with his counterpart Nawaz Sharif. “We see attacks are taking place on Muslims in the country, they are being beaten, mosques are being blown up. Its impact is felt on our children,” he said. Talking about the situation in J&K post abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah said that there is pressure everywhere. Citing media, he said, “Media was not free there. No one can write freely and if you do, you can go to jail.” Referring to the youth there, he said that there are lot of educated youth there but they have no employment. “What is their future,” he asked. He further added that there are so many problems in J&K as there is Pakistan on one side and China on the other. “We are stuck between them. We do not know if there will be war someday. Only we will suffer, we will be killed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/if-india-can-talk-to-china-why-cant-it-do-so-with-pak-farooq-abdullah/articleshow/87725327.cms||---

Talking to reporters after inaugurating a computer laboratory at Kalapatti government high school in the city on Monday, Poyyamozhi said that though there is a standing instruction that complaint boxes should be installed in all the schools, students don’t know how to use the facility. “Once all the schools resume in-person classes in a full-fledged manner, awareness programmes will be conducted for students and they will be encouraged to make use of the complaint boxes. The schools too will be instructed to constitute committees chaired by a female teacher. Students can approach the committee and register complaints about sexual harassment on the campus,” he said. A formal announcement regarding the same will be made after November 19, he assured. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/committee-to-check-sexual-harassment-in-schools-soon/articleshow/87725321.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS MLC picks: 2nd term for Kadiyam Srihari, Gutha Sukhender Reddy; Padi Kaushik Reddy gains||HYDERABAD: TRS supremo and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao seems to have taken the tried and tested route while finalising candidates for the upcoming legislative council elections. While the official announcement will be made on Tuesday, party sources said names of Gutha Sukhender Reddy, Kadiyam Srihari, Padi Kaushik Reddy, MC Koti Reddy, Takkalapally Ravinder Rao, Erolla Srinivas and Akula Lalitha have been finalised. All of these names were frontrunners in the race with hardly any surprises. Going by the list, the party is considering two SCs, one BC woman and three OCs to represent the upper castes. KCR reportedly called up the candidates and informed them about their candidature. Sukhender Reddy, Kadiyam Srihari and Akula Lalitha will get a second term in the council. Sources added that Sukhender Reddy will be sent to the upper house through the governor’s quota. He will replace Kaushik Reddy, whose nomination governor Tamilisai Soudararajan was unwilling to approve. In another significant development, Siddipet collector P Venkatrama Reddy took voluntary retirement and is likely to join the TRS. He will contest the MLC poll on a TRS ticket under the local authority constituency either from Medak or from his native district of Karimnagar. He had about one year left to retirement. The name of former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, who belongs to the SC community, was finalised because he played an active role in popularising the Dalit Bandhu scheme. Similarly, another SC leader, Erolla Srinivas worked as the first chairman of Telangana SC commission. The TRS president has decided to give an opportunity to party general secretary Takallapally Ravinder Rao, a Velama, after considering his service to the party. Under the women’s and BC quota, Akula Lalitha has been given chance. She belongs to Munnuru Kapu community. M C Koti Reddy, a leader from Nalgonda, got an opportunity in the council as KCR had promised to accommodate him during the Nagarjuna Sagar by-election earlier this year. Koti Reddy joined the party from the Congress during the election. Sources added that KCR considered former council speaker S Madhusudhana Chary’s name too, but instead decided to send him to the Rajya Sabha next year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has notified elections to six vacancies under the MLA quota and 12 vacancies under local authority constituency quota and other constituencies. Under MLA quota, last date for filing nomination is Tuesday and polling will be held on November 29. The second round of elections will take place soon as the last date for filing nominations (second notification for filling up 12 seats) will end on November 23 and polling will be held on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mlc-picks-2nd-term-for-kadiyam-gutha-kaushik-gains/articleshow/87725959.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man freed in stabbing case after 9 years over ‘casual’ investigation||NEW DELHI: Nine years after a case was filed against a man for allegedly stabbing another man with a knife, a court has acquitted him citing contradictions in the prosecution’s case and “casual” investigation by police. Additional sessions judge Parveen Singh set aside a magistrate court’s order by which the man was sentenced to two years in prison in 2019 under IPC 326 (causing grievous hurt by using a dangerous weapon). The man had moved the sessions court against his conviction and sentence. The sessions court said on Wednesday, “There is nothing on record to show that the hurt caused endangered the life of the injured or that the injury caused was life threatening in nature. In absence of any such opinion by the doctor or a categorical finding by the court, the appellant could not have been convicted u/s 326 IPC.” The investigating officer (IO), the court observed, did not want to work hard enough to find the alleged weapon of offence or he knew that there might not have been such a weapon. Its non-recovery becomes important as there was a probability that the injury might have been caused by a piece of glass instead of a knife, and also in view of an absurd explanation given by the IO, the judge noted. The IO said the appellant had claimed that he had kept the knife in his pocket, but, on reaching home, found that it had made a hole in the trouser and fallen somewhere, the court said, adding that the explanation seemed unbelievable. It pointed out that in the alleged medical history of the case, it was recorded that the injury was a “glass injury to the abdomen”, but the IO claimed to have noticed it only during the cross-examination. “This reflects the casual manner in which the IO had conducted the investigation,” it noted. Merely because of the medical report stating “stab cut positive”, the magistrate court could not have reached the conclusion that it was a knife injury, not by a broken glass or glass, the judge observed. Although the prosecution claimed the victim was stabbed during a conversation between the two, the sessions court pointed out that during cross-examination, the complainant had said the accused was silently listening to his conversation with another driver and had nothing to do with it. “This is not a minor variation because the motive of the appellant to stab the victim stands demolished by this cross-examination.” The IO also chose not to find and join any independent public witness, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-freed-in-stabbing-case-after-9-years-over-casual-investigation/articleshow/87725326.cms||Usha Das
---||Pune||Pune: Two CNG furnaces proposed for dhobi ghat crematorium||PUNE: The Pune cantonment board (PCB) has forwarded a Rs1.5crore proposal to the Principal Director of Defence Estate (PDDE) of the Southern Command, seeking financial sanction for setting up two CNG-operated furnaces at its crematorium in Dhobi ghat. This follows complaints by citizens about the almost two-decade-old existing electric furnace not working properly. Rajabhau Chavan, an activist, said, “During the peak Covid period, many citizens faced difficulties at the crematorium. The cantonment should consider people’s concerns and complete the work at the earliest.” “The proposal is pending with the PDDE office. We are likely to get the requisite sanction to go ahead with the project,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. A PCB official said, “The existing electric furnace was set up in 2002, but now it is not functioning properly as its electric coils have worn out. As a result, the furnace is not able to maintain temperature for even two hours.” The existing chimney, too, is in a bad shape and the smoke generated at the site does not go out. It gets accumulated within the premises. It makes relatives and families uncomfortable at the place, said PCB officials. “In the event of disruption in electricity supply, we are unable to operate the furnace effectively by using the generator. Hence, we have proposed two CNG-operated burners,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-cng-furnaces-proposed-for-dhobi-ghat-crematorium/articleshow/87724402.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Face shield, mike for teachers for stress-less lectures||KOLKATA: Wearing masks while addressing one class after another for is not an easy proposition but that’s what teachers are gearing up to do as schools and colleges reopen on Tuesday after the pandemic hiatus. The different institutes are also taking additional measures, such as providing them with face shields and installing microphones in classrooms, to make it easier for them. Our Lady Queen of the Missions School will be among those distributing face shields to teachers so that they feel less constricted while talking. “We don’t want teachers stressed out, wearing masks while taking classes. We will initially try out with the face shield and see how comfortable they are,” said principal Sister Rani. At DPS Ruby Park, teachers will not have to speak very loudly as microphones have been installed in classes. Ram Mohan Mission principal Sujoy Biswas agreed that teachers had to be comfortable while taking classes for long hours. “We will try out face shields and see if they feel comfortable in them. Talking for long hours through the mask is a torture. We will monitor the situation on the day of reopening and take feedback from our teachers,” Biswas said. La Martiniere for Boys has organised for headphones with microphones to relieve teachers’ stress. The problem is likely to be worse for teachers at government and aided schools. The state has prepared staggered timing with classes IX and XI scheduled from 10am to 3.30pm and classes X and XII from 11am to 4.30pm. Teachers and other staff will have to reach school by 8.30am-9am and stay on till 5pm. Taki House headmistress Swagata Basak said, “We have requested all teachers to be present at least for the first 10 days. After that, we will get a clearer picture.” A south Kolkata college professor seemed concerned. “I don’t know how to manage a full class, wearing a mask. I’m practising but after talking for five to 10 minutes, I feel strained. We have to take online classes for first- and second-years the same day we take offline classes.” Scottish Church College has decided physical classes will not be for more than four hours, each honours class being assigned one hour. Vice-Principal and history professor Supratim Das said, “We have prepared a new schedule in such a way that nobody is overloaded. Teachers will not take offline classes for more than two hours. They can take their masks off during the break. They don’t have to wear masks for online classes.” Colleges in the suburbs may face some difficulties due to lack of infrastructure. Political science professor at Hiralal Mazumdar Memorial College at Dakshineswar Pradipta Mukherjee said, “Giving lectures with a mask on may be difficult. The risk factor is also there as many UG sudents are not vaccinated. We don’t know how to manage hybrid mode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/face-shield-mike-for-teachers-for-stress-less-lectures/articleshow/87724405.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The leopard was already trapped in a cage and the forest department suspects that it was trapped by poachers. The two-hour-long operation saw the team using a tranquiliser gun and ferrying the feline to a rescue centre in Ranibagh of Nainital district for treatment before releasing it back into the wild. Forest Rangers Bhupal Singh Kaida of Rudrapur and Roop Narayan Gautam of Barhaini forest range reached the spot with a medical team after being informed by villagers. As the news about the caged leopard spread in the area, a big crowd gathered on the site. The presence of a big crowd made the rescue operation complicated. Gautam said, “The cat was stuck in the cage. Poachers might have installed the cage to catch some wild animals for their meat. We are still trying to find out the actual reason behind this. A probe has begun and a case will be registered against the farm owner if found guilty.” Meanwhile, veterinarian Ayush Uniyal said that the big cat has suffered injuries in its hind legs and will be treated at the centre. “The forest department will be fixing a radio collar on the leopard before releasing it in the wild,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/leopard-caged-by-poachers-rescued-in-u-s-nagar/articleshow/87724411.cms||Aakash Ahuja

During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725330.cms||---

In August, the administration had decided to go for a fresh plan as the officials of the Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) had said UT’s 2009’s plan could not be updated as the Centre had issued new guidelines.The UT adviser has asked the department concerned to submit the report on progress made.To solve the city's urban transport problem, the administration had fixed a meeting with RITES, in which options of MRTS, like metro, monorail and skybus, were discussed. Before moving ahead, the UT adviser had directed the transport department to get an updated RITES-2009 study. The last mobility plan for the MRTS was prepared by the RITES in 2009. Since then, many things have drastically changed on the ground like volume of traffic, entry of vehicles into the city and rush on many routes.The administration had in 2019 rejected a detailed study conducted by French company Systra for a mobility plan under the Smart City project. Citing wrong methodology for carrying out the study aimed at suggesting ways to solve traffic congestion and offer possible modes for mass rapid transport system, the administration had set it aside. The French agency had suggested three Tricity corridors and a combination of bus rapid transit system (BRTS), light rail transit (LRT), modern tram and monorail as possible modes of transport along these corridors. The UT administration had then asked a team of Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and other experts to check the study and found flaws with methodology and figures.The RITES, in their earlier study, had proposed that a metro would cover a distance of 52.4 km, of which 40.4 km will be in Chandigarh, and the rest in Mohali. The alignments were proposed both above ground as well as underground. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had prepared the detailed project report of the first phase. Later in 2017, the Central government had declared Metro as unviable for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-adviser-seeks-report-on-new-mobility-plan-for-mrts/articleshow/87724407.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

There are approximately 40 lakh students in colleges run by technical and higher education departments in Maharashtra. Over 60% of them have received first dose of Covid vaccines. The state held “Mission Yuva Swasthya” for vaccination of college students. But low attendance in colleges that resumed physical classes on October 20 proved a dampener. “We have decided to prioritise the vaccination of college students by holding near-home camps at community halls and other public places. The aim is to vaccinate those left out during the vaccination on college campuses,” said the state immunization officer, Sachin Desai. There are about 5,000 institutes of higher and technical education in the state. Also, about 40 lakh students study in deemed and private universities. The state health department held vaccination camps on the premises of 1,608 colleges across the state and inoculated a total of 1,08,613 students in the weeklong special drive from October 25 to November 2. Santosh Parchure, the director of the students’ welfare department at SPPU, said, “After the good response students during the previous drive in the Pune division, we shall extend it further and ensure that maximum students benefit. Many are waiting for their second dose. Also, there are few students who have not taken first shot.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand's biggest biodiversity park, spread across 50 hectares, to be set up in Garhwal||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s biggest biodiversity park will be set up at Garhwal’s Muni Ki Reti. Dubbed the Shiwalik Biodiversity Park (SBP) and spread across 50 hectares of land, its aim is to conserve the natural landscape of the area. The park is expected to bring in around 5 lakh tourists who visit Rishikesh every year. It will have 33 types of conservation concepts, all developed at the cost of Rs 65 crore. The project will be executed in three phases over the next five years. Interestingly, the park is expected to generate employment for at least 7,000 people, according to preliminary estimates by forest authorities. Forest officials say objectives behind building the park include biodiversity conservation, promotion of natural products (testing, processing, value addition, marketing, and quality control), livelihood enhancement, eco-restoration of degraded forests, nature education, promoting responsible visits to the Himalayan natural treasures, and teaching the importance of various types of ecosystems. The SBP is divided into two parts, the Herbal Eco-Par, spread across 6.32 hectares, and Nature Park Area, across 43.05 hectares. The biodiversity park will also have miniature replicas of iconic sites in Uttarakhand such as the Char Dham shrines. It will have a valley of flowers with a water body, a nature learning centre, butterfly conservatory, open-air aviary, a theme-based light and sound show called 'Conservation of the Maa Ganga River', a natural herbal haat, a conservation park, some livelihood-based activities, five nature trails, and a Sanskriti Gram. The biodiversity park would have a Shivalik transition zone, a rich ecotone, hillside grasslands, gentle active plains, tropical deciduous forests, bushlands, and upper Bhabar landscapes. These different landscapes would be interconnected by nature trails and would support more than 1,000 species of plants. The park is surrounded by the main Char Dham roads, NH-58 and NH-94, which is why the department is expecting a handsome income generation through the set-up. “The project is based on the utilisation of natural products with zero carbon footprint and sustainable utilisation of resources. The Shiwalik Biodiversity Park will serve three important functions besides enhancing the quality of the urban environment – educational, cultural, and conservational,” said DS Meena, DFO of Narendra Nagar. The authorities aligned the project with the National Biodiversity Action Plan and the Convention on Biological Diversity during planning. Meena added, “The park will have over 450 species of medicinal herbs/shrubs and trees in the arboretum. It will also have a seed bank to save the rare, endangered, and threatened species of plants.” Muni Ki Reti seems to have untapped potential, which the authorities are trying to use for the livelihood generation of the locals, as more than 35 lakh pilgrims pass through this area for the Char Dham yatra every year. The Kumbh mela and kanwar yatra also provide additional opportunities for income generation for the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-biggest-biodiversity-park-spread-across-50-hectares-to-be-set-up-in-garhwal/articleshow/87724428.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Proposal for petrochemical cluster in Nagapattinam scrapped||TRICHY: In the wake of the stiff opposition from the opposition parties, the state government has withdrawn its proposal to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) to establish a petrochemical cluster in Nagapattinam. In the announcement, published as a newspaper corrigendum, M-TIPB stated that the request for proposal (RIP) for preparation of DPR for establishing a petrochemical cluster has been withdrawn due to administrative reasons. The objective of the cluster was to set up 90 lakh tonne capacity petroleum and chemical related business units around the refinery being constructed by Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in Nagapattinam at an estimated cost Rs 31,580 crore. The decision of the Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau (M-TIPB) to cancel the bid for preparing the DPR was welcomed by PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss. He said that the PMK welcomed the move of the state government to abandon the proposal, which will jeopardise the objective of the protected special agriculture zone. On October 30, Ramadoss issued a statement condemning the government for floating a proposal to prepare a DPR. Citing that the proposed site falls under the protected special agriculture zone of the Cauvery delta region, the PMK leader had accused the DMK for attracting investments instead of safeguarding the agriculture and environment of the state. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam also issued a statement on November 1 terming the move as DMK government’s ‘double-standard’. In the statement on Monday, Ramadoss demanded the government to include the petrochemical industries in the banned list under The Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/proposal-for-petrochemical-cluster-scrapped/articleshow/87725349.cms||---

The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile of Chandrika Perera was sent to the forensic science laboratory in Chennai two weeks ago, where DNA of Lokka has already been profiled,” a senior police officer from CB-CID told TOI. He said that both DNA profiles matched with 99 % accuracy. “We had already confirmed that the death of Lokka was due to sudden cardiac arrest. Following the DNA match, we have now confirmed the identity of the deceased as Lokka,” the police officer said. “There was no foul play behind the death of Lokka. So, we are going to file a petition before a court in Coimbatore to close the suspicious death of Lokka’s case,” he added.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges take tech help to spread reopening message||KOLKATA: College and university authorities took help of all social media platforms — used by students — to share information and guidelines about campus reopening. This made communication effective and helped reach students quickly instead of the “official notifications” on websites that most students don’t notice. From information about vaccination to sharing plans of reopening to publishing health and safety protocols, college authorities shifted focus to platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, YouTube and even Instagram. Students, many of whom have been waiting eagerly for colleges to reopen, were quick to respond and share the information. “We sent out a detailed notice to students on various class specific groups. Several students responded with queries, which were cleared by the teachers in charge. The college has been taking help of several tech platforms even during online classes and examinations,” said an official of St Xavier’s College. Colleges even collected vaccination certificates through WhatsApp groups to get the number of fully vaccinated students. “Teachers started counseling students days in advance about the reopening and the protocol to be followed. The method proved to be effective as all students use WhatsApp and are very quick to respond,”said Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College. The college also has an official YouTube channel. Most principals said students do not check circulars and notices on official websites. Initially some colleges faced problems shifting to online classes but now almost all have WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels. “During admission we have found most students don’t check the college website. Some even missed the deadline. But for reopening we could not take any chances because it’s a matter of safety,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.  Many colleges have also started sharing information on health facilities available on campus. “We have a health centre on campus, where facilities have been increased. We have also tied up with a private hospital and informed students on how to use the facilities in case of emergency. All this is being done through various social media groups,”said an official of Jadavpur University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-take-tech-help-to-spread-reopening-message/articleshow/87724445.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||India||Calcutta HC remarks on CAT bench can be expunged in Alapan case: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday told the Centre that it can expunge the adverse remarks made by Calcutta High Court against the principal bench of the CAT while giving a verdict in favour of former chief secretary of West Bengal Alapan Bandyopadhyay but observed that it cannot be said that the HC had no jurisdiction to pass order. The HC, while setting aside the order passed by the principal bench of CAT on the Centre’s plea for transfer of the case filed by Bandyopadhyay from the Calcutta HC bench to itself, said “The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides, it is unfortunate that the principal bench of the CAT nurtured such efforts by passing the impugned transfer order, thereby paying obeisance to the diktat of Union of India.” Challenging the order passed by HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta contended before a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that it was a “disturbing order” and very unwanted observation passed by the court and must be set aside. He said that the bureaucrat was an All India Cadre Officer and he can challenge departmpartmental action only before the principal branch of the tribunal. The bench, however, said the officer has since retired and he has the option to file the case where he stays. Mehta, however, insisted that the HC had no jurisdiction at all and again referred to the “disturbing” observations. He said that such language could not be allowed to be used even by litigants in a constitutional court. The bench said it can order to expunge the remarks and again observed that there was nothing wrong in the case being heard by the Kolkata branch of the tribunal as ordered by the HC. “Part of the cause of action arises in Kolkata itself and the HC has jurisdiction. What is wrong about it. Regarding observation we can take care of it,” the bench said. The bench, however, deferred the hearing for next week after Mehta contended that he wanted to place relevant case laws before the bench to buttress his point that HC had no jurisdiction. Bandyopadhyay had been issued a showcause for allegedly abstaining from a meeting held by the Prime Minister in Kalaikunda in May this year. On May 31, the last day of Bandyopadhyay’s tenure, he was directed to go to Delhi to join the central government’s service. He, however, retired on the same day without going to Delhi. Although the state government offered to extend his tenure by three months, Bandyopadhyay turned it down. The central government started disciplinary proceedings against Bandyopadhyay and he approached the Calcutta bench of CAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/calcutta-hc-remarks-on-cat-bench-can-be-expunged-in-alapan-case-sc/articleshow/87726596.cms||---

As part of the national campaign to restore the old pension scheme, hundreds of employees gathered at Parade Ground and held a march to the secretariat. The campaign's national president, Vijay Kumar Bandhu, and general secretary Stidhi Pragya said that the whole country is once again mobilised to restore the old pension scheme. Representatives of about 50 employees' organisations have joined the campaign. In January 2004, the central government introduced a new pension system, NPS, for government employees recruited after December 31, 2003, to replace the one under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. The new pension scheme does not provide the guarantee of minimum pension on the last basic salary drawn by the employees, according to a protesting employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-employees-demand-restoration-of-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/87724449.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Trichy||3 years after Gaja, coconut farmers still struggling||Trichy: It has been three years since Cyclone Gaja turned the lives of the coconut farmers of the delta region upside down in a single night on November 15, 2018. The severe cyclonic storm had uprooted 59.29 lakh coconut trees, which were the mainstay of the farmers in the area. Trees raised on around 2.50 lakh acres in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Pudukottai districts were destroyed in the strong winds. Though the then government distributed coconut saplings and a compensation, most of the farmers are still struggling to revive the saplings as well as their lives.Thanjavur was the worst hit district as around 40 lakh coconut trees in Pattukottai, Peravurani and Orathanadu were completely destroyed, farmers said. The state government had provided a compensation of Rs 1,100 per tree, free saplings and input cost to the farmers who lost their trees. But the saplings have not grown well and withered due to the attack of rhinoceros beetles, V Veerasenan, a coconut farmer from Ponnavarayankottai in Pattukottai taluk in the district, said. “I had around 250 coconut trees on five acres. Now I have hardly 25 trees. Most of the farmers could not get full compensation as the enumeration was done in an improper way. The free saplings given by the government are not growing properly. Still, the saplings remain as saplings as the breed supplied was not fit for the soil in the area. The government announced to disburse manure, fertilizers for five years free of cost. However, we received it only once. The government disbursed black gram seeds to raise as intercrop among the coconut groves to get extra income. But that too yielded nothing as the seed was substandard,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3-years-after-gaja-coconut-farmers-still-struggling/articleshow/87725370.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the storm water drains clearing drives recently, piles of plastic, glass and cloth waste that clogged the storm drains were retrieved.Despite having three major rivers and several minor channels crisscrossing the city, several localities with storm water drains were marooned by rainwater last week due to poor maintenance. Plastic waste clogging the drains also contributed to inundation in localities that have drain infrastructure. Since the storm water drains were open in most parts of the city, commercial establishments and residents litter plastic waste in them, which affects the flow of water.In the localities that have Tasmac liquor bars, Trichy Corporation workers have recovered several empty glass bottles and plastic cups that clogged the drains causing inundation. In Karumandapam, the run-off water that was supposed to merge with Koraiyar inundated RMS Colony and Kalyanasundaram Nagar due to the clogging.“Earlier, garbage bins were placed in public places. Once they were removed, people started throwing waste on vacant spaces that eventually end up in drains,” S Thirugnanam, a resident of New Colony, Karumandapam, said. Corporation and the state highways department were also to be blamed as most of the stormwater drains in the city were left uncovered. While the concrete slabs above the drains prevent waste from entering the drains, authorities were reluctant to cover them as the drains are used as sullage carriers, which need to be cleaned frequently. “Placing slabs will hinder the cleaning and silt removal process. Anti-social elements are damaging the slabs to sell the iron rods in scrap yards, we are covering the drains in a phased manner,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plastic-waste-choking-storm-water-drains-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87725356.cms||Deepak Karthik

Although political parties repeatedly insist cadres to refrain from erecting banners that affect the public, the warning stays only on paper as cadres are undeterred by enforcement agencies.In Srirangam, political banners by DMK has occupied a portion of the centre median near Thiruvanaikoil junction. Locals said that the recent rainfall and bad weather may cause the banners to fall over and also cause accidents. Recalling the incident in Chennai in 2019 where a woman was killed after being knocked down by a banner and run over a by a truck, the locals added that political parties have not learnt any lesson. “Publicity on the centre median is against court directives. Law enforcement authorities are turning a blind eye to such violations although they are aware,” said Suresh Venkatachalam, coordinator, Arangamanagar Nala Sangam. Authorities fearing repercussions from political parties are hesitating to remove illegal hoardings and initiate legal actions against the offenders. Similar hoardings are occasionally cropping up on Sastri road, Anna Nagar link road and MGR statue.“Our high command has strictly told cadres in a written order to avoid placing banners in public places. We will remove the hoardings,” a functionary with DMK said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/political-banners-crop-up-on-medians/articleshow/87725363.cms||---

In business, he foresees a future in the zero-wood homes and has set a five-year deadline to make Polywood a zero-debt company. In fact, Dhabriya comes from a family that has zero presence in business. His grandfather was an illustrious teacher who had won the President’s award. His father was a BITS professor. His brother and sister too are in academics. Recalling his inspiration for entrepreneurship, Dhabriya says, “I was aspirational since my younger days. While doing mechanical engineering in MBM College in Jodhpur, I used to hear about Birlas and Tatas, and Singhanias. Their stories used to fascinate me.” After the engineering degree, he secured a scholarship of Rs 1,200 to pursue a post-graduation in Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology. “During PG days, I became more aware about scope in the plastic industry. Thoughts of replacing wood with plastic and saving trees took shape. The fact that my father was a nature lover, the idea of creating a wood substitute animated me,” reminiscences Dhabriya. After PG, he bounced around a couple of ill-fitting jobs for around 4 years, but found interest in plastic extrusion technology that can create doors and windows. In 1995, he set up Polywood with a capacity for 12 tonne of products. Today, it makes products worth 1,000 tonne having five plants (three in Jaipur and one each in Karnataka and Coimbatore). While expanding product portfolio and entering new markets, Dhabriya wanted to work for big clients. But he could not win projects. “Big clients prefer companies having well-recognised credentials and high corporate governance standards. It was hard for a small company like mine from a tier-II location to prove that. That’s when I decided to go public. Polywood became the first from Rajasthan to list on BSE’s SME exchange in 2014,” says Dhabriya. The valuation of Polywood was at Rs 17 crore when it raised Rs 3.30 crore. Today, the market capitalization is around Rs 125 crore. Dhabriya says the listing fecilitated him to work with the likes of Shapoorji Pallonji and DLF. After PVC and UPVC doors, windows, false ceiling, Polywood innovated new products like wall paneling, flooring and products that replace sunmica under D-stona brand made of marble waste. Recently, Dhabriya tied up with Italian and French firms to make modular furniture made of paddy and wheat husk, and forest waste. “Compared to wood, medium density fibre (MDF) has better characteristics. Companies like Livspace and HomeLane have a thriving modular furniture business made of MDF. We are confident this segment will help us achieve our revenue target of Rs 500 crore in the next five years,” says Dhabriya. At 56, he is the oldest player playing polo in the country now. Recalling an event that pushed him to the game, Dhabriya says, “Once, I had lent money to a polo player. Since he could not pay back, he offered me his horse. I brought it thinking my son would like to learn polo. He tried but got bored. Then I wanted to sell it but could not.” But in the short time, he developed a fascination for the animal. “When I started to ride it, I felt its power, a sense of thrill and speed. I took the help of polo player to learn the game. At 41, I played my first game. Recently, I started an arena polo facility which has been hosting tournaments. As captain of the Polywood team, I won a tournament last year,” says Dhabriya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/listing-increased-my-acceptability-among-big-clients-says-dhabriya/articleshow/87725373.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The films of Satyajit Ray will also be screened at the 52nd Iffi as the festival celebrates the birth centenary of the legendary filmmaker. ‘El Rey de Todo El Mundo’ (‘The king of all the world’), a Spanish-Mexican musical drama directed by Carlos Saura, will be the opening film at the 52nd Iffi. This will also be the film’s international premier. In addition, films from the five BRICS nations— Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa— will be showcased through the BRICS film festival, which will be held parallel to the main film festival.

Thanjavur is the birthplace of FCI where its first office was inaugurated on January 14, 1965. The museum showcases the evolution of man from the nomadic hunter groups into the settled agriculture procedures leading to the beginning of civilization. It also displays various ancient grain storage methods, both global and indigenous, challenges in storage, food grain production scenarios across the world as well as in India.The museum also digitally displays informative content about the journey of FCI, its present operations and the journey of the food grains from farm to plate through FCI.

Everybody in the world is talking about food security, everybody realizes how important it is. During the earlier pandemics, more people died of hunger in the world than the pandemic itself. Thanks to the work of our farmers, you (employees of FCI) were able to provide adequate food grains to every single citizen of India. From food security, we have progressed to farmer security and from farmer security, we are progressing to consumer security. So, the world now sees India as a trusted partner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/indias-first-food-museum-inaugurated-in-thanjavur/articleshow/87725371.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deshmukh influential, could tamper with evidence, says ED||MUMBAI: Urging the special PMLA court to send former state home minister Anil Deshmukh to judicial custody and not release him during the pendency of the investigations, the Enforcement Directorate in its plea submitted through special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar on Monday said that he is an influential person, having served as state home minister, and if his judicial custody is not granted, he may tamper with evidences and consequently hamper the PMLA probe. “During the interrogation of Anil Deshmukh, many crucial facts have been revealed which are in his exclusive domain, as he (sic) being the key personnel, deeply and directly involved and having in possession of proceeds of crime,” the ED said. Deshmukh had been in ED custody from November 2 until Monday. The ED alleged that Deshmukh, who played a crucial role, had not provided the required information regarding the laundering of proceeds of crime. “Therefore, judicial custody is required to unearth the trail of funds, for corroboration and confrontation with other persons involved even with accused himself in the case,” the probe agency said. Meanwhile, the court allowed Deshmukh’s plea to continue his medicines and have a bed in jail. Deshmukh’s lawyers, Inderpal B Singh and Aniket Nikam, cited his age and ailments and battle with Covid-19. “He has back issues and is unable to lie on the earth… He is not a young man,” the defence said. The court perused the medical papers of JJ Hospital from Friday, which showed that Deshmukh had complained to the doctor about suffering from lower back pain for many years. “Considering the age of accused and his ailments, the jail authority is asked to provide a bed to the accused in jail,” the court said. Before the hearing commenced on Monday, on the special court’s query, Deshmukh responded that he had no complaints of ill-treatment and harassment at the hands of ED officials. The prosecution submitted a reply to Deshmukh’s handwritten application for the retraction of his statement recorded during ED custody. In the handwritten plea submitted to the court on Friday, Deshmukh had stated that he retracts answers that may have been taken from him in a “malafide manner from me by creating stress, confusion and mental obfuscation owing to my physical distress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-influential-could-tamper-with-evidence-says-ed/articleshow/87725377.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Kerala gold smuggling case: Centre to move SC against HC||NEW DELHI: In a politically sensitive case involving the LDF government in Kerala, the Centre has decided to move the Supreme Court against an order of the Kerala High Court quashing the detention of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case, under the stringent Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act). Suresh was recently released on bail by the HC after 15 months in jail under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) imposed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The gold smuggling racket was busted in July 2020, leading to seizure of 30kg gold worth Rs 15 crore from an official consignment of the UAE consulate at Trivandrum International Airport. Later, Suresh and seven other accused were arrested and a probe by the Enforcement Directorate and the customs department revealed involvement of IAS officer M Sivasankar, then principal secretary of CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The customs department has in its recent chargesheet in the case named Sivasankar as an accused who, it claimed, knew about the gold smuggling racket and was involved with Swapna Suresh. The central government has taken an opinion from the law ministry to challenge the HC order quashing Cofeposa against Suresh. The quashing order came on October 8, two days short of Suresh completing an year in detention under the stringent Act. Completing one-year detention under Cofeposa allows agencies to confiscate assets of all the accused, their relatives and associates and the burden of proof lies on the accused (that the properties are not illegally acquired from the ‘proceeds of crime’). In the same case, sources said, the Cofeposa imposed on six others have been retained, raising eyebrows in the government about the dual approach adopted in dealing with the particular case. A Cofeposa detention order is issued in extraordinary cases where the government has designated a joint secretary level officer in the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in the finance ministry to strictly review the proposals from Customs, DRI and ED and issue such orders. The states are also empowered to issue detention orders under Cofeposa, but only by a designated officer not below the rank of secretary. The customs department has claimed that the accused were repeat offenders and had smuggled several consignments of gold from the UAE totalling about 167kg between November 2019 and June 2020, all in the garb of diplomatic consignments involving consulate officials. Once arrested under Cofeposa, the accused is completely immobilized with all his operations freezed and bank accounts attached. During 2018-19, the CEIB had issued 51 detention orders under the Act. This was the highest so far in any year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centre-to-move-sc-against-hc-order/articleshow/87724450.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Pune||Pune: Youth stabbed over gambling quarrel, three men arrested||PUNE: The Talegaon MIDC police on Monday arrested three men on the charge of stabbing their 21-year-old friend to death following a quarrel during a game of gambling on November 14 night at Indori village in Maval. The police have identified the victim as Shahbuddin Ansari, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh. An officer from the Talegaon MIDC police said the victim was a painting worker and was staying at a rented accommodation in Indori village. “On Sunday night they were gambling inside the room, when the suspect and the victim got into a brawl over the rules of the game,” the officer said. He said the suspect, who stayed nearby, went home and returned with sharp weapons. His two relatives accompanied him as well. “The trio first brutally kicked and punched Ansari. The suspect’s relatives then held Ansari by his hands and the suspect stabbed him in the stomach, chest and near the left eye,” the officer further said. Another friend of Ansari took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. “We have arrested all the three suspects,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-stabbed-over-gambling-quarrel-three-men-arrested/articleshow/87724432.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to officials, several measures have been taken to reduce pollution levels caused by heavy construction activity all across the 82-km-long Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut stretch. Apart from constant sprinkling of water, 20 anti-smog guns have been deployed to settle the dust. "RRTS construction is in full swing on the entire route. Besides maintaining the pace of the construction, National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is taking proactive steps to minimise inconvenience to locals in the area. In this direction, extensive pollution control measures are also being taken in and around the construction sites," said NCRTC PRO Puneet Vats. He added that apart from establishment of water pumps at casting yards, air monitoring devices have also been installed at various points along the route to bring down dust levels. “Arrangements to remove the soil accumulated on the roadside by using broomer machines have also been made,” Vats said. Notably, post-Diwali, smog has been lingering in UP districts including Meerut and Ghaziabad, where RRTS construction is in full swing. The AQI levels (as per data released by the Central Pollution Control Board) are consistently in the ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ category. Presently, around 10,000 workers are engaged in the project that will connect Delhi, Meerut and Ghaziabad with a high-speed rail link. The project is slated to reach completion in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pollution-mitigation-major-challenge-for-delhi-meerut-rapid-transit-project-20-anti-smog-guns-deployed/articleshow/87723703.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Trichy||Encroachments shrink Kottapattu tank capacity||Trichy: Kottapattu tank, the second largest in Trichy city is facing a slow death with encroachments and poor maintenance shrinking the water storage capacity. As the tank was not desilted, the recent rain exposed its vulnerability as it flooded the nearby residential settlements instead of storing the water. Spread on 70 acres, the tank in ward 35 is fed both by rainwater accumulated in catchment areas and Cauvery water through the New Kattalaimettu canal. The Cauvery water would first fill the Sempattu tank near Trichy airport and the Kottapattu tank and finally the Mavadikulam tank in Ponmalaipatti. However, the channels interconnecting the tanks were not properly maintained and the sluice gates were encroached. During the recent rain, the tank flooded JK Nagar, RS Puram and other localities in Khajamalai. Authorities were forced to reduce the water level by pumping the rainwater to the drains. “The recent rainfall was wasted, the tank could have augmented the groundwater table in the Ponmalai localities if it was desilted,” K C Neelamegam, state treasurer, Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam said. The tank is presently maintained by the revenue department. Though the tank can store water for 10ft deep, officials said that even the 6ft level is causing inundation in adjacent areas since the bunds and supply channels were not properly maintained. “We have closed the water flow from the new Kattalaimettu canal. If the revenue department hands over the tank to us, we can develop the tank and bund as a recreational site besides improving the storage capacity under the Jal Jeevan Mission,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-shrink-kottapattu-tank-capacity/articleshow/87725360.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Indrani Mukerjea if she wishes to withdraw her bail petition||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday heard at some length on merits a bail plea filed by Indrani Mukerjea in the Sheena Bora murder case, and in the end orally asked her counsel, Sana Raees Khan, to take “her instructions” and inform if she wishes to withdraw it. Justice Nitin Sambre after a patient hearing orally observed, “on merits am not convinced.’’ He asked if she would like to withdraw the plea or attract an order on merits. Khan said since Indrani is in Byculla woman’s jail, she would need time to speak with her. The judge posted the matter for orders on Tuesday. Khan said it was the first bail plea of Indrani, 50, on merits before the HC. She pointed to various “contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies’’ and, citing SC orders, said Indrani is in jail for six years “as a pre-trial punishment” with no end in near sight for the trial. She said only 67 witnesses have been examined and the CBI has 185 more to go, apart from likely defence witnesses and the trial may drag on, thus impinging her fundamental right. Even on health grounds bail may be granted as Indrani’s “latest Sept 2021 report from JJ Hospital says she has an irreversible neurological condition, thus needing care,” Khan said. She said, “Entire case hinges on approver Shyamwar Rai’s story. He was arrested two days prior to her, on possession of arms. He denied such possession later destroying his credibility and as such foundation of case collapses.’’ Rai was Indrani’s driver and co-accused and is now the state witness. Khan also cited depositions by doctors and experts to argue that the skeletal and teeth remains as well as skull exhumed in 2015 after Indrani’s August 25, 2015 arrest from Pen and the one found in 2012 by Pen police in Raigad are not the same. CBI prosecutor Sandesh Patil with DP Singh said she has been denied bail five times since 2017. CBI said summons were issued to Rahul, son of co-accused Peter Mukerjea, but trial was held up due to Covid-19 and resumed on Feb 17. “Rahul Mukerjea will prove motive for murder and also that he dropped Sheena Bora near Amarsons showroom, Khar at 6.30 pm on 24.04.2012.” The CBI said that submitted that at the stage of granting of bail, the court can only go into the question of the prima facie case established for granting bail. It cannot go into the question of credibility and reliability of the witnesses put up by the Prosecution. “The question of credibility and reliability of Prosecution Witnesses can only be tested during the Trial,” it submitted. CBI reply also said mere long delay in trial and long period behind bars by themselves singly or conjointly are not enough for grant of bail as held by the Supreme Court in 2007 in C Yadav vs State of Maharashtra. It also cited another SC ruling in the case of “Rajesh Rajan Yadav v/s CBI in 2007 where it held that there is “no absolute rule that a long period of incarceration by itself would entitle an under trial to bail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-indrani-if-she-wishes-to-withdraw-her-bail-petition/articleshow/87725395.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mangaluru||Kodikal shuts down to protest desecration of Naga idol||Mangaluru: Activists of pro-Hindu outfits including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Jagran Vedike on Monday observed a bandh in Kodikal town to protest the alleged ‘desecration’ of the nagabimba or the idol of the snake god at the Nagabana temple on Friday. The bandh received widespread support among the people of the town, with most shops remaining closed in an expression of solidarity with the pro-Hindu outfits. In addition to the closure of businesses, bus services to Kodikal were suspended on Monday, while traffic movement was blocked along its roads. The protesting activists held a rally, to which many residents joined along the way, from Kodikal Katte to Nagabana, demanding police action against those responsible for the desecration of the idol. Secretary of VHP’s Mangaluru division Sharan Pumpwell, reiterating the outfit’s demand for stringent action against the culprits, said, “This will prevent attacks from Hindu shrines from recurring. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai must respect the religious sentiments of the people along the coast, who voted for Hindutva. This is the third time that idols of the snake god are being desecrated in the region. The first such incident was reported in Panambur, while the second was reported from Kuloor.” Gurupura Vajradehi Mutt pontiff Sri Rajashekarananda Swami alleged that police had arrested a mentally-challenged individual, charging him with desecrating the Naga idol at the Kuloor temple. “We are giving the cops 24 days to nab the culprits behind this attack in Kodikal. We will call for a bandh either in Mangaluru or call for a shutdown of the entire district if police do not take action against the miscreants responsible for desecrating our shrines. We have confidence that Mangaluru city police will solve the case soon, and we will present them with gold medals,” the seer said. Meanwhile, Mangaluru city police stepped up security in Kodikal, where they deployed additional forces on Monday. Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, Mangaluru City South MLA Y Bharath Shetty and other BJP leaders paid a visit to the Nagabana temple in Kodikal to take stock of the damage done to the Nagabimba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kodikal-shuts-down-to-protest-desecration-of-naga-idol/articleshow/87723659.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Bio-fungicide it developed can also be used in treating cumin wilt, says CISH||Lucknow: ICAR-FUSICONT, a unique bio-fungicide to control fungal disease causing wilting of banana crops, can also prove effective in managing the cumin wilt disease in Rajasthan, a study has found. ICAR-FUSICONT was originally developed by ICAR-Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH). While originally it was used to treat banana wilt, in a recent experiment, the CISH team also found it effective in managing the cumin wilt disease in Rajasthan. “Cumin wilt disease is causing losses of several crores of rupees, and in many places, the entire crop is being wiped out due to epidemics of the disease. Thousands of people in Rajasthan depend heavily on cumin, which is a short-season crop that can be grown with low input costs and yields high returns. ICAR-FUSICONT was used to manage this disease and successful results were obtained,” said director CISH Shailendra Rajan. He said Ph.D. students of renowned scientists of the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, T Damodaran conducted experiments in Rajasthan to test whether ICAR Fusicont can also control cumin wilt in the Jodhpur district and found that it was effective for cumin as well. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Gudamalani from the Barmer district requested Lucknow ICAR institutes to supply the product so that it could be extensively tested in their fields, he added. He said the experiment began in November 2020 in farmers’ fields in the hotspot area, using technology as a seed treatment at the time of sowing and later with irrigation water. Farmers saw encouraging results, which attracted scientists from Krishi Vigyan Kendra and other ICAR institutes to see the outcomes of the initiatives. They communicated with the Lucknow scientist to further discuss the possibility of using this technology to manage this unsolved problem in Rajasthan. “Farmers who used the technology last year are satisfied, and convinced that the banana technology can also be used with cumin, an important spice crop. The spice crop accounts for a significant portion of Indian spice exports,” said Rajan and added that the problem has been present in various parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan for many years on sandy soils. Researchers and farmers have been looking for an effective control measure for the wilt problem, but no remedy has been recommended that can successfully manage the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bio-fungicide-it-developed-can-also-be-used-in-treating-cumin-wilt-says-cish/articleshow/87705133.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Kota however, the air quality remained ‘very poor’ for the third consecutive day. For the forth straight day, the air quality in Udaipur continued to deteriorate as it AQI touched 348. For the second time in Jodhpur, the air quality turned ‘very poor’ this season. The first time its air quality turned ‘very poor’ was on November 5 (day after Diwali). Amid rising AQI in Delhi-NCR region, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) convened a crucial meeting on Sunday. The meeting, while soliciting views from the state governments of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, advised states to take measures to deal with the situation. The adverse air quality scenario in Delhi-NCR was a combined result of paddy stubble burning, vehicular pollution, post-Diwali pollution, dip in temperature and a dust storm moving in from the South-Westerly directions of the Thar desert which brought in huge quantities of dust that further amplified the PM2.5/PM10 levels significantly. Considering different aspects causing a spike in the air pollution levels, the commission during the meeting reiterated that actions recommended by the orders of the sub-committee, shall be strictly implemented by the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipurs-air-improves-aqi-of-other-raj-cities-deteriorates/articleshow/87725382.cms||---

The government has allowed schools to open with 100% capacity looking at the low number of Covid cases being reported. However in most of the districts, a large number of parents seem to be still reluctant to send their children to school. Bal Vidya Vidhyashram School principal Pratima Sharma said that response was better in lower classes. “Response was good in lower classes as higher class students have become habituated with online classes. In class XI, mid-term is going on so they were not in high number. We are conducting classes in online and offline modes,” said Sharma. A similar response came from Subodh Public School, Jaipur. According to the school administration, attendance was around 55% and it was expected to rise in the coming days. Cambridge Court High School is functioning in 50% capacity and will open 100% from Wednesday. Principal Lata Rawat said they would be keeping the option of online classes. Some parents were concerned about their kids attending school. Monika Sharma, a parent of class II student said, “I had gone to pick up my child from school. It was difficult to see children of smaller classes not maintaining social distancing. I request government not to risk the lives of children as cases of Covid have started to rise again.” Some parents also complained about online classes being shut down by schools forcing parents to send their children for physical classes. Surprisingly, the state government in its SOP released has not mentioned whether schools have to continue online classes along with offline. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh said, “We are receiving complaints from many parents that schools have shut down online classes. Parents are being forced to send students to school, which is risking their lives. Government must take action against such schools. The government hasn’t clarified this statement whether online classes should be available. This is being used by the private schools.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-reopen-in-full-capacity-parents-reluctant-to-send-kids/articleshow/87725375.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Experts bat for sero-survey among a sample of Covid-19 vaccinated population||PUNE: Experts have called for a sero-survey among a sample of vaccinated population to estimate the antibody levels months after completion of their inoculation schedule. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, told TOI, “It has been some time after the last sero-survey in Pune. Hence, another sero-survey is required, especially after many healthcare workers have completed over six months post-vaccination. It will help in gauging whether a booster shot is required or not.” Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of the Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, said, “It would be ideal to pick people in Pune’s select pockets and test serum samples for antibody levels six months after the total vaccination. Authorities now have data on completely vaccinated individuals, who have had months elapsing after the second dose of the vaccine.” He said, “Such people could be picked for the sero-survey. If there is a declining level of antibodies, then a booster shot could be recommended. Booster shots in such cases would ensure maintenance of population immunity against Covid to keep another surge at bay.” Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, however, said evidence in western countries showed that booster shots should be given to immunocompromised patients or those at a higher risk of Covid. He said, “Antibody titers tend to reduce after a few months post-vaccination. However, the absence or reduction of antibodies in the serum does not necessarily mean an absence of immune memory, which is also induced by vaccination. So instead of only correlating sero-survey to check for circulating antibodies post-vaccination, a sero-survey is needed to detect if there are any neutralizing antibodies in the population.” Antibody titer is a type of blood test that determines the presence and level (titer) of antibodies in the blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-bat-for-sero-survey-among-a-sample-of-vaccinated-population/articleshow/87724452.cms||Neha Madaan

Around six nurses attempted to scale the parapet of the building to jump. One of the nurses suffered low blood pressure and was taken to hospital, but later she returned to join the protest. Around 11am, hundreds of nurses from all over the state blocked the entry and exit of the building for over six hours. The office staff, including the director, were locked inside and visitors were also not allowed to move till the police acted and let them out from the backdoor. The nurses raised slogans against Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and said they would end their lives if their demands for regularisation were not met. Led by Karanjit Kaur (Ludhiana), Ninder Kaur (Muktsar) and Kamaljit Kaur Patti, the NHM nurses forced the employees and Health Services and Family Welfare, Punjab (HSFWP), director to remain inside the building for hours. Patti said, “We have been pressing for our demands for regularisation of our services for the past many years. We want to be brought on a par with other ranks, but the Punjab government has been giving only assurances. Today we laid a siege to the building and will not move till we are heard and our demands met.” Many nurses were seen carrying their babies in their laps while protesting and raising slogans against the Punjab government. Director not allowed to leave The protesting nurses did not allow Om Prakash Gojra, director, health services and family welfare, Punjab, to leave the building around 4pm. As he came out, he was gheraoed by the protesters and was forced to retreat. On seeing him go back, the protesting nurses celebrated their win by clapping and raising slogans in their favour. Later, when the director told them that he had to go for a meeting to discuss their issue with the CM, they let him go around 4:30pm. They are knocking at wrong door: Director The protesting nurses’ union is knocking at the wrong door as the National Health Mission (NHM) employees aren’t governed by HSFWP, said director Om Prakash Gojra. “So, they should have protested outside the office of NHM in Sector 38 instead of Sector 34. They came to the wrong door,” he added. The NHM office is housed at Prayaas Building in Sector 38-B, while the nurses protested at Parivar Kalyan Bhavan in Sector 34.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-nurses-climb-building-in-sector-34-threaten-to-jump/articleshow/87724463.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Unfair contract conditions can be challenged: Consumer redressal panel||T’puram: In a judgement that has far-reaching consequences, Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has reserved the right to maintain petitions that challenge provisions of a contract that are unfair to a consumer. Considering a petition filed by United India Insurance challenging the maintainability of a plea by the family of a deceased fisherman in Kollam, commission president justice K Surendra Mohan ruled that as per Section 47 and 2(4) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the commission can maintain complaints against ‘unfair’ contracts. The basis of the petition was a case filed by Jessy Malar, wife of late Charles, seeking compensation for the untimely death of her husband. Charles and three others ventured into the Arabian Sea for fishing at 5am on Oct 17, 2019 from Kollam harbour. At 3pm, there was heavy thunder and lightning close to the vessel and Charles fainted. He was brought to Benziger Hospital by 4:30pm where he was declared brought dead. Charles was covered by a group insurance policy issued by United Indian Insurance in conjunction with Matsyafed. When the family tried to claim the insurance money of Rs 10 lakh, the firm refused it on the ground that Charles died of a heart attack. As per the insurance contract, ‘death due to natural cause and diseases, including heart attack’ won’t come under its coverage. But, Jessy contended that the policy provisions were arranged by Matsyafed and she had no role in it. She said the condition that the insured is not covered for ‘death due to natural cause and diseases, including heart attack’ is an unacceptable term, liable to be set aside by the commission if it exercised its power under Section 49(2) of the Consumer Protection Act (2019). Quoting an apex court order in 2006, the counsel of the insurance firm argued that the prayer for declaring the term of insurance policy as null and void on the ground that it is unfair, went against the existence of the policy and cannot be sustained. The removal of the said clause will be illegal and result in policy collapse. The counsel also pointed out that the term that is sought to be set aside by the complainant is not an unfair condition. The commission dismissed the arguments as untenable and said it has power to entertain such complaints, against ‘unfair agreement conditions’, as per the provisions of the new act passed by Parliament in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/unfair-contract-conditions-can-be-challenged-consumer-redressal-panel/articleshow/87724494.cms||B S Anilkumar

The girl’s body was found in a cane field on Saturday midnight. Her family had refused to cremate the body on Sunday as they wanted the culprits to be arrested, compensation and a government job for a family member. It was only after Pilibhit district magistrate Pulkit Khare spoke with them that they relented. Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit superintendent of police, told TOI, “The autopsy report said there were multiple injuries on the girl's body and she died of strangulation. The forensic report will confirm the allegation of sexual assault. We are expecting a breakthrough in this case soon.” Locals at the village say that people often gather and consume liquor near the sugarcane field where the girl’s body was found. The village pradhan had earlier lodged a complaint to the effect at the local police outpost but no action was taken. A few empty beer bottles and wrappers of snacks were found near the body. Former state minister and Samajwadi Party leader Hemraj Verma, who has been in constant touch with the bereaved family, has demanded the state government to provide Rs 1 crore as compensation to the victim’s family. SP workers also took out a candle march on Monday evening as a mark of protest against increasing crime in the state. Verma told TOI, “The BJP government in the state is unable to control the crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/as-cops-hunt-for-killers-pilibhit-schoolgirl-is-cremated/articleshow/87722998.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Department officials said hostel facilities are being inspected and a notification regarding their reopening will be issued soon. Colleges reopened in October but several outstation students have not been able to attend in-person classes as hostels remained closed. Joint director of the department of higher and technical education, Kirankumar Bondar, said hostels in colleges affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune district are ready for reopening. “Most hostels are operated by the management of the institutions. Some hostels are under the revenue department and institutions have been asked to take charge so that they can be reopened for students,” said Bondar. Many hostels were being used by the district administration during the pandemic as quarantine centres. Some of these hostels are still under the district administration. A student based in Solapur, Ashraf Baig, said he has not been able to return to Pune despite enrolling at a college hostel as it has not opened. “I have got both doses of the vaccine but cannot stay in private accommodation as it is unaffordable. Students had also written to the college authorities to open the hostel and promised that we would follow all precautionary measures. If the government allows hostels to reopen, it will be good for us,” said Baig.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/college-hostels-gear-up-to-reopen-soon-providing-relief-to-outstation-students/articleshow/87724467.cms||---

The crime branch said a non-bailable warrant was issued by the court on October 30, but the trio were not available at their addresses. It alleged they had gone into hiding after a case was filed. The plea also invoked a section through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. On Wednesday, a non-bailable warrant was issued against Singh, the third such.

They were allegedly mowed down by Ashish's convoy. In retaliatory action, farmers had allegedly lynched three BJP workers. Special prosecution officer S P Yadav said that since the investigation report has mentioned Ashish as the prime accused in the case and a special investigation team (SIT) had gathered sufficient evidence against him, bail was denied to him and two of his aides, Luv Kush Rana and Ashish Pandey. District government counsel (DGC) Arvind Tripathi told TOI, “The defence hid Ashish's criminal history. Also, an SDM and a circle officer recorded statements saying Ashish was seen running away from the spot after the farmers were mowed down." He said this was corroborated by over 60 farmers who had given statements that suggested Ashish's presence at the incident spot. "The statements also said that he was sitting inside the Thar jeep in the co-driver seat. His presence was further confirmed by the SIT investigation, which said that the mobile location of Ashish showed that he was there during the violence. The investigation also showed that he ran towards a cane field firing towards the farmers. The ballistic report of his rifle was also found positive in the forensic test. Since allegations against Ashish are grave and the investigation is still pending, the judge rejected the bail plea,” Tripathi explained. Judge Mukesh Mishra had in the afternoon reserved the judgment after arguments between district government counsel Arvind Tripathi and Ashish Mishra's counsel Awadesh Singh. The judgment was later pronounced in the evening. Advocate Harjeet Singh, who is representing the farmers, said a key contention during the arguments was disclosure of past criminal history. “The bail application was filed by the brother-in-law of Ashish and the application mentioned he didn’t have any criminal history. However, the police report said that he had two FIRs registered against him in the past at the Tikunia police station. Over 60 farmers had seen him at the spot firing from inside the jeep. We are happy his bail was rejected,” he said. Ashish's counsel Awadesh Singh said that he will approach the high court as his client is "innocent and was framed because he is the son of a minister." He added: "The old cases against him are already closed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-was-at-kheri-violence-spot-govt-counsel-tells-court-bail-denied-to-ashish/articleshow/87723016.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The incident took place at around 3.05pm when three employees of Maa Janki petrol pump located at Hajipur in Vaishali district were on their way to R-Block in Patna to deposit the money in the Bank of India branch. The criminals, who had covered their faces with helmets and masks, stopped the car alleging that it had dashed against their motorbikes. As soon as the driver of the car stopped, the robbers snatched the bag containing the money. Three employees of the fuel outlet, including manager Anunay Kumar, were travelling in the car. The bag was held by one Sanjeet on the back seat. He was assaulted with pistol butts when he resisted the loot. The manager told the police that they had left the former minister’s residence at New Patliputra Colony for the bank with the cash. The robbers waylaid the car near Atal Path at Indrapuri road number 10 and looted the money at gunpoint. They then drove away towards R-Block roundabout. City SP (central) Ambarish Rahul along with police officials of the nearby police stations rushed to the site and also quizzed the car driver, Chandan Sharma, a resident of Lalganj in Vaishali, and Sanjeet, a native of Saran district. Authoritative sources said SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma later visited the residence of Veena Shahi, the daughter-in-law of former Union minister late L P Shahi. City SP Rahul said the CCTV footage along the Atal Path was being obtained to ascertain the identity of the gang involved in the loot. “We will crack the case very soon,” he told reporters. The former minister’s son-in-law, Harshendra, told the police that the employees used to carry the money in the same vehicle for a long time. “The staff have been associated with the agency for long,” Anunay, the manager of Maa Janki Transport Service, told the investigating officials. Earlier, a trader was shot at and robbed of Rs15 lakh under the Malsalami police station area in Patna City late Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs41-41-lakh-looted-from-ex-ministers-petrol-pump-staff/articleshow/87724490.cms||Ramashankar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anticipatory bail for CA booked in bogus surety case||Mumbai: In a relief for a city chartered accountant (CA), the Bombay high court recently granted him pre-arrest bail after he was booked for submitting a bogus surety. Justice Surendra Tavade passed the order on a plea by Behram Pardiwala (66) who was booked on May 27 by D B Marg police station for cheating by personation, forgery and using as true a certificate known to be false. His petition said he has been practising since 36 years and provided services to high net individuals and respected personalities such as former attorney general late Soli Sorabjee and jeweller Dinshah Gazdar and their families. Pardiwala was a co-testator of a man’s will. After his death, his brother in December 2015 filed a complaint that the will was forged and fabricated. Pardiwala surrendered to Tardeo police, was jailed and released on bail in March 2016. In 2018, it was found that the man who stood surety for him had submitted false and bogus documents. When Pardiwala learnt an offence was registered against Padwekar, he approached the magistrate who allowed him to furnish cash security. Pardiwala’s advocates Sujay Kantawala and Neha Ahuja said the FIR does not attribute any illegality to him. Justice Tavade, in his November 4 order, said it was the duty of Pardiwala’s advocate to verify the document of surety, which he had verified and after scrutiny it was accepted. “Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicant (Pardiwala) was concerned with the preparation of the document of his surety. Prima facie, no offence is made out against the applicant,” he said, directing that if arrested, Pardiwala will be released on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 with a condition to attend the police station whenever called.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-anticipatory-bail-for-ca-booked-in-bogus-surety-case/articleshow/87725421.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Four people, including three salesmen at the showroom, have been arrested. All the chains have been recovered. Sanjay Goel, director of the jewellery showroom, has announced a cash reward of Rs 2.50 lakh for the probe team for 100% recovery of the stolen chains. Abhishek Yadav, Muzaffarnagar SSP, said a joint team of the crime branch and city police was formed to crack the case. After exhaustive scanning of CCTV footage of the area, sleuths noticed a man with a slight limp leave the shop and disappear after walking some distance to an area where CCTV cameras were not installed. A few hours later, another man was seen in the area with a different set of clothes but with the same gait. Suspicious, the sleuths zeroed in on one Tushar, a resident of Muzaffarnagar . Based on the information he provided, police arrested a sales assistant at the shop, Abhishek, and two of his colleagues, Kanhaiya and Ketan. The SSP claimed, “Abhishek, Kanhaiya and Ketan planned the heist. They also bought Tushar, alias Lucky, in the plan. Posing as a customer, Tushar entered the jewellery shop on November 7. The salesmen had already put a plastic box filled with the gold chains at a select spot, which Tushar picked up and walked out.” The robbery was “discovered” later and police summoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/distinct-gait-helps-police-nab-jewel-thieves/articleshow/87723752.cms||Mohd Dilshad

But the manufacturer and retailer of Jaipur Kurti brand on ecommerce platforms like Myntra, Flipkart, and Ajio says the real growth phase is waiting to be unwrapped soon. “We have created a roadmap to reach Rs 400 crore revenue by 2026. For that we need to raise capital. Multiple options are on the table, including diluting additional equity at the right price,” explains Mundhra who listed Nandani Creation on NSE’s SME bourse in 2017 and now traded on the main board of the exchange. Part of the plan is also to strengthen the company’s online platform jaipurkurti.com and go offline with 60 stores. Currently, it has opened four in Jaipur and one in Sriganganagar. Another five will come up by the end of the current financial year. “Some of the funds will be used for rebooting our online platform and building an offline presence. The rest will be invested in creating more production capacity. Whatever we produce today flies off the shelves. That is why we need growth capital now,” adds Mundhra. While Jaipur Kurti has enriched its product portfolio with indo-western wear, Mundhra says the soul of the company resides in ethnic wear. “India lives in its traditions and culture. Holi, Diwali, Rakhi, weddings and a host of festivals and rituals create demand for ethnic wear round the year. That has continued to support our growth and will remain at the core. However, to give variety to our customers, we are expanding our trendy ensembles,” says Mundhra. Recalling his early days, Mundhra says that formal education never interested him but later he wanted to make a mark and create his own identity. After making some money from trading, he took up job works for kurtis. But a visit to Delhi in early 2012 became a turning point. “After seeing Jabong and Snapdeal billboards in a metro station I thought this is going to be the new theme for young India. On the same day, after reaching Jaipur I booked jaipurkurti.com domain and the rest is history,” says Mundhra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sales-boy-to-kurti-king-jaipurs-mundhra-on-a-roll/articleshow/87725457.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

He said there are several apprehensions about the project and government is committed to clearing them. People should understand that the project will be an integral part of state’s development. Vijayan also sought their support to exert pressure on Centre to set up more natural calamity warning systems, centres in Kerala. Centre hasn’t considered our long-pending demand of setting up a Doppler radar at Wayanad-Kozhikode border. At present, state has two such radars but it is insufficient. It needs such systems in every district due to the prevailing situation, he said. Vijayan said the Centre was encroaching on the powers of the governments in several sectors. There is a need to strengthen ties between state and Centre in sharing development, welfare initiatives and MPs must stand with the government to ensure that Kerala’s demands are fulfilled by Centre. GST arrears and vaccine supply are the examples of such efforts, he added. Kerala must get GST compensation for five consecutive years after July 2022. For this, MPs must put in extra efforts and get it sanctioned from the Centre. The state has concerns over the proposed power sector reforms and the port policy. The restrictions imposed on states for releasing disaster funds should be relaxed. Vijayan sought their help to secure sanctions for the light metro projects in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode.

This has disappointed visitors coming for bird watching from the lake's regulatory end. UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai says the cut will be filled by the UT engineering department as soon as water level goes down, after which the visitors can enjoy bird watching from the regulatory end. However, visitors can still enter the Sukhna Lake nature trail and enjoy a walk and bird watching from the Lake Club side. This monsoon, the UT administration had opened Sukhna floodgates on five occasions as the water had reached near danger mark of 1,163 feet. A senior UT official says they had opened gates as a precautionary measure to avoid flood-like situation in Baltana, Zirakpur. The gates were opened on September 30, September 23, September 21, August 14 and August 9. Two floodgates had to be opened in August last year after the water level crossed the danger mark. On September 24, 2018, incessant rain in the catchment area had forced officials to open two floodgates. At that time, these were opened after a gap of 10 years. After opening of the floodgates, the Sukhna Choe carries the excess water to the Ghaggar River.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cut-on-nature-trail-to-make-way-for-water-from-catchment-area/articleshow/87724522.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

They are undergoing treatment in a private hospital at Peelamedu. A health official with the city corporation said both the infected were elderly people - a 63-year-old woman from RS Puram and another 68-year-old woman from Peelamedu. “They are not related and hail from different parts of the city.” The official said the two had symptoms similar to Covid-19 and approached the private hospital for Covid-19 testing. While they tested negative for Covid-19, they were found to be infected with swine flu. The official said the family members and contacts of the infected people were being closely monitored. “Presently, Tamiflu tablets are being distributed to the people who came in contact and the family members of the infected. We have asked them to stay in isolation.” He said 64 medical camps were being conducted daily in the city limits by the urban primary health centres to monitor dengue, Covid-19 and swine flu cases. The official said there was no need to panic. He, however, advised the residents to follow precautionary measures. “People have to wash hands frequently, wear face masks, disinfect floors and avoid touching surfaces often. The swine flu symptoms are similar to that of Covid-19. People have to isolate themselves immediately, if they develop symptoms. They have to be in isolation until they test negative for the infectious diseases.” Swine flu infected people, he said, could recover without any complications. “However, it can, as in the case of Covid-19, create complications for the people with comorbidities.” City corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, meanwhile, asked the people to keep their houses and surroundings clean, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. “People should approach medical camps or the nearest government hospital, if they have any symptoms like fever, cough and headache.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/swine-flu-surfaces-in-city-two-test-ve-for-infection/articleshow/87725449.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Pay Rs 22-cr property tax arrears: MC notice to PU||Chandigarh: After an exercise of almost six months, the municipal corporation has finally prepared about Rs 22-crore property tax arrears of Panjab University (PU) and sent a notice. It has asked PU to pay as soon as possible or face action as per rules. This is the biggest property tax amount notice issued to any single authority during the ongoing current financial year.MC’s tax branch had conducted a detailed survey of all the buildings and areas of PU to calculate the amount. Since the campus is quite big with many multi-storey buildings, the authority had deployed its technical and other staff for the physical survey. “The arrears were prepared considering all buildings in the records. Earlier, the residential areas of the university were not taken into account, and it is a big chunk of the campus. But this time, all houses of the PU employees have been considered,” sources said.Earlier, there was ambiguity over the amount to be paid and buildings covered under the property tax. The MC had multiple meetings with the officials concerned. PU officials met senior MC officers and submitted their own records too, which differed from the civic records, so it was decided by both PU and MC to have a fresh survey.Since the property tax is one of the significant sources of revenue, the civic body has been putting in all efforts to collect the maximum amount. The defaulters are being sent notices and some properties have also been sealed in the recent past.PU paid Rs 68L tax Panjab University has deposited property tax of around Rs 68 lakh for the current financial year. But now the university has to pay a huge amount of arrears to avoid further action by the municipal corporation.-----Rs 46.5cr taxAs per records, the municipal corporation has received Rs 46.5 crore in property tax from both residential and commercial properties. Out of this, Rs 13 crore have come from the residential properties and remaining Rs 33.5 crore from commercial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pay-rs-22-cr-property-tax-arrears-mc-notice-to-pu/articleshow/87724513.cms||Deepak Yadav

They heard MSRTC’s contempt plea even as the union was not willing to end the strike. The union’s advocate Gunaratan Sadavarte refused to participate in the HC-appointed committee’s second meeting on Tuesday, saying it has no faith in it. He said 36 employees had died by suicide and two attempted immolation. “Nobody should end their life in such a way. Inform your (union) leader that every life is precious,” said Justice Varale. The judges said when a worker, who is the only earning member, dies by suicide, it is a loss of the entire family. “It is our appeal, an earnest request, that nobody should take such an extreme step,” said Justice Varale. Sadavarte thereafter agreed to submit the union’s memorandum and suggestions to the committee. The judges directed the state to place minutes before the court on November 22, adding “that minutes may also indicate the progress or otherwise. Senior advocate S U Kamdar for MSRTCsaid people in rural areas were facing hardships in the absence of other convenient and economic transport. He said some employees are cooperating and the union must not stop them. Sadavarte claimed 92,000 staff are supporting the union, “When they are not going to drive vehicles, where is the question of disturbing?” he asked.

---||Jaipur||Report on contractual staffers almost ready, says energy minister BD Kalla||JAIPUR: Water and energy minister BD Kalla has said the three-year-old committee of contractual workers constituted by his government had almost prepared its report on the working conditions of the staffers on contract. He issued a statement mentioning that during the previous government in the state, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, was the chairman of the panel constituted for contractual workers, but it did nothing during its entire tenure for the interests of contractual workers. Kalla said regarding some of the issues raised by the Rathore in Bikaner on Monday, the report was almost ready. In such a situation, those who were sitting idle for five years had no right to talk about contract workers, he said. The minister said that ever since the committee of contractual workers was formed during the tenure of the present government, about 10,000 contractual workers had been regularised with bonus marks under the medical and health department, whereas no benefit was given to the contract workers at the time of the previous government. Kalla said most of the committees constituted by the state government under his chairmanship had completed their work on time.  The work of committees related to the naming of schools after freedom fighters and implementation of the public manifesto was going to be done regularly. Their meetings were also being organised regularly and work was pending with the committees, he said. Kalla also said when Rathore was a cabinet minister in the previous government, the state government had handed over the work of electricity in Bikaner, Bharatpur, and Kota to private companies for 20 years and Rathore should now tell under which rule its 'contract' should be cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/report-on-contractual-staffers-almost-ready-says-energy-min-kalla/articleshow/87725462.cms||---

The vaccination drive has touched 90% of the target population for the first dose in Dakshina Kannada. “If we are not free from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is difficult for the nation to grow economically. There is no shortage of vaccines and it has no adverse effect. Hence, people should understand that they are responsible not only towards the health of their families, but society too,” he said. Special emphasis should be given to ensure adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour in educational institutions, he said, and directed officials to visit schools and colleges regularly. “Submit a report to me through the zilla panchayat CEO,” he said. Deputy director of public instructions (DDPI) Malleswamy said that the attendance in classes from 1 to 5 was 51%, while it was 69% in classes from 6-8 and 81% in classes from 9-10. The district has 210 children who lost parents, including five losing both the parents, he said. The Lokayukta directed officials to expedite the distribution of the government’s ex-gratia. On the vaccination of children, the DDPI said the district had identified 2,467 physically-challenged children. A vaccine drive will begin soon after the stock arrives, he added. The Lokayukta visited a government higher primary school in Gandhinagar and the vaccine centre at the Wenlock District Hospital. Complaints against MCC officials The Lokayukta said that his office had received complaints against two members of staff of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) who were creating obstruction in public work.

He also said that prima facie, the demand for a merger is not appropriate and there has been no consensus yet. Meanwhile, BJP leaders continued to back striking unions, while some leaders addressed a protest at Azad Maidan.

Around 85,000 employees, along with 28 different unions, are still on strike as the deadlock continued for the 19th day on Monday.

As per the data available with the Airport Authority of India (AAI) officials, the city had handled 1,112 flights in October, against 999 flights in September. However, only 56 international flights were operated last month, compared to 178 in the comparable period in 2019, when operations were normal. The dip in the international flight has affected the international passenger traffic as well. The airport has, however, recorded a 15% increase in passenger traffic last month, when the airport handled 1, 25, 053 domestic passengers and 6,824 international passengers, compared to September. “Both the passenger traffic and flight movement are on the rise every month. It shows people are confident of the safety protocols taken by the AAI. Moreover, decrease in Covid-19 infection and increase in the vaccinated population have further bolstered the confidence of fliers,” an airport official said. Flight movements were disrupted during the peak of second Covid-19 wave from May. While the airport had resumed flight operations in July, it was only after August that the airport began to record a good passenger traffic. Tour operators, meanwhile, said most of the people were flying out of the city for business and leisure activities. “Most of the flights are witnessing packed movement, thanks to the government’s decision to allow flights to operate with 100% occupancy from October 18. The airport will record more fliers this month, as we have got a few more connections in the winter schedule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flight-movement-passenger-traffic-go-up/articleshow/87725474.cms||V Devanathan

The accused, N Rajasekar, 62, a silambam and kalari instructor from Pappanaickenpalayam in the city, was booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Preliminary inquiry revealed Rajasekar was in a relationship with a woman. His friend A Muruganandam, 57, a wall painter from Mariamman Kovil Street, also tried to have an affair with the woman. Rajasekar decided to finish off Muruganandam and gave him liquor mixed with cyanide as gift on November 4. The next day morning, Muruganandam and his friends M Parthiban, 35, and S Sakthivel, 61, consumed the liquor and died. Suspecting that they had consumed the liquor mixed with thinner, the Race Course police initially registered a case under Section 174 of the CrPC and sent the dead bodies to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for autopsy. Police also sent the liquor bottle to the forensic science laboratory. The lab report found the presence of cyanide in the liquor. Immediately, police collected CCTV footage in the locality and found Rajasekar walking with Muruganandam.

Also, it is likely that the session is held in Mumbai and not Nagpur. A senior minister said that since the biennial election to the Maharashtra Legislative Council will be held on December 10, all parties have been asking the government to defer the session by at least a week. Officials, however, said that although political parties want the session to start late, a final decision will be taken by the business advisory committee which is headed by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and has representatives of all political parties. Also, due to Thackeray's recent cervical spine surgery, the session may be held in Mumbai itself this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-winter-session-of-legislature-may-be-delayed/articleshow/87725494.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Teen girl in Beed alleges rape by 400 men, including 2 cops, over 4-6 months||AURANGABAD: The Beed police probing a case of child marriage and alleged rape subsequently by several men were stunned after the 17-year-old victim claimed in a statement given to the child welfare committee that she had been raped by around 400 men, including two policemen, over the past four to six months. The girl’s statement was recorded on November 12, days after a first information report (FIR) in the case had been registered with the police. Sources said the girl was initially reluctant to lodge a complaint but gave her statement after she was counselled. The police have now taken the girl’s supplementary statement on record and launched a fresh probe. They suspect it to be a case of human trafficking and that the minor was forced into the flesh trade. When contacted, investigating officer and additional superintendent of police Kavita Nerkar said, “The girl was rescued by an NGO and brought to us, following which an offence was registered on November 8. So far, six men have been arrested and a minor boy has been detained and sent to a correctional home.” Among those arrested are the girl’s father, the man she was married off to and an alleged pimp. The girl said in her statement that she was married when she was 13 but left her husband due to alleged differences and exploitation by him. She returned to her parents’ home some time ago. She further stated that after her father molested her earlier this year, she left home in May or June and had been staying in and around the Ambajogai bus stand, from where the NGO volunteers rescued her. The police have registered a case of rape, gang rape, molestation and voluntarily causing hurt, besides invoking sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Beed superintendent of police R Raja told TOI, “Four days after registration of the FIR, the victim has alleged that she has been raped by 400 men. We are verifying the claim and will act accordingly.” DISCLAIMER: (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/girl-17-alleges-rape-by-400-men-including-2-cops-over-4-6-months/articleshow/87726664.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kota narcotics officer’s suspension to continue||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court upheld the Central Administrative Tribunal order to continue the suspension of Sahiram Meena, a former deputy narcotics commissioner of Kota, who has been accused of corruption and possession of disproportionate assets by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). Meena challenged the central administrative tribunal’s order citing that the ACB failed to file chargesheet within three months of his arrest and the extension of suspension from service was illegal. The ACB raided his office and residence for accepting illegal gratification. He was placed under suspension on February 1, 2019. A criminal case was registered against him after ten days. Later on, another case of disproportionate assets to his known source of income was registered against him. His suspension was extended on April 24, 2019, which was challenged by him in the administrative tribunal. The tribunal had upheld his suspension. The petitioner then challenged the tribunal order in the high court. The high court, while upholding the decision of the tribunal, said, "We do not consider that the order passed by the tribunal suffers from any illegality or perversity to call for interference. We cannot resist mentioning that the petitioner was facing serious charges of corruption. The petitioner was suspended on February 1, 2019, and retired from service upon attaining the age of superannuation on July 31, 2019.

---||Kochi||Police summon hotel owner, driver||Kochi: Police probing the Chakkaraparambu accident – in which three persons, including two models were killed – said that the statements of the hotel owner, where the victims attended a party on the night of the accident, and the driver of another car which followed their vehicle will be crucial in identifying if there was more to the accident than what meets the eye. Police have identified that the driver of the Audi car, which was seen driving close to the victim’s car, too had attended the party at the hotel in Fort Kochi. A senior officer said that summons were sent to the hotel owner and the car driver and they are likely to appear before the investigation team on Tuesday. Police were still considering it as a drunken driving incident but the inability to get access to full recordings at the party had led to some suspicions. “An investigation is underway and after collecting more witness statements, we will get better clarity on the incidents,” said an officer. Police are also investigating if something, other than the influence of alcohol, caused the driver to increase the car’s speed. On Monday, the investigation team interrogated the driver, Abdul Rahman (25), also the accused and sole survivor in the case. Though police had sought a three-day custody on Monday morning, the court only granted custody of the accused till the end of the day. He was later granted bail by the court. The accused, who was remanded on Monday evening, is likely to execute bail on Tuesday. Earlier, his counsel had opposed police custody, arguing that the youth was undergoing severe mental trauma and that he was physically weak after being injured. The case pertains to the accident that occurred in the early hours of Nov 1, when the car rammed a tree at Chakkaraparambu while trying to avoid hitting a bike. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer and Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan died on the spot. The third passenger Mohammad Ashiq (25) later died at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-summon-hotel-owner-driver/articleshow/87724561.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Not up for jab? Street plays, lucky draws may change your mind||Nagpur/Pune: From offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students to motivate the unvaccinated, health officials in Maharashtra are going the extra mile to woo citizens to take the Covid shot.The officials are also using creative methods like organising street plays and providing doorstep counselling to win citizens over in favour of vaccination, in addition to deploying routine educational tools like posters, hoardings and mass media.The above 18 population in she state is 9.14 crore. Of them, 6.9 crore have taken the first dose. However, the remaining 2.23 crore have not yet taken even a single shot.State immunisation officer Sachin Desai said, “We are doing every bit to motivate and convince the state’s unvaccinated population of above 18 years to take the shot. District collectors are making use of different creative methods to achieve 100% vaccination coverage.”State health minister Rajesh Tope recently told collectors across the state to opt for measures aimed at persuasion and not coercion to boost vaccination. The state is working towards giving at least one dose to all the 9.14 crore eligible population by November 30.In Chandrapur, the civic body is offering expensive electronic luxury and home appliances under a lucky draw to ensure that the 39,000 unvaccinated citizens come forward to get the first shot.Municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite said, “We don’t want to leave any stone unturned. An LED TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine and 10 mixer grinders would be awarded to the citizens through lucky draw. This move is certainly improving the vaccination numbers to some extent in Chandrapur.”“The beneficiaries have to drop a photocopy of his/her first dose in the special box kept outside every vaccination centre. We are going to announce the lucky winners after November 24,” Mohite said.Chandrapur district administration is also pasting stickers outside commercial establishments where staff is unvaccinated so that customers have a choice whether they want to enter such a shop or not.In Yavatmal, where over 10 lakh citizens are yet to take the first dose, the administration is seeking the help of schoolkids. “We are telling parents that they need to take the shot for the safety of their kids. We are also involving school kids to motivate unvaccinated family members and neighbours,” said district collector Amol Yedge.Akola resident deputy collector Sanjay Khadse said they would give ‘sanman patra’ (felicitation certificates) to kids who are able to convince unvaccinated people in homes and localities.Nashik district’s health official Kailas Bhoye said, “We are taking help of religious heads in Malegaon to create awareness to increase vaccination.”Vaccination in Nashik city and rural parts of the district has crossed 74%, but has remained slow in the limits of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) where only 27% of the beneficiaries have been administered the first dose.Aurangabad’s immunisation officer Smita Nalgirkar said concerted efforts were being taken to enhance vaccination coverage among the unvaccinated.“We are carrying out door-to-door visits of health teams to reach out. Besides, we are also making phone calls and spreading public awareness in general,” Nalgirkar said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 3 had held a virtual meeting involving authorities from Aurangabad and other districts where vaccination coverage is relatively lower.(Inputs from Prasad Joshi from Aurangabad & Tushar Pawar from Nashik)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-up-for-jab-street-plays-lucky-draws-may-change-your-mind/articleshow/87723102.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Over 42.4 lakh people late for second Covid-19 jab in West Bengal||Kolkata: Over 42.4 lakh people in Bengal, who received their first vaccine doses, have not turned up for their second doses in time. Even as the state government is trying to step up its second dose vaccination drive in November, the reluctance of people to take the second dose is is baffling experts. Since November 8, the state government has been trying to trace and vaccinate the people who have not taken their second doses. As part of the special drives on November 8, 4.3 lakh people were administered their second doses — the highest in recent months. Since then, the state is trying to prioritise the second dose recipients and inoculate 2 lakh recipients every day. On Sunday, this has dipped to 40,674 second dose recipients. After the Centre’s nod, Bengal has already announced it will soon launch the house-to-house search for eligible adults who are yet to get vaccinated. Bengal’s vaccination drive is moving at a fast pace with around 8.5 crore people being vaccinated. Over six crore people of the seven crore eligible population has already received one dose while the other 2.5 crore people have received both their doses. The skewed first-dose and second-dose recipients in Bengal are also throwing up an anomaly, sources said. A senior health official said, “At several meetings district officials and KMC officials have been sensitised on the need to step up the second dose vaccination drive. Those, who have not taken their second doses, need to be identified and encouraged for vaccination. The Centre is likely to provide some clarity on the booster doses by the year-end. Given this situation, second dose vaccination needs to be completed in time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-42-4l-late-for-2nd-jab-enough-shots-says-state/articleshow/87724554.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Kasganj cops find ‘kidnapped’ girl at railway station, produce her in court||AGRA: A week after a 16-year-old girl was allegedly “kidnapped” by 22-year-old Mohammad Altaf -- who was later found "hanging" from a 3ft-high water tap in the washroom of the thana on November 9 – the Kasganj police on Monday produced her in court for recording her statement, claiming she was found “sitting alone” at the town's railway station on Friday evening. Police said they are yet to nab the “unknown” friend with whom Altaf had allegedly "sent the girl into hiding". This development came even as videos of her with Altaf, sitting and laughing together, surfaced on Monday, raising more uncomfortable questions for the Kasganj police, five of whom have been suspended and a few unnamed ones booked for murder. SP Kasganj Botre Rohan Pramod said, “Altaf and the minor girl were in a relationship. Altaf had persuaded the girl to leave her home with his friend and planned to catch up with them later after arranging some money. Altaf’s friend Rinku took her to Mathura and Agra. On the basis of inputs from a police surveillance team, the girl was rescued from Kasganj railway station. Rinku managed to escape, and efforts are on to nab him. The girl will be handed over to her family on Tuesday after the court proceedings are over.” Police said the girl is being kept at a ‘One Stop Centre’ until the court formalities are over. Such centres provide integrated support and assistance under one roof to women affected by violence. The FIR, filed by the girl's father against Altaf and his "unknown" friend, stated that she had left her home with Altaf's friend, "taking her clothes and academic certificates along to Delhi". The FIR was registered at Sadar Kotwali police station under section 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the Indian Penal Code. TOI had earlier reported that an FIR for kidnapping against Altaf was registered after he died in police custody on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Altaf’s father, Chand Miyan -- citing the TOI report -- sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday demanding a judicial or CBI investigation in the alleged murder of his son. Miyan also demanded that a second postmortem of his son’s body -- which was buried on Wednesday -- be conducted by doctors from All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). Miyan said he and his wife will be forced to go on a hunger strike if the chief minister does not hear his prayers. While police claimed that Altaf hanged himself with the drawstring of his jacket’s hoodie in the washroom of the lockup at Kotwali Sadar police station, his family disputed the theory. The autopsy report mentioned “asphyxia” as the cause of death, but makes no mention of any bruises or injuries on the rest of the body. The family members had claimed that they were not shown the body before the postmortem on Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-cops-find-kidnapped-girl-at-rly-stn-produce-her-in-court/articleshow/87723809.cms||Deepak Lavania

Milind was among the 26 Maoists who were killed in Gadchiroli near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border on Saturday. A teary-eyed Viplab, also a social activist, received the body of Milind after post-mortem at Gadchiroli district hospital. The family took the body to Yavatmal for the last rites. His wife, Angela Sontakey, too was present. The cops also collected samples from his kin for DNA sampling. Viplab said Milind’s death was a second blow to the Teltumbde’s family within a year after the arrest of his elder brother Anand in Elgar Parishad case. He added that his uncle’s death was somewhat mysterious as none with him survived. “The family would have a discussion about the encounter. We will also speak to Angela about it and later take a decision about our future course of action,” he said. The lawyer said his uncle had left family in 1996 stating he intended to work and dedicate his life for the masses, especially the deprived and downtrodden. “When my grandmother (Milind’s mother) tried to hold him back, he told her that she should live happily with her four other sons and three daughters,” he said adding Milind was loved by all in the family. “My uncle did not even turn up for the funeral of his father or another brother,” said Viplab. It’s learnt Milind, who was childless, was a leader of workers’ union while working with Western Coalfields Limited (WCL). “He (Milind) was a well-known leader of workers’ union in Chandrapur and Wani belt,” said Viplab and added that his uncle was an active and popular social worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/milind-died-for-the-cause-of-displaced-and-jal-jungle-jameen/articleshow/87723112.cms||Soumitra Bose

Chandrasekaran added that "India must use this decade – or techade, which is the right term for the country - to go from $3 trillion to $12 trillion by 2031.” “China really took off between 2000 and 2010 and went from being a US$1.2 trillion economy to a US$6 trillion one, driven by manufacturing. It did it in partnership with the USA. In this techade, India needs to use technology to triple its GDP from $3 trillion to $12 trillion by 2031," he said. He added, “We need to create tech city clusters with connectivity, skill ecosystems and access to risk capital where Indian talent learns in India and transforms India. The country must focus now on modern technologies and data.” Sydena Mufaddal Saifuddin, AMU chancellor, while congratulating Chandrasekaran and lauding the role played by the Tata Group, said that "a business can only be considered truly profitable if it is a means to improving the lives of others."

In most of the cases, the Covid test reports that led to a scare among people have been negative. Experts said the overlapping symptoms will persist till the end of the month as other viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and rhinovirus remain active. These are the normal seasonal viruses that have been on the prowl since Durga Puja, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology, Raja Dhar. He added that these symptoms would be more common than Covid now. At Peerless Hospital, positivity rate has been 7%-8% over the last one week. “While most of the positive cases are mild ones barring those seeking hospitalizations, a vast majority of those undergoing tests at our hospital have been negative and have other viruses. Influenza A seems to be the most common one but the symptoms are similar to Covid,” said internal medicine consultant, Arindam Biswas At AMRI Hospitals, the number of tests has been around 200 a day while the positivity rate has dropped below 5%. “Most of the people are getting tested with Covid-like symptoms that are turning out to be non-Covid virus,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Positivity rate has dropped to around 10% at Medica Superspecialty Hospital from 25% till early-November. “We are testing around 200 each day and most of the people are suffering from non-Covid viral attacks. But the symptoms are very close,” said Medica chairperson, Alok Roy. There has been a sharp spurt in influenza cases due to the temperature change triggered by the frequent drizzles over the last two days, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist, Sauren Panja. He said RSV has also been striking children. It causes infection in the lungs and respiratory distress that is leading to a Covid scare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/overlapping-signs-trigger-cov-scare-many-scramble-for-tests/articleshow/87724560.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Headed by Konark Rai, who hails from Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district, SASTRA, which operates under the aegis of Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU) in Gujarat, among other things aims to “elevate sprouting innovators and facilitate an efficient work environment dedicated to the advancement in the domain of national security.” Stating that it will particularly focus on integrating modern technologies and relevant doctrines to support the security forces of India and its allies, the incubation centre said the primary objective is to facilitate a three-way engagement between academia, industry and the government for innovation, incubation, indigenisation and technology acceleration in the security sector. “The country needed SASTRA because homegrown innovators lacked a platform backed by the ministry of home affairs that could help in taking security innovations to the next level. Launched in September 2020, SASTRA is currently supporting six startups related to autonomous systems including drones and boats. Most of the prototypes are ready and final products are set for deployment,” Rai, managing director, SASTRA, told TOI. Pointing to how the association is a pioneering effort that would strengthen national security with emphasis on civil defence fusion, Rai said that RRU has now signed an agreement on its behalf to commercialise innovations developed and patented by the navy. Rai, who started his schooling at Bishop Cottons Boys’ School in Bengaluru later studied at Sri Sathya Sai Loka Seva School, Alike and St Victor’s School in Puttur and did his graduation from Gujarat National Law University before working as a political and policy analyst in the United Nations. Elaborating about the agreement, Rai said the navy has agreed to assign licenses of four innovations developed and patented by them — surgical gowns called ‘Navrakshak’; oxygen recycling system called ‘Aadyant’; a low-cost digital stethoscope called ‘Spandan’ and technology for a dental dome: a ‘mobile micro-dental clinical amplifying bio-aerosol protection’ — to SASTRA for commercialising. “The navy has a wide range of innovations for which patent applications have already been filed. Through NIIO (Naval Innovation and Indigenisation Organisation), it has agreed to assign the license to SASTRA, which will manage and commercialise such products by entering into Transfer of Technology (ToT) agreements with select MSMEs to ensure that products gets mass produced for the larger benefit of the society,” Rai said. The NIIO, launched on August 13, 2020, puts in place dedicated structures for the navy to interact with academia and industry towards fostering innovation and indigenisation for self-reliance in defence. “At SASTRA, we work towards an Atmarakshit Bharath and at the service of those serving the nation,” Rai, whose parents Pramod Kumar Rai and T Shobha Rai are based in Puttur, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ktaka-man-heads-centre-aimed-at-commercialising-security-innovations/articleshow/87723740.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

On Monday, Team TOI visited Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s headquarters in Civil Lines, district collector’s office, high court and Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Giripeth off Amravati Road to find out implementation of the norm.At collector’s office, an employee was deputed at the entry point to check vaccination status of the visitors. Over 600 visitors were checked and only the fully vaccinated carrying a proof were allowed to proceed to meet collector R Vimala. However, there was no verification at rest of the offices on the same premises. When pointed out, the collector said, “No one is allowed to enter my office without showing vaccination proof. It is sad if it is not being followed at other places, though we have given orders for strict implementation.”At NMC, two employees were tasked to verify vaccination status, but they didn’t stop anyone to ascertain it. One of them said the civic health team remains there only till 2pm and leaves after it. The health team vaccinates the unvaccinated visitor in case they are willing and then they are instantly allowed entry.There was no check or deployment of any staff at the high court and RTO. Team TOI found visitors were not even wearing mask properly, which is also compulsory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-must-for-entry-fizzles-out-at-govt-offices/articleshow/87723132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi preps for liquor-buying high, but expect dry run to begin with||NEW DELHI: The experience of buying liquor in the city will get transformed from Wednesday when huge stores will replace the existing small ones, which resemble cabins and are dirty and stuffy. The new stores would be like showrooms and people would be able to walk through, explore the stock on the shelves and pick the liquor they like. All existing 600 state-run shops would close down on Tuesday according to the new excise policy that seeks to make the government exit the liquor business. The 850-odd new mega liquor stores opening under the new excise policy are nearly ready and most of them are getting final touches. Within a few days, all of them would be ready to welcome customers. The transition is likely to push Delhi into a liquor crisis for a brief period because all 600 government-run shops would close on Tuesday night, but not as many new ones would be opening the same day. The last week has been tough for buyers as they have been experiencing a growing liquor crisis. The existing shops stopped replacing the stock because they were in an exit mode. They wanted to sell everything before winding up. Many regular buyers TOI spoke to said they were finding it difficult to get their preferred brands and had to stand in long queues outside the shops to buy liquor. “I didn’t get the brand I wanted even after checking out three shops in east Delhi. This had never occurred in the past. The shelves of most shops were almost empty and they were just selling the remaining stock,” said Dhirendra Tanwar, an east Delhi resident. On October 1, around 250 private liquor shops shut down under the new excise policy and the pressure of the demand immediately shifted to the 600 state-run shops. These shops were directed by the government to increase their stocks to meet the sudden rise in demand. The queues outside the shops got longer due to the demand-supply gap. Delhi government is making all efforts to ensure that a liquor crisis doesn’t occur. It has given provisional licences to over 350 stores, which means they can start sales. In all, 206 brands have been registered till now. “Ten wholesale licensees have procured 9 lakh litres of liquor of various brands so far. Delhi is not likely to slip into a liquor crisis due to the transition into the new regime from November 17,” said a government official. However, a trader said under the old regime around 400 brands were registered, which meant people looking for the other 194 brands were likely to be disappointed. “There was a delay in giving provisional licences by the excise department, which also delayed opening of shops. The granting of licences should have been fast-tracked,” added the trader. Under the new excise policy, Delhi has been divided into 32 zones with 8-10 wards each having 27 liquor stores on average. It is estimated that Delhi government would earn Rs 10,000 crore annually as excise revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-preps-for-liquor-buying-high-but-expect-dry-run-to-begin-with/articleshow/87724584.cms||AlokKNMishra

Tomar alleged that last month, he was abducted from the Civil Lines area by armed men in a car. He claimed that former MLA Vijay Yadav was in the car and he was made to speak with DP Yadav over the phone. Tomar claimed, “Over the phone, DP Yadav threatened me and told me to pay Rs 10 crore before Diwali or else my family would be killed. I was also forced to sign a few blank papers at gunpoint before I was released.” Police said Tomar had a property dispute with the accused for the past few years. Tomar claimed that he had been receiving threat calls for some time but he did not pay up.

Hence, they were given priority as frontline workers even before government officers for vaccination. Since many have still not taken their jab, we came up with this new initiative,” municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite told TOI. If shopkeepers and employees are found to be unvaccinated, warning stickers will be pasted prominently at the shop. The sticker will state ‘The people working in this shop have not yet received the Covid-19 preventive vaccine. Consumers should take note of this and enter at their own risk’. Mohite warned that these stickers are government property and they should not be removed without the permission of an authorized person. “Otherwise, punitive action will be taken against the shopkeeper,” he said. He informed that CMC squads have already started checking hawkers, service providers and vendors in the markets for vaccination certificate. Those lacking it are removed from the marketplace. There is also an offer of winning a lucky draw against getting the vaccine till November 24. It is mandatory for every employee of industrial estate, industry units and private offices to show proof that of at least the first dose. “Other measures like door-to-door vaccination through mobile vans, special vaccination camps and rampant awareness drives too are in place to achieve the 100% vaccination target by month end,” Mohite said.Official sources informed that of the CMC’s target of vaccinating 2.51 lakh eligible citizens, 81% have taken the first doses, while 45% have taken their second dose. Target is to achieve 100% first dose vaccination by November end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cmc-to-put-warning-stickers-on-shops-with-unvaccinated-staff/articleshow/87723139.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||Purandare shared a special bond with Nagpur, Vidarbha||Nagpur: At an event held on February 6, 2017, Shiv Shahir Babasaheb Purandare was at his usual best, narrating episodes from the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj when one of the volunteers of Laxmi Nagar Nagarik Mandal politely told him that the police wanted the programme to conclude by 10pm. This made the great orator and historian angry. “How dare they (police) ask me to stop Shiva Charitra? Tell them to go and stop illegal activities first,” said Purandare, literally scolding cops from the stage. The event, ‘Shiv Kalyan Raja’, continued at the Laxmi Nagar ground well past 10pm. Current president of the organizing committee Prasanna Mohile still remembers the anger in Purandare’s eyes. Purandare, who passed away early Monday morning, shared a special bond with Nagpur. He had great friends and followers and got the right kind of support from the region whenever in need.“In the early years of his career, Babasaheb used to go door to door to sell ‘Shiva Charitra’. Rajabhau Kulkarni was his close friend. With Kulkarni’s help, hundreds of copies were sold in Vidarbha,” recalled Prafulla Mategaonkar, a senior theatre activist who was a close associate of Purandare in Nagpur. “I consider myself fortunate to have worked with Babasaheb during the organization of Janata Raja, a mangum opus in Nagpur,” said Mategaonkar, who coordinated local artistes for the Janata Raja show. The theatrical marvel was staged four times in Nagpur and every show was house full. Shiva Charitrakar Vijayrao Deshmukh, a historian who wrote about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, recalled Purandare as a ‘Shiva Yogi’. “It was his inspiring oratory that re-introduced Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to entire Maharashtra for decades together. We had a 65-year-long association with Purandare. Establishing ‘Shiv Srushti’ was his dream and all his followers should start working to fulfill it,” said Deshmukh. Datta Shirke, coordinator of the Shiv Rajyabhishek Sohola Samiti, which organizes an annual programme to commemorate the coronation day of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Gandhi Dwar, said the inspiration came from Babasaheb Purandare. “He used to take part in all our events. Age was never a barrier for him. He used to visit Nagpur especially for our coronation day event,” recalled Shirke. Purandare’s last visit to Nagpur was in 2019 when he attended the Marathi play ‘Vasudeo Balawant Fadke’ presented by Prafulla Mategaonkar. He had interacted with the audience after the show and shared many unknown facts about the great freedom fighter. “He was a great storyteller. He had many undocumented stories which he used to share with us during our informal sessions. We will miss a man who was a personification of Maratha history,” said Mategaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/purandare-shared-a-special-bond-with-nagpur-vidarbha/articleshow/87723146.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Despite govt nod, cops penalize pvt buses plying on MSRTC routes||Nagpur: Lack of coordination between Regional Transport Office and Maharashtra Police is causing hardships for commuters of strike-hit Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus service as they are forced to travel in private modes of transportation.The state police across the region are acting against private bus operators for ferrying passengers without a valid permit.Bus operator Santosh Jog threatened to stop ferrying passengers to rural areas if the action continues. He further said that action is being taken on various routes forcing private bus operators to cancel the trip midway.Jog also stated that operators are being forced to pay fine for violating the Motor Vehicles Act. “This despite the fact that we are providing the bus service as per the order of the state government,” he said.After MSRTC employees launched their strike, from November 10 the RTO resumed the bus operation with the help of private operators. Since then, the transport department here in Nagpur has been operating almost 300 private buses, which included many school buses, and additional 200 kali-pili four-wheelers to ferry passengers on ST bus routes.Deputy RTO Ravindra Bhuyar admitted that the private operators are facing police action for ferrying passengers without valid permit. He, however, clarified that the operators were roped in by the state government itself.Bhuyar further said that on November 9, the state government had ordered that private vehicles of all types including cars, school buses, private buses, jeeps and even goods vehicles be allowed to carry passengers in both stage and contract carriage format from MSRTC bus stops and other places.As per the government order, local administration should actively monitor and assist in these efforts to mitigate the situation, stated the order issued by additional chief secretary Ashish Kumar Singh.As per this order, the RTO should allow operation of buses from MSRTC depot in Ganeshpeth itself. However, the traffic police are not even allowing them to ferry passengers from outside the bus stand.Another bus operator and president of Nagpur Private Travels Association, Mahendra Luley, too confirmed that state police is taking action against private buses, which is causing inconvenience to the already-harried passengers.A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said that the action is being taken under sections 66 and 192 of Motor Vehicles Act, which states that for ferrying passengers a vehicle requires proper permit from the transport department. The officer refused to comment when asked about the government order which allows even private vehicles to ferry passengers without valid permit. He claimed that police haven’t received any specific order from the government in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-govt-nod-cops-penalize-pvt-buses-plying-on-msrtc-routes/articleshow/87723156.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC will use drone tech to fumigate areas tough to reach||By Siddhanta MishraNEW DELHI: With the number of dengue cases rising, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to use drone technology to fumigate areas that are difficult to reach manually. “We have given approval to the project for conducting insecticide spray with the help of a drone in those areas where it is very difficult for our workers to reach. If this turns out to be successful, we will expand the coverage area,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. The east corporation has reported 183 dengue cases in last week and a total of 518 cases this year so far. Locations along the Yamuna Khadar are likely to be fumigated by the drone. “A stretch of three kilometres has been identified to carry out the spraying of insecticide. There are several areas in east Delhi where it is very difficult to fumigate, as they have dense forest, thorny bushes and the soil is also mushy. Many times our fumigation vehicles get stuck in the mud. Through this technological help, we hope to fumigate such locations,” said Ajay Handa, additional medical health officer, EDMC. The stretch has been specifically chosen where there are no houses. A company based in Gurgaon has been hired by the corporation to conduct the spraying of insecticide. The concept is based on the spray mechanism that is done when covering a large open field during locust attack on crops, said Handa further. The first run will be conducted on November 17. Meanwhile, the corporation has identified several vulnerable and affected areas and is paying special attention to them. In these hotspots, the civic body sends a team of domestic breeding checkers and field workers to kill the infected mosquito and create awareness among the residents. The civic body has so far sprayed insecticides outside 6,75,459 houses. It has found 32,220 houses with mosquitogenic conditions and launched prosecutions in 6,271 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-will-use-drone-tech-to-fumigate-areas-tough-to-reach/articleshow/87724601.cms||---

The exam is conducted by the Centre and implemented by states, with the purpose of checking the academic progress of students studying in Std III, V, VIII and X. Schools and students are randomly chosen across the country and they appear for the test on the same day and time. In Maharashtra, Std III students have not yet been given permission for physical classes which proved to be a challenge for teachers. Khimesh Kumar Badhiye, teacher at Dharmaraj School in Parseoni taluka of Nagpur district said, “We were able to convince parents that this is for their benefit. In fact, in rural areas parents are interested in sending their kids to school but so far permission has come only for Std V-X,” said Badhiye. Speaking to TOI back then, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “This is a country-wide exam so we have to go ahead with it. Regardless, only some students chosen randomly are being called and all safety protocols will be followed.” In Nagpur district, almost 7,000 students were present for the exam. The regional level supervisors for (Std III) were Madhuri Khode, Vaishali Sawarkr and Sunanda Bhagat. While for Std VIII and X, supervisors Jayashree Kantode, Jyoti Ambade and Nilesh Mule were appointed under block education officer Kailash Lokhande. In Dharmaraj school, where mostly the younger kids appeared, there was a great deal of supervision to ensure that all safety protocols were followed. Officials lauded the efforts by principals of both primary and higher sections Pamita Wasnik and Asha Hatwar respectively along with vice principal Ramesh Sakharkar. Other teachers who put in efforts to bring kids back to school for the exam included Chitralekha Dhanphole, Bhimrao Shinde-Meshram, Harish Kavate, Udary Bhasme, Raju Bhasme, Amit Menghre, Likhita Dhonde, Kishore Jibhkate, Anil Sarve, Aparna Bawankule, Sharda Samreet, Preeti Sengar and Harshkala Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rural-school-in-parseoni-successfully-hosts-nas-exam-with-class-iii-students/articleshow/87739143.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was Peter, the house owner, who was shocked at the sight in the morning and awoke all the remaining family members and rushed them out of the house. The power supply to the house has been disconnected and the house is deemed to be structurally unsafe for living. Fire force personnel, corporation councillors and revenue authorities reached the spot and did not let anyone enter the house considering the dangerous state of the building. Peter, who calls out at auction in fishing harbour, has been living with his family in the house for 21 years. “Pappa usually wakes up early and goes to buy milk. We woke up this morning hearing a frantic call from him and we were shocked to see that our compound had disappeared,” said Mary Shyja, daughter of Peter. Six children, including twins aged 2.5 years old, were in the house when the incident happened. “We are fortunate that we could move out of the house. Sometime at night we had heard a sound, but we ignored it,” said Mary. At the onset of rains, they had kept their certificates and identity cards in a separate file. A few months ago, cracks had developed in the house and renovation was done recently. The family members were initially moved to a convent. The twins develop fits during extreme cold and when the condition of children was known to residents, Pushparaj, who is their neighbour and now resides in the city, offered a temporary stay for the family in his house. All the family members were moved to the neighbouring house which had been remaining locked for a while. “At present, we just need to take care of our children. We are thankful that we got a house to stay temporarily. There are loans to be repaid, even the document of the house was mortgaged. This was our life saving and we are scared for our future,” said Mary Shyja. By evening, medicines and milk for children were procured for the family. Peter told the media that unscientific excavation in the area posed threat to his house. Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima said that the house was in an extremely dangerous situation and that it was totally unsafe to live there. Meanwhile, there was a mild respite in showers in the district on Monday. However, instances of earth caving in at many places have caused anxiety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/narrow-escape-for-family-as-part-of-their-house-caves-in/articleshow/87723870.cms||---

The SIT was formed after a controversy erupted over allegations of a payoff to an NCB official in the cruise drug bust case and images of witnesses accompanying the accused to the NCB’s office with Aryan Khan and selfies with him emerged. Malik had alleged that the case was fabricated. NCB had then said He was trying to settle scores after his son-in-law was booked in a narcotics case. The SIT had taken over six cases but the priority will be to broaden the investigation into these three cases, according to deputy director of NCB, Sanjay Singh. “Due to shortage of manpower we have now taken up only three cases to relook at investigations carried out and later, we will take up the other three,” Singh told TOI. The three other cases pertain to the arrest of accused from Mumbra, Jogeshwari and Dongri for dealing in contraband.

The total number of cases now stands at 5,277, which is the highest number of cases recorded from Delhi in the past five years.Of the 2,569 cases reported, 1,772 cases were from the three corporations and the remaining from New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment and Railways areas. There are also 470 cases, which are from outside Delhi and are not part of the total number of cases.The north corporation has witnessed 808 cases under its jurisdiction, followed by the south corporation (781). The east corporation recorded 183 cases within a week. The number of confirmed deaths due to dengue was nine till last week. Under the epidemic act, Delhi government in October made it mandatory for all the health facilities in the city to report the cases to the administration, hence, old cases are also being reported. According to health experts, there are three primary factors behind the increase in the number of dengue cases. Firstly, it is the four-year trend of the disease according to which every fourth year, there is a major outbreak of dengue. Secondly, prolonged monsoon, which resulted in water stagnation in different parts of the city, led to increased mosquito breeding and thirdly, the disease has been notified by the government and hence, all the hospitals, clinics and labs have to report dengue cases to the authorities. “Some instances of repeat cases and mismatch in data have also come to the fore,” said a corporation’s health department official. In a meeting held with the state health secretary, health officials from all the local bodies discussed the spurt in the number of dengue cases, the issue of repeat and old cases being reported by private hospitals, said an official who attended the meeting. However, the officials are hopeful that the number of cases may go down in the next two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dengue-case-tally-at-5-yr-high-as-number-crosses-5000-mark/articleshow/87724609.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bella Casa looks to hit 1k-crore valuation mark in three years||Sometime before their sons joined the family textile business Bella Casa Fashion and Retail Ltd in 2004, Harish Gupta and Pawan Gupta were confident of a retail upsurge in the domestic market. By then, their export revenues were about Rs 10 crore. Convinced that their sons would drive the shift in strategy, the Guptas set up their big manufacturing factory in 2004 in Sitapura. The growth strategy played out on the expected lines. From home furnishing products like bedsheets, comforters and pillows, they forayed into the lifestyle segment manufacturing women’s and men’s wear. “We trusted our foresight when we shifted the focus from trading in fabrics to manufacturing in 1996. Our father late K R Gupta started the company in 1959. But as the economic environment changed, it was not difficult for us to change the template. Similarly, when we foresaw a bigger domestic story on the horizon, we nimbly repositioned our business model,” says Harish Gupta, chairperson of the company. As the domestic demand gained in size, the company added another manufacturing facility in 2008. Today, it has three factories with a production capacity of 1.4 million pieces a month. Unlike many traditional family businesses, the promoters of Bella Casa were keen to go public. Besides raising funds to invest in growth, they were aware of other benefits that listing brings in its wake. Pawan Gupta, MD, says, “Even though we are a family business, we are highly aspirational. So, the decision to go public was collective and unanimous.” Gaurav, the third generation to join the busines along with Saurav, says, an unlisted company has many limitations. “By going public, a company not only gets access to funds but also improves its corporate governance standards which is a key to unlocking many opportunities.” “A listed company is favorably positioned to work with the banking partners, attract customers and gain visibility,” adds Gaurav. When it listed on the BSE’s SME platform, its valuation was Rs 14 crore, which has risen to Rs 250 crore after migrating to the main board. Saurav says, “Those who invested Rs 1 lakh at the IPO, their shares are worth Rs 15 lakh now.” The company has set a long-term target of becoming a unicorn in the next 10 years. Saurav says, “We want to become a Rs 1,000-crore company in the next 3 years. We will additionally invest Rs 150-200 crore to reach there by venturing into every category in fashion. We are currently investing in brand building, scaling up distribution, enhancing manufacturing efficiency, digitizing all functions and looking at possible acquisitions to shore up growth,” adds Saurav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bella-casa-looks-to-hit-1k-cr-valuation-mark-in-3-yrs/articleshow/87725594.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Anoop Radhakrishnan’s cartoon, which won the Academy’s Honourable Mention for 2019-20, portrays leaders of four world powers attending a global submit on Covid, with the Indian representative caricatured as a saffron-clad monk with the head of a cow. BJP leaders, including its state president K Surendran and PK Krishnadas, have described the cartoon as insulting the nation and demeaning India’s fight against the pandemic, and demanded that the decision to confer the award to such an “anti-national cartoon” be withdrawn immediately. “If the government won't correct this decision, society will not allow those responsible to go scot-free,” Surendran warned in a post on social media.There were tense moments during BJP’s march to the Academy office here on Monday as party activists tried to breach police barricades. Meanwhile, Radhakrishnan has filed a police complaint alleging that he has been receiving numerous abusive and threatening calls after he was selected for the award. Police decided to provide him security and personnel have been posted near his house at Vyttila in Kochi. Nemom Pushparaj, president of Lalithakala Academy, said that the aggressive protests against the cartoon award indicate rising intolerance in society. The cartoon award winners this time were selected by a jury headed by cartoonist EP Unni and artist Paul Kallanode as one of the members. “There is no question of going back on the selection of the award winners by a competent jury,” said Pushparaj. Earlier, the Catholic church had come out against the selection of a cartoon by Subhash Kalloor attacking controversial Bishop Franco Mulakkal but Academy officials had decided to go ahead with the presentation of the award to the cartoonist for 2018-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cartoon-row-again-at-lalithakala-academy/articleshow/87724653.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Delhi||Delhi: Students’ groups clash on JNU campus||NEW DELHI: Following an altercation between two groups of students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday night, both the sides — JNU Students’ Union and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) — blamed each other for the “violence on the campus”. Allegations of vandalism inside the JNUSU room and students being injured were also made by both the groups. They also took out protest marches on Monday in the campus. Meanwhile, police on Monday registered two FIRs under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (common intention) at Vasant Kunj (North) police station regarding the altercation. Cops claimed no one was injured in the clash. JNUSU said a study circle, Hundred Flowers Group, had booked the union room on November 11 for a reading and discussion session scheduled on November 14. However, it was alleged that ABVP members occupied the room following which heated discussions and a clash occurred. Aishe Ghosh, JNUSU president, said, “We reached the union room after receiving calls that ABVP members were refusing to leave. When we asked the ABVP members to shift their meeting elsewhere, they refused. Soon, they started heckling and targeted a student and started beating him.” Vivek Pandey, a student allegedly attacked by ABVP members, said, “When I reached the union room, they were sloganeering. Suddenly, 10-15 people gathered around me and started hitting me. They even tried to throw chairs on me.” On the other hand, ABVP stated that derogatory language was used by students who had assembled along with the JNUSU members. Shivam Chaurasia, president of ABVP’s JNU unit, said, “We were holding our weekly meeting in the common room. Suddenly, people walked in and said that prior permission was required. They started pushing us, used derogatory language and even tried to instigate those present there.” In a statement, the JNU administration said, “Students are aware that this venue is a common activity or facility centre. Every student is entitled and free to use the place, adhering to JNU’s rules. Violence and unruly behaviour have no place in an academic institution and the JNU administration strongly disapproves of it.” “Students are advised to use the common facilities with a sense of cordiality and responsibility and in harmony with each other. Nobody should be allowed to disturb the peaceful existence and functioning of others,” added the statement. On Sunday, the PCR got a call that slogans were being raised and a quarrel was probably taking place between two groups at JNU. A team from Vasant Kunj (North) police station visited the campus and found that slogans were being raised, but there was no quarrel. An inquiry showed that heated arguments took place between two groups of students for organising a seminar in the students’ union hall. Later, ABVP members visited the police station and gave written complaints. One student from a Left-affiliated organisation also lodged a complaint. DCP (Southwest) Gaurav Sharma said they conducted an inquiry and then registered the FIRs. “No one has been arrested. People involved in the incident were named in both FIRs,” he added. Asked whether students were injured in the clash, an officer said they had received four MLCs, which suggested that no one was injured. However, police spoke to both sides and asked them to maintain peace inside the campus. The investigators also scanned several videos to identify the people involved in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-groups-clash-on-jnu-campus/articleshow/87724626.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Daily green challenge to promote nutritious diet||Mangaluru: Leafy green vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. In an attempt to promote its consumption, Mamatha Rai, president, Kadike Trust, working for the revival of Udupi sarees, has launched a campaign called daily green challenge. On social media, Mamatha has been introducing several edible greens along with recipes for several days. Mamatha told TOI, “I completed 25 days of the challenge on Sunday. This is an attempt to spread awareness about wild edible greens that can be grown easily and under any climatic conditions. For many, greens only mean consuming spinach, methi or coriander leaves bought from the market. The challenge is to use leaves grown in the home garden everyday,” she said. Mamatha has been wanting to take this up as a challenge for a long time, and introduce people to a rich variety of greens that can be grown even in limited space naturally. “I live in a rented premise and have been growing edible greens in pots. Five years ago, we had documented more than 100 edible greens from our garden. I am planning to write about 30 leaves and recipes and then take a break due to the workload of the Udupi saree revival project,” she said. She shares the details including the scientific name of the leaf, common names in Kannada and English as well as the recipe of the dish cooked at home with pictures to support them. Some of the leaves introduced and recipes shared include rasam from Peperomia Pellucida, chutney from Brahmi leaves, aromatic rice by cooking the leaves of Rasana, juice using Indian moon seed plants leaves, curry (palya) by cooking black nightshade leaves with pre-soaked pigeon pea, Mexican mint leaves and onion pakoda and many more. She also writes about the benefits of leaves. All details are shared on social media platforms and as well as among weavers. “The response has been positive so far. While adding nutrition to the diet is the need of the hour, this change is needed amid the climate crisis as most of these leaves grown are from climate tolerant plants. Also, the kitchen waste and grey water can be diverted to this home garden. Once I complete 30 days, I will probably take a break and return with more edible greens after some time,” said Mamatha, who has been a vegan for the past six years and has given preference to a plant-based diet for environmental reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/daily-green-challenge-to-promote-nutritious-diet/articleshow/87723537.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Zuarinagar witnessed tense moments after the private contractor broke the culvert while laying the pipeline on Friday. Residents demanded that the work should be immediately stopped to repair the culvert. After Sancoale sarpanch Girish Pillai and local panch Arish Kadar inspected the site, the contractor was asked to stop the pipeline work till the culvert is repaired. Pillai said, “The contractor was warned earlier to work with precaution. We are not against any work of any company but we cannot tolerate such irresponsible work as it causes problems to the public.” The contractor had damaged one pillar of the bridge (culvert) and was trying to do some patch work over it, he said. Pillai said, “There are around 200 small industries and a population of 30,000. Small as well as big vehicles use the culvert daily. If any incident happens the locals will hold the panchayat responsible.” He said that the panchayat will write to authorities about the incident, including the Verna police station and the South Goa collector. “The work can only re-start after the contractor repairs the culvert and the public works department (PWD), who had constructed the bridge (culvert), gives a stability report of the repair work,” Kadar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/private-contractor-damages-culvert-while-laying-gas-pipeline-near-vasco/articleshow/87725611.cms||---

He has also started a petition on change.org, which has been signed by nearly 40,000 people within two months. “Medical insurance has become a necessity and a must have protection for the working class, thanks to the ever spiralling medical costs. However it is subjected to 18% GST which makes it very expensive. It puts a burden on the already slim earnings of the middle class, retirees etc,” read the petition. Seeking a reduction of GST to 5%, Madhava Endlur, retired insurance professional who put up the petition, said: “Owing to the limited availability of quality medical care in the public space, common man is forced to go to expensive private hospitals. People are forced to buy expensive medical insurance policies to safeguard themselves from high cost of treatment in private hospitals. To levy 18% GST on this already expensive product is an absolute unjust.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-insurance-staffer-fights-for-gst-cut/articleshow/87725092.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Unhealthy medical insurance GST hurting families seeking cover||HYDERABAD: The hefty 18% GST on medical insurance is pushing many families across Telangana into a debt trap. Unable to sign up for an insurance cover at that price — the GST levied on medical care and hospitalisation, incidentally, is only 5% — many are left draining their savings or turning to lenders, to meet medical emergencies. Among the worst affected are the elderly. “My uncle recently suffered a paralytic attack and we had to rush him to Hyderabad from Bhongir for treatment. We not only had to dip into our savings but also borrow from friends, relatives and neighbours to meet cost of Rs 25 lakh,” said Yadama Suresh, nephew of the 65-year-old patient. The family is now completely financially drained. “While we had been looking for an insurance for him,we couldn’t go ahead with it as the premium being quoted by the firm was close to Rs 1.2 lakh, since he has hypertension,” Suresh added. In yet another case, a cancer patient’s treatment was halted midway as the family ran out of funds. They too couldn’t opt for the expensive insurance. “When we exhausted all the money we had collected from selling our house, for my elder sister’s treatment, the hospital refused to do even one chemotherapy session. We ultimately had to shift her to a government hospital,” said P Shivakumar. Doctors admit the high cost of insurance is creating ‘medical hostages’ (term coined during the pandemic where people were denied treatment for lack of funds) and burdening families with high debts. “It is true that the high rate of premium — apart from lack of awareness — has become the main hurdle for people hoping for an insurance. This has led to further widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. The government should bring in a policy change to ensure that premium rates are reduced,” said Dr Mahesh Kumar, president, Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA). Demanding a change are senior citizens too. “I pay Rs 87,000 per year in premium for a Rs 10 lakh coverage, which includes about Rs 20,000 GST. This is too much of a burden for a retired private company employee,” said Sastry Gollapudi, echoing the sentiments of many others who’ve had to sell off gold, properties and other belongings. “The medical insurance premium for senior citizens is at least three to four times more costly compared to a middle-aged person. Charges get extremely expensive when one is above 70 years. Given limited means of most senior citizens and need for an insurance cover, it is very important that the government of India reduces the GST to 5%,” said Madhava Endlur, who is fighting for this change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unhealthy-med-insurance-gst-hurting-families-seeking-cover/articleshow/87725077.cms||Amrita Didyala

LOUIS (MISSOURI): At a time when social and political controversies have led to a slowdown in the rate of vaccination across the US -- latest CDC data shows only 67% (avg) have taken at least one shot – Indians there continue to be coming out in large numbers to get the jab. In fact, multiple reports put them at the top of the charts with at least 40% (approx.) of Indians being already fully vaccinated. Among other reasons, it’s also the pain of loss that’s driving them to the vaccination centre, say locals. For instance, when Appala Naidu Gandi heard the news about one of his family friends in India passing away from Covid-19 complications early this year, he was heart-broken. It also left him scared. “I panicked and worried for everyone I knew in India,” Gandi, who has been working as an onsite project manager for HCL, recollected. “It was also unfortunate to realise how vaccines were readily available in the US, while places in my home country were facing a shortage,” he added. Gandi was among those who, when the vaccine was first available in the US, drove his family 321 km to get the shot. The trust in the medical science behind the vaccine, apart from lived personal experience of knowing loved ones die from Covid-19, were the main reason, he admitted. Like Gandi, several other members of the community living in the US –rattled by the goings-on back home as the second wave of Covid-19 peaked – chose to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. Among them was Srinivas Manchikalapudi, former president of the North America Telugu Society (NATS) in St Louis. “The best we could do is get vaccinated and continue to wear masks and social distance,” he said. In collaboration with NATS, Manchikalapudi also hosted vaccine drives and outreach programmes. According to demographic data from covidvaccine.mo.gov, Asian-Americans’ vaccination rates exceed the state’s average of 46.5%. Data shows 58% of Missouri’s Asian population has initiated vaccination and 50.5% of Missouri’s Asian population are fully vaccinated. Dr Annu TerKonda, a general internal medicine physician who treats Covid-19 patients, said that percentage of Indian Americans being vaccinated is much higher. She predicts upwards of 80% of eligible Indian Americans in Missouri are at least partially vaccinated. “Most are well educated and have a high level of scientific knowledge,” Dr TerKonda said. Dr TerKonda was among those involved in Telugu Association’s recent vaccine drives in St Louis. She said updates about relatives in India suffering during peak of delta variants added to the urgency. Though association’s recent drives saw a moderate turnout – of about 20 people per drive – its president, Ranga Suresh Chakka, predicts it is because a majority of Telugu community have already been vaccinated. “Most of them who walked in for our drive were children above the age of 12 who had just been cleared for vaccination,” he said.

The students have already lost almost a year due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The students have been complaining about the missing multiple choice questions (MCQs) section in their exams. National Medical Commission (NMC) regulations and guidelines say that 20 per cent of the question paper must contain MCQs whereas the Kaloji health university has completely eliminated this section, they said. When the court questioned the varsity whether it was willing to conduct a second supplementary exam as a one-time measure because the pandemic crippled all spheres of life, the university said it had to obtain NMC permission. However, the NMC counsel said that it was for the university to explain whether it deviated from the pattern fixed by the NMC.

The petition came in the wake of recent remarks made by Ranaut on India’s independence. The lawyer, in his petition, stated that the actress’ remarks were offensive and hurt the feelings of citizens across the country. The lawyer cited a reference to an interview where the actress had termed India’s independence in 1947 as “charity” and that real freedom was only won in 2014.  “There is utmost chaos and disturbances in the entire country, which will warrant stringent action against her for sedition and bringing disrepute to the Constitution ,” Aijazuddin went on to say. The lawyer stated that Ranaut’s statement “attracts charges of sedition under the provisions of IPC Section 124-A (sedition), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and so also Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.” In his letter, the lawyer pleaded the CJI to take suo-motu cognisance by initiating enquiry and directing the Union government to take penal action against the actress. The city also saw sporadic protests over the remarks from various groups. The petition came in the wake of recent remarks made by Ranaut on India’s independence. The lawyer said the remarks hurt feelings of citizens across India||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lawyer-petitions-cji-over-kangana-remarks/articleshow/87725134.cms||---

Sanjay’s convoy was also attacked at Chillapally village in Suryapet district, police said. Police, who were unaware of the sudden tour of Sanjay, had a tough time in bringing the situation under control and averting the clashes from escalating further between BJP and Telangana Rashtra Samithi adres. Later in the day, police registered a criminal case against Sanjay for violating the model code of conduct in the wake of MLC elections. In another case, TRS cadres were booked for pelting stones on the BJP leader’s convoy and creating obstruction. A similar case was registered against the BJP for retaliating against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre. Nalgonda police said that they were clueless about Sanjay’s sudden plan to visit paddy procurement centres and mills in the district. It was only at 9 am they came to know about his tour from the media. When senior police officials contacted the district BJP leaders, local BJP leaders met deputy IG of Nalgonda AV Ranganath and sought permission for Sanjay’s programmes. By this time, Sanjay’s convoy had already reached Choutuppal. Police hurriedly made bandobust arrangements. “Sanjay’s meeting in Nalgonda went off peacefully. However, when he went to Miryalaguda, stones were pelted by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre on the convoy of Sanjay. There were nearly 50 vehicles in his convoy. The rearside windshield of an SUV was broken,” Nalgonda police said. At another place, eggs and tomatoes were hurled on BJP leaders by Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre. Police had to intervene to control the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-workers-hurl-stoneseggs-on-bandis-convoy/articleshow/87724656.cms||---

However, Delhi Police has not made any headway into the probe to identify the culprits. On paper, police seem to have ticked all boxes. An FIR was promptly filed after the incident was reported on January 5, 2020, and the police brass transferred the probe to Crime Branch wherein a special investigation team (SIT) was formed to investigate the case. The SIT even set up a camp office at the admin block of JNU. Footage from CCTV cameras was retrieved and mobile videos were obtained and examined by forensic experts. Technical and mobile surveillance was used to establish the identity of people present at the spot. Later, several people from Left-wing and Right-wing groups were sent summons for questioning. Around 100 people have been questioned till now, including DU student Komal Sharma. The SIT recorded the statements of injured students, teachers, wardens, security guards and others who were either witnesses or suspects. Police also wrote to Google and WhatsApp seeking information about the chat content of the suspects and the details of WhatsApp groups they were members of. Cops also released photographs of suspects. Despite all this, no arrests were made and no chargesheet was filed. Asked about an update in the case, senior officers didn’t say much, except that the investigation was ongoing. However, sources told TOI that the case had gone cold and no breakthrough was expected anytime soon. The investigation was conducted in full swing for about two months, but the team later got busy with the riots and Covid-related cases. Since then, documenting procedures have been going on. A top source told TOI that it was unlikely that any arrests would be made. At the most, a chargesheet without arrests would be filed, eventually leaving the decision to the court. Asked whether a closure report would be filed, an officer replied that they were gathering evidence and would take the case to a logical conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-months-on-no-headway-in-jnu-violence-probe/articleshow/87724650.cms||---

Since, the AP government has taken up expansion and new schemes without approvals from the ministry of water resources (MoWR), appraisal from KRMB and also the Apex council, it should be brought to the notice of MoWR for taking necessary action. TRS government said it is also against provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. In a letter to KRMB recently, Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar said HNSS project and its expansion was being done by the AP government and tender notices were issued. “The AP government has recently issued tender notices for enhancement from 3,850 cusecs to 6,300 cusecs for the main canal and eight pump houses at a cost of Rs 4,652 crore,” Muralidhar said. He said the Telangana government has requested KRMB to restrain AP from drawing more than 34 tmcft water from Srisailam reservoir.

---||Goa||State hopes to clear 5,000 forest claims by Dec 19: CM||Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that at least 50% of the 10,136 pending claims under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, and land ownership rights can be expedited and processed by December 19. He, however, put the onus of delay on traditional forest dwellers saying that poor attendance at gram sabha meetings convened for scrutiny and verification of the claims has delayed the process. Sawant said that at least 5,000 claims, which have been pending for around 10-12 years, can be cleared if the tribals and forest dwellers participate in the meetings being held by November-end at the panchayat-level. “We are trying to fast-track the sanads for the tribals. Our efforts are to give at least 50% of the beneficiaries their sanads or land titles. If the gram sabhas can fast-track the process at their end, then over the next two months we can give at least 5,000 people their sanads,” Sawant said after handing of land title documents or sanad documents to a handful of forest dwellers. Sawant said that forest right cases, as per provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 are being sped up. As on March 31, the state had granted just 46 sanads or land titles to the scheduled tribes (ST) and other traditional forest dwellers. As per the provisions of the act, when a forest dweller files a claim for land title, it passes through three levels of checks. Once the claim is received, the forest rights committee (FRC) does an on-ground verification along with forest department officials. The committee verifies both, the individual and community forest right claims. The FRC and the gram sabha then hold a meeting to pass a resolution on the claims, where the meeting must have a quorum of 50% with a third of them women. The claims are then sent to the sub-divisional level committee (SDLC) and then for final approval to the district-level committee (DLC). “Often, due to lack of quorum for gram sabha meetings, the meetings to verify claims are cancelled. Some people say they have got their sanad certificates so they no longer want to participate in the gram sabha meetings. This is wrong. All tribals must remain together and help each other get the titles for their land,” Sawant said. He also announced that the proposal for a tribal research centre at Sanguem and a Birsa Munda freedom fighters museum at Farmagudi would be set up in the near future. Five model tribal villages will also be set up to showcase the culture, traditions, music and handicrafts, which will also attract tourists. A national tribal dance festival and tribal craft festival in Goa is also on the anvil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-hopes-to-clear-5000-forest-claims-by-dec-19-cm/articleshow/87725628.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Addressing a press conference on Monday at Telangana Bhavan, Rythu Bandhu Samithi chairperson Palla Rajeshwara Reddy, Rajya Sabha MP Badugula Lingaiah Yadav and other leaders from Nalgonda condemned the alleged attack on farmers. The leaders accused the BJP of bringing sticks and stones in cars to create terror in Miryalaguda.  “BJP government at the Centre informed Telangana government they were not going to procure paddy in the next agriculture season and even asked the state to encourage farmers to go for alternative crops. But Bandi Sanjay is instigating farmers,” Rajeshwar Reddy said. They also accused the BJP of adopting a dual policy on paddy by procuring two crore metric tonnes in Punjab while denying the same in Telangana. “BJP leaders should get an official letter of assurance to procure paddy from the state,” Lingaiah Yadav said. In a statement, Nalgonda minister G Jagadish Reddy said Sanjay was creating terror at procurement centres in the name of visit. “People of Nalgonda will teach a lesson to BJP leaders,” the minister said. In another press meet, animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav called Sanjay a liar. “Sheep distribution programme was taken up by the government by availing a loan of Rs 3,550 crore from NCDC.

With an ambitious target of procuring 50 lakh tonnes for the current market season, the state government will be opening 6,884 procurement centres across the state. The government has already issued orders to the district administrations on paddy procurement. The government has instructed the AP State Co-operative Marketing Federation Ltd (Markfed) to carry out procurement in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts while leaving the task in the rest of the 10 districts to the AP Civil Supplies Corporation. The Primary Agriculture Marketing Societies (PACS) and the District Cooperative Marketing Societies (DCMS) have been made agencies to assist the farmers and the procurement agencies. The two agencies would also shoulder responsibility of making payments to the farmers while the respective district collectors would monitor both procurement and payment. The government has also directed the collectors to ensure that the farmers are paid within 21 days from date of procurement.

High noise levels affect hearing, impact cardiovascular health, and lead to annoyance, sleep disturbance and high blood pressure in individuals. Children and the elderly, especially those with existing physical and mental illness, are more susceptible to noise and face the brunt. Charbagh recorded the highest noise pollution of 79.5 decibels, revealed CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Researchs’ post-monsoon noise pollution survey. Indiranagar was the noisiest among all the residential localities in the city both during the day as well as at night, recording noise levels of 72.9 and 62.5 decibels respectively. After Indiranagar, Gomtinagar (61.1), Aliganj (59.2) and Vikasnagar (57.8) were the noisiest residental areas at night while among commercial areas, Charbagh recorded highest noise pollution of 79.5 decibels at night, followed by Aminabad (69.8), Chowk (67.2) and Alambagh (66.3). “Due to increase in vehicular traffic, blowing of horns by heavy vehicles like trucks and trailers, use of loudspeakers, blowing of sirens led to increase in noise pollution. Exposure to high noise has several adverse impacts on health and can even lead to loss of hearing if a person is exposed to deafening noise for a prolonged period,” said IITR chief scientist G C Kisku. Not only on humans, but high noise pollution has a harmful impact on the overall environment, plants, and animals. Noise pollution was recorded above permissible limits, both during day and night, at all locations monitored by CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nights-turned-noisier-trigger-alarm-as-experts-warn-of-severe-health-hazard/articleshow/87725635.cms||---

Telangana industries and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao asked the Centre to release Rs 900 crore for backward districts financial assistance and provide concessions for industrial promotion under AP Reorganization Act, 2014. He said the 15th finance commission recommendations were not being implemented as far as Telangana is concerned. Participating in the meeting of chief ministers’ and finance ministers of states held by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, KTR made a detailed presentation on state policies and schemes for industrial and infrastructure development in the state. “The youngest state in the country, which is just 2.5% population in the country’s population is contributing five per cent of country’s GDP. During the formation of the state, the GDP of the state was Rs 1.24 lakh crore, now it rose to Rs 2.37 lakh crore. When it comes to state’s GSDP rose to Rs 9.8 lakh crore now from Rs 5 lakh crore in 2014,” the minister said.  “The Centre should discourage unhealthy competition among the states and behave wisely on giving concessions for setting up industries. For instance, the defence industrial corridor which was supposed to be set up between Hyderabad and Bangalore was shifted to Bundelkhand. As a result, there was a delay of three years in getting desired results,” KTR said. He asked the Centre to release Rs 900 crore for backward districts financial assistance and provide concessions for industrial promotion under AP Reorganization Act, 2014||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/provide-funds-give-concessions-for-industrial-promotion-ktr/articleshow/87724672.cms||Koride Mahesh

Due to its impact, the entire unit on a two-storeyed building collapsed.Velmurugan and Manojkumar who sustained 60% and 30% burn injuries respectively were rescued and rushed to the Sivakasi government hospital for treatment. Fire and rescue services personnel from Sivakasi rushed to the spot and are carrying out the work to remove the debris.Speaking to TOI, an official from the department said that they received a call at around 3.15pm. Though the team rushed to the spot, it was unable to go near the building for more than 30 minutes, as the crackers were continuously exploding. Only after the explosion stopped, they put out the fire.The official said that on seeing the nature of the explosion, they suspect that crackers were illegally manufactured in the unit. The building is two-storeyed with a ground floor, first floor, a few rooms and a water tank on the second floor. Huge quantity of chemicals that are required for manufacture of crackers was said to have stored in the building. Since the chemicals have to be carefully handled, the work on removing the debris is going at a slow pace. Only after the debris is completely removed, we would be able to tell if anyone is trapped, said the official.The Sivakasi Town police are conducting investigations about this incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/four-missing-as-illegal-fireworks-unit-in-sivakasi-collapses-in-blast/articleshow/87724675.cms||---

When TOI visited the site on Monday, the otherwise serene landscape was seen buzzing with construction activity. About 1,500 staff and workers are toiling day and night to catapult it into a major learning hub, located some 30 kilometres from Vizag. The demo given by the technical team to TOI from a model classroom at the site offered a peek into the tectonic shift in the digital technologies that IIM-V is bringing into every classroom. The redesigned learning spaces with high-tech classrooms are aimed at preparing students for the future. The institute planning to conduct the next academic session from the permanent campus by readying essential structures like academic blocks, hostels and other student amenities. Speaking to TOI, IIM-V director Prof M Chandrasekhar said the classrooms at the permanent campus would be Operation Digital Board (ODB)-compliant to offer near physical learning experience to the students. “The smart camera tracking system would help conduct paired classrooms. Students can see the professor in close-up even as he/she moves around, during virtual classes. And the students can conserve naturally with the professor or students during virtual classes,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. “The capacity creation at the permanent campus will come in handy to meet the future inevitable growth of the institute and scaling up of academic programmes. The National Education Policy-2020 envisaged a multidisciplinary approach in academic institutions. The academic bank of credits, proposed under NEP-2020, will give freedom to students to learn from multiple institutions at the same time. This would help IIM-V expand its horizon. The advanced digital technologies embraced in the permanent campus will help offering full-time online programmes. IIM-Vizag does not need to create separate studios for this setup as every classroom doubles up as a studio as advanced technology is an integral part,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-to-soon-move-into-permanent-campus/articleshow/87723938.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He added, “I wanted to pursue IAS so I took up BA English as English knowledge is also necessary. But, still I spend time writing Tamil poems and reading books.

Commuters complain that the careless driving and incessant honking have become a major distraction on the roads and are leading to accidents. On Monday, a speeding private bus went out of control and crashed into 13 vehicles before coming to a stop by hitting a roadside tree at Foreshore Road. Although a broken brake pedal was prima facie identified as the cause of the accident, speeding has been a major cause for concern especially on this stretch. Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod said that the city has been witnessing serious traffic congestion and urged police to take proactive action to control it. “There have been complaints about private buses stopping at random locations in the city to take passengers instead of stopping at the designated stops. I have raised the issue in the district development committee (DDC) meeting and the collector has promised to take appropriate action,” said Vinod. The city police are planning to launch a dedicated WhatsApp number for the public to report rash driving. Police officers said that with the new WhatsApp number residents will be able to tip police about rash driving by sending videos or pictures or simply through a message. All those who were involved in Monday’s accident had a narrow escape. It was private bus Maria, which commutes between EdakoVechi and Kakkanad, that met with the accident around 11am on Monday. Police said that according to those who saw the accident the bus started speeding after taking the curve near the Foreshore Road. “The bus first hit a car moving in front of it with two women, including an elderly person. The bus then hit vehicles parked on the right side of the road. An autorickshaw overturned in the impact of the collision. The windshield and bumper of the bus sustained damages. All the other vehicles, including two autorickshaws, also got damaged,” said an officer. Police said that as many as 20 persons were taken to the hospitals nearby but all were discharged soon after. Central police recorded the statement of the owner and driver of the bus. A case was registered for offences including rash driving, an officer with the central police said. Police said that CCTV footage in the area would be checked to find if the bus was speeding. “Minor accidents happen in the stretch often as bus drivers try to take the sharp curve here very quickly. There was some academic programme at an educational institution nearby and several cars were parked on both sides of the road when the accident occurred,” said an officer. On November 1, three youths had died in an accident at Chakkaraparambu due to alleged drunken and rash driving. As per the statistics of the state police, in 2020, a total of 1,437 accidents were reported in the city. Among these 98 were fatal, 1,067 had victims with grievous injuries, 195 with minor injuries and 77 where no one was injured. A total of 101 deaths and 1,122 grievous injuries were reported in accidents in the city last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vehicle-pile-up-raises-concern-over-rash-driving-by-pvt-buses/articleshow/87723991.cms||---

Senior state-level leaders have already undertaken trips to some of the districts where the saffron party has good strength in the local bodies. Party sources said the leaders talked to the rank and file and local party leaders on the winning chances of the party if it were to enter the fray in the MLC polls. There are 12 vacancies in the local bodies quota. The party is considering fielding candidates from Rangareddy, Nizamabad and Karimnagar where it has a significant presence in the local bodies. “We are reviewing the situation and will take a decision in next few days after consulting with local leaders,” N Ramchander Rao, former party MLC, said. The party is also considering various options to cause ripples in TRS camp by trying to secure some TRS MLAs’ support for nominating its candidates in the MLC elections to be held under the MLA quota. Going by the numbers, the BJP can manage to field its candidates in the local authorities constituencies, but it falls short of seven legislators in the MLA quota as 10 legislators are required to propose a candidate. “Even if the behind-the-scenes strategies fail, the saffron party’s moves are going to hit a raw nerve with the ruling party,” party sources said. Some BJP leaders cited the example of senior TRS leader K Keshava Rao who enlisted the support of Congress MLAs while contesting for the Rajya Sabha MP seat. Sources said party state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar will take a call on fielding the candidates. “Even otherwise, aggressive efforts will be made to poach rebel TRS leaders into the saffron party,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-eyes-mlc-pie-now-despite-lack-of-numbers/articleshow/87724716.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Chowk chokes, records highest air pollution||LUCKNOW: Increase in human and commercial activities after the Covid-19 second wave led to a spike in the fine particulate matter, PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants, in the city air this year after monsoon as compared to last year. Track the pollution level in your cityThe PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were monitored at various locations and found to be above prescribed limits of 60 micrograms and 100 micrograms set by Central Pollution Control Board. Chowk had most polluted air with both superfine PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations being recorded at the highest among nine major localities — four residential and commercial and one industrial. This was revealed in the report of the survey ‘Assessment of ambient air quality of Lucknow city, post-Monsoon 2021,’ conducted by the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, released on the institute’s annual day on Monday. “Increase in vehicular load, ongoing construction, garbage and crop residue burning, and drop in temperature have taken a toll on air. Air pollution levels witnessed a bigger increase after monsoon this year,” said chief scientist G C Kisku, who led the survey. Among residential areas, PM2.5 concentration was the highest in Gomtinagar at an average of 82.8, followed by Aliganj (76.2), Vikasnagar (75.3) and Indiranagar (63.4). In commercial areas, Chowk recorded PM2.5 concentration of 97.8 micrograms — the highest among all categories — followed by Charbagh (86.2), Alambagh (68) and Aminabad (63.4). Last year, post-monsoon PM2.5 concentration was in the range of 49.5 to 90.6 micrograms, while this year it ranged from 25.7 to a maximum of 199.4 micrograms. Meanwhile, the highest PM10 concentration in residential areas was recorded in Vikasnagar (140.9), followed by Aliganj (131.6), Indiranagar (123.6), and Gomtinagar (115). Among commercial areas, it was highest in Chowk (217.8) followed by Aminabad (195.7), Alambagh (163.3) and Charbagh (159.4). Last year, the PM10 concentration during this period ranged from 91.4 to 130 micrograms, while this year it hovered between 67.5 and maximum of 313.5 micrograms. “Scientific evidence shows that both long and short term exposure to fine particulate matter can cause premature death, harm the cardiovascular system, increase hospital admissions and emergency department visits for heart attack and stroke,” said Kisku.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chowk-chokes-records-highest-air-pollution/articleshow/87725662.cms||Mohita Tewari

In the minor’s rape, Ajay alias Ajju Ratan Parik, 22, Sahil Rajmani Singh, 24 and Rameshwar alias Ballu Indramani Tiwari, 22, were convicted by the court of Dilip Mahida, special judge for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act cases. Two minor accused involved in the crime were given the benefit of age. “They developed friendship with the Class X girl over Instagram and later morphed her image to make an obscene photo. They started blackmailing her and took turns to rape her,” said Arvind Vasoya, public prosecutor.  In the case of the 22-year-old woman in Kapodra, the court of Amrut Dhamani, additional sessions judge, sentenced Mishra to 14-year jail. “Mishra had entered the survivor’s house when her husband was not present at home. Considering the severity of the crime, the court sentenced him to 14 years jail,” said Rajesh Dobariya, public prosecutor. “The court observed that the convict had no relationship with the survivor and he forcefully entered the house and raped her,” Dobariya added.

Cut to March 2020, with the pandemic forcing the academic institutions to shut down for months on end, he had no other option other than adapting to the new reality of online education for his ward. This is not an isolated case as lakhs of students in Andhra Pradesh had to switch to online platforms to achieve academic continuity in the last two years. But medical experts point to the increasing vision problems in children that has come about with the increase in screen time, particularly with prolonged usage of smartphones in the last decade. The results of a recent mass screening programme under Dr YSR Kanti Velugu programme corroborated this trend. The state government conducted eye tests on nearly 66 lakh schoolgoing children in Andhra Pradesh as part of the Kanti Velugu initiative. Spectacles were prescribed to 1.58 lakh students, while other eye conditions were identified in 2,621 children among those screened. Surgeries were performed on about 309 students. Renowned ophthalmologist and former regional eye hospital superintendent Dr VVL Narasimha Rao said prolonged exposure to electronic gadgets will do cause harm in children than adults. “There has been an increase in the number of eye complaints in children in the last two years. Unfortunately, parents are left with the only option of online learning for their kids. But parents should make sure their kids take frequent breaks in between classes,” said Dr Rao. Dr Rao added that screen time of children should be limited. “Not only online classes, some children have their eyes glued to video games even after attending virtual classes. Children tend to blink less frequently while playing video games or attending online classes, leading to itchy, dry eyes.” Narava Prakasa Rao, convenor of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Forum, said parents should engage children in physical activities once online classes are over for the day. “It has been brought to our attention that some children are immersing themselves in cartoon shows or video games even after classes rather than physical games. This will be a double burden on their eyes,” said Prakasa Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/smartphone-learning-presents-spectacles-to-1-58-lakh-students/articleshow/87723979.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Three earthquakes of above four magnitude were reported in Peddpalli in Telangana, Gadchiroli and Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh also witnessed a microearthquake. The experts said that seismic zonation hasn’t changed. “There earthquakes do happen, and it is just a coincidence that they occurred in a short period. The places they occurred are not that close, and the quakes are unconnected. It’s not a new phenomenon. These are all below 4.5 magnitude and are considered small earthquakes. For instance, in Karnataka, due to hydro-seismicity, rainfall percolating into earth crevices resulted in microquakes. This will not occur in all regions,” National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) chief scientist M Ravi Kumar said. Tectonic plates are in constant motion and when two plates collide, a big earthquake occurs. But in interior tectonic plates, stress builds up, and when this stress is released, small quakes occur. “We are away from the plate boundary. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, including Hyderabad, are in zone 2 and fall in low seismic risk zone and only certain parts fall in zone 3,” he added. Srinagesh Davuluri, a siesmologist and professor, department of civil engineering, IIT Madras, said, “The intervening region where Godavari river flows in Telangana and Maharasthra is classified as seismic zone 3 and the south coastal AP from Kakinada down up to Chittoor as seismic zone 3. Other areas, including Hyderabad, are in zone 2 of low risk.” “Nothing to worry about the recent quakes. They fall in the Godavari rift valley. This region is conscious with weak zones within the crest of the earth. Accumulated stress in the form of seismic energy is released, leading to tremors,” he added. NGRI has been studying both the inter and intra plate earthquakes for the past six decades. Initially, NGRI had a single station on its campus in the city, but now it operates more than 200 seismological stations across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/series-of-quakes-part-of-pressure-release-experts/articleshow/87724729.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The renewable energy park attached to the children’s park still remains closed. T J Vinod, MLA, has asked government to probe the alleged anomalies in the renovation of the children’s park. “Many facilities in the park are yet to be arranged. The park was inaugurated after the renovation in February 2021, works were pending though. But the park had been remaining closed. Even nine months after the formal inauguration, many of the renovation works are yet to be completed. On Sunday, the park was reopened for the children, but works are incomplete,” Vinod said. “Computer arcade game, bumper cars, pedal boats, toy train and skating facilities are not ready. The CCTV surveillance cameras which are part of the safety and security system in the park are yet to be activated. The sprinklers to water the lawn and plants in the park also are not functional,” Vinod said. Vinod has submitted memorandums in this regard to health, women and children welfare minister Veena George, and district collector Jafar Malik. He also brought the attention of the authorities to the anomalies in the renovation works. Vinod asked the government to book the culprits and also to expedite the works. The renewable energy park attached to the children’s park is full of bushes. “The authorities should clear the undergrowth urgently and reopen it for the children. Decades ago, there had been facilities for imparting traffic awareness to the children in the park. The facility is lacking now. Authorities should restore the facility. This will help create a new generation who knows, respects and abides by traffic rules thereby making our roads safer,” said Ranjith Thampy, an activist. Most of the toys at the renewable energy park have been damaged due to various reasons. According to the officials with the children’s park, some of the toys are to be imported while some other toys are to be brought from other parts of the country. The pandemic has affected the manufacturing of toys and their transportation, the officials say. They also said that the toys can be procured without much delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/renewable-energy-park-out-of-bounds-for-kids/articleshow/87724004.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nearly 50% drop in number of critical patients in state||Pune: With a consistent drop in fresh Covid infections, the number of critical patients in the state has reduced by nearly half, from 5,048 last month to 2,783 on November 8, as per public health department data. In all, there were 1,132 Covid patients in intensive care units across Maharashtra. Nineteen districts in Maharashtra are reporting fewer than 50 active cases, with nine districts reporting single digit caseloads, the data till November 15 showed. Covid task force members said the state appears to be slowly moving towards an endemic stage, though they said it was too early to say for sure. “Critical patients, meaning those in need of oxygen support, are reducing significantly. The number has dropped even in terms of daily critical patients being reported at hospitals. Though percentage of critical patients among total active patients is the same, the absolute numbers of severe infections have fallen considerably, and Covid-19 vaccination seems to have played a major role in this reduction,” a state public health department official said. The official added, “The main purpose of vaccination is not a reduction in reinfection, but reduction in severe Covid cases/critical admissions and therefore, mortalities — a trend seen post-vaccination.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force, told TOI, “We are slowly and surely moving towards endemicity, though it is too early to say we are there. Maharashtra must wait for another two weeks for the Diwali-effect on Covid cases to become apparent. If there is no significant surge in cases by the month-end and, depending on how fast we can vaccinate the rest of the population, the state could quickly move towards achieving Covid endemicity.” Pandit said another 7-14 days will have to elapse for any festival-related surge in Covid cases to show. “Reduction in Covid mortalities and single-digit active cases in several districts is, however, indicative of the pandemic being under control with low test positivity rates in various districts. Some districts have had active cases in single digits for weeks now, which is significant,” Pandit said. Around mid-September, at least 14 districts in Maharashtra had an active Covid caseload of below 50, while seven of these had active cases in single digits. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “Total number of Covid patients being admitted at the hospital is just six currently. The single digit Covid admission trend has persisted for four weeks now. There have hardly been any Covid mortalities at our hospital in the last two months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-nearly-50-drop-in-number-of-critical-patients-in-state/articleshow/87724750.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Testing time for schools as CBSE term exams start today||NEW DELHI: The Central Board for Secondary Education Term 1 exams begin on Tuesday for Class XII and Wednesday for Class X. The schools have arranged for photocopy machines, taking care to stock extra ink cartridges and papers because they are required to print out optical mark recognition (OMR) answer sheets and do not want to be caught at a disadvantage. AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, has installed an extra photocopier. He said, “For now, the exams are scheduled in my school only on Wednesday. It is on a minor subject, so we don’t expect any problems. We might face difficulties when the exams are in important subjects like English and Hindi.” Unlike students of private schools, government school students will not be writing the exams in their own school, but in other test centres. Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at Government Boys' Senior Secondary School in Ghitorni, said, "Our school is not an exam centre, but the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya nearby is one.” In another government school at Madanpur Khadar on Monday, the authorities checked the internet speed, which had only recently been enhanced after hybrid teaching and learning, comprising online and physical lessons, began at the school. On Monday CBSE organised a mock drill for the schools in printing the OMR sheets and question papers. Term 1 exams will comprise multiple choice questions with the students marking their answers on the OMR sheets. Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School, said, “Conducting the mock drill proved helpful because we learnt how the mass printing needed to be done. Each school's email ID has been submitted to the education board and that is how we get the link for downloading the OMR sheets.” All the examinations, which are to be conducted from November 16 to 29 and again from 26 December onwards, will have question papers supplied in an encrypted mode. Forty-five minutes prior to the day’s exam, the school will be able to download the question paper. The exams will begin from 11.30am instead of the regular 10.30am. The students of 26,000 schools affiliated with CBSE in India and 26 abroad will be writing the exam. Because the examination will be conducted in the schools, the board has appointed observers at each examination centre to preserve the sanctity of the examination process. There will be one observer with centres hosting 500 examinees and two for those with more than 500 students. The city coordinators are responsible for appointing the observers at the examination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/testing-time-for-schools-as-cbse-term-exams-start-today/articleshow/87724730.cms||Shradha Chettri

The incident came to light on Monday after the woman and her boyfriend got married and sought police protection. According to Madanapalle circle inspector Narasimha, the woman identified as Sonika, an MBA graduate from Tattivaripalle village of Madanapalle mandal, and a resident of Society Colony in the town were engaged to be married. Family members had made all arrangements and scheduled the reception on Saturday and wedding on Sunday. After the reception was held on Saturday night, family members of both the bride and the groom arrived at the wedding venue for the marriage ceremony. Around 5.30pm on Sunday evening, Sonika went to her room to dress up. But her family members grew suspicious as her room remained locked for a long time. Later, they barged into the room only to realise that she has already left the premises. Police said Sonika and her boyfriend Charan went to Punganur town and got married in a temple and later approached Madanapalle Two Town police claiming threat from her family.

---||Kochi||Call for novel fishing methods at Vypeen||KOCHI: Experts recommended fishermen at Vypeen should adopt novel methods where they can increase fish harvest and thereby increase their income. The recommendations were put forward on the second day of the workshop on ‘Vypeen island protection and sustainable development’ on Monday. “The availability of quality fish is coming down in the state. Hence, prospects for aquaculture methods like cage fish farming and biofloc is high at Vypeen which is a favourable place for fish production. “Farmers can cultivate and harvest Vannamei shrimp (whiteleg shrimp) on the compounds of their houses itself. It has high export opportunities,” said Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos) registrar B Manoj Kumar. “Shrimp can be cultivated in biofloc method and harvested in seven months. By expanding pokkali farming, cage farming can be done along with prawn farming at pokkali fields. Aquaponics method also can increase job opportunities,” he said. Other than creating job opportunities associated with fish farming, export of marine and value-added products also will create employment. The workshop also discussed the prospects of inland tourism in the area by giving thrust to the tradition of the island, culture, history, pokkali farming and water resources. “Since the population density is high at Vypeen, possibilities of setting up small-scale industries in electronics, organic vegetable farming and waste management can be explored,” Kumar said. The workshop is held in the backdrop of climate change induced incidents at Vypeen. The area witnesses recurring episodes of sea erosion and high tide. It has been envisaged to formulate a master plan for the island by consolidating the expert views and traditional knowledge emerged at the workshop. The workshop will conclude on Tuesday and water resources minister Roshy Augustine will inaugurate the valedictory function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-for-novel-fishing-methods-at-vypeen/articleshow/87724018.cms||---

A petition was filed by Congress candidate Madan Mohan Rao, who had lost the election to Patil by a margin of 6,000 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. According to the Congress leader, the election of Patil needs to be set aside because he suppressed the fact that he was convicted by a Jharkhand court. Senior counsel K Vivek Reddy,who appeared for the Congress leader, said Patil had suppressed the pending criminal cases filed against him in Jharkhand under the Forest Act (Bihar Amendment) and the criminal conviction under the Payment of Wages Act. The Congress leader also alleged that Patil had not given wide publicity to the cases that were registered against him as was mandated by the Election Commission. Senior counsel Haren Raval, appearing for Patil, said that the trial court only imposed a penalty for non-maintenance of labour records and minimum wages in contract work at a forest area of Jharkhand. Patil is a partner of the firm and the alleged conviction did not come under the purview of the prohibitions imposed by the Election Commission, he said. The arguments would continue on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patil-dismissal-plea-hearing-begins-in-hc/articleshow/87724735.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The CM was addressing a function organised at the Cultural Complex here on the occasion of the 146th birth anniversary of tribal icon Birsa Munda on Monday. He said that the tribal population inspires all to protect the natural resources. “We appreciate the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to celebrate the jayanti of Bhagwan Birsa Munda as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas,” said the CM, and highlighted the sacrifice of Birsa Munda for the country’s freedom. “He sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 in 1900 that proved to be a mantra of country’s independence in a short span of 47 years,” he added. “The state government is committed to take care of the tribal population and benefit them with all welfare schemes and programmes for their well-being,” said the CM, adding that the state government has initiated a number of steps for their welfare and development. “After 2017, as many as 54 forest villages have been granted the status of revenue villages so far. Work is in progress to benefit them with land pattas, ration cards, Ayushman cards and employment opportunities,” said Yogi adding that the government respects the tribal population and is committed to protect their dignity. The CM accused the previous governments of ignoring the tribal population. “The welfare work of tribals should have been done just after the independence, but there was no thought and vision,” he said, adding that they remained neglected till 2014. The CM also highlighted the leadership of PM Modi in successfully tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that people were given free vaccination, food grains and financial help during the pandemic period. The function was attended by the mayor Mridula Jaiswal, UP ministers Ashutosh Tandon, Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and Anil Rajbhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tribal-population-is-saviour-of-natural-resources-biodiversity/articleshow/87724026.cms||---

So affected were the boys from Vasant Vihar in south Delhi that they began working on a zero-waste management project. From January 2018, the brothers began getting the people of their colony to segregate household waste, gradually including people from adjoining colonies. The duo educated the residents about the importance of waste segregation and proper disposal of trash. They created a WhatsApp group and started the collection of segregated dry wastes from the houses. This stellar effort of the kids, called OneStepGreener, has found recognition beyond the city. They were adjudged winners of the KidsRights International Children’s Peace Prize, which has a cash component of 100,000 euros (Rs 84.9 lakh), at a ceremony held at The Hague. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi handed over the award to the Agarwals. Satyarthi tweeted, “India may be the land of a hundred problems, but it’s also the land of a billion solutions. Pleased to confer the KidsRights International Children’s Peace Prize ’21 on Vihaan and Nav. This Children’s Day, I reiterate — nothing is more important than voices of young people.” Having recycled around 1.8 lakh kilos of dry waste, Vihaan, a Class XII student, said, “We have educated over 60,000 people on waste management and afforestation through talks and training. We have saved about 25 lakh litres of water and prevented around 1,029 cubic metres of landfill space being used. The electricity saving has been equivalent to lighting 1.5 lakh houses. The oxygen generated is around 2.8 crore pounds and the carbon sequestered, 1.7 lakh pounds.” Nav, a Class IX student, added, “OneStepGreener currently services homes, schools and offices in more than 14 colonies in Delhi and Gurugram. We have planted an urban mini forest in Vasant Vihar and reforested neglected parks.” The brothers homes, clubs, offices and school a monthly schedule for the pick-up of dry waste. The waste collected goes to factories for reuse and to certified recyclers. “This ensures that waste is permanently eliminated from the landfills and reduces the depletion of Earth's precious resources,” smiled Vihaan. After winning the award, the brothers said they felt “elated, grateful and humbled” and hope KidsRights would help their voices to be heard. They plan to soon start pickups in other cities across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-delhi-kids-win-global-award-for-managing-waste-tree-plantation/articleshow/87724755.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

WPL 1090 has made efforts in this direction. Even UNICEF has praised the agency and given it 98% success,” said DGP Mukul Goel, who launched multiple awareness programmes through community participation related to women’s security by women and child security organization 1090 on completion of its 10 years. Goel along with UPSRTC MD Navdeep Rinwa flagged off LED vans under the ‘safe city’ project with the message of awareness about crimes against women and calling 1090 for help. “The vans will run for eight hours a day for the promotion of messages around women’s safety,” he said. Additional director general of police WPL 1090 Neera Rawat said that emphasis has been laid on spreading of awareness about 1090 through community participation. “We have decided to distribute placards and pamphlets with messages of awareness among village chowkidars, RWAs, youths engaged with NSS, and security guards of offices. If they notice any woman or girl being harassed, they can share this information about 1090 with them,” said Rawat. About 200 buses operated by UPSRTC will also carry the message through banners. These will ply in far-flung areas of the state. Besides, tickets will also carry the information. An official of WPL 1090 said that it was for the first time that UPSRTC had been roped in for the cause of women’s safety. All these activities and expansion are a part of Mission Shakti 3.0, the campaign of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1090-a-decade-of-womens-safety/articleshow/87725680.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC to watch out for December surge as more international tourists expected in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC on Monday said it will watch out for any rise in Covid-19 cases and any possibility of a new variant next month following the expected increase in travellers from abroad for Christmas and year-end festivities. The BMC said there has been no visible rise in cases after Diwali so far. However, the civic body said the 14-day Covid cycle ends around November 20 and it would continue testing aggressively to monitor the situation. Civic officials said they will be as vigilant in December as they expect an increase in overseas travellers. Recently, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said with the ministry of aviation allowing airlines to operate at 100% of their scheduled capacity and the Christmas season lined up, passenger traffic is inching towards pre-Covid levels. It is a known fact that due to Covid restrictions, several overseas travellers had been unable to visit Mumbai last year. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the health department, pointed to news reports that Mumbai airport has been witnessing a record number of passengers. “In December we expect an increase in international travellers landing in the city either to meet families or as tourists, considering that travel restrictions have eased and also a large number have been vaccinated. Besides, socialisation may also be at its peak. Any new variant may be enough to rock the boat and therefore we will be monitoring it very closely. We would be requesting testing of travellers and also appeal to those with even the slightest symptoms to get tested,” said Kakani, adding this is one of the reasons why they have been conducting cyclic genome sequencing, which is a study of changes in the structure of the virus over time at regular intervals. Officials said increasing vaccine coverage of the city’s population is encouraging. The BMC is taking various steps to increase vaccination, including calling citizens who may have missed their second dose, holding vaccine-on-wheel camps around high footfall areas and encouraging housing societies to inform them in case anyone has missed their dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-watch-out-for-dec-surge-as-more-intl-tourists-expected-in-city/articleshow/87724766.cms||Richa Pinto

A student from the KMC tweeted about the incident. Noticing the tweet, Mattewada police visited KMC campus on Monday and enquired with students. Mattewada Inspector T Ganesh said, “We thoroughly examined the hostel premises, interacted with the third-year and fourth-year students. We tried to trace the number of the student who tweeted. However, could not trace the person. All hostellers said there was no such (ragging) incident.” The tweet alleged that fourth year students forced first year students to consume alcohol. A central team from Hyderabad visited the KMC and also concluded that no such ragging incident took place. The central team camped at KMC campus. KMC principal Dr D Mohan Das stated that third year students were busy making arrangements on campus and in the meantime a third year student held a birthday party on campus. “There may have been a little clash. But, there was no ragging reported on the campus. However, KMC constituted an enquiry panel.” The false information was tweeted and Prime Minister tagged.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Liquor prices set for a sharp dip from today, some beers too will cost less||KOLKATA: Tipplers are getting ready to raise a toast as the price of all kinds of liquors — India Made Foreign Liquor, beer, bottled in origin liquor (BIO), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) and wine — are dropping by a hefty 20%-30%. For beer, the fall is marginal though (5%-6%). But for some IMFL, the dip will be up to 30%. According to the prices registered with the excise so far, prices of some leading premium and semi-premium whisky brands have been slashed by 30% — from Rs 1,350 to Rs 920 for a 750ml bottle. For deluxe whisky brands, the fall will be 25%-26% — from Rs 980 to Rs 710. In case of popular rum brands, the price dip will be around 15%-18% — from Rs 640-Rs 650 to Rs 540. Price of some overseas spirits bottled in India will down by over 30% — from Rs 2,290 to Rs 1,640. Beer prices of some leading brands for both lager and strong beer have come down by 5%-6% — from Rs 130 (strong) to Rs 120 and from Rs 119 (lager) to Rs 115 (650 ml). “Prices of vodka, BIO, OSBI, Gin and brandy will be registered eventually in another couple of days. In the first batch, only those prices have been registered that are high selling products. For beer, the marginal fall comes after a major price slash in October 2020, making it even cheaper than the pre-pandemic level for some brands. On Tuesday, excise officials will meet liquor retailers to discuss a new distribution structure. It was learnt that the excise department had a series of meetings with leading liquor and beer companies over the last few months following a series of representations from various bodies related to liquor trade. The consumption of IMFL in the state was in decline since the upward revision in price in April 2020. The price of IMFL has increased by almost 40%-50% in two phases since the pandemic set in. In the last quarter of 2020-21 (Jan-Feb-March 21) and first two quarters of 2021-22 (Apr-June and July to Sep), liquor consumption was down by 30%-35% compared to the same period of 2019-20. The trend continued in the third quarter of this fiscal year despite it being a festive month. Sources in the liquor industry said that even in October, sales were down by 20%. In a sharp contrast, demand for beer has witnessed a jump. The price of beer was slashed by 20%-30% in October 2020. An executive of a beer company pointed out that there had been a robust growth in beer demand since the price drop. “We are getting a very encouraging response,” he added. Bengal is a market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer annually. The total consumption of IMFL in 2020-21 was little over 10 million cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-prices-set-for-a-sharp-dip-from-today-some-beers-too-will-cost-less/articleshow/87724049.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

CM thanks PM for idol brought back to KashiAddressing a function organised at the Rudraksh International Convention centre after the installation ceremony, Yogi said, “There was no other better place than KVT to install this idol, which returned here after being stolen 108 years ago. It will make the coming generations aware about how the symbols of culture and heritage of India had been left to be stolen and smuggled in the past and also inspire them to preserve it.” Expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts for bringing the idol back to Kashi, he said, “The theft of idols for smuggling used to hurt the sentiments of the people but the previous governments did not bother. The PM is ensuring the return of such idols from across the world. While returning from the US recently, the PM brought back 156 such idols and antiquities with him.” “Kashi has always been an attraction for people from across the world due to it being an ancient centre of Sanatan Dharma and spirituality. Despite this fact, Mahatma Gandhi had to give a bitter reaction over the sanitary condition in and around the KVT in 1916 during his visit. In the name of Mahatma Gandhi, many ruled the country for decades but never tried to ensure development of the shrine and city as per its stature,” said Yogi, mentioning that after over 100 years of Gandhi’s remark, how the PM ensured the development of KV Dham (corridor) as per the stature of this shrine. “The idol of Goddess Annapurna, which has returned due to efforts and inspiration of the PM, has been consecrated on the courtyard of KVT in its ‘Ishan kon’ (northeast point) as per Vastu Shashtra on the auspicious occasion of Devthan Ekadashi,” said Yogi, praising the PM for beginning construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya by ensuring a permanent solution of the five-century-old dispute, efforts for cleaning of river Ganga, making Yoga global, ensuring that no one starved during the pandemic with the best Covid-19 management in the world and giving the vision of development of everyone without any discrimination as per Vedic traditions.” Regarding the delayed arrival of the rathyatra (carrying the idol) from New Delhi on November 11, Yogi said, “When the rathyatra to bring this idol to Kashi from New Delhi was planned, it had been decided that it will move 4-6 hours per day and halt in different cities in night. But, lakhs of people kept turning up on roads in all districts through which it passed. Thus, the possibility of a night stay on the way to Kashi ended.” He said that he had reached Kashi on Sunday evening and also visited Durgakund, where the rathyatra had to halt at night after entering Kashi in the afternoon, but it reached during wee hours on Monday. Earlier, UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari, who had left Ayodhya with rathyatra on Sunday morning, reached Varanasi at 4 am. Tiwari said, “Delay was caused as thousands of people at hundreds of points in Pratapgarh, Sultanpur and Jaunpur had surrounded the rathyatra to welcome it and offer prayers to the idol of the goddess. To avoid any further delay, the rathyatra could stay at Durgakund for a few minutes only after reaching there around 7 am.” A huge crowd also showered petals on the rath yatra before it reached KVT. Before the arrival of the idol inside KVT, a band of 11 priests had started rituals of consecration. After the idol was brought down, Yogi took it inside the temple in a silver palanquin and completed the rituals of consecration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-installs-retrieved-18th-century-goddess-annapurna-idol-at-kvt/articleshow/87724048.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The civic body’s water works department is aiming to provide water connections to these areas within a year. The water works department has floated tenders to lay Ductile Iron (DI) pipeline in these areas and the work is expected to start in the next three to four months. Water works department officials said that the tenders have been floated to lay DI pipeline in Nageshwar, Jamnagar road, Vardhman Nagar, Raiyadhar, FCI godown road and other areas. The total cost of the project is Rs 26 crore. A population of around 70,000 will be benefitted by the project. Madhapar, Ghanteshwar and Manharpar were merged with RMC’s west zone a year ago. These newly merged areas are still deprived of many basic facilities. Some of the households get piped water through the old gram panchayat network while the majority of the population is dependent on groundwater and water tankers. Nageshwar and Vardhman Nagar, among the fastest developing areas, are highly dependent upon groundwater. Pushkar Patel, chairman of standing committee said that the tenders will be approved by the standing committee. “Once the pipeline is laid these areas will be connected with RMC’s main network,” Patel said. Devang Mandkad, chairman of the water works committee said, “We aim to provide drinking water to these areas through our network within a year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/new-rmc-areas-to-get-water-connections/articleshow/87724790.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: Farm fire share in PM2.5 close to 50 per cent in peak season||NEW DELHI: The daily percentage of emissions from harvest-stubble burning in the PM2.5 pollutants in Delhi varied from 25 per cent to 48 per cent between November 4 and November 13, the highest on a single day being 48 per cent on November 7, according to SAFAR data. Though the central government informed the Supreme Court that farm fire pollutants comprised 10 per cent of the city’s bad air, experts said the magnitude of stubble burning in the pollution crisis should not be diminished because farm fires were not a year-round phenomenon and registered high impact figures only in October-November. Data from different studies over the years brings out the varying nature of farm fires' share in the pollutants in Delhi’s air. A study by IIT-Kanpur in 2016 stated the contribution of biomass burning to the city’s PM2.5 was 26 per cent in winter and 12 per cent in summer. Another by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) titled ‘Bending Delhi’s Air Pollution Curve’ said the relative contribution from farm fires was the highest (31.4 per cent) between October 15 and November 15, 2020, reducing then to 8.6 per cent between November 15 and December 15, 2020 and 4.1 per cent between December 15, 2020 and January 15, 2021. TImesViewDelhi is choking again and it is undeniable that stubble burning has played a role. Exactly how large that role is might differ from one study or report to another, depending on the month and other factors, but there is little doubt that only a sustained and concerted effort can stamp out the menace.According to data shared with TOI by the Union earth ministry body, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), in the past, the average share of stubble fire emissions between October 1 and November 30 was 16 per cent in 2020, 13.5 per cent in 2019 and 12 per cent in 2018. Chandra Bhushan, CEO, International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iForest), said, “The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution might be 4-10 per cent annually, but it goes up to 40 per cent on some weeks. The right way to present facts is to highlight that harvest stubble is not burnt for 365 days, only for a few weeks in a year. During the stubble burning season, it causes high levels of pollution.” Advocate Ritwick Dutta, founder and managing trustee, Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment, similarly noted, “The important point here is that the monthly contribution of stubble burning may be around 10 per cent, but we have to look at the 15-20 days when the share is highest. Average monthly or seasonal contributions do not signify the daily impact.” Explaining this, he said, “If there were five heavy rainfall days in a month, the mean rainfall of the year would still be low if we were to include data of other months.” Dutta added, “Meteorology ensures that stubble burning adds a dangerous dimension to Delhi’s pollution in the winter months. If the base load of pollution (other components like emissions from vehicles, industries and dust) is high, even a 10 per cent addition from the farm fires can be significant.” A Delhi government official also asserted, “If we include only the stubble burning period, the percentage of the farm fires’ share in pollution will be quite high. But if we include September, December and January in the calculations, when the farm fires are negligible, the average contribution is shown as low.” Pointing out how the measured taken by the central and state governments in the past few years, such as in-situ and ex-situ methods to discourage farmers from burning stubble and an attempt at banning stubble burning, hadn’t yielded the desired results, L S Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW, said, “While these existing measures need to be scaled up and improved, the governments should also come up with farmer-friendly plans to manage the harvest stubble in the upcoming season. The focus should be on promoting short-duration crop varieties and diversifying from paddy.” Some experts said efforts should be intensified to curb other sources of pollution too. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “SAFAR data shows that the average contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels varies widely and is not consistently high as it depends on wind direction, wind speed and intensity of stubble burning.” Given this, she said, “So, while stubble burning requires urgent attention, Delhi and NCR’s multi-sector action has to be more stringent in addressing local pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fire-share-in-pm2-5-close-to-50-in-peak-season/articleshow/87724822.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Atmanirbhar hit: Food carted out of vendors’ tables in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Over the past 25 years, Ahmedabad has largely transformed into a cosmopolitan city, largely attracting families from various states owing to major national-level institutions, central government offices, MNCs and the bustling industrial corridor, which has been its economic lifeline. Recent census figures on migration have revealed that of the total 25.6 lakh migrants in the city, 6.9 lakh belong to outside the state. The fact that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation chose to embark on a campaign to evict non-vegetarian food carts on Tuesday has not appealed to many families, including those Amdavadis who do not eat eggs at home but are regulars at some of the egg larris across the city. On Tuesday, a gamut of issues were discussed in the town planning committee meeting chaired by Devang Dani on the difficulties that may arise while executing the eviction drive on Tuesday. “Many of the street vendors were being enrolled under the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (SVANidhi) Yojana, just before the eviction announcement was made. This central scheme provides highly subsidized loan of Rs 10,000 to street vendors who were hit during the pandemic and wanted to kick start their business. Such a move could hurt the implementation of the scheme itself,” says a senior estate department official of the AMC. Dani said, “We had received complaints from residents in Maninagar, Khadia, Paldi, Narol, Nikol and several such places against such non-vegetarian food larris outside religious institutions and schools.” The senior estate department official added, “Also, we are enforcing Clause 232 of GPMC Act which relates to clearing encroachments from streets. Under that, one cannot differentiate between a non-vegetarian, vegetarian or a tea stall,” added the official. Another important issue pointed out to Dani was that non-vegetarian joints like egg carts are usually set up during evenings when there are no schools or colleges functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/atmanirbhar-hit-food-carted-out-of-vendors-tables/articleshow/87724813.cms||---
---||Delhi||Three arrested for shooting at man in East Delhi last month||NEW DELHI: Three people have been arrested for shooting at and injuring a man in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar. The incident took place on October 10. The victim, Amit Kumar, is a resident of Ashram and had arrived at the police station after being shot. He was taken to a hospital by the cops and admitted for treatment. He was found to have sustained a bullet injury on his back. “In his complaint, he stated that he was returning home from his office and had reached in front of Sanjay Jheel on NH-24 Service Lane, when two bikers came from behind and the pillion rider fired at him. As he fell down, the bikers fled,” DCP (east) Priyanka Kashyap said. An FIR was registered and investigation taken, up but there were no leads initially. However, the cops used technical surveillance and found that the shooters could be from Bareilly. The victim also gave some leads in this regard. Cops then arrested two men, Abhijeet and Sumit Gupta, from Bareilly. During interrogation, it was found that the victim had given Rs 4.5 lakh to Gupta, which the latter could not return. So, he roped in two others and decided to eliminate the victim. The third suspect, Sumit Patel, was also arrested by the police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-arrested-for-shooting-at-man-in-e-delhi-last-month/articleshow/87724814.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Last police witness quizzed over crowd ‘hampering probe’||HYDERABAD: Head constable D Srikanth, who was the final witness to depose before the SC-appointed inquiry commission on Monday, was again shown photos and videos of the alleged encounter site and quizzed on crowd presence. The police has all along claimed that jostling by crowd hampered their probe into the alleged encounter of the four Disha rape and murder accused. The photos and videos from various vantage points were taken by media outfits on December 6, 2019, when the four accused were killed in police firing. On Friday too, Srikanth, who was the handler of accused C Chennakeshavulu, was quizzed on photos. In his deposition earlier, encounter case investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy had claimed that he was too busy giving orders to control the mob and it was much later that he realised the CLUES team had not followed his order to record the entire topography of the crime scene. But in the photos and videos shown to the witness on Monday, there was no sign of any crowd trouble near the area with the four bodies that was cordoned off with yellow tape. After showing a photo, the commission’s advocate asked: “Is it not correct that this photo reflects that the crowd was far away on the highway at a distance of about 500 metres and not advancing towards the crime scene?” Srikanth replied: “It is true.” The cop was also shown a video of the tent being set up by cops and asked if it wasn’t too close to the crime scene. Srikanth said he could not be sure. The head constable also said that he did not know who the two men in white coats seen walking in the field and entering the tent in the videos were after the panel sought to know if they were doctors. When asked if at any point the inquest was hampered by the crowd on December 6, Sriknath said he did not notice, adding that there were only a few people in civil dress near the tent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/last-police-witness-quizzed-over-crowd-hampering-probe/articleshow/87724817.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Nagpur||Weather change, temperature fluctuations bring flu-like illnesses||Nagpur: The sudden change in weather and rise in temperature, which is not usual in November, has made cough, cold and flu-like illnesses more common in the last two weeks in the city. General practitioners are seeing more patients with symptoms of sore throat, cold, and fever. These symptoms are similar those of Covid-19. These also include many people who have taken both doses of vaccine. According to experts, seasonal cough and cold is common and should not be misunderstood as Covid-19. Still, going for a Covid-19 test is not a bad idea. “Patients of all age groups are coming with complaints like fever, sore throat, cough, cold, sneezing etc. We ask them about their Covid vaccination status first. If symptoms persist despite general medication, I suggest some of them to go for Covid test,” said Dr Pragati Kamble, a general physician from Manewada. However, people are reluctant to undergo testing, said many doctors. “People ask for generic medication and treatment. A majority of them believe that one or two doses of vaccine have given them full protection from infection. Secondly, home isolation is still not permitted in Nagpur. So, people do not want to spend days in hospital,” said Dr Vishal Joshi. Experts told TOI that the vaccine offers nearly 100% protection from serious diseases and hospitalization as well as oxygen need. But, it’s not a guarantee of protection from infection. “Some 5-10 patients are getting detected every day in the district for the last one week. This means at least 50 people are getting infected. As they have vaccine protection, they are not developing symptoms or must be experiencing very low symptoms,” said a senior member of the Covid task force. According to infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, non-Covid cough, cold and fever, which are being experienced by many people these days, are very infectious. “Hundreds of people are developing these symptoms daily. This is happening not only in Nagpur but everywhere. Nothing wrong in getting tested if your doctor suggests,” he said. Doctors said that it’s a win-win situation if a person tests negative. In case of testing positive despite vaccination, symptomatic treatment will cure most patients. An official from health department said they are doing their level best to ensure contact tracing and random testing in Nagpur, but still the number of tests is down. “If people come forward for testing like they used to earlier in July-August, it will in fact reduce the test positivity rate. We can also detect many asymptomatic cases,” he said. Testing is good Covid-19 testing facilities are still available at all NMC centres Many private labs are providing Covid testing at low prices now If you have symptoms and your doctor suggests, get yourself tested Even vaccinated individuals may get tested on developing symptoms Vaccinated people can get infected, but their illness won’t turn serious On testing negative, proper medication can be planned on seasonal flu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/weather-change-temperature-fluctuations-bring-flu-like-illnesses/articleshow/87724068.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aspirants await outcome of pleas in SC on med quota||Mumbai: Even as the Supreme Court’s hearing in a bunch of pleas challenging the government’s decision to apply OBC and EWS reservations to all-India medical quota seats is scheduled on Tuesday, undergraduate and postgraduate aspirants are anxiously awaiting the outcome. The court stayed the postgraduate counseling process till November 16. Undergraduate admissions in the states, on the other hand, can start once the all-India admission rounds commence. Admissions are already delayed on account of the pandemic in both UG and PG courses. A postgraduate medical aspirant, Dr Zubin Driver, said that many postgraduate aspirants who rely on the income from stipends are at home waiting for the admissions to commence. “Our admissions are already delayed due to the second wave of the pandemic. We do not mind the delay now due to the court case, as long as the decision is favourable. In a seat matrix issued for colleges, very few seats or none were vacant in the open category even in sought-after MD/MS courses. Technically, 35% seats are for open category students, so courses with three seats should ideally have one seat in open category, which was not the case,” he said. Undergraduate admissions in the state run parallel to the all-India round admissions. The first round of admissions in the state, starts after the first all-India round concludes. With the new quotas challenged, the seat matrix and admission schedule are yet to be released for the all-India rounds. The state’s Directorate of Medical Education and Research is also yet to receive the state rank list from the Directorate General of Health Services, said an official. But he added that students need not worry as the admission process will take its course and students will not be at loss. A parent, however, said that the delays add to the anxiety of students, especially in medical courses, where the seats are limited. Last year, too, admissions were pushed till December due the pandemic and in the state, it was further under disorder due to the state’s impending decision on Maratha quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aspirants-await-outcome-of-pleas-in-sc-on-med-quota/articleshow/87724818.cms||---
---||Varanasi||NEET solvers’ gang: Bid by accused to secure release foiled||Times News Network Varanasi: The attempt by one of arrested members of the NEET solvers’ gang, Osama Shahid, a native of Mau and a final year MBBS student at KGMU, to secure bail was foiled by the Varanasi police commissionerate on Monday. The commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said on the complaint of the father of one of the 16 aspirants, who were in contact of this gang, a fresh FIR was lodged with Sarnath police following which the court of the chief judicial magistrate sent Osama to 14-day judicial remand. This process was completed by the police before the formalities of his release could be completed as Osama had managed to get bail from the High Court, officials said. The fresh case against Osama and seven other members of NEET solvers’ gang was registered by the father of one of the 16 aspirants belonging to Jhansi. He alleged that his son was preparing for NEET in Kota (Rajasthan) when the gang lured the boy to arrange an impersonator for clearing the exam, the police said. “Earlier on Sunday, the Varanasi police had sent a letter to the vice-chancellor of KGMU, Lucknow, seeking lifetime ban on Osama,” the CP said, adding that the letter had details as to how Osama was involved with the gang and was instrumental in ensuring that ineligible candidates get selected. Osama was arrested on September 14 after his connections with the Patna-based inter-state solvers’ gang came to light during a police investigation. The solvers’ gang was busted by the police with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from a NEET centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under Sarnath police station. Apart from Osama, the police had also arrested Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar, although the kingpin of gang Pravin Kumar alias PK alias Neelesh is still absconding. With the progress in investigation, the police detected that 25 aspirants were in contact with this gang. Of these, 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine skipped the exam. Police sought the help of the National Testing Agency director in the investigation. Later, NTA withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for two years from appearing in examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-bid-by-accused-to-secure-release-foiled/articleshow/87724056.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath seeks Centre’s help to boost development||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday requested the central government for more ATMs, certain policy changes to benefit MSMEs and approval for more hospitals and industrial parks for better economic development of the state. Speaking during a virtual meeting between Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and chief ministers of all the states, Yogi said the state government was working hard to achieve sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. “As part of the process, more ATMs and a better network of banks is required across the state,” he said. He also highlighted that in view of the limit of Rs 100 crore as minimum investment under the Centre’s performance-linked incentive scheme, the garment industry under the MSME sector was not able to take advantage of it. The CM requested for relief from minimum investment clause for readymade garment units in eastern UP so that they could compete against similar industries in Vietnam, Bangladesh etc. “Keeping in view the vast power consumer base in the state, we also request to be allowed capital outlay under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme. Working capital loans for discoms are also not being sanctioned as per the standards identified by the Centre because of which they are being forced to take loans at higher rates of interest,” the CM said, requesting for the Centre’s cooperation in ensuring that the rules laid by it are followed. Appealing to the Centre to provide approvals for setting up a bulk drugs park in Lalitpur district and a plastic park in Auraiya district, the CM said a central policy to promote investments in the upcoming defence corridor was also being expected. Appealing for its quick implementation, Yogi said it would help in speeding up work on the corridor in UP. On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for a construction unit where Brahmos missiles will be manufactured in the corridor’s Jhansi node.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-seeks-centres-help-to-boost-devpt/articleshow/87725700.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Battered by lockdown and cyclones, Boipara hopes business will return with reopening of campuses||KOLKATA: Reopening of campuses not only means return of students to colleges and universities. It will also give a fresh lease of life to Boipara on College Street. Booksellers and vendors are already witnessing a rise in footfall since the date of reopening was announced last month. With several competitive examinations scheduled later this year and earlier next year, book trade is expecting a good business. Shutting down of campuses also robbed the iconic Indian Coffee House, Paramount and other hangout zones in and around College Street of the business and the characteristics vibe. But they are looking forward to turning a new page. “The pandemic, along with two cyclones in the last two years, completely broke our backs. The business hit rock bottom and stock got destroyed in Amphan last year. But we are hoping for a turnaround in the next few weeks once students start returning to campuses and several examinations are notified. We are expecting to make up for our losses,” said a book trader. Boipara is a km-long stretch on College Street flanked by hundreds of stalls of second-hand books, rare academic journals, fiction, maps and everything in between, making it the world’s biggest market of second-hand books. It is also the biggest market for books in the country. Battered by the pandemic, lockdowns, two cyclones and status quo in academics, business in Boipara had hit an all-time low. “Lakhs of livelihoods are linked to this trade and reopening of campuses will revive it,” said Bimal Chandra Mondal, a book-stall owner in College Street. The iconic coffee house, where getting a place to sit is considered a matter of good luck, lost its vibe as a big portion of the student crowd went missing after the pandemic. “Coffee house is a meeting point come hang out. People from different colleges converge here after their classes. But since campuses were shut, students could not come over. During the first half, almost 40% seating space remains vacant but this will change in the next few days when college reopen,” said Tapan Kumar Pahari of the Indian Coffee Workers’Co-operative Society Limited, which runs the iconic coffee house on College Street. Paramount on Bankim Chatterjee Street, too, is a popular haunt of college students that has been eagerly waiting for the return of the student community to College Street. “The footfall has been down by almost 50%,” said an employee. College Street and it vicinity has over 15 colleges, two universities, a government hospital and several coaching institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battered-by-lockdown-and-cyclones-boipara-hopes-business-will-return-with-reopening-of-campuses/articleshow/87724061.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Naitam, now recuperating from an injury at Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, had a close shave after a bullet fired by a Maoist during the encounter at Mardintola forest near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border grazed past his skull. The commandos had killed 26 Maoists in the encounter on Saturday. The commando had tied a towel around his skull to stop bleeding and waited for around 10 hours in pain before receiving first aid. His colleague, Sarveshwar Atram, son of a teacher, sustained a grave injury on the right knee after falling for around 10 feet on a solid rock. Atram too had contributed in gunning down around 70-75 Maoists. Despite the numbing pain, Atram too had fought from 7am to 3.30pm to keep the Maoists at bay. “When the question is about life and death, the pain becomes obsolete and it fails to draw one back. If I don’t act and think about the pain, death would be inevitable,” said Atram who had applied a gel on the knee to keep going for the rest of the 9-10 hours. The C60 commandos had returned with 26 bodies of Maoists from the spot, including their central committee member Milind Teltumbde, and other senior cadres. The encounter has dealt a big blow to the rebel movement in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Naitam said he almost lost consciousness after the bullet grazed past my skull. “Blood was oozing from the right side. I informed my buddy who was engaged in firing. My colleagues had anti-clotting kit but they were not in a position to abandon firing to reach me. It was a critical period. I could not crib about my injury but ensured there was no blood loss,” said Naitam who has fought several gunbattles with the Maoists and returned victorious on most occasions. “I have lost some of my best friends in different encounters but never felt demoralized as I am servicing the motherland,” he said extolling the efforts of Addl SP, Operations, Somay Munde who was leading the operation from the front. The commando said the jawans were spread out in smaller groups in different sections and were not aware what was happening with others. “Every group was focussing on specific tasks,” he said adding the operation had started on Friday night. The jawans walked all through the forest to reach the location where there was an input of Maoist presence, said Naitam, adding there was no idea about Milind’s (Teltumbde) presence. “We just knew some big cadres,” he said. Apart from Naitam and Atram, some of their colleagues who too are recuperating from injuries included Maharu Kudmethe and Tikaram Katenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ab-tak-pachattar-says-injured-c60-commando-involved-in-many-encounters/articleshow/87724798.cms||Soumittra S Bose

If necessary, the department will operate a separate window for issuing CF to school vehicles. The state government had extended the validity of CF till September 30 from March 2020. This left a large number of vehicles without a valid CF. “Since many of the vehicles were parked idle for long, they may develop technical snags all of a sudden,” said a technical officer of Kolkata PVD. “With several buses set to rejoin some popular routes to cater to the morning-hour rush, we want everyone to ensure that safety is not compromised,” said an officer from the special raid section of traffic police, adding that random checks will be carried out on vehicles carrying students. DC traffic Arijit Sinha further pointed out that the CF was mandatory to ensure that the vehicle was road-worthy, it had been serviced and that brakes, tyres, lights and wipers were in running order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/surprise-checks-for-cars-ferrying-kids/articleshow/87724084.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||BJP skipped as TRS & MIM numbers stacked against it||HYDERABAD: The BJP skipped the GHMC standing committee election because it does not have the majority of votes. According to party insiders, the 47 votes they currently have would not be enough to secure even a single slot in the GHMC’s apex council because of the rules of the contest. Explaining the reasons, a leader said, “With TRS and AIMIM having a deal, we cannot manage to obtain the majority votes as rules that came into effect in 2010 as part of the GHMC Act. The regulations state that all 150 members vote for 15 standing committee members, with the latter being chosen based on the number of votes they receive, there is no sense in contesting it.” In fact, the BJP has filed a writ suit in the high court challenging two norms. According to the new rules, there should be one person on the committee for every ten wards, and standing committee members can run from any ward and receive votes from all members. “This is not representative voting. The contending member should be from that set of ten wards and only those ward members should vote for them, and those who voted may truly demand their right and budget in the council,” the BJP leader said. Any number of members may run for a seat in the council, but when voting occurs, only 15 members should be counted. If a member votes for more than 15 people, his or her vote is ruled invalid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-skipped-as-trs-mimnumbers-stacked-against-it/articleshow/87724839.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

On Monday, AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch an extensive drive to remove all non-vegetarian larris from public roads. “There are as many as 6,000 food cart operators in Ahmedabad who sell non-vegetarian food. AMC’s decision is unconstitutional and if implemented it will result in loss of livelihood of their families,” said Rakesh Maheria, president of Gujarat Lari Galla Patharna Sangh, an association of street vendors in the state. Maheria said most egg and meat food cart operators are from other states. “They are mainly poor Hindu migrants from like UP, Bihar and Odisha whose families survive on the income generated here.

Though farm fires were high at 3,125, the share of stubble burning to PM2.5 reduced to 10 per cent as winds slowed down. However, the contribution of farm fires is predicted to rise on Tuesday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said visibility due to smog reduced on Tuesday compared with Monday. “The visibility at Palam was between 1,000-1,500 metres. At Safdarjung, it was 800-1,200 metres,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “Like Sunday, winds were mostly light or calm on Monday at Safdarjung over the past 24 hours. At Palam, light winds at the speed of 5-7kmph were recorded between 11.30am and 3pm. However, relative humidity increased by 10-15 per cent on Monday evening,” added Jenamani. The minimum temperature was 10.3 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, and the maximum 26.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. Air quality is predicted to remain in the “very poor” category for the next three days. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said, “AQI is in the very poor category and is unlikely to improve on Tuesday as winds at transport level are increasing. This will bring in more farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi.” “However, winds are forecast to blow from the east and slow down, which will improve air quality on November 17. Surface winds will slow down further on November 17 and 18, which is likely to reduce dispersion of pollutants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-gasps-as-aqi-remains-very-poor/articleshow/87724851.cms||---

The trouble began after the section which was in Sardar Mahal was shifted to Phoolbagh. Now, locals say that they are being made to run between the two places to get a simple job done, be it for the certificate or corrections. “I submitted an application for rectification in my daughter’s birth certificate. It’s two weeks and I am still doing the rounds of Phoolbagh and Sardar Mahal everyday,” an upset Mairaj told TOI. The residents said that the matter was brought to the notice of local leaders but they reportedly turned a blind eye towards the issue. Taking strong exception against the shifting, Telangana Telugu Desam Party( TTDP) urged the GHMC mayor and commissioner to bring all matters in Circle-9 under one roof for the convenience of applicants from Charminar. “The people have to suffer a lot for birth & death certificates. Applicants are being told to submit documents at Phoolbagh area and pay challans at Sardar Mahal. It should all be at one place for people living in and around Charminar,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, TTDP (GHMC, minority vice-president).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-locals-fume-as-pain-marks-birth-death-certs-process/articleshow/87724857.cms||Omar bin Taher

This is one of the largest seizures of marijuana by the NCB. On October 18, Washim police’s local crime branch (LCB) had intercepted a truck that had entered the district from Hingoli. That truck was found carrying marijuana weighing around 1,150 kg concealed in poultry feed. The seized material was estimated to be worth around Rs 3.45 crore. Following the seizure an offence was registered at the Risod police station. In the latest case, the seized marijuana has a valuation of over Rs 3.30 crore. An offence in this regard has been registered at NCB, Mumbai. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede told TOI, “Our team has seized a truck carrying 1,127 kg of marijuana at Manjram of Naigaon tehsil in Nanded district.” He said the 12-wheeler truck was carrying the contraband concealed in 100 iron bars. “Preliminary probe has revealed that the seized material was coming from Andhra Pradesh and investigation is underway to ascertain its destination,” Wankhede said. The NCB team has arrested two accused — Gokul Rajput, the owner of the truck who was driving the vehicle when it was intercepted, and his help Sunil Mahajan. “Based on specific information, a team of NCB seized a total of 1,127 kg of marijuana at Manjram on November 15, and arrested two people. This consignment, being carried in a 12 wheeler truck, was to be delivered at Jalgaon and later distributed to other parts of Maharashtra,” read a press release by NCB. A senior NCB official said, “The suspects have claimed that they were tasked with delivering the large quantity of marijuana at Jalgaon which is used as a base to land the banned item before it is dispatched in smaller quantities to cities like Pune, Mumbai and Thane.” Authorities said a transit remand for the accused was acquired for taking them to Mumbai where they will be produced before special NCB court on Tuesday for seeking their custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ncb-seizes-truck-carrying-over-1000kg-of-marijuana-in-nanded/articleshow/87722579.cms||Mohammed Akhef

On Monday, AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch an extensive drive to remove all carts selling non-vegetarian food from public roads. The AMC decision comes in the wake of Rajkot and Vadodara mayors announcing similar decisions a few days ago. “All non-vegetarian food carts will be removed from all public roads, those operating near schools and colleges, religious places, marriage halls and community halls starting from November 16 Tuesday,” Devang Dani, the chairman of AMC’s town planning and estate management committee. When asked how many illegal or legal, non-vegetarian or vegetarian food carts are operating on the roads he did not have any answer. “We will conduct a survey,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dani-clueless-about-number-of-food-carts-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/87724884.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Is Gujarat govt ready to launch RTI portal, asks high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday questioned the state government on whether it is ready to launch a portal through which citizens can file applications seeking information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and asserted that the government can work out modalities later. The bench headed by Chief Justice Aravind Kumar asked the government to reply to its question on Wednesday. The court’s query came in response to two PILs filed three years ago, demanding online processing of RTI applications and to create a payment gateway for those who seek information online. Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Saurabh Soparkar submitted that the petitioner wants RTI applications to be processed online through a portal. The Centre and other states have already started accepting RTI applications through portals. He questioned why a developed state like Gujarat cannot do it. He termed the affidavit filed by the state government irrelevant and submitted that the government has taken three years on pretext of awarding contract to companies for the purpose of creating systems on how to track files with regard to RTI applications. “I want RTI application to be filed online and a payment gateway to pay fees, nothing more and nothing less. I do not desire to track the files in government department,” he submitted. The state government submitted that the process of finalizing the system is underway. To this, the chief justice said whether the concerned government secretary can state on an affidavit that he would receive all RTI applications online. “We want a three-line answer whether you are ready to process RTI applications online or not? We do not want all details. The moment you enter in all those details, it will be surrounded by mystery,” the judge sought reply after two days. After the senior advocate submitted that there are government agencies who want to set up payment gateway for free , another petitioner-advocate Sandeep Munjyasara drew the court’s attention on how the state government has taken three years to make a clear statement on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/is-state-govt-ready-to-launch-rti-portal-asks-high-court/articleshow/87724889.cms||---

A senior police officer said that a case was registered against the constables at Model Town police station for forging driving licences to get the job in Delhi Police by “deceitful means”. The dismissal order stated that the 12 constables are unfit for service. According to the police, more than 81 candidates had applied for the job in 2007 and several tests were conducted before the selected individuals received their appointment letter. An order issued by Delhi Police, signed by DCP Pankaj Kumar (operations and PCR), stated: “It has clearly been proven that the delinquent constables (drivers) deliberately and knowingly submitted a forged/fake driving licence by adopting deceitful means to seek recruitment. They all gave their residential address of Mathura in their licence, there’s no record of their residence in Mathura. It shows that the constables procured licences by adopting forged mean.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-papers-12-pcr-constables-dismissed-after-13-yrs-of-service/articleshow/87724931.cms||---

UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the Delhi government spent hardly anything on pollution control even as reports of highly toxic air and extremely poor quality of water in the Yamuna river were coming in. “This is the realty of the Kejriwal government. It is high on rhetoric but dismally low on action. The pollution in the Yamuna even during the Chhatth festival, coupled with poor air quality, is testimony to the total failure of the Delhi CM on pollution control. While he has failed to perform in Delhi, he is trying to give suggestions to other states,” the minister said. Demanding “urgent remedial measures” to bring pollution in Delhi under control, Singh said Kejriwal owed an explanation to the people of UP on why he was against them. “In the name of controlling pollution, he stopped construction work in Delhi and this is directly impacting workers. During the Covid-19 crisis last year, they cheated labourers from UP by turning them away and now once again he is snatching away their bread and butter,” the minister alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-slams-aap-over-pollution-spike-in-delhi/articleshow/87725719.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Lucknow||UP: Chief Secretary sends missive, asks officials to pick calls of MPs, MLAs||LUCKNOW: The UP government’s repeated directives to officials asking them to always pick up phone calls of public representatives, including MPs and MLAs, as per necessary protocol, have once again turned out to be a case of ‘talking to a brick wall’. The fact came to light recently when the Chief Secretary R K Tewari sent a stern missive to all additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries of various departments and the director general of police. The communique, dated November 11, also marked to all divisional commissioners and DMs, categorically mentions that officials in some districts neither pick the calls of public representatives vis-à-vis public welfare related works nor do they call back. The development comes barely two months after a parliamentary monitoring committee headed by UP assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit pressed for strict compliance of protocols due towards the public representatives as per the orders issued by the state government. Officials said the committee got several complaints about officials not following the parliamentary protocols besides being callous in responding to correspondence from the elected representatives. The chief secretary’s communique further points out that in case of being unavailable at the time of call, officials will call back’ soon after coming to know about the lawmaker’s phone call. All the officials in the districts should ‘save’ the phone numbers of the respective MPs/MLAs in their phones and in office records. The timing of the missive is being seen as the earnestness of the BJP to ensure public welfare work and development projects are not affected ahead of the UP assembly elections due in the next few months. CM has himself many times asked officials to take suggestions and feedback from MPs/MLAs while implementing various welfare schemes. During a recent region-wise meeting of BJP, party MLAs told the CM that officials are ‘unresponsive’ and do not pay heed to their suggestions. The government had sent out a similar communique on March 23 stating that officials are ‘making excuse’ of not having phone numbers of public representatives 'saved’ in their phones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cs-sends-missive-asks-officials-to-pick-calls-of-mps-mlas/articleshow/87725726.cms||Pankaj Shah

This is a rare precedent set in the country, where an accused has been charge-sheeted around a week. Earlier, an accused of a rape case was charge-sheeted by Surat police in 11 days. Senior police officers of the local crime branch (LCB), investigating the case, confirmed the development and said, “We have filed a 500-page charge sheet against the accused Vijay Thakor, resident of Vansjada village in Kalol taluka of Gandhnagar, after taking testimonies of 62 witnesses of the rapes and murder cases.” The officer said that Thakors’ involvement has also surfaced in four other cases of loot and attempt to murder on four other women which he had committed in a time span of around five months. “He used to talk with women who were moving alone and or struck conversations in the guise of helping them in their work or asking about some address. Then he used to attack them with a stick. He did this to four women and two of the four have gone paralytic after the attacks,” said an officer. Thakor – a labourer with a private firm in Santej – is married and has a six-year-old daughter, said police. “After his wife became pregnant a second time, he hunted for minor girls as he believed they would be unable to narrate his sexual predation to anyone, leaving him safe,” police said. Police received the first complaint on November 4. A woman labourer living near Rancharda village approached Santej police, alleging that an unidentified man had abducted her five-year-old daughter and left her at a secluded place. “The girl’s medical check-up confirmed that she had been raped,” said a police officer. Two days later, Santej police received a similar complaint from a casual labourer, who hails from Dahod. He told police that his three-year-old daughter had been kidnapped on the night of November 5 from their makeshift shanty near Khatraj crossroads. Thakor entered the hut when everyone was asleep and abducted the child. Thakor killed the three-year-old because she had been screaming loudly crying for help. He then raped her body and dumped it in a culvert near Moti Bhoyan village in Gandhinagar. The body has been recovered by the police on November 7- the day when Thakor was caught from his home in Vansjada. After being caught, Thakor confessed to have raped another seven-year-old girl in the last week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-file-chargesheet-in-8-days/articleshow/87724899.cms||---

---||Delhi||Ready for lockdown, but neighbours must do same for better results: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: As people continue to gasp for breath in the city, Delhi government informed the Supreme Court of its readiness to impose a lockdown to curb pollution but suggested a complete lockdown in Delhi-NCR to fight the air crisis. The court had recently asked the Centre and Delhi government to consider a lockdown of two days to check the generation of local pollutants given the extreme deterioration in the air quality. TimesViewLockdowns heap untold misery on the city’s poorest, already reeling from months of suffering due to Covid, which had reduced job opportunities and incomes. They should only be contemplated as a last resortThe state government argued that a complete lockdown in Delhi to curb local pollution would be meaningful only if it is replicated across the National Capital Region. “Given Delhi's compact size, a lockdown would have limited impact on the air quality,” Delhi government said in its affidavit. “This issue would need to be addressed at the level of airshed involving NCR areas. In view of the above, we are ready to consider this step if the same is mandated for the entire NCR areas by the government of India or by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region.” Track the pollution level in your cityIn the affidavit filed by an environment department official, the state government explained the remedial measures it had already taken to fight air pollution, including banning construction activities apart from closing educational institutions and directing all government officials to work from home for a week. Private offices have also been advised to switch to work from home mode to keep vehicles off the streets in an effort to reduce vehicular emissions. Delhi government explained that over the past several years, it has been observed that the AQI does not reach the 'severe' level between February and September. “November 2021 saw seven severe days in the first 13 days of the month and corresponded with an increased number of stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana averaging around 4300 incidents per day.” The court was informed about the measures being taken to counter air pollution. The government installed a smog tower at Connaught Place, while a pollution source apportionment study was carried out to gather targeted information on the local sources of pollution in Delhi for evolving pollution control and mitigation strategies. The government has identified 13 pollution hotspots and action is being taken on specific mitigation measures such as removal of plastic waste and garbage. The government has also implemented the directions and advisories of the Commission for Air Quality Management regarding road dust management, abatement of air pollution from dispersed sources, safeguarding and enforcement and greening and traffic management. The government has developed a comprehensive action plan to eliminate the paddy crop residue and stubble burning in Delhi, created a web portal to deal with construction and demolition waste, while road-owning agencies have set up dust control and management cells. Action is also being taken against petrol and diesel vehicles older, respectively, than 15 years and 10 years. At the same time, electric vehicles and private charging stations are being promoted in the city. A tender has been floated for the installation of 100 charging stations across Delhi. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday with an AQI of 349 at 3pm. The effective fire count by the Union earth sciences’ forecasting body, SAFAR, showed a high figure of 3,125, but the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 10% with the winds too slow to transport the farm fire emissions. The air quality is likely to remain ‘very poor’ for the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-for-lockdown-but-neighbours-must-do-same-for-better-results-govt/articleshow/87724879.cms||AlokKNMishra

With no relief granted by special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court, NCB will now approach the court in Pune.

---||Hyderabad||Including tobacco products under food illegal: Traders||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday reserved its judgment in a batch of petitions filed by traders of gutkha, khaini and other tobacco products, challenging the ban imposed by the state on their production, transport, storage and sale. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajsheker Reddy heard senior counsel Vivek Kohli and a few other advocates and reserved its judgment. Kohli in his argument said that the Centre had equipped itself with the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution) Act, 2003, known as COTPA law. “This law has not been repealed and is still in force. In the meantime, the Centre has brought Food Safety and Standards Act and has delegated the powers to states to deal with food safety issues,” he said. “But, the states have erroneously included tobacco products in the list of food items though they were never part of food. It is illegal to subject tobacco products to action under two laws,” he said. They should deal with tobacco products under COTPA only, and under this law, they cannot be banned, but only their sale can be regulated, he said. “That is what they have been doing in respect of cigarettes but are applying different yardsticks in respect of gutkha and khaini,” Kohli said. Refuting the allegations against police, Telangana home department counsel T Srikanth Reddy said the Supreme Court has upheld the powers of police to book gutkha traders under IPC provisions. “Several high courts have upheld the notifications issued by the state food commissioners,” he said. Nagesh Bhimapaka, state health department counsel, argued that only those tobacco products which are chewed were considered as food and hence the action of the state in banning them was correct. “The cigarette is not chewed and hence it is allowed,” he said. The bench reserved its judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/including-tobacco-products-under-food-illegal-traders/articleshow/87724861.cms||---

This is after the admission committee carried out three rounds of admissions so far this year for a total of 14,700 seats, said sources close to the development. “The number of vacant seats at GU collages are expected to increase to 7,000 after admissions for medical, paramedical and pharmacy colleges are held in the state,” said sources. After three rounds of admission, GU has given the task of filling the vacant BSc seats to the colleges. “These colleges will have to come out with a merit list and the admissions are to be endorsed by the university. This is going to be quite a task given the large number of vacant seats,” according to sources. The response from students for admission in GU science colleges has been quite dull this year. So many seats are vacant in a year when the Class 12 candidates have got the benefit of mass promotion points out to the lack of interest among students for these courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gu-likely-to-have-7000-vacant-bsc-seats/articleshow/87724909.cms||---

As soon as the news of the death of the farmer spread, locals thronged the spot and alerted the family members, besides the police. Family members, however, raised doubts after coming across a blood-stained shirt, besides injury marks on the body and a shawl lying at a distance of nearly 50-meters from the spot. At the same time, the family members claimed that the miscreants had hanged the body of the victim after killing him. The police immediately called the forensic team and got the evidence collected and said that the reason would be clear only after the autopsy report. The victim, identified as Naresh Kumar (35), a resident of Dalelpur village of Bidhnoo police station area, had gone to the fields on the banks of the canal on Sunday evening to irrigate the crop. His wife, Mithlesh said that she had last spoken to her husband at around 10 pm on Sunday, wherein he had told her that he will return home after irrigating the land by next morning. The incident came to light on Monday morning after the villagers, who had gone towards the canal in the morning, came across the dead body of Naresh hanging from a `Babul’ tree, follwoing which they raised alarm. On being informed, wife Mithlesh, daughter Deepika, Ragni and son Raju rushed to the spot. The victim’s wife alleged that the shirt from which the dead body was found hanging does not belong to her husband. The injury marks have been found near the left eye. The family members claimed that the miscreants, after murdering the victim, had hanged his body to give it a colour of suicide. A blood-stained shirt and Naresh’s shawl were found at some distance from the spot. His slippers were found lying under the tree. On the arrival of the police, the family members staged a protest and demanded to call in a forensic team and a dog squad. After some time, the forensic team reached the spot and collected evidence by taking possession of a blood-stained shirt, shawl and slippers. When the dog squad did not come, the relatives again refused to hand over the dead body to cops for postmortem. CO Ghatampur Sushil Kumar Dwivedi tried to convince the family members and after nearly five hours, subsequently, a dog squad was requisitioned. Police station in-charge Atul Kumar Singh said that the matter is being investigated. The situation will be clear only after the post-mortem report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/farmers-dead-body-found-hanging-from-tree-kin-suspect-murder/articleshow/87724100.cms||---

---||Delhi||200 trees de-concretised in south Delhi, HC told||NEW DELHI: The south corporation on Monday informed Delhi high court that it has deconcretised 1,200 trees in an area and has launched a special drive to ensure all such trees are freed. In an affidavit filed before Justice Najmi Waziri, the corporation said it had identified 1,736 trees in Vasant Vihar that require removal of concrete. “In 70 trees, nails and wires strung around have been removed and in 24 trees, anti-termite medicine has been sprayed,” the civic body stated. The south corporation also assured the high court that the drive to deconcretise trees in the area will continue. Meanwhile, the forest department has told the high court that its tree officer will carry out a joint survey in Vasant Vihar to identify any concretised trees and inform PWD and SDMC to take steps. The court had recently taken note of what it dubbed “victimisation of trees” and demanded an explanation from the civic body and Delhi government on why hundreds of trees have been concretised. It acted on a plea by activist Bhavreen Kandahari seeking preservation of trees. The court was shocked by some of the photographs shown by the petitioner’s advocate, Aditya Prasad, and noted that “right up to the tree trunk, nails have been embedded and metallic wires have been strung along the trees.” The court had earlier noted that “concretisation of the street is unmindful of the directions of this court and that of the NGT, it shows disregard of the law not only by the municipal corporation but also by the road maintaining agency – the public works department” and directed them to file an affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/200-trees-de-concretised-in-south-delhi-hc-told/articleshow/87724915.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Mumbai||In Monday effect, Maharashtra's Covid cases fall to April 2020 levels||MUMBAI: The Covid graph in the state plunged to one of its lowest points so far since March 2020 on Monday as 686 cases were registered. On November 6 (Bhai Dooj), the state had recorded 661 cases; on the Monday after it, 751 cases. It clearly seems to a Monday effect: with fewer tests conducted over the weekend, the tally is lower on Mondays (when the results are available) than on other weekdays. In Mumbai, less than 200 cases were registered as 23,723 tests were carried out against the usual 35,000-plus. Four deaths were registered. With only 258 critical cases in the city, a civic doctor said it’s clearly a lull between Covid waves. Only 7% of the 17,501 Covid beds in the city are occupied. “It is nearly 10 days since Diwali and the state has not reported any significant spike in Covid cases. We are now ensuring that people who are still unvaccinated take their dose as early as possible,” said an official. CM Uddhav Thackeray’s officer on special duty, Sudhir Naik, tested positive on Monday and was admitted to a private hospital as a precaution. A testing camp was held at the CM’s bungalow Varsha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-monday-effect-state-cases-fall-to-apr-20-levels/articleshow/87724893.cms||---
---||Goa||Since 2017, Goa assembly sat for average 16 days in a year: ADR||PANAJI: In the past five years, Goa’s 40 elected lawmakers worked for an average of just 16 days a year. A detailed performance report by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) highlights the plummeting graph of the Goa legislative assembly since 2017, with the House often meeting for a single day to meet Constitutional obligations. The report also shows that of the 40 MLAs, just 11 participated in the business of the house every single day out of the 80 days that the House functioned. Ministers are not required to mark their attendance. Congress MLAs Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Digambar Kamat asked the most questions. Most of the questions revolved around water supply, panchayats and rural development, and education. “Many want to know whether this track record of 16 days is good or bad,” said ADR representative Bhasker Assoldekar. “I would suggest, compare it with the 312 days the 16th Lok Sabha sat in five years from 2014, which is almost 62 days in a year against the Goa assembly’s 16. (This was) perhaps partly due to Covid-19.” The report shows that the duration of the state legislative assembly has been on a decline since 2017, with the number of sittings declining from 24 days in 2017 to eight days in 2021. The number of bills passed by the lawmakers also saw a corresponding decline from 28 in 2017 to 12 in 2021. The longest session was from July 15 to August 9, 2019. The House met for just a single day on four different occasions. In 2018, well before the Covid-19 pandemic, the House was convened just twice for a total period of 16 days, indicating the BJP government’s move to skirt legislative debates in the state assembly. The Constitution does not stipulate the number of days that a legislative assembly should meet, but does state that not more than six months should pass between sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/since-2017-goa-assembly-sat-for-avg-16-days-in-a-yr-adr/articleshow/87725737.cms||---

According to police, Jebaliya and Dhandhal families had a long-standing rift over a money dispute. On Monday morning three men identified as Munna Dhandhal, Uday Dhandhal and Raghu Dhandhal arrived at Nagarka village in a car and opened fire at Shardul Jebaliya killing him on the spot. In retaliation, the three were attacked by the Jebaliya family. They too suffered serious injuries and are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Botad. Additional cops have been deployed at the hospital to prevent further untoward incidents. While cops said that the accused fired only a round at Jebaliya, which hit him in the chest, sources claimed many rounds were fired indiscriminately. Cops have sought help from forensic experts to ascertain how many rounds were fired. Meanwhile, based on a complaint filed by the deceased’s father, Bhoja Jebaliya, police have booked the trio for murder and also under the Arms Act. Another offence was also registered by police for the attack carried out on the three accused. Following the incident, senior police officials including deputy superintendent of police Chetan Mundhwa reached the village. “There was a past rift due to which the clash broke out on Monday morning.

---||Lucknow||‘Indian Road Congress norms overlooked’||Lucknow: Accusing the BJP of having compromised with the quality of construction involving Purvanchal Expressway project, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was aware that specifications of the Indian Road Congress -- apex body of highway engineers in the country – have been thrown to the wind to reduce the project cost. The former UP CM said that the material used in the expressway and scant regard to specifications of the road congress will not only take its toll on the quality of the construction, but also make journey by road more cumbersome for commuters. He said as per the Indian Road Congress the expressway should have a 12-metre divider, but the median has been compromised to reduce cost. “These specifications of the Indian Road Congress came after the Lucknow-Agra expressway was completed and should be adhered to by all new expressways constructed thereafter but have been overlooked in Purvanchal Expressway,” he said. “It is not only about the median. Government advertisements claim that geo cells have been put in place to hold the soil from being washed away by water during rains. In layman’s language these geo-cells are known as plastic sheets. Government claims bitumen used in the process will contain rubber for improved quality and performance. But the recent rains saw sections of the expressway being washed away,” Akhilesh said. “Were geo cells missing from the part of the expressway that were washed away in the rains? If mixing rubber in bitumen has improved the quality of the expressway then why has the riding quality come down,” he questioned. He said the riding quality of Purvanchal expressway is such that it will leave commuters with stomach ache and backaches. “Desh ke Pradhan Mantri ji aa rahe hain ... unki jankari mein ye cheezen hain kin nahi (Country’s Prime Minister is coming to inaugurate the project. Is he aware of these issues).” the former UP CM said. The SP chief went on to question the basis on which some top construction companies were dropped from the project by the ruling BJP. “Will the PM ask the UP CM why country’s topline companies were dropped from the project. Not that I am rooting for these industrial houses, but these very companies are associated with the construction of Ram Temple, statue of Sardar Patel and some most important projects of the country. Why were they dropped from the project,” Akhilesh questioned talking to the media at party headquarters. The 341-km-long Purvanchal Expressway, a section of which is slated to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will connect UP’s nine districts, including Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur. Samajwadi Party on Monday accused the district administration in Ghazipur of not only stopping the party from proceeding with their Vijay Yatra to Azamgarh using the Purvanchal expressway, but also claimed that authorities have placed boulders at all entry points of the expressway. He said if permission was not granted to him to use the expressway, he would inaugurate it symbolically by offering flowers as the project is originally that of the SP government. Though initially the SP chief was slated to take expressway route from Ghazipur to reach Azamgarh on Tuesday, looking at the response of the district authorities he postponed his event by a day. He will now reach Ghazipur on Wednesday and take the expressway route to reach Azamgarh as a part of his ‘Vijay Yatra’. “I am happy that the Prime Minister will inaugurate the expressway — a project of the Samajwadi Party government,” he said, adding that the ruling BJP cannot name a single project that the government had laid the foundation of and inaugurated it as well. Citing an instance that took place during the Bahujan Samaj Party regime, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav recalled how he had planned to cycle his way from Noida on the then newly constructed expressway but the government stopped him. “We carried the bicycles on our shoulders and crossed the new expressway and inaugurated the project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/indian-road-congress-norms-overlooked/articleshow/87725741.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Speaking after inaugurating the office of a BJP office-bearer in Aurangabad, Danve said, “During the time of the Congress government, petrol prices were linked to the international market. It is not the Union government that does the work of increasing petrol prices... These rates are decided in America, and, therefore, it is wrong to blame us.” The senior BJP leader said that even now, the Union government has reduced its taxes but, “the state governments led by Congress and other parties are not ready to reduce their share of taxes. We should tell this to the citizens.” Danve made the statements while inaugurating the office of BJP office-bearer Raju Shinde in Aurangabad late on Sunday. He was accompanied by BJP leaders from in and around Aurangabad. Danve said that currently, the country is being run on the money from the Union government. “None of the three parties in the state government sit together or take decisions. If we tell this to the people, I am sure that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders will struggle to save their faces in the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” Danve said. The statement has been criticised by people’s representatives from MVA, with some of them recalling the BJP leadership’s statements on price hike while it was in the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wrong-to-blame-union-govt-for-fuel-price-rise-says-danve/articleshow/87722606.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Ahmedabad||Change in Afghan regime: Pakistani drug lords clear stocks||AHMEDABAD: The big shots in the drug cartels have gathered in UAE and decided to sell drugs in large scale as soon as the Taliban took over power in Afghanistan — the biggest producer of opium in the world. The Times of India on September 22 had published the news on how the drug mafia are desperate to pump in prodigious quantities of heroin into India through the Gujarat coast. ATS officers said that the sender of the 120kg heroin consignment – Zahid Bashir Baloch had met the accused Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodia, and Hussein’s brother Isa Rav was in constant touch with Baloch for around three years. Before the drug was delivered near the international maritime border to Hussein and his aides in the territorial water of Pakistan on October 23, Hussein had a meeting with Baloch who told him to sell the consignment at the earliest. There was a desperation showed by Baloch as he also knew that the Taliban government might not further allow opium or any drug trade on its land in Afghanistan. Apart from the Gujarat ATS, officers of other agencies believe that concentrated efforts are being made to push heroin produced in Afghanistan into India. The officers said that the drug lords not only fear confiscation of the narcotics stock by the Taliban but apart from staggering financial losses, they also face the prospect of summary execution if caught in the narcotics trade. These factors are fuelling the drug stock clearance runs to India conducted by apparently desperate Pakistani drug lords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-in-afghan-regime-pak-drug-lords-clear-stocks/articleshow/87724998.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Farm leaders’ misguidance behind fire in fields: J P Dalal||CHANDIGARH: Haryana has made a provision of around Rs 200 crore this year to curb the stubble burning in the state. State agriculture and farmers welfare minister J P Dalal also claimed that stubble burning in Haryana was not the reason behind poor air quality in Delhi but use of firecrackers during Diwali and the wind direction were responsible for causing such a high level of pollution. “Haryana has almost negligible incidents of stubble fire this year as compared to previous years but because of defiance in districts due to pressure and misguidance by farmers’ leaders like Gurnam Singh Charuni, the incidents of fire have been reported,” he alleged. Farmers were being misguided by some “self-styled farmer leaders” only to create a situation of confrontation with the government and perhaps that was the reason why a number of stubble fires in two-three districts was high this time, he added. Incentives to curb stubble burningFrom 2018 to 2021, the state government has provided around 32,489 machines to individuals and 21,236 machines for around 4,200 custom hiring centres (CHC) on subsidised rates for mitigation of stubble burning, Dalal said. According to the minister, around 19,000 machines have been provided this season, of which 9,000 have been given to individual farmers and around 10,000 to the custom hiring centres on subsidised rates. A total of Rs 174 crore subsidies have been given in this season only to control stubble burning incidents, he added. Around 96,000 acres have been diversified for other crops from paddy this year through a special scheme for which Rs 7,000 per acre incentive has been given, he pointed out. On long term measuresA large number of projects have been initiated, including setting up of 4-30 megawatt (MW) paddy straw-based biomass power plants, in which one lakh metric tonne paddy straw is needed. The number of plants would be increased, which would use 14 lakh MT stubble would be required. This could be the permanent solution to this problem, the minister said. Doing better than Punjab Asserting that the situation in Haryana was much better than Punjab, Dalal said while 67,165 incidents had been reported in Punjab as per satellite imagery, Haryana’s figure was less than 10% of it. He said that only around 5,400 incidents of stubble fire had been reported in Haryana till date. Delhi pollution not due to farm burning The minister claimed that stubble fire in Haryana may have miniscule impact but there are several other factors contributing to this. He added that it happened every year after Diwali and firecrackers used during the festive season is the main reason. According to Dalal, direction of wind was also sometimes the reason behind such poor quality in NCR. No dearth of fertiliser in the stateTalking about the dearth of fertiliser in the state, the agriculture minister claimed that there was no actual shortage and till last week, the supply of fertiliser had already crossed the stock received by the state till November 30 last year. “We are regularly in touch with the Centre, and in the past three days, eight racks of DAP have been received and nine more racks are expected in the next three days. The Centre is providing 7,000 to 8,000 metric tonnes of DAP and NPK fertilisers every day,” he added. According to the minister, around 2.10 lakh metric tonnes of DAP has been made available in the state, of which 1.82 lakh metric tonnes has been purchased by farmers. Around 3.84 lakh metric tonnes of urea, 93,000 metric tonnes of SSP and 37,000 metric tonnes of NPK are available in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-leaders-misguidance-behind-fire-in-fields-dalal/articleshow/87724956.cms||Ajay Sura

The state transport utility employees are protesting to get the MSRTC merged with the state government. However, with around a week gone, none of the factions are ready to back down. Also, every year additional MSRTC buses used to ply to Pandharpur on the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi. This time around, as the buses are not plying due to strike, the MSRTC workers conducted Vitthal puja on Monday on the premises of the bus stand. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers’ association in Kolhapur, said, “Our demand is crystal clear and there is no backing off now till it gets approved. Today (on Monday), on the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi, we performed Bhajan-Kirtan on the bus stand premises and prayed for better sense to prevail with the state government to approve our demands as early as possible.” Meanwhile, passengers continued to have a hard time as they are relying on private and goods transport vehicles. Samadhan Shinde, a passenger who hitched a ride on a milk truck, said, “My village is in the remote areas of Shahuwadi tehsil and every day the ST bus used to ply to our village twice. Now, as the buses are not plying, villagers are struggling to travel from one point to another. I had to request a milk transport truck to drop me till Kolhapur bus stand. The fares of the private buses are too high and unaffordable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/msrtc-staff-strike-enters-second-week-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87722612.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

District magistrate Vishakh G Aiyer, after receiving the complaint, has constituted a two-member committee to probe the alleged irregularities in the construction. CDO Mahendra Kumar and SDM Sadar Anurag Jain are members of the committee. The two officials inspected the newly-constructed pavilion on Sunday. The biggest problem of the new players pavilion is that its sewer system had not been connected with the main line besides seepage at points and out of order transformers. The committee had sought a copy of the work order and invoice from the executive engineer of Avas and Vikas which was the construction agency. The committee had asked the PWD engineers to check the quality of construction of the building on the basis of its site plan and DPR on this basis of which the committee will submit its report to the DM Kanpur Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/two-member-panel-to-probe-irregularities-in-construction-of-pavilion-in-green-park-stadium/articleshow/87724144.cms||अनंत नारायण

Sanjiv Inamdar was the manager of Ambawadi branch of PNB when the alleged scam occured. With him, two persons — Mayank Shah and Rikin Shah of Jainal Enterprise — were also sentenced to undergo imprisonment. Inamdar was fined Rs 7.5 lakh while Mayank and Rikin were asked to pay fine of Rs 7 lakh each. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act in December 2004 against the accused. It was alleged that the then chief manager of PNB had sanctioned cash credit (hypothecation) facility of Rs 40 lakh to Mayank Shah, proprietor of city-based firm in conspiracy with other accused on the basis of forged documents, without carrying out physical verification of the immovable property. This allegedly caused loss of Rs 40 lakh to the bank. After investigation, a chargesheet was filed in October 2006 against seven accused. During the trial, two accused passed away and the case against them stood abated. The court acquitted two persons and held the then bank manager guilty of corruption alongwith two others of forgery and cheating. Special judge V R Raval handed ordered down the punishment and imposed a fine of various amounts for conviction under different offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pnb-manager-two-others-get-five-yr-jail-term-for-loan-scam/articleshow/87724995.cms||---

Following an incident on November 1, when she was abused by her mother-in-law, she’d left for her parents’ house and from there lodged the complaint under IPC Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 294 (b) (uttering obscene words). The woman stated that she had wed a Bapunagar resident in 2016 and for about two months she was happy at her matrimonial home. Soon after, her in-laws began abusing and insulting her for not bringing 500g of gold but only 250g in her dowry. They threatened she will have to live and work like a servant unless she brought another 250g gold from her parents, as there were other members of the community who were ready to give 500g gold in dowry to give the hands of their daughters in marriage. They forced her to do menial work and treated her like a maidservant, the woman alleged. She said after this she had gone to her parents, but they convinced her to return and start life afresh. But things didn’t change and her in-laws kept up their abuse. Finally, on November 1, while she was working in the kitchen, her mother-in-law entered the kitchen and abused her over noises from utensils. Thereafter, she went to her parental home and filed her complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-harassed-for-250g-dowry-deficit-in-gold/articleshow/87725020.cms||---
---||Goa||Tree felling posing threat to one of Goa’s highest peaks||KERI: One of the highest peaks of the Western Ghats in Goa at 726m, Vagheri’s private forests, which come under the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, are under threat due to increased illegal tree felling activities allegedly being undertaken by some of the land owners at the behest of a Delhi-based firm that plans to set up an eco-tourism project here. The Vageri hill covers Keri, Zarme, and Pali areas of Sattari and has for ages been known as the abode of the tiger. In 1999, the Sawant committee appointed by the Goa government had identified 200ha area in Keri as private forests. Subsequently, the Karapurkar committee and V T Thomas committee had also identified private forests on the Vagheri hill. Despite this, owners of private forests here have allegedly made attempts to sell their land to a Delhi-based firm. Taking advantage of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, land owners sought permission to clear bushes and instead undertook tree felling illegally. “Last year we booked an offence against unidentified persons for illegal felling of trees. We also told the owners not to repeat the illegal felling,” Keri range forest officer Vivek Gaonkar told TOI. Deputy conservator of forests Santosh Phadte said that he has already instructed forest officials not to allow any forest clearance and to take necessary steps for the protection of the private forests at Vagheri. “Six kilometres of the pathway going to privately-owned forests passes through the sanctuary and we have instructed our staff to restrain unnecessary entry to Vagheri hill,” RFO of the sanctuary, Deepak Tandel said. If these eco-tourism plans materialise, it will cause irreparable loss to the wildlife, ecology and environment, environmentalists said. Environmentalists said that damage was first wrought to the hill’s ecology after the state forest department undertook tree felling here with a view to afforest it with exotic tree species. Later, cashew plantations taken up by local communities had posed a threat to its natural cover. However, the more recent tree felling and clearing of bushes for proposed eco-tourism activities has only served to accelerate the degradation of the hill’s natural habitat, they said. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s directives, Goa government had constituted a state-level expert committee on January 24, 1997, under the chairmanship of Sadanand Sawant to identify private forests. The Sawant committee had identified private forests contiguous to government forests having 75% forestry species and 40% canopy cover. In 1999, government-owned forests were included in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, which also had a one-kilometre eco-sensitive zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tree-felling-posing-threat-to-one-of-goas-highest-peaks/articleshow/87725774.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Lucknow||Expressways to put Uttar Pradesh on fast track of progress||By invitation: Pravin SinghLUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is the land of opportunities in terms of business, industries and human capital. The last four-and-a-half years have seen an unprecedented boost to infrastructure to bring this vast state on the driver’s seat to ensure nation’s development. The objective of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is to make Uttar Pradesh the driver of development activities. PM Narendra Modi had also said recently that “a determined approach to boost infrastructure in the state is turning UP into an ‘express state’”. The expressway projects launched since 2016 include Purvanchal Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway, Ganga Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority has been given the responsibility of completing these projects. While Purvanchal Expressway is set to be inaugurated by the PM on November 16, work on other expressways is continuing at a fast pace. GatiShakti Boost: The development of expressways in UP is set to get a boost with the GatiShakti National Master Plan for infrastructure development. It aims to ensure integrated planning and implementation of infrastructure projects in the next four years, with focus on expediting works on the ground, saving cost and creating jobs. Purvanchal Expressway: Express development for East UP: The Purvanchal Expressway has opened new horizons for the development of eastern Uttar Pradesh which has immense possibilities with its abundant natural resources, extensive agriculture, a huge repository of human resources, a big market, and unique products in all districts. The foundation stone laying ceremony for the Purvanchal Expressway was held in Azamgarh in July 2018 by PM Narendra Modi. This greenfield expressway has its starting point at Chand Sarai village, located near the existing Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH- 731) in Lucknow. Its end point is near village Haidaria on NH-31 in Ghazipur. Its total length is 340.82 km and the districts falling along the expressway include Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur. Districts near the Purvanchal Expressways have immense industrial potential. A wide range of products from Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ayodhya, Gorakhpur, Ambedkarnagar and Ballia will get access to huge market. Major gains are expected in getting a big market for ODOP (one district, one product) items from these districts. The total project financial outlay of the expressway was Rs 22,497 crore, of which, land acquisition accounted for Rs 7,380 crore. Gorakhpur Link Expressway: Boost to the east: For large parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Gorakhpur is the hub of activity in education, medical & health facilities, trading, tourism, sugar mills, border trade with Nepal, and also holds cultural and religious significance dating back to centuries. The city is named after the revered saint Gorakshanath. The Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur is the seat of the Nath sect. With the futuristic era of expressways now covering the entire state, Gorakhpur will soon be linked to Purvanchal Expressway with a Link Expressway. The Gorakhpur Link Expressway project is a 91-km long, fully access controlled four-lane expressway with the starting point at Jaitpur in Gorakhpur, on the NH-27 bypass. It will end at Salarpur village in Azamgarh, joining the Purvanchal Expressway which ends at Haidaria village in Ghazipur. The stipulated date for completion of the project is December 2023. Ganga Expressway: Express road link across UP : The Ganga is synonymous with the spirit and essence of India. Now, an expressway coming up along the holy river will transform road connectivity in the state. The Ganga Expressway will be a 594-km long, fully access-controlled expressway proposed to start from Bijauli village on Meerut-Bulandshahr road (NH-334) in Meerut, and ending at Judapur Dando village near bypass on NH-19 in Prayagraj. It is slated to be completed by 2025. Bundelkhand Expressway: Towards rapid transformation: Bundelkhand is a historic region in central India straddling across UP and MP. Now, a modern expressway will transform this relatively inaccessible region into a hotbed of development activities. The CM launched the Bundelkhand Expressway project in April 2017. After the completion of this project, the ambitious Defence Industrial Corridor Project will get tremendous boost. The proposed expressway will link Bundelkhand with Delhi through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The PM laid its foundation stone on February 29, 2020. Its total length is 296.07 km, beginning from Chitrakoot on Jhansi-Prayagraj NH-35/76 near Bharatkoop, and ending at Agra-Lucknow Expressway, near Kudrail village of Takha tehsil on Agra-Lucknow Expressway in Etawah. Till November 2021, more than 75% work on the expressway has been completed and at this pace, it is likely to be completed by the stipulated time of March 2022.

Justice Sophy Thomas made the observation on a petition filed by Salim Kumar of Kollam through advocate IV Pramod. The petitioner, a village assistant, had challenged a case registered by Badiadka police under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act. As per Section 118(a), any person found in a public place in an intoxicated manner or riotous condition or incapable of looking after himself can be booked for causing grave violation of public order or danger. The petitioner had said he was called to the police station at 7 pm to identify an accused and a false case was registered as he couldn’t identify the accused as required by police as the accused was a stranger to him. The HC said, “Consuming liquor in a private place without causing nuisance or annoyance to anybody will not attract any offence. Mere smell of alcohol also can’t be construed to mean that the person was intoxicated or was under the influence of any liquor.” Even if the petitioner had consumed alcohol, the available facts and materials in the case are not sufficient to suggest that he was not able to control himself or he committed rioting inside the police station, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/booze-smell-alone-not-proof-of-intoxication-kerala-hc/articleshow/87726755.cms||---

Congress is likely to re-field incumbent MLC KC Kondaiah. The saffron party has submitted five names to the core committee, including Channabasanagouda, the defeated candidate in the previous MLC election. Meanwhile, KC Kondaiah has already completed one round of campaigning by meeting with elected officials in local governments. Y Satish, Gonal Rajashekhar, Channabasanagoudra, Dharmendra Singh, and Dammuru Shekhar are BJP's MLC candidates. Tourism minister Anand Singh, transport minister B Sriramulu, MLA Somashekhar Reddy, Janardan Reddy, and other BJP leaders need to work hard to retain the constituency, but they seem to have lost enthusiasm for the MLC elections for a variety of reasons, including the separation of Vijayanagara district from Ballari. “We should not underestimate Congress candidate Kondaiah in this election because he won the previous MLC poll by a large margin. However, if leaders and workers work together in the election, the BJP will have better chances. I hope the party will consider me as a candidate, but the final decision will be made by the party,” said Y Satish. Mrutyunjaya Jinaga represented this constituency during the Reddy brothers' tenure, but in the previous election, BJP candidate Channabasanagoudru (who got only 1,500 votes) was defeated by KC Kondaiah by a huge margin (secured 3,098 votes). This time, 4,663 people are eligible to vote in the constituency, which includes MPs, MLCs, and MLAs from 11 taluks in both districts. In Congress, Kondaiah may be the undisputed candidate, but some party leaders have been demanding ticket for a Dalit candidate. " There is no strong Dalit voice in in the council from the Kalyana Karnataka region. If the Congress gives a ticket to a Dalit leader in the Ballari local body MLC election, it will help to raise community issues of the backward area," said a Congress leader from the Dalit community in the Ballari district.

---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC slams CBI for ‘unsatisfactory’ probe into Jaunpur custodial death||PRAYAGRAJ: Slamming the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its failure to properly investigate the alleged custodial death of a 24-year-old man from Jaunpur, the Allahabad high court has observed that the affidavit filed by the CBI is totally unsatisfactory as it indicated that no concrete effort had been made by it to arrest the accused persons, who are policemen. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Ajay Kumar Yadav of Jaunpur district, a division bench comprising justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and justice Piyush Agrawal observed, “The averment made by the CBI that efforts are being made, appears to be merely an eyewash in view of the stand taken on the last date of hearing as recorded in the order October 27, 2021 that the CBI arrests accused only after completion of investigation.” In its affidavit, the CBI gave the details of police officers, suspects and accused persons and also stated that efforts are being made by conducting raids/ searches at their known addresses, examining their CDRs/ IPDRs, and deploying sources to get their present locations for the execution of non-bailalble warrants (NBWs). It was also stated that arrest warrants have been issued by local police from the court of chief judicial magistrate, Jaunpur on September 6, 2021. However, the court noted that the accused persons haven’t been arrested even after more than two months. However, in its order dated November 10, the court granted one more opportunity to the CBI to investigate the case properly and execute the arrest warrants without any further delay and to take all consequential action as provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), including the provisions of sections 82 and 83 CrPC, by which the accused are declared as absconders and their properties are attached. Lastly, the court called for an affidavit from CBI on the next date, i.e., November, 29, 2021. The CBI has been asked to clarify its stand on its submission made earlier that CBI arrests the accused only after completion of the investigation. Earlier, at one stage, this court had transferred the probe of the alleged death of a 24-year-old man in police custody in Jaunpur district in February this year to CBI, while observing that “the entire effort of the police is to somehow give clean chit to the accused”. It is alleged by the petitioner that a police team of Baksha police station in Jaunpur district forcibly took away Krishna Yadav alias Pujari, who was about 24 years of age, on February 11, 2021 in an alleged false case and detained him at the police station. When the informant (brother of the deceased) went to the police station, he was not allowed to meet his brother and the next morning (February 12, 2021), he was informed that his brother (Pujari) had died. Thereafter, a case was registered against the accused police officers under Sections 302 (murder) and other sections of Indian Penal Code at Baksa police station. On the other hand, police claimed that the youth was apprehended while he was driving a motorcycle which fell due to which he received injuries and the public beat him up. As per the police version, when he (the detained youth) was sent for first aid along with a sub inspector and two constables, the doctor at the community health centre referred him to district hospital, Jaunpur, and by the time they reached the district hospital, he had died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-slams-cbi-for-unsatisfactory-probe-into-jaunpur-custodial-death/articleshow/87724155.cms||---
---||Allahabad||SRN hospital to provide ‘jumbo pack platelet’ to help dengue patients in Prayagraj||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that the Sangam city has recorded 926 dengue cases (till Sunday) and there has been an enhanced demand for the platelets among the patients suffering from dengue, Swaroop Rani Nehru hospital of the MLN medical college of the city is all set to provide the much-needed relief. As good news for the denizens suffering from dengue, the blood bank at SRN would be providing a ‘Jumbo pack platelet’ for the patient who needs the same. This has become possible after the use of the Apheresis machine, which has been installed in the blood bank of the hospital last year. “This machine has come handy when we needed a large quantity of plasma during the Covid-19 pandemic and now that we have got the rate for the Jumbo pack platelet from the government, we have started providing the same," said associate professor at the department of transfusion medicines at MLN medical college of the district, Dr Ravi Rani. The benefit of the jumbo pack, which is also called single donor Apheresis platelets, is that a single unit of this pack can result in an increase of around 50,000 platelets in a dengue patient, explains the medico. The government has fixed the rate of one unit of jumbo pack platelets at Rs 8,000 and this would be given to patients admitted in the government hospitals. However, it will be completely free for the patients of Thalassemia and those who are covered under 'Janani Shuraksha Yojna' of the central government. Dr Ravi Rani says that the increased platelet count from 50 to 60 thousand in one unit would also mean that it would be of immense help in terms of helping the patients suffering from dengue. There is a shortage of platelets due to high demand and every effort is being made to provide platelets to all the patients in SRN, she added. Another benefit of using the Apheresis machine and segregating the platelets through it is that the donor just has to donate the platelets and the rest of the components of the blood would be transfused back to the donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/srn-hospital-to-provide-jumbo-pack-platelet-to-help-dengue-patients-in-prayagraj/articleshow/87724164.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Cloudy atmosphere leaves paddy farmers in Raichur, Yadgir worried||Kalaburagi: The countdown to harvesting paddy having begun in the earnest in Raichur and Yadgir districts, the gloomy weather prevailing almost across Karnataka, has the farmers understandably perturbed. The overcast sky may result in the colour of the rice in the crop going black, which will subsequently translate to huge losses for the farmers, who will be forced to sell their crop at a throwaway price.On Monday, the farmers in the two districts greeted the Sun with visible delight, for the bright light rent asunder the gloom that had hung over the sky for the past four days. Rice mill owners are unlikely to purchase the blackened crop, and if they do, may not offer an attractive sum to the farmers. There are also fears of a marked reduction in the yield this year.Most of the farmers engaged in the cultivation of paddy in the two districts have leased farmland for the venture. Under the terms of the agreement, the farmer is obliged to pay the landlord once the paddy is harvested. However, with the threat of their crop blackening, the farmers, most of whom borrowed money from private moneylenders to sow their fields, are fretting over honouring their commitment, and settling their debts.Bheemappa Hosamani, a farmer in Kembavi, Shorapur taluk in Yadgir, said that the cloudy atmosphere was likely to result in the rice crop accruing a black hue, which would, in turn, result in their produce fetching very low prices. “We are all quite worried since we have to prepare for the harvest soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cloudy-atmosphere-leaves-paddy-farmers-in-raichur-yadgir-worried/articleshow/87723424.cms||---

Gurkirat, who was the chief guest at Punjab Day function held during the ongoing India International Trade Fair 2021 at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, also urged the central government to re-open Kartarpur corridor which has been closed since March 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic. About industrial growth in the state, the minister said that the Punjab government has brought investment of over Rs 1 lakh crore, which has not only given the much needed boost to the economy but also generated employment. He said a two-day Progressive Punjab Investors’ Summit was organised recently and the government has also set up the Punjab bureau of investment promotion as the single point of contact for facilitation of investors. The new industrial policy with detailed schemes and operational guidelines was implemented with the sole motive of making the state number one destination for investors and business in the country. The new policy covers extensive reforms, focusing on eight key strategic pillars of change, including infrastructure, power, skill, MSMEs, startup and entrepreneurship, ease of doing business, fiscal and non-fiscal incentives and policy. The minister took a round of Punjab Pavilion which has been designed and decorated in consonance with the theme of IITF 2021 i.e. Atmanirbhar Bharat- Self Reliant India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-failed-to-control-delhi-pollution-now-blaming-farmers-punjab-minister/articleshow/87724990.cms||---

Autorickshaw drivers went on strike as a mark of protest towards the drastic surge in prices of CNG. The strike however, received a lukewarm response. “Since Covid-19 lockdown, auto rickshaw drivers were struggling to do business. With the drastic surge in CNG prices, rickshaw drivers’ revenues are dented. Our fares were revised after four years which should have been done much earlier,” said Rajvir Upadhyay, president, Jagrut Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union. Members have sought that they be allowed to revise prices independently. Rickshaw drivers have also sought to regulate cab aggregators who are levying upfront charges, alleging they’re fleecing customers.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 12-day baby dumped in drain saved by Nirbhaya cops||MUMBAI: She has been named Pari (fairy) and is the cynosure of all eyes at a suburban hospital. But her flickering, 12-day life has been anything but a fairy tale so far. On Sunday, nobody was sure if the waif of a girl would survive after she was rescued from a drain near Ramabai Nagar in Ghatkopar by a woman-led police team. Dressed in nothing but a flimsy T-shirt and soaking in the water and trash in the drain for an hour at least, Pari was lucky she did not drown, choke or freeze to death. Her incessant wails finally alerted residents, who informed the police. The police team acted with common sense and speed. Rushed to a hospital in the nick of time, Pari is now doing well. Pantnagar police have filed an FIR against her unidentified parents for abandoning her and are looking for them. Early on Sunday, the Nirbhaya squad of Pantnagar police station was attending to a distress call at Ramabai Nagar. Around 3.30am, the squad was informed about a baby’s cries from a drain at D B Pawar Chowk. The team wrapped up as quickly as possible and rushed to the drain. A couple of residents were up but nobody had touched the baby for fear of “interfering in police work”. “The two-and-half-foot-high drain had a thin flow of water. The infant had turned sideways when we found her and her cries were growing faint. Cats had started to gather around. We believe she may have been abandoned for an hour at least. Large tiles had been used to cover the drain partially so that she wouldn’t be discovered,” said constable Sheetal Sonawane. When she and assistant sub inspector Vitthal Pardhi lifted the baby out, she was freezing; her arms had turned blue. “We asked for some warm water and cloth to clean the baby,” said Sonawane. She swaddled the infant and tried to arrange for warm milk and a baby bottle, but the child wouldn’t stop crying. So the team rushed her to a public hospital. Getting the baby admitted was an ordeal. The hospital said they had only one infant warmer and it was required for babies born in-house. The paediatric and NICU wards also turned them away. After nearly half an hour of persuasion, a doctor finally put his foot down and said the baby was too frail to be turned away. For two hours, she was kept in a warmer and fed. A saline drip was added later. Sonawane is checking every night on the baby, whom she named Pari. Once she recuperates, she will be handed over to a shelter as the investigation continues. “We have already started receiving phone calls from people enquiring about adoption and have had to clarify that it can’t happen at this point when legal procedures are underway,” said inspector Kishore Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-12-day-baby-dumped-in-drain-saved-by-nirbhaya-cops/articleshow/87724988.cms||Nitasha Natu

November 15 was reportedly the first day for application to get the compensation, according to the state government directives. “However, when I reached the spot after driving for 20km with my son, I was informed by the personnel that no form distribution or submission takes place at the collector’s office. Instead, we were directed towards the zonal health department office of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation,” said Jayendra Parmar, a resident of Pirana who had lost his father in May to the pandemic. “Moreover, the current process is only to procure the medical certificate for cause of death (MCCD), we are told. We’ll do the process tomorrow.” Hundreds turned up, hoping to fund the education of kin, support family, or even get a new vehicle from the money, but officials at the collector office said it is a long road to getting Rs 50,000. “The only official notification on the subject is from the state health department on October 29, laying down rules for getting MCCD. The notification clearly mentioned the registrar of birth and death at respective administrative unit – municipal corporation, municipality or gram panchayat – as the issuing authority,” said a senior official. “The notification also mentions forming of Covid Death Ascertaining Committee (CDAC) at various levels. It says nothing about compensation.” “But how would we know all this nitty-gritty? We went by the media reports and even downloaded a form circulated on a social media platform and filled it up to submit with the copy of death certificate issued from the Civil Hospital,” said Usha Mangar, a resident of Vejalpur, who lost her husband to the pandemic in April after a prolonged hospitalization. Senior officials at the Civil Hospital said that there are no applications so far to review the cause of death. The officials added that there’s no Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to review the committee decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-deaths-ex-gratia-kin-made-to-run-around-on-day-1/articleshow/87725013.cms||---

Around 31.3% hid the cord in their homes, the study showed, further highlighting the fact that most moms didn’t apply any dressing to the cord stump. The study, which focused on mothers at the South Goa district hospital, threw light on the considerable importance given to cultural practices related to maternal/newborn care. Of the 80 participants, 22.5% observed a period of postpartum confinement of 40 days at home, with their newborns. Some traditional practices adopted by the new mothers to protect their baby from the evil eye included applying kajal to the baby’s face, as well as the use of bangles, black threads, anklets and chains. The study was conducted by Drs Preksha Vernekar, Jagadish Cacodcar, Minaxi Panandikar and Ira Almeida, and was published in the International Journal of Preventive, Curative and Community Medicine. As far as traditional practices related to the care of newborns goes, a significant number of mothers used new/washed clothes for their babies (83.8%) and 72.5% bathed them five days post-delivery. It was also found that almost half of the study participants — 48.8% — were advised to be confined along with the baby in hospital till day six, post-delivery. The researchers felt that mothers need to be educated about the consequences of applying kajal to a baby’s eyes, as it can not only cause itching or irritation, but can cause infections like blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), conjunctivitis (inflammation/infection of the membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball), or dacryocystitis (infection of the tear sac). Fingernail trauma while applying kajal can cause conjunctival or corneal lacerations, they said. Another practice that is commonly followed was massaging a baby before bath. As many as 98.8% of the respondents said that babies were given massages before bath. Other traditional practices that are still prevalent are exposing a baby to holy smoke (incense/dhoop) after bath, as well as exposing babies to warm sunlight to counteract jaundice. The study noted participants’ positive attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding among a majority of the women; 86.3% initiated breastfeeding within thirty minutes of birth, which was comparable to studies done in India and elsewhere. The researchers felt that health professionals should be aware of traditional practices followed by the community to provide culturally-appropriate and acceptable healthcare. It has recommended that harmless, acceptable or even potentially beneficial practices observed during the postnatal period should be supported and considered a part of the state’s rich culture, while harmful practices should be avoided with health education provided at the time of discharge from hospital and during post-natal visits for health checkup of mother and baby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-study-throws-light-on-goan-moms-belief-in-postpartum-cultural-practices/articleshow/87725789.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Dehradun||Salman Khurshid’s Nainital home shot at, portion set on fire||By Sonali Mishra & Pramod DalakotiNAINITAL/ALMORA: The house of Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid, located in Satkhol area in Ramgarh block of Nainital district, was vandalised on Monday afternoon. Around two dozen people, who onlookers said belonged to right-wing outfit Bajrang Dal, staged a demonstration in front of the house, burnt Khurshid's effigy before setting a portion of the residence on fire. An FIR has been registered against around 20 people, "who are yet to be identified", police said. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book 'Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times'. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?” He further said, “So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides, I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Fellow Congress leader Shashi Tharoor took to Twitter to condemn the incident, saying “this is disgraceful”. “The mounting levels of intolerance in our politics should be denounced by those in power,” he tweeted. At the time of the incident, the caretaker of the house, Sundar Ram, and his family were present. Ram said that around 1 pm, a mob converged in front of the house. “We tried to reason with them but they started pouring diesel on the front door and set it on fire. One of them whipped out a pistol and pointed it at my daughter-in-law. They then opened fire at the window and broke the window panes. They must have fired around six to seven rounds,” Ram said. The caretaker added that he recognised two people in the mob, one of whom has been named in the FIR. Police reached the spot after Ram informed them. DIG Kumaon Nilesh Bharane told TOI, “Apart from one accused, identified as Rakesh Kapil, a resident of Mouna village, 20 others, yet to be identified, have been booked. For now, police cover has been provided at the house.” The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (punishment for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night),552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/khurshids-nainital-home-shot-at-portion-set-on-fire/articleshow/87724167.cms||---

It’s seeking an extension of a stage-wise delivery schedule,” said a senior official from the NMC’s transport department. “A senior representative from the manufacturing unit in Hyderabad has sought time to meet municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on November 18. They will be submitting a plan to deliver the buses in a phase-wise manner,” the official said. Under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle), the Central government had sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NMC to procure 40 e-buses. Recently, the NMC had given an ultimatum to the firm to deliver 40 electric buses by November 15 or it will start levying a 0.1% per day fine against its performance guarantee amount. “After the meeting with the civic chief, we will decide our future course of action, whether to give more time or to start deducting a fine from the performance guarantee amount,” the official added. A local representative of the firm told TOI that the pandemic-induced lockdown had a great impact on the production of e-buses. Pre-lockdown, the firm used to manufacture 12 e-buses per day. The figure has now come down to 4. The lockdown had also affected the availability of spare parts required for manufacturing of e-buses. Besides, availability of manpower was another major factor that affected the production of e-buses, said company sources. With the present status, the company can’t deliver the 40 e-buses at one go. Sources said the company is overburdened with orders to deliver 1,400 e-buses across India. With the present status of manufacturing 4 e-buses per day, the company will require 400 days to fulfil its commitments, said sources. The official said that the firm is seeking time to deliver the 40 e-buses between December and May 2022. He, however, pointed out that the NMC can’t grant additional time and further explained that 170 JNNURM buses will have to be scrapped in February due to the end of their lifespan. To a query, the official said though the three red bus operators will have to replace these buses with new fleets, the NMC cannot take any chances. “We are seeking quicker delivery of the 40 e-buses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hyderabad-firm-fails-to-deliver-40-e-buses-to-nmc/articleshow/87724174.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of the Kinnar akhara, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, who reached Prayagraj on Monday, termed Kangana Ranaut’s statement as “wrong”, adding that she should apologize to the country and take back her statement. The head of the Kinnar akhara said that such a statement regarding the independence of the country is an insult to democracy and the constitution. “So many great freedom fighters of the country have shed their blood, participated in satyagraha and sacrificed everything they had in their life so that the country was freed from the slavery of the British. Thus, the statement of film actress Kangana Ranaut is an insult to the freedom fighters of the country,” Tripathi said. Tripathi said that it is not proper to use abusive or insulting words, whether intended or unintended, regarding the freedom of the country and termed Kangana’s statement as “seditious”. No one has the right to make such statements just to “generate publicity”. “Everyone had fought for the freedom struggle together, whether they belonged to the Congress, Left, Sangh, or right-wing ideology. Everyone has an equal contribution in freeing this land from the British Raj,” said Tripathi. Tripathi also said that everyone has the right to exercise the freedom of speech in a democracy and political rhetoric can also be made, but the independence of the country cannot be associated and seen using the lens of a government or any political party formed before or after 2014. The Kinnar akhara head also said that from 2014 onwards, the BJP government in the country has been in Centre and many states which is a positive thing and added that the same can also be said for most of the governments formed since the independence of the country. Meanwhile, the Kinnar akhara has welcomed bringing back the statue of ‘Maa Annapurna’ from Canada after around 108 years. “The statue would be installed near Baba Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi. Tripathi said that the Kinnar akhara welcomes such efforts and the British Museum is full of artefacts associated with our heritage. Likewise, many other idols are kept in foreign museums and the same should also be brought back,” added Tripathi. On this occasion, the Acharya Mahamandaleshwar also led the procession taken out by the Rashtriya Sanatan Sena. She said that the Kinnar Akhara is with all the organisations which are working for the progress of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/kinnar-akhara-head-flays-kanganacomment-on-countrys-freedom/articleshow/87724171.cms||---

---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi to launch Purvanchal Expressway, open doors for east UP’s development||LUCKNOW: The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway, connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, just months ahead of crucial UP assembly elections. It would be the longest operational expressway of India, overtaking Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which is 301-km long. PM Modi is scheduled to arrive in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft that will land on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Kurebhar stretch of the Access Controlled Greenfield expressway in Sultanpur and will dedicate the project to the people almost three years after laying its foundation on July 14, 2018, in Azamgarh. The Purvanchal Expressway project was launched to spur development in the remote east UP region that has lagged in infrastructure and industrialisation. Experts said the expressway could give BJP an advantage over its political rivals in the eastern UP region that also comprises PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. Starting from village Chand Sarai on Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH-731) in Lucknow, the expressway passes through seven districts — Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh and Mau — before ending at village Haidariya on National Highway No.19 in Ghazipur, just 18 km away from UP-Bihar border. “The expressway has been the dream project of the state government and CM Yogi Adityanath. The project was completed in record time despite severe restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic,” said UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO Awanish Awasthi on the eve of the inauguration. All the preparations for the inauguration by the Prime Minister have been completed, he added. CM Yogi on Monday had an inspection of the site of the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration will also witness the landing of fighter aircraft on the 3.2 km long and 34 mt wide emergency air strip at Sultanpur. Constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 22,496 crore (including the land cost), the expressway has eight packages. UPEIDA officials said the tenders received were around 5.19% less than the estimated cost, resulting in a profit of around Rs 614 crore to the authority. The six-lane expressway (expandable up to eight lanes) has 18 flyovers, seven railway over-bridges (ROBs) and 271 underpasses. According to a UPEIDA document, the work of setting up eight toilet blocks and four petrol pumps is in progress. In the event of an accident, a total of 16 ambulances (two each in every package) will be available for quick assistance and speedy transport of the injured to the nearest hospital. The expressway will provide the much needed connectivity from the east UP region to the state capital and then to Delhi through Lucknow-Agra Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The state government also plans to set up 21 industrial points in the hinterland of the expressway in an area of 9,171 hectares. The state government has identified handloom industry, food processing units, storage plants, mandi and milk-based industries for the purpose. Opportunities will also be available for establishment of Industrial Training Institute, educational and training institutes, medical institutes along the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-launch-purvanchal-e-way-open-doors-for-east-ups-dev/articleshow/87725800.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Ali Zaidi unanimously elected new chief of Shia Waqf Board||Lucknow: Ali Zaidi of Lucknow, who was earlier nominated to the UP Shia Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) by the state government, was unanimously elected as the chairperson of the Board on Monday. Out of eight members, six participated in the election. Former chairperson and current member Waseem Rizvi and another member Syed Faizi boycotted the day’s proceedings which were undertaken after getting the green signal from newly-appointed principal secretary of the minority welfare, Haj and Waqf department, Himanshu Kumar. The members who participated in the election were former Congress MP from Rampur, Noor Bano, advocates Zaryab Jamal Rizvi of Amroha and Syed Shabahat Husain of Sidharthnagar, cleric Maulana Raza Husain of Lucknow and senior consultant at district women’s hospital, Prayagraj, Dr Noorus Hasan Naqvi. After the announcement of election result, state minister for minority welfare, Mohsin Raza, termed Zaidi’s win as the victory of BJP and of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Zaidi is the son-in-law of the cousin of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad and is the youngest person in the Board. Jawwad has been at loggerheads with Rizvi and has been accusing him of indulging in corruption. Jawwad also led several protests during Rizvi’s two terms as the Board’s chairperson. Due to his controversial statements against Islam, the Quran, Prophet Mohammad and madrasas, Rizvi had also drawing the ire of other clerics and organisations. “My priority will be to clean the Board of all corruption, as is the CM’s roadmap. Corrupt persons will not be spared. Shia waqf properties encroached by land mafia and waqf mafia will be taken back and the profit from earnings of these land will be honestly utilised,” said Ali Zaidi. “The Waqf Act is very clear but the Board was not being run according to it. People who benefitted from selfish management of the Board will be stopped. Honest people will be given responsibilities,” he added. Meanwhile, in a press statement, Waseem Rizvi termed the election result would lead “to the hold of Taliban over the Board much as it is in Afghanistan”. “Clerics, in collaboration with the minority department, have usurped the Board. The Waqf Act clearly states that the number of nominated members will not be more than elected ones but this was not the case for the chairperson election. Only three out of the eight board members are elected, while the remaining five members are nominated by the government. Syed Faizi will wait for the high court’s decision on our writ petitions on the subject,” Rizvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ali-zaidi-unanimously-elected-new-chief-of-shia-waqf-board/articleshow/87725804.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Nagpur||Nagpur orange turns sour for Bangladesh traders||NAGPUR: Orange growers in Vidarbha complaining of a poor harvest this year are not alone. Even traders from Bangladesh — the biggest export market for Nagpur oranges — say they have been left bleeding. Over four months ago, the Bangladesh government increased assessment value for oranges by 10 cents per kg. Assessment value is the base price at which customs duty is calculated. Oranges attract over 90% duty. Now, as the value has been hiked, the final duty levied on the fruit goes up too. It is reported to have taken a toll on Indian exports, say trade sources here. But oranges from Bhutan are sold duty-free in Bangladesh. A costlier Nagpur orange has a lower demand these days. Traders in Bangladesh say their purchase price has increased due to the duty hike. However, prices in Bangladesh markets are not enough to recover the cost. This has left each of them in losses. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been pushing for increasing orange exports to Bangladesh from the region. The minister on Saturday said he had a meeting with the Bangladesh home minister in New Delhi, wherein the latter “assured to take oranges in huge quantum from Vidarbha”. He has also taken up the issue of duty hike with the country’s leadership. The yield of Ambiya crop, whose season begins in October-November, is low and the prices need to be pushed for the farmers to cover up the losses, say trade sources. This can happen with a good export demand. Normally, 25% of the crop goes to Bangladesh. The level may not be reached this year. Manoj Jawanjal, a director in Mahaorange, a state government undertaking, also agreed. TOI talked to traders both in India and Bangladesh to assess the situation. Javed Khan, a trader in Warud which is the major centre for oranges, said that domestic prices have just touched Rs25,000 to Rs30,000 a tonne. “The average price was over Rs15,000 in the beginning. The prices are not enough to cover up losses due to lower yield,” said Khan. From Bangladesh, Shahjahan Mohammed Kabir said that traders are incurring a loss of at least Rs500 a crate. “Many stake their savings in the trade. With the duty clubbed, a crate of Nagpur oranges cost Rs2,500 to Rs2700 and the market price is Rs2,300 to Rs2,200,” he said. A number of delegations have been put up before the government but in vain, said Kabir. Farooq Siddiqui, secretary (foreign affairs) of Bangladesh Fresh Fruit Importers Association, said that the costlier dollar is further adding to the duty. Since the assessment value is dollar designated, it further goes up if the greenback becomes costlier as against the local currency. Siddiqui said that there is a major market of Nagpur oranges in Bangladesh. However, there has been a duty impact on oranges imported from all other countries. “The increase in cost is affecting the trade.

During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725848.cms||---
---||Delhi||Corporations will get funds to buy more sweeping machines, says Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Delhi government on measures to fight air pollution in the city. The SC’s remarks came as the Delhi government declared that it would sanction “whatever money” the municipal corporations required to augment the fleet of mechanised road-sweeping vehicles to curb dust pollution, a major contributor to toxicity of ambient air pollution. When the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, praised Delhi government's efforts in intensifying water sprinkling and deploying of mechanised road-sweeping machines, a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said the AAP government's affidavit was blaming the farmers by stating that stubble burning was the principal cause for deterioration of air quality in Delhi even when scientific studies showed that dust, industries, vehicular traffic and coal-fired thermal power plants were major contributors. Taking up the pollution caused by dust particles, the bench asked Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehra whether 69 mechanised road-sweeping machines were adequate to minimise the pollution caused by sweeping of nearly 8,500 km of roads in the city. “What steps have you taken to control air pollution due to dust particles?” it asked. “Municipal corporations are the ones which carry out road-sweeping tasks,” responded Mehra. “These are independent autonomous bodies. It is for the corporations and mayors to file an affidavit stating whether the number of machines is adequate.” The CJI said, “There is always some excuse or the other that can be given when the work is not done. You are passing the buck to the municipal corporations.” “This kind of lame excuse will compel us to find out and hold an audit inquiry into the total revenue you are collecting and what you are spending on the popularity slogans instead of looking after the people,” said Justice Kant. Justice Chandrachud asked Mehra what the government could do to augment the number of machines in the next 24 hours. Mehra said that there was a commitment from the top level, including the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government, to do “whatever is required”. Justice Kant reminded the Delhi government that the municipal corporations were before the SC in some other cases and had pleaded that they do not even have money to pay salaries to their staff. After speaking to the officials concerned, Mehra assured the court that “the Delhi government will release funds immediately as and when the municipal corporations inform it about the additional requirement of road-sweeping machines. We are committed to do whatever is possible to ensure clean air for Delhi.” He said they will come out with a figure tomorrow. “Whatever steps the Centre wants the states to take, almost all have been taken by the Delhi government…We will take whatever steps are required in the next 24-48 hours. We have banned all construction activities,” added Mehra. The bench then observed that, “even the SG has said that you are doing your best, but you may need to take more steps. There are other areas also. If construction is taking place in NCR, the states have to take steps. Delhi does not mean the entire NCR.” Mehra then pointed out that the Delhi government wants to have a lockdown and the SC and Centre must consider that for the entire NCR to effectively stop vehicular pollution. “There should be one cohesive effort to reduce air pollution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-will-get-funds-to-buy-moresweeping-machines-says-delhi-govt/articleshow/87725075.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: In 4 days, test positivity rate in Ahmedabad reaches 0.2%||AHMEDABAD: Despite the directives by the state health department to increase Covid testing on Saturday, the overall testing has remained around 45,000 to 55,000 – the same as the average of the last week, albeit an increase from 15,000 to 25,000 during Diwali festivities. Thus, the test positivity rate (TPR) has remained 0.06% — 6 cases found for every 10,000 tests performed. On Sunday, only Vadodara (5,258), Ahmedabad (7,193) and Surat (9,873) recorded over 5,000 daily tests as the three districts accounted for 49% of the daily tests. It’s despite the claims by the state administration that all entry points including airports, railway stations, bus depots and district along with state borders have medical teams deployed for stringent checks of the incoming population. Analysis of the past four days reveal that Ahmedabad reported 37 new cases from 19,236 tests, giving TPR of 0.2% compared to the state average of 0.06% and against Surat’s 0.05% as the district recorded 16 cases from 30,419 tests. Ahmedabad currently has the highest 70 active Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-4-days-tpr-in-abad-reaches-0-2/articleshow/87725035.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After no to food trucks, BMC to distribute mobile libraries||MUMBAI: In the next few months, residents of Byculla and Mazgaon may well spot mobile libraries for students in their localities. With the BMC stopping distribution of food trucks by corporators as freebies, now the Shiv Sena-led corporation intends to distribute mobile library vans free of cost ahead of the civic elections early next year. The BMC’s E Ward, which covers Byculla, Mazgaon and Mumbai Central, has moved a proposal to buy and distribute mobile library vans worth Rs 2 crore. One mobile library will cost the BMC around Rs 45-50 lakh. Last month, in a setback to a chunk of Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC had stayed the distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators. The BMC’s planning department had issued a circular directing all wards to not distribute any food trucks bought from the BMC’s funds, citing lack of a comprehensive policy for food trucks in the city. With the Shiv Sena miffed at the BMC’s circular to stop distribution of food trucks, civic commissioner Iqbal Chahal had called for a meeting to discuss and formulate a food truck policy. The BMC’s E Ward has now asked the planning department to fix guidelines for distribution of mobile libraries after a demand from Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav, who heads the civic standing committee. Jadhav is a corporator from constituency number 209 of Byculla and Mazgaon. Jadhav said the library vans will be run for poor and needy students by social organisations. “This is an educational initiative and I had taken approvals for it and even got fund provisions made officially. This will benefit thousands of students since we will keep books related to competitive exams such as UPSC and school and college curricula. Students can borrow the books and it will be a library at their doorstep. Poor and needy students will benefit. Education shouldn’t be politicised by the opposition,” Jadhav said. However, the opposition corporators have hit out at the BMC on this latest freebie. “Just like the distribution of food trucks, there is no policy for distributing mobile library vans. We don’t know who will run the libraries and who will be the beneficiaries or what kind of books will be kept in these mobile libraries or where they will be parked. The BMC seems to be giving freebies like donations to the ruling party,” said SP corporator Rais Shaikh. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra too opposed it. “This is nothing but a way to give out freebies without any policy. The BMC says the library vans are for unemployed persons. Who are the unemployed persons who will earn money by running libraries? This is loot of public money,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-no-to-food-trucks-bmc-to-distribute-mobile-libraries/articleshow/87725044.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The group aims to cover 8,500 students of the five schools run by the management and an equal number of underprivileged children will be vaccinated at a private hospital, according to a media release. Around 3,000 parents who participated in a survey done by the Udgam Group of Schools, 99% of the parents expressed their willingness for their children’s vaccination. The group has tied up with Ahmedabad based multispecialty hospital chain to execute vaccination program. Both Covaxin and Zydus vaccines will be available for the parents according to their choice, it said. Commenting on this initiative, Manan Choksi, executive director of Udgam Group of Schools said, “With the mass-vaccination drive by the authorities combined with an awareness of the pandemic, most of the citizens have been taken their shots. Children need to get protected from Covid-19 with their vaccine doses.” The school management had conducted a survey among the parents to know their willingness about vaccinating their kids. Around 3,000 parents had participated in the survey and 99% of the parents expressed their readiness to get the vaccine shots for their children. Under this vaccination campaign, the school management is aiming to cover underprivileged children as they have lost a lot of schooling. “Bigger challenge is ensuring vaccination among the underprivileged children,” added Choksi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/udgam-group-to-mass-vaccinate-students-underprivileged/articleshow/87725034.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Tubewells polluted up to 130m in Sangrur village||CHANDIGARH: An experts’ committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has found that most of the tubewells and aquifers up to depth of 130 metre below ground level in village Alorakh of Bhiwanigarh block in Sangrur district are contaminated. The committee had done sampling from tubewells varying between shallow (46 meter below ground level) to very deep (183 meter below ground level). The committee said that it has been observed that the tubewells affected by contamination are having depth of about 130 meter below ground level in the vicinity of a closed industry. “Considering the water levels of about 40 meter below ground level, about 80 meter to 90 meter thick aquifer zone has been contaminated,” reads the report. The NGT was also informed that water from five locations out of total 22 locations in the village was found reddish in colour, indicating contamination. All these five borewells were also found to be having high total organic carbon, further indicating contamination with organic compounds. Two borewells were found to be having significant concentration of chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand whereas three borewells were found having high nitrate concentration. The experts’ committee also submitted to the NGT that the sampling of the soil, agriculture crops and produce to determine the accumulation of contaminants in soil, crops and produce by the joint committee was conducted on October 27 after determining the affected area based on the Central Ground Water Authority report. The samples have been sent to the Punjab Biotechnology Incubator (PBTI) laboratory in Mohali and the results of the analysis are expected by November 25. The committee has sought a time of 15 days from the NGT to submit the final analysis report. It was also submitted that based on the outcome of the analysis of heavy metals in the groundwater, outcome of accumulation and biomagnification studies, the remediation plan and cost estimation will be prepared by the joint committee for taking further remedial measures by the Punjab chief secretary. The joint experts committee, included Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir, experts from the central pollution control board, Punjab pollution control board and Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change. The NGT had constituted the expert’s committee in a petition filed by advocate Hari Chand Arora on the basis of a news report highlighting that tubewells in Sangrur village have polluted water and the people are suffering with this problem for the past 10 years. The Punjab pollution control board had been blaming a factory for this which was shut down around 15 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tubewells-polluted-up-to-130m-in-sangrur-village/articleshow/87725058.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Chandigarh||Finally, GMCH-32 starts radio frequency identification attendance||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The UT health department has started radio frequency identification attendance at GMCH-32 for all its employees. This is the first such tertiary hospital in the city to have such a system of attendance. The system was introduced in 1998 and 2010 but discontinued. Sources said that the Medical Council of India had made it mandatory for the college teaching faculty to have RFID attendance. All government medical colleges were given machines for this but even after installation, they were fixed the wall without being used. When UT health secretary Yashpal Garg conducted a surprise night inspection last month, he found that there was no emergency medical officer available in the hospital. Also, the security guard supervisor was not checking visitors in emergency and was busy surfing the internet on his phone instead. “The system was installed and has been operational since the last one week in all administrative offices and even OPDs but it will not provide any incentive for those going for extra hours beyond their schedule,” said a GMCH-32 employee. He added, “We are also asked to sign on the register besides using the RFID system.” GMSH-16 is already using the attendance system while PGI has it only in the administrative block. “There was a plan to start the same in OPDs. The machines were even bought and are lying unused,” said a PGI official. The purpose of the automated attendance system is to enable punctuality at the work place. However, some of the employees at GMCH-32 have doubts about its feasibility. “This is the third time that the system has been adopted. Still, most workers here have not been able to make it a habit to remain punctual,” said a faculty at GMCH-32.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/finally-gmch-32-starts-radio-frequency-identification-attendance/articleshow/87724196.cms||Shimona Kanwar

A bench led by Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla heard a petition by Ghaziabad resident Prince Singh, who was thrown out of the admission process due to a technical glitch. His petition said he scored an all-India rank of 25,894 and scheduled caste rank of 864 in the JEE (Advanced) 2021 exam. He was allotted a seat at IIT-B for civil engineering (4 years, Bachelor of Technology). The last date for paying fees was October 31. Centre’s advocate Rui Rodrigues said the seat allocation process was completely computerised and non-payment implied rejection of the seat offered. In the November 12 order, the bench said, “The petitioner did not register his grievance with regard to his failure to make payment by online mode before 12 noon but registered it after October 31 after 12 noon ie after the entire activity/process was finally closed/shut.” They said by not availing grievance redressal in time, Prince has entailed the consequence of rejection from the process. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-declines-any-relief-to-student-who-lost-iit-seat/articleshow/87725068.cms||---

NDA offers undergraduate training along with a centre of excellence in military training. It is among the top tri-service academies which train cadets of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Upon successful completion of three years of training, graduating cadets are awarded with BA, BSc and B Tech degrees from Jawaharlal Nehru University. The graduating students proceed to respective training centres for further training before joining the armed forces. Numerous candidates, however, withdraw or fail to fulfil the requirements of the academy and are boarded out for not being able to fully satisfy the required criteria for completion in the areas of academics, outdoor training, standards and protocols due to injuries/medical complications post or prior to the course of the training. Such boarded out candidates face numerous challenges in continuing their academics as a result of multiple reasons thus requiring academic rehabilitation which PU will be offering through this MoU. “PU is one of the very few universities in the country to hold such an agreement with the NDA. It is a matter of great honour and pride for us,” said PU president Dr Devanshu Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pu-signs-mou-with-nda-for-dropout-cadets/articleshow/87725082.cms||---

This is perhaps the first time in the country a QR code made out of bamboo has been developed. A QR code is a scannable barcode encoded with data. TOI had in July reported how rakhis and friendship bands made completely out of bamboo by Walke were in demand abroad. After turning into an entrepreneur by preparing at least 50 types of creative bamboo artifacts, she has designed a bamboo QR code. Earlier, such codes have been developed in China. “For people, it may look a simple thing, but for artists like me, it can be a good alternative to QR codes made out of non-eco-friendly plastic. It also reflects traditional skills and values art,” said Walke. Sharing her experience on making the QR code, Walke said, “Our small-time business of selling bamboo articles took a big hit during Covid-19 and family was reeling under financial crisis when a businessman asked us whether a QR code can be made out of bamboo.” “I accepted the challenge. But two months ago, when I started to work on it, I was sceptical whether the technique would work on bamboo or not. I prepared the first model in two days. The model is 15cm high and 8cm wide with a thickness of 5mm. The QR code is easy to handle and durable,” she said. The bamboo QR code by Walke has caught global attention. Susanne Lucas of the World Bamboo Organization said, “It is an excellent innovation. We should move away from plastics as recycling plastic is very energy-dependent and wastes precious water. I will see how she can be supported.” Walke even won accolades from globally known bamboo artist Ivan Platas. “I liked the idea and its results. We are procuring a laser machine soon and will try to make such QR codes,” he told Walke. Walke provides direct and indirect employment to many women in the slum, known as Bengali Camp, in Chandrapur for making bamboo articles. She was conferred the National Nari Shakti Award-2018 for her start-up venture. In 2019, she was also felicitated by Burad community women, who are traditional bamboo craftsmen, for her contribution. In 2021, on World Women’s Day, the Indo-Canadian Art & Culture Society presented her the ‘Woman Hero Award’ virtually. Looking at her bamboo art, Walke was also approached in 2019 by a global beauty pageant contest organizer, requesting her to make beauty crowns for winners. These bamboo crowns were applauded by one and all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-homemaker-develops-first-bamboo-qr-code-in-country/articleshow/87724228.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

NU top brass led by vice chancellor (VC) Subhash Chaudhari defended their decision to award first semester exam work to the Pune-based firm without floating tenders, the members told TOI. During the adjourned meeting on Friday, members were shocked when the VC went to the extent of personally guaranteeing MKCL’s performance. Quoting various newspaper reports, the members led by Manmohan Bajpayee then questioned Chaudhari why the university was going out of the way to rope in a company that was blacklisted by his predecessor SP Kane. They expressed surprise that NU was favouring the company that had miserably failed to provide services as per its agreement in the past, leading to embarrassment for NU. Due to MKCL’s failure in pre and post exam works, results were inordinately delayed, and students suffered a lot. They also pointed out that many universities had already blacklisted the company for poor performance. The members further asked the VC to justify why exam work was awarded to MKCL without floating tender as per rules. Members became aggressive and put the administration in an uncomfortable position, where it could not answer their barrage of queries. Finally, the VC declared a two-member panel of Bajpayee and Vishnu Changde to look into MKCL’s earlier dealings and its performance in various universities. Statutory members told TOI that moves to bring back MKCL started after Chaudhari took over as VC and decided to go out of the way to rope in its services for winter 2021 examination of first semester, despite its poor track record. He was also instrumental in releasing its earlier dues of Rs1.37 crore, which were withheld by Kane as the company failed to provide services as per the agreement. “The VC doesn’t listen to anyone. He works as per his whims and fancies. When Promarc has finally settled down now, and saved the university during Covid-19 pandemic by conducting online exams, he is bent on bringing back the blacklisted company. It’s return would once again push NU to the dark times of delayed results,” they warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/members-force-nu-to-form-panel-to-probe-mkcls-earlier-performance/articleshow/87724233.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Police are trying to establish weather the two shooters were carrying mobile phones so that their locations and routes can be traced. Sources in Police said that the two sharp-shooters followed Vicky Middukhera closely for seven days to study his daily routine. They found that he visited the office of the property dealer every other day and that he was generally alone at the time. On August 7, they struck when Middukhera was coming out of the property dealer’s office alone. Mohali police have learned that the sharp-shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil alias Latth alias ‘Khabbu Shooter’ (left-handed shooter) reached Mohali on July 31, seven days prior to the murder of Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera. A senior police officer with the Mohali police said, “We suspect that the killers were made to stay at Purab Premium Apartments by their handlers. The housing society has already attained the tag of being the hub of gangsters. Otherwise also we have started keeping a watch on the housing society.” Sources added that the police is interrogating the two arrested gangsters, Amit Dagar and Kaushal Chaudhary, pressurising them to force Latth to surrender. Despite efforts, Mohali police have failed to arrest the main shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil alias Latth alias ‘Khabbu Shooter.’ Apart from Rohit ‘Kartoost’ and Vijiya Malhe, four to five more sharp-shooters are yet to be identified. A senior officer in the Mohali police said, “We are very close to the arrest of the gangsters who killed Vicky Middukhera. Main shooters have been identified and the two mediators are also in the police net.” During the face-to-face interrogation of the two gangsters, police learned that Armenia-based Gaurav Padial alias Lucky Padial, handler of the Bambiha gang, gave the contract for Middukhera’s murder. Recently, Mohali police established that the Hyundai i-20 car used in the Middukhera murder was hired by the sharp-shooters from Gurugram. Kaushal-Dagar told the police that the car owner was Tek Chand. Police raided his premises Gurugram but learned that he had escaped after the murder of Middukhera. While tracing the movement of the Hyundai i-20 car, Mohali police reached Gurugram via Ambala, Nahan, Dehradun to Delhi. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are on right trail of the accused and soon they will be arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukheras-killers-may-have-stayed-at-purab-premium-apartments-cops/articleshow/87724223.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

His 10-volume Shivcharitra Raja ShivChhatrapati, thousands of lectures, and the epic play ‘Jaanta Raja’ not only took the illustrious life and battles of the Maratha king to every household in Maharashtra and beyond, but also embedded the mighty warrior’s memory further in the conscience of the people. Purandare, an eminent history scholar, died on Monday in a Pune hospital of age-related pneumonia. He was 99. His last rites were performed with state honours. For seven decades, Purandare was a ‘Shivshahir’ or bard of Shivaji Maharaj. He trekked to hundreds of forts the Maratha king had conquered, visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji and meticulously preserved every little piece with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent storyteller and narrator, an author, playwright and novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to common citizens in easy-to-understand but vivid language and did not lose sight of the fact that historical research was a science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bard-of-chhatrapati-shivaji-bows-out/articleshow/87726766.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Crop residue management gathers steam in Kaithal, tea vendor turns entrepreneur||CHANDIGARH: From tea vendor to a CRM (crop residue management) leader, Ram Kumar, a 40-year-old landless farmer from Kaithal’s Rewar Jagir village near Guhla Cheeka, has made an incredible transformation to earn 12 balers, 300 employees, and a season’s income of Rs 45 to 50 lakh. Asked how it started, Ram Kumar said: "I come from a joint family that tilled panchayat land or worked for the big landlords. In 2000, I had a village tea stall. Slowly, I learnt to drive a tractor and, in 2010, bought a second-hand model for packing crop residue into bales and selling it to Jaalkheri village for fuel. When I first saw a baler, I tried to understand its functioning." His first second-hand baler cost him Rs 6 lakh but running it made him some money. Gradually, he was able to buy more balers and other equipment used for the management of crop residue, to turn it into fodder, fuel cakes, and crushed raw material for paper and cardboard industry. Kaithal’s deputy director agriculture Karam Chand, who observed Ram Kumar’s success, said: "He is a pioneer of crop residue management in this district." Chand explained how Ram had started without bailers, rotters, croppers, and all other heavy equipment but built a fleet of those. The officer said: "Ram’s success will inspire the other farmers. We have a team of 14 small farmers who turned CRM entrepreneurs." Noni of Kaithal district, who adopted CRM after watching Ram, described how he was able to make good money out of Happy seeder and other equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crop-residue-management-gathers-steam-in-kaithal-tea-vendor-turns-entrepreneur/articleshow/87725073.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chandigarh||Elderly suffered knee, spine issues during lockdown: Study||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: In the first study conducted in India to assess the musculoskeletal health of the elderly during lockdown, PGI doctors found that as physical activities declined in this set of the population, either the existing medical condition deteriorated or a new one developed. In both new and existing conditions, knee joints and spine problems were noted. Also, there are no home-based solutions/kits developed for the geriatric population, which could have helped them during lockdown, when OPD services were shut and there was no access to medical services. The study has been published in an international journal and is part of the GoI’s project on bone health of the elderly. Under the study, 105 participants above the age of 60 were sureveyed telephonically. In response, 63.8% said that they were involved in some kind of exercise or fitness-related activity before lockdown. However, this number decreased to 44.8% during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, walking/jogging was the most common form of exercise performed by 53.3% of the survey respondents and during lockdown, this figure decreased to 48.9%. Yoga/meditation was performed by 13.4% of the survey respondents before the lockdown, which increased to 25.5% during the lockdown. The number of participants indulging in other forms of exercise such as cycling and low-impact aerobic exercises, stretching, and strengthening also increased from 37.3% before the lockdown to 46.8% during the lockdown. “Those elders whose medical services were affected during lockdown had significantly worse scores. This highlights the importance of continued access to medical services for the elderly during periods of confinement. We are trying to work on such home-based tools for them,” said Dr Siddhartha Sharma, corresponding author, department of orthopedics, PGI. The study, “Impact of the Covid-19 lockdown and confinement measures on the musculoskeletal health of the urban geriatric population,” has been published in the journal, “Cureus” from the departments of orthopaedics, community medicine and school for public health and department of biostatistics. Box: Lower limbs suffer Majority of the respondents (48.7%) had lower limb problems before the lockdown, of which knee joint problems were the most prevalent (37.3%). Aggravation of pre-existing problems was most frequently noted in the lower limb (62.2%), followed by the spine (28.8%) and the upper limb (8.8%). New-onset problems during the lockdown were noted most frequently in the lower limb (54.3%), followed by the upper limb (26.3%) and the spine (19.2%)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/elderly-suffered-knee-spine-issues-during-lockdown-study/articleshow/87724236.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Petition over kids amicably settled on Children’s Day||MUMBAI: After a Jaipur man kept his promise and appeared before the Bombay high court this past Saturday with his two minor grandchildren, as well as their father and grandmother, a petition filed by the kids’ mother was amicably settled on Children’s Day, November 14. The mother had filed a habeas corpus (order to produce a person from illegal detention) petition to produce her children from Jaipur. The HC on Saturday sent the children home with their mother who has lived in Mumbai since September, following her remarriage, and asked them to work out an amicable settlement. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar worked through the weekend. The mother’s counsel Rizwan Merchant with Vinta Dandekar and counsel Rafiq Gori, Karan Mertia with Afin Pathan for the father and his parents got back on Sunday with consent terms. The court accepted the terms. Both sides agreed to an arrangement where the children would stay with the mother in Mumbai and the father, as well as their paternal grandparents can meet, have telephonic contact and visitation rights in their mother’s presence. The mother had also alleged that she had been taken to Rajasthan on October 1 by police along with the children and their passports and other documents, on the pretext of a probe into an FIR registered by her ex-in-laws at Amer police station, Jaipur, against her for jewelry theft. The mother claimed the FIR was false. The settlement terms bring closure to the theft case too by consent. The father also returned the children’s Green cards, permanent resident cards of Hong Kong, passports and re-entry permit to the US. The HC noted though the petition is disposed of, “there are serious allegations made against police officers at Gamdevi police station, Mumbai, as well as Amer police station, Jaipur city (north).” The HC called DCP (Zone 2) of Mumbai who informed he would inquire into the allegations and “take stern actions against the officers , if found guilty.” The DCP said he would inform the HC of steps he takes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petition-over-kids-amicably-settled-on-childrens-day/articleshow/87725087.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Asaduddin Owaisi set to launch AIMIM in Rajasthan, contest 2023 elections||JAIPUR: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday announced that he would launch the Rajasthan unit of the party within two months. During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725857.cms||---

---||Delhi||Mannu Bhandari, writer of film Rajnigandha, no more||Hindi litterateur Mannu Bhandari, who penned wildly popular short stories and novels without sacrificing literary merit and who constructed a new and aware modern woman in her works, passed away in a Gurgaon hospital on Monday. She was 90. “She had suffered a series of strokes over the last few years. She was frail but never bedridden. This time she was hospitalized for an infection which turned fatal” her daughter Rachana Yadav, a kathak dancer, told TOI. Notable Hindi film director Basu Chatterjee, with whom she shared a fond and durable association, transformed Bhandari’s long short story, Yehi Sach Hai, into a feature, Rajnigandha (1974). The film was both a critical and a commercial success. Basu da’s Jeena Yahan (1979) was also based on her work, Ekhane Aakash Neyee. Bhandari also wrote the dialogues for Swami (1977), another box-office winner. Her novel, Aap Ka Bunty was made as Samay Ki Dhara (1986), which veered away from the original story and ran into legal trouble. Mahabhoj, a hard-hitting political novel, was numerously staged as a play. Born in Bhanpur, Madhya Pradesh, Bhandari earned her masters at Banaras Hindu University. She also taught at Delhi University and was married to eminent writer-editor Rajendra Yadav who passed away in 2013. Both were pillars of the Nayee Kahani (New Story) movement. Noted writer Mridula Garg said that along with Krishna Sobti and Usha Priyamvada, Bhandari was regarded as the three best and most-talked about Hindi women writers of the 1960s and 70s. “She wrote with spontaneity and great empathy for her characters. Her style was easy going and direct. People identified with her characters,” Garg said One such character was Bunty, the tormented son of a divorced couple, from the novel, Aap Ka Bunty. Writer Pushya Mitra wrote on Facebook how his mother read the novel during her days of pregnancy and gave him his pet name, Bunty. Others shared similar experiences on social media. As Garg added, “She provided the finest example of literary writing which could be popular with common people.” Satyanand Nirupam, editorial director, Rajkamal Prakashan, recalled how he was deeply disturbed by Bhandari’s short story, Sazaa, the story of a man fighting for justice. “Another story, Do Kalakaar, has taken on a fresh meaning in these intolerant times. And after reading the story, Yehi Sach Hai, I started looking at rajnigandha (tuberose) flowers in a different light,” he said. Bhandari’s women are real, plucked from life. They are characters with agency like Deepa, played by Vidya Sinha in Rajnigandha. The story walks the reader through the corridor of her mind as she struggles to choose between two men. But the final decision is her own. There was a tough side to Bhandari as well. Garg narrates an anecdote. “At a seminar once, a member of the audience asked me a vulgar question about my novel, Chitkobra. Mannu-ji, who was on the stage, turned to the man and said, “Please apologise to her. If you haven’t understood the book, please keep quiet, don’t ask such questions…Writers often don’t stand for each other in such situations. But she did.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mannu-bhandari-writer-of-film-rajnigandha-no-more/articleshow/87725106.cms||Avijit Ghosh

Taking a dig at the opposition, Nitish said majority of the population support liquor ban but few people are defaming the state. “They issue statements against me because they know it will get them publicity,” he said. The CM also said his government would launch a special campaign to make people ‘conscious’ about the deadly effect of consuming illicit liquor. Asked about the rise in the incidents of crime recently, Nitish said the figures did not suggest so. “We take action immediately if any incident of crime occurs. At some places, incidents like the Maoist violence have been reported. It is being investigated. It is a different matter but the incidents of general crime and road accidents have come down, especially after the enforcement of liquor ban. Earlier people used to drive vehicles after drinking,” Nitish said after his weekly ‘janata darbar’ programme. Talking about the proposed high-level review meeting on Tuesday, Nitish said all issues related to prohibition and the shortcomings in its enforcement would be discussed. He said all cabinet ministers, who are in-charge of districts, and all senior officers would be present at the meeting. All district magistrates and the SPs would also be connected to the meeting through videoconferencing. “We will discuss everything related to liquor ban and analyse where we are lacking in its implementation. We will take further decisions accordingly,” he said. “Liquor is a bad thing … We will launch a renewed special propaganda to tell people how the consumption of liquor is dangerous for them,” he said. Earlier, the CM heard the grievances of altogether 121 people at his janata darbar and issued necessary instructions to the officials of the departments concerned for earlier resolution of their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/crime-road-accidents-down-after-liquor-prohibition-cm/articleshow/87724255.cms||Madan Kumar

While the transport department has received close to 20,000 applications, it wants more women drivers to come forward to fill the 33 per cent reserved slots. The online scheme was launched in October for the registration of 4,261 e-autos, out of which 1,406 are reserved for women. The initial last date was November 1, which was extended to November 15. Out of the 19,885 applicants, 19,187 are men and 698 women. “We thought of filling the slots with general category applications, but noticed in the past one month that more and more women were applying and coming forward with enquiries,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. “Unless we stick to our mandate, we will always end up making excuses to not let women be active participants.” More than 1,400 women driving autos will mean lakhs of women feeling safer, he said. “We are also in talks with NGOs to train more women.” Women with a valid driving licence for light motor vehicles or three-seater autos can apply if they have an Aadhaar card with Delhi address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-time-to-women-drivers-for-e-auto-registration/articleshow/87725120.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds lower court’s order in Vashi hotel owner’s son case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday upheld a magistrate’s court order directing Rohan Abbott, 32, to surrender in 10 days before it, as police invoked a graver offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder after his release on bail in a case where two sons of a police officer were killed in crash in Vashi on February 7. The accused, allegedly driving at high speed, crashed into a motorbike near a hotel at Palm Beach road, dragging the motorist and flinging the pillion rider. He fled the spot, surrendering himself later next day when he was granted bail. Justice Sandeep Shinde said the magistrate’s order of March 26 requires no interference. The HC continued a stay on it for three more weeks since April 5, to enable Abbot to appeal before the Supreme Court. The accused through his lawyers Aniesh Jadhav and Veerdhawal Deshmukh said the FIR was for bailable offence of death due to rash driving under section 304 (A) of the IPC and other offences and also under Motor Vehicles Act. He was released on bail on February 8, on a bail bond of Rs 15,000. The magistrate had also declined a police plea for cancellation of bail after it had on February 13, invoked the non-bailable offence of culpable homicide, which stipulates up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The magistrate’s court had also declined a police custody plea but directed Abbot to surrender before it and apply for bail for the newly added offences. Failure to surrender would entitle investigating officer to seek his arrest, the magistrate had ordered. Aggrieved, he approached the HC, saying the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain the police plea once he was out on bail. Prosecutor Sharmila Deshmukh and counsel Abha Singh for the brother of victims Akshay Gamare (29) and Sanket (24), opposed his plea. Singh cited an SC ruling to argue that the magistrate was empowered to order his surrender and apply for bail after a new non-bailable offence is added to a case, without cancelling the earlier bail. The HC agreed with the submission and said “petition is dismissed and disposed of”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-upholds-lower-courts-order-in-vashi-hotel-owners-son-case/articleshow/87725125.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Ranchi||Modi dedicates Birsa Munda museum to the nation, terms it an emotional moment||Ranchi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday remotely inaugurated country’s first (tribal) freedom fighter’s museum on Birsa Munda Memorial Park complex in Ranchi and hailed it as an emotional moment for himself. “I have spent a major chunk of my life living with tribal communities, tribal children and understanding their needs. It is an emotional moment for me personally,” Modi said in his virtual address after inaugurating the museum. Politics was not far away as Modi also said the museum was a befitting tribute to late former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who set up the Union ministry of tribal affairs. “It was due to his determination that Jharkhand came into existence.” While BJP functionaries chanted “Modi, Modi” from the audience, their Jharkhand Mukti Morcha counterparts matched the decibels by chanting “Shibu Soren Zindabad” and “Hemant Soren Zindabad”. The museum has been built in a restored 200-year-old Ranchi Central Jail where Birsa died in British captivity in 1900. A sum of Rs 25 crore was given by the Centre for construction of the museum while the state government made the rest of expenses for restoration of the old jail, construction of boundary wall, landscaping and park. Besides Birsa, the museum showcases the life and works of other prominent tribal freedom fighters from the state. “In every phase of India’s freedom struggle, tribal revolutionaries have risen up in rebellion against the British for their rights. The Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas, which will be celebrated every year from now on, is a tribute to those brave men and women,” Modi said. The PM also compared Birsa with Mahatma Gandhi. Hailing the museum as a place of pilgrimage, Modi spoke richly about other tribal revolutionaries from Jharkhand such as Sidho-Kanho, Poto Ho, Jatra Tana Bhagat, Telanga Khariya and their contribution to the freedom struggle. “While Ranchi is the first museum, nine upcoming museums in Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Mizoram and Goa will preserve the tale of the heroics of the country’s tribal revolutionaries for future generations,” he added. Modi spoke Mundari in between his speech and hailed Munda as “Bhagwan”, terming him as a source of inspiration behind India’s efforts towards environment conservation and the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. While Modi inaugurated the program virtually, chief minister Hemant Soren, governor Ramesh Bais, Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda, Union tourism and culture minister G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state Annapurna Devi, state tribal affairs minister Champai Soren, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Ranchi MLA CP Singh and Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra attended the function at the Memorial Park complex. Soren termed the day as historic. “We are standing in a hallowed ground as this is the place where Dharti Aba (Birsa) breathed his last. This project came together with the collaboration of the Centre and the state government,” he said. Emphasizing that Jharkhand’s history deserves special mention, he said: “Long before the country started dreaming of Independence, the tribal people here crossed blades with the British to win their rights and preserve their Jal, Jangal and Zameen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/modi-dedicates-birsa-munda-museum-to-the-nation-terms-it-an-emotional-moment/articleshow/87724305.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||India||Centre extends UAPA ban on Zakir Naik's NGO Islamic Research Foundation by 5 years||NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Monday extended the ban on Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), an NGO founded by fugitive Islamic evangelist Zakir Naik, for a further five years, saying that if the activities of the "unlawful association" were not curbed, it would continue its subversive activities and reorganise its absconding activists to create communal disharmony, propagate anti-national sentiments and support militancy. IRF was termed as an "unlawful association" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on November 17, 2016 for a period of five years. The ban was due to expire on Tuesday. An MHA notification extending the ban said that the Central government is of the opinion that the IRF and its members, particularly, its founder and president, Zakir Abdul Karim Naik alias Zakir Naik, has been encouraging and aiding its followers to promote or attempt to promote, on grounds of religion, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious communities and groups which are prejudicial to the integrity and security of the country. It referred to his statements and speeches saying that they were objectionable and subversive, and added that Naik, through such speeches and statements, was inspiring youths of a particular religion in India and abroad, to commit terrorist acts. It further noted that Naik had made radical statements and speeches to millions of people worldwide through international satellite TV, internet, print and social media. The notification stated that if the unlawful activities of IRF were not curbed and controlled immediately, it will take the opportunity to continue its subversive activities and re-organise its activists who are still absconding; disrupt the secular fabric of the country by polluting the minds of the people by creating communal disharmony; propagate anti-national sentiments; escalate secessionism by supporting militancy; and undertake activities which are prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and security of the country. "Islamic Research Foundation has been indulging in activities, which are prejudicial to the security of the country and have the potential of disturbing peace and communal harmony and disrupting the secular fabric of the country," the MHA said while exercising its powers under Section 3 of UAPA to declare IRF as an unlawful association for a further period of five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-extends-uapa-ban-on-zakir-naiks-ngo-islamic-research-foundation-by-5-years/articleshow/87724254.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Border areas deserve peace and development: Mehbooba Mufti||R S PURA: Emphasizing that friendly relations between India and Pakistan were paramount for sustainable peace and development of the whole subcontinent, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said that people living in border areas were the worst affected and deserved peace the most. She also lambasted the 'callous attitude' of the J&K administration towards farmers who suffered massive losses due to recent adverse weather conditions. The former chief minister said rice cultivators in the border belts of Jammu and those growing apples and dry fruits in Kashmir contribute a major portion towards the economy of J&K, and in both the regions the losses suffered by them due to rain and snowfall ran into crores of rupees. “I am told that the government has assured peanuts as compensation to the farmers of R S Pura, Bishnah, Samba and other plains of Jammu where farmers have suffered extensive damage to their standing crops,” Mufti said. She said that the sudden change in weather has damaged the crops of farmers and brought them to the verge of starvation. “But the government, I am told, has fixed Rs 600 compensation per kanal, which is disgraceful and disdainful for this hard working class of society,” she said. She also lambasted the BJP-led central government, stating that it had adopted a hostile attitude towards farmers across the country and J&K was no exception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/border-areas-deserve-peace-and-development-mehbooba-mufti/articleshow/87724438.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: PM Narendra Modi to launch Purvanchal Expressway on November 16||LUCKNOW: The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway, connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, just months ahead of crucial UP assembly elections. It would be the longest operational expressway of India, overtaking Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which is 301-km long. PM Modi is scheduled to arrive in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft that will land on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Kurebhar stretch of the Access Controlled Greenfield expressway in Sultanpur and will dedicate the project to the people almost three years after laying its foundation on July 14, 2018, in Azamgarh. The Purvanchal Expressway project was launched to spur development in the remote east UP region that has lagged in infrastructure and industrialisation. Experts said the expressway could give BJP an advantage over its political rivals in the eastern UP region that also comprises PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. Starting from village Chand Sarai on Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH-731) in Lucknow, the expressway passes through seven districts — Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh and Mau — before ending at village Haidariya on National Highway No.19 in Ghazipur, just 18 km away from UP-Bihar border. “The expressway has been the dream project of the state government and CM Yogi Adityanath. The project was completed in record time despite severe restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic,” said UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO Awanish Awasthi on the eve of the inauguration. All the preparations for the inauguration by the Prime Minister have been completed, he added. CM Yogi on Monday had an inspection of the site of the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration will also witness the landing of fighter aircraft on the 3.2 km long and 34 mt wide emergency air strip at Sultanpur. Constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 22,496 crore (including the land cost), the expressway has eight packages. UPEIDA officials said the tenders received were around 5.19% less than the estimated cost, resulting in a profit of around Rs 614 crore to the authority. The six-lane expressway (expandable up to eight lanes) has 18 flyovers, seven railway over-bridges (ROBs) and 271 underpasses. According to a UPEIDA document, the work of setting up eight toilet blocks and four petrol pumps is in progress. In the event of an accident, a total of 16 ambulances (two each in every package) will be available for quick assistance and speedy transport of the injured to the nearest hospital. The expressway will provide the much needed connectivity from the east UP region to the state capital and then to Delhi through Lucknow-Agra Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The state government also plans to set up 21 industrial points in the hinterland of the expressway in an area of 9,171 hectares. The state government has identified handloom industry, food processing units, storage plants, mandi and milk-based industries for the purpose. Opportunities will also be available for establishment of Industrial Training Institute, educational and training institutes, medical institutes near the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-pm-narendra-modi-to-launch-purvanchal-expressway-on-november-16/articleshow/87724207.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||World||Battle underway for release of Mountbatten diaries which UK says could compromise relations between UK, India and Pak||LONDON: A tribunal is underway in London which will determine whether all of the private diaries and letters of the Mountbattens should be released to the public despite concerns by the UK cabinet office that they will be "prejudicial to international relations between the UK, India and Pakistan" as well as a breach of the Queen’s personal data. British author Andrew Lownie has spent £250,000 (Rs 2.5 crore) of his own money on his court battle with the university of Southampton and the cabinet office to get all the diaries and letters released in the "name of academic freedom". "The material relating to India and Pakistan is very important as there is a huge debate as to how impartial Mountbatten was on independence and the degree of relationship Nehru had with both the Mountbattens, and so what they said is of great importance to historians and the material around the abdication and royal family could provide new insights too," Lownie said during cross-examination on Monday. The university of Southampton bought the Broadland Archives — which include the papers of the Mountbattens — from a Mountbatten family trust in 2011 for £4.5 million. But immediately the university closed off some of the archive, citing directions from the cabinet office. Following a complaint from Lownie, the Information Commissioner’s Office ordered the university to disclose all the Mountbatten diaries and correspondence in December 2019, but the university and the cabinet office appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) against this decision. That hearing is currently taking place. On Monday Clara Hamer, representing Lownie, said: "A total of £4.5 million of almost exclusively public money was spent to obtain for the nation the very documents that are now covered in redaction. Although we take an educated guess of what has been redacted, what we find is information that has been redacted as prejudicial to international relations between the UK, India and Pakistan, is there in the Mountbattens' daughter’s own book." She said in her book Pamela Mountbatten refers to the Jinnahs coming to dinner and says that "Jinnah’s attitude to the Sikh situation was unsound" and that "her mother vents in her diary he is already a megalomaniac so God help Pakistan." She also refers to another book, Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire, which she says shows that "Mountbatten and Jinnah were never friends". "In that the former calls latter various unpleasant names … so less than complimentary remarks about Jinnah are already in public domain," Hamer said. "It is a waste of time for the cabinet office to redact information that was in books about the Mountbattens for 35 years. Some of the information is utterly innocuous, such as a conversation between Moutbatten and the Queen at his 70th birthday party when he asks her what time he should go to bed and the Queen says ‘It’s your birthday — you have to stay up longer.’" Rory Dunlop QC, representing the university of Southampton, pointed out that 99.8% of the Broadlands archives had been released to the public and accused Lownie of "running an aggressive campaign in the media attacking the university and its staff".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/battle-underway-for-release-of-mountbatten-diaries-which-uk-says-could-compromise-relations-between-uk-india-and-pak/articleshow/87724469.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Explosion outside Liverpool hospital was suicide bomb attack, police say||LONDON: A taxi explosion outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital on Remembrance Sunday was a terrorist attack in which a male suicide bomber self-detonated, the UK police confirmed Monday. The UK terror threat level was on Monday raised to severe, meaning a terror attack is highly likely. Video footage shows the taxi exploding after pulling up in front of the hospital reception and the driver, named as David Perry (45), running out of the car whilst black plumes of smoke billowed out seconds before it went up in flames. Emergency services rushed to the scene and put out the fire. On Monday night the dead man was named by police as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. UK media reported he was born to parents of Syrian and Iraqi heritage, spent a large amount of his life in Iraq and entered Britain as an asylum-seeker. Perry was initially hospitalised for injuries and burns but has since been released. A local fundraiser has so far raised £20,000 (Rs 20 lakh) for him and Liverpool mayor Joanne Anderson praised him for "diverting what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital", which specialises in the health of women and babies. Chief constable Russ Jackson, counter-terrorism North West, said the suicide bomber had "asked to be taken to the Liverpool Women's Hospital", after hailing the taxi from the Rutland area of Liverpool, which is 10 minutes away. But UK media speculated his intended target may have been the Remembrance Sunday service at Liverpool Cathedral, 20 minutes walk from the hospital. At least 2,000 military personal, veterans and relatives of the fallen, together with civic dignitaries, had gathered in the cathedral on Sunday for its annual Remembrance Day Service. The taxi exploded outside the hospital at 10.59 am, just one minute before the annual two-minute silence to pay respect to the fallen. "This is being treated as the ignition of an explosive device," Jackson said. Enquiries "indicate that the device was brought into the cab by the passenger. Our enquiries indicate that an improvised explosive device has been manufactured and our assumption so far is that this was built by the passenger in the taxi. We believe we know the identity of the passenger," he added. "It is not clear what the motivation for this incident is. The reason why he took it to the women’s hospital is unknown, as is the reason for its sudden explosion. We are of course aware that there were remembrance events just a short distance away from the hospital and that the ignition occurred shortly before 11 am. It is a line of inquiry we are pursuing," Jackson added. Enquiries led officers to two addresses in Liverpool. The first was Sutcliffe Street in the Kensington area where three men aged 21, 26 and 29 were arrested under the Terrorism Act on Sunday. A further man aged 20 was arrested in the Kensington area under the Terrorism Act on Monday. The Sutcliffe Street address was searched overnight and a second address was searched at Rutland Avenue in Sefton Park. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Meeks said searches were still ongoing at both addresses. "We believe he lived at the Sutcliffe Street address for some time and had recently rented the Rutland Avenue address. Our focus is the Rutland Avenue address where we have continued to recover significant items." This attack comes after MP Sir David Amess was stabbed to death in his constituency surgery on October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/explosion-outside-liverpool-hospital-was-suicide-bomb-attack-police-say/articleshow/87724524.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The owner of the house in which the militants had been hiding, who was injured in the gunfight, succumbed later to his injuries, the police said. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said that according to their sources, and digital evidence, the house owner had " been working as a militant associate". A search for any remaining militants was still on, he said. "#SrinagarEncounterUpdate: 01 unidentified #militant killed. #Operation going on. Further details shall follow," the Kashmir zone police had tweeted. A little later, they had added: "01 more unidentified (militant) killed (Total 2). Operation going on. Further details shall follow (sic)." The police said the encounter between security forces and terrorists in Hyderpora area of Srinagar city began at around 6.15 pm. On Sunday evening, terrorists had injured policeman Gulzar Ahmad when they attacked a police party at Nawa Kadal, in central Srinagar, and then escaped. Intelligence sources say there are two dozen terrorists active in Srinagar city, including a few foreign terrorists. Security officials have been issuing advisories to protected persons asking them to restrict their movements in view of the terrorist threat in various localities, the sources said. Terrorists have been targeting civilians since October this year. A dozen civilians, including several non-Kashmiris and a few non-Muslims, had been killed till last week. The security agencies have so far failed to bust the terrorist sleeper cells, according to intelligence sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/2-unidentified-terrorists-house-owner-killed-on-srinagar-airport-road-police/articleshow/87724573.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ali Zaidi unanimously elected new chief of Shia Waqf Board||LUCKNOW: Ali Zaidi of Lucknow, who was earlier nominated to the UP Shia Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) by the state government, was unanimously elected as the chairperson of the Board on Monday. Out of eight members, six participated in the election. Former chairperson and current member Waseem Rizvi and another member Syed Faizi boycotted the day’s proceedings which were undertaken after getting the green signal from newly appointed principal secretary of the minority welfare, Haj and Waqf department, Himanshu Kumar. The members who participated in the election were former Congress MP from Rampur, Noor Bano, advocates Zaryab Jamal Rizvi of Amroha and Syed Shabahat Husain of Sidharth nagar, cleric Maulana Raza Husain of Lucknow and senior consultant at district women’s hospital, Prayagraj, Dr Noorus Hasan Naqvi. After the announcement of the election result, state minister for minority welfare, Mohsin Raza, termed Zaidi’s win as the victory of BJP and of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Zaidi is the son-in-law of the cousin of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad and is the youngest person in the board. Jawad has been at loggerheads with Rizvi and has been accusing him of indulging in corruption. Jawad also led several protests during Rizvi’s two terms as the Board’s chairperson. Due to his controversial statements against Islam, the Quran, Prophet Mohammad and madrasas, Rizvi had also drawing the ire of other clerics and organisations. “My priority will be to clean the Board of all corruption, as is the CM’s roadmap. Corrupt persons will not be spared. Shia waqf properties encroached by land mafia and waqf mafia will be taken back and the profit from earnings of these land will be honestly utilised,” said Ali Zaidi. “The Waqf Act is very clear but the Board was not being run according to it. People who benefitted from selfish management of the Board will be stopped. Honest people will be given responsibilities,” he added. Meanwhile, in a press statement, Waseem Rizvi termed the election result would lead “to the hold of Taliban over the Board much as it is in Afghanistan”. “Clerics, in collaboration with the minority department, have usurped the Board. The Waqf Act clearly states that the number of nominated members will not be more than elected ones but this was not the case for the chairperson election. Only three out of the eight board members are elected, while the remaining five members are nominated by the government. Syed Faizi will wait for the high court’s decision on our writ petitions on the subject,” Rizvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-ali-zaidi-unanimously-elected-new-chief-of-shia-waqf-board/articleshow/87723916.cms||Pravin Kumar
---||India||Government amends rules to spur extension of ED, CBI chiefs’ tenures||NEW DELHI: Amid protests by opposition to the twin ordinances promulgated on Sunday to provide for extension in tenure of chiefs of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and CBI by a possible 3 years beyond their mandatory two-year term, government has moved swiftly to encode the change in the relevant service rules. The government on Monday amended the Fundamental Rules, 1922 to bring them in sync with amendments to Central Vigilance Commission Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which govern the ED and the CBI respectively. The Acts, amended through ordinance route, had extended the maximum tenure of CBI and ED director to five years. The original Rule 56(d) of FR 1922 pertained to top functionaries like home secretary, defence secretary, foreign secretary, and chiefs of the Intelligence Bureau and Research & Analyses Wing, whose tenures could be extended by the government up to a maximum of two years and beyond as specified. The amended Rule 56(d) mentions the directors of the ED and the CBI along with defence secretary, home secretary, director of Intelligence Bureau and R&AW secretary. Curiously, foreign secretary does not figure in the grouping, leading to speculation whether the omission was deliberate or an oversight. The original Rule 56(d) rule provided for a two-year term for foreign secretary, extendable by another year. The notification of the rule intensified the buzz that the twin ordinances may have been designed to secure further extension of tenure for ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra after his term runs out on Thursday. The amended rules do not change matters for home secretary, defence secretary and the chiefs of the IB and R&AW since the earlier rules also provided for an extension of their service for a period or periods deemed proper by the government, with reasons to be recorded in writing, provided their total term does not exceed two years, which may include a period beyond their superannuation age. In the case of home and defence secretaries, a three-month extension beyond two years is also provided for, though this can be made longer by allowing a relaxation in Rule 56. The latter provision, which is replicated in All India Services (Retirement-cum-Death Benefits) Rules, was used to grant a one-year extension to the present home secretary, DIB and RAW chief after they completed their respective two-year terms. The amendments to DSPE Act and CVC Act, made on Sunday via Ordinance route, provide for a maximum five-year tenure to CBI and Enforcement Directorate chiefs, including a two-year fixed term that may be extended “in public interest” by up to three years, one year at a time. As per the amended Rule 56(d) of FR 1922, the maximum tenure of CBI and ED chiefs shall now be as laid down under the DSPE Act and CVC Act respectively. “The amended tenures for the two posts are now reflected in the Fundamental Rules, leaving no scope for anyone to question the maximum five-year term on the ground that there cannot be continuous extensions in service for a bureaucrat who has superannuated,” said a senior DoPT functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-syncs-service-extension-rules-with-amended-dspe-cvc-act-to-enable-5-year-term-for-cbi/ed-chiefs/articleshow/87724667.cms||Bharti Jain

Morning haze and smog envelops Delhi‘Don’t step out unless absolutely necessary’Dr (Brig) Ashok K Rajput, Chief, Respiratory/Pulmonology & Sleep Medicine, Artemis Hospital, Gurugram, shares, “Those who are suffering from respiratory illness in the form of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, will suffer in this pollution. They should remain indoors, use air purifiers and continue their regular medication. Even healthy people, as well as those who have suffered from COVID-19 and recovered, with their lung functions not at the optimal level, are likely to experience breathlessness, chest tightness, difficulty in breathing and chest pain. We all should remain indoors. This kind of air quality is detrimental to health so it might cause eye burning, runny nose, coughing, chest tightness, or breathlessness.” Read AlsoAs Delhi's air turns toxic, doctors say N95 better than cloth masks to combat pollution + COVIDDelhi’s air quality severely dipped post Diwali, with many areas in the city recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 500. Even though the air quality improved slightly on Saturday due to higher wind speed, the AQI was still over 400. With the COVID pandemic still not over and now the toxic air,‘Wear a mask, avoid prolonged exposure if you can't avoid stepping out'Dr (Brig) Ashok K Rajput says, “If you have to go out, then you should wear a mask, and time your outdoor activity as per the air quality. It is advisable to not step out early in the morning when the AQI is at its worst. When you are travelling by bus or car with the windows open, you are exposed to the pollution. Travelling in an air-conditioned car, or one with an air purifiers, is a slightly better option.”. Dr Puneet Khanna, HOD, department of Respiratory Medicine, Manipal Hospitals, Delhi, adds, “People should reduce the usage of vehicles to as little as possible. One should carpool with family members while keeping social distancing norms in mind, and try to cut down the commuting time by requesting the management to allow work from home as much as possible. Cover their nose and mouth completely with a good quality N95 mask. One should ideally step out for a stretch of two-three hours and then take rest indoors before stepping out again. Elderly, young children and those with lung diseases, diabetes, hypertension or cardiac diseases should avoid venturing out at all. Avoid exercising outdoors early in the morning and in the evening. Also, avoid running and marathons during this time. It is better to limit your exercises to minimum.” He advises that large gatherings should also be avoided during this time. “These are dangerous from the COVID-19 and the pollution point of view. Limit your movement to as little as possible,” he shares. Keep windows closed, use air purifiers, avoid outdoor physical activities and stay in touch with your docs, say doctorsDr Vineeta Tandon, Consultant, Internal Medicine, PSRI Hospital, Delhi, says, “Pollution has a huge impact on our health, and it is a misnomer that it impacts only the lungs. Yes, it does impact our lungs but it also has a damaging impact on our eyes, heart, and even skin. Children and the elderly who have compromised immune systems are highly vulnerable. Apart from staying indoors, keep windows closed and use air purifiers at home. Wear an N-95 mask while stepping out as a cloth mask would not help in protecting you from polluted air. Remain hydrated as it improves the blood flow and can improve oxygen levels in the body, while keeping your skin exfoliated. Wear sunglasses while driving a two-wheeler. When you return home, wash your eyes with fresh running water. Those who have respiratory problems should avoid stepping out and should get in touch with their doctors. Those with cardiovascular problems should also monitor their health regularly and watch out for any alarming signs.” ‘Wear goggles; avoid contact lenses and over-the counter eye drops’Experts share how to take care of your eyes during this weather||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/delhis-air-emergency-stay-indoors-take-extra-care-if-youre-in-the-vulnerable-category-caution-doctors/articleshow/87720909.cms||Riya Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai kids go cycling on Children’s Day||Cycling is a great way to stay fit and it’s also being seen as a way to commute, especially amid the pandemic. And this time around, it was a group of children who advocated that as they got onto their bikes on Children’s Day. The youngsters embarked on a special ride in the city and as expected, it was full of fun, laughter and some outdoor adventure, too! ‘Children can help us ride into a more sustainable future’Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh flags off the eventOrganised by the Cycle Chala City Bacha group, the event saw 50 kids gather at 6.30am in Santacruz. The happy, buzzing cyclists took off and rode via S V Road, then headed towards Jalsa and Juhu Beach and rode back. They took a short break at the beach, where they enjoyed fun games. Three other rides took place in South Mumbai, Chembur and Mulund as well. Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh, who organised the ride, says, “We cannot undermine the benefits of cycling; it can impact not just adults’ but also kids’ lives in a positive way. Many teachers report that kids who walk and cycle to school are more alert and ready to learn than those who arrive by car. I feel that it’s the children who are the superheroes who can help us ride into a more sustainable future.” Pedalling towards a memorable dayParents wore their old school uniforms to celebrate with their kidsThe kids had a fun time on wheels. Dr Viswanathan Iyer, brain and spine surgeon, and bicycle councillor (T-Ward), says, “The adults also came by wearing their old school uniforms, as everyone wanted to feel like a child again. I wore my son’s uniform and a few parents did the same. We had a slow cycling competition and everyone rode from Mulund west to east. At the end, we all went to a park and the kids spoke about cycling and its impact on the environment.” Happy participants during the ride at Marine Drive The event at South Mumbai saw a joint participation from A-Ward and C-Ward. Says marine engineer and bicycle councillor (A-Ward), Kayhan Irani, “Our entire stretch was along the sea face. The weather was great and everyone enjoyed refreshments at Nariman Point at the end. We definitely can do with more such rides in Mumbai to inculcate the value of cycling in our kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-go-cycling-on-childrens-day/articleshow/87723310.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||India||Hold emergency meet to tackle air pollution: SC to Centre, NCR states||NEW DELHI : A slight reduction in toxicity of ambient air quality did not deter the Supreme Court on Monday in directing the Centre and three NCR states — UP, Punjab and Haryana — to follow the Delhi government in adopting work from home for their employees to reduce vehicular traffic and called for an emergency meeting of all five governments to devise emergency measures to tackle pollution within 48 hours. Lack of concrete measures by the Centre and states to reduce the severe pollution levels in Delhi and NCR made a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant vent its anguish, saying, “We don't think the executive governments will sit together and take a decision as we had expected on Saturday. It is very unfortunate that we have to set an agenda for them and the areas they have to focus on for taking urgent decisions." “We find that major contributors of air pollution in the National Capital Region are — construction activities, running of nonessential industries, transport and running of coal-fired power plants. We find that some initiatives have been taken by the ‘Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas’ as also by Delhi government in compliance with directions passed by this court. We appreciate the steps taken by them,” it said. “However, after going through the actual exercise undertaken at the ground level, we find that the authorities have not yet indicated the broader steps that they are going to take to control the factors responsible for poor air quality,” the bench said, and directed the Centre to call an emergency meeting on Tuesday with all stakeholders and discuss the areas underlined by the court, and decide what further steps can be taken, along with the implementation mechanism. The SC highlighted that stubble burning was not the major contributor of pollution, even though the Centre said it affected Delhi and NCR air for two months in a year. The bench said, “So far as the air pollution caused by stubble burning is concerned, the affidavits filed in the matter do indicate that the stubble burning is not responsible for causing air pollution to that extent except for the two months of October and November,” it said. At the same time, the CJI-led bench conceded that there has been a spike in stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana. It asked both these states “to persuade the farmers and impress upon them not to set fire to stubble at least for a period of two weeks”. “We direct the Union of India and the NCR states to consider allowing their officers and officials to work from home, as is done by the Delhi government, to minimise vehicular traffic,” the bench said and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday, with a rider that the Centre and concerned states must come out with a concrete action plan. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre has been coordinating with the states and Delhi government, who are not only cooperating but doing their best to tackle the crisis situation. He agreed with the SC, which had said that sources other than stubble burning contribute nearly 70-80% of the pollution in NCR, and said that stubble burning contributed around 4-10% of air pollution. The CJI-led bench said, “Stubble burning is not the major cause of pollution. Dust, industry and vehicles are main contributors. If you take steps relating to these three issues, pollution will come down. Stubble burning we can tackle by taking long term measures.” Justice Chandrachud said, “Stubble burning contributes 4% to the pollution as per your affidavit. So, till now we were targeting a source of pollution which is insignificant.” But petitioner Aditya Dubey's counsel Vikas Singh, Nikhil Jain and Meenesh Dubey protested and said that forthcoming elections in Punjab are forcing the government towards fudging data on stubble burning. “Stubble burning cases in Punjab are not being reported and no action is being taken as the crucial elections are approaching,” Singh argued. The bench said it was not concerned either with elections or politics. “All we want is concrete measures on the ground level to reduce pollution.” SG said the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been enforced since 2017 and has yielded results.

Second dose. Corona vaccine. Anybody left out?” The act may have amused many, but seen in the context of India’s imposing inoculation target and the anxiety of the health establishment over unused vaccines going past their expiry date, there is suspicion this goes beyond comic relief. Most officials TOI spoke to, however, scotched fears of vaccine wastage, or those about to expire being offered as booster shots secretly, or expired doses being dumped. Hospital administrators, particularly those in the private sector, have adopted ingenious methods to clear their vaccine stockpile — including cutting the price of shots, using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to vaccinate people for free, and exchanging doses with other hospitals to use up the idle stock. The Serum Institute of India (SII), makers of Covishield, has been encouraging private hospitals to buy from those having doses in excess, instead of placing a fresh order. “We paid SII and it diverted the money to another hospital that gave us the required cache,” said Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital in Pune. Such measures are seen more in the case of Covishield as its shelf life is just six months, as opposed to Covaxin’s one year. Health experts hope India will soon come up with a policy to vaccinate children below 18 years, which will push up demand and help clear out near-expiry doses. As of November 12, India had vaccinated 36.2 crore people, or 26.2% of its population, with its supply chain reaching places off the map. Private hospitals in Pune district have around 2.5 lakh doses, a large chunk of which will expire either in January or February. "We are struggling to clear 6,000 doses of Covishield for more than two months. We marked down the price of each dose by Rs 100, but there’s not much hope as their use-by date is February 28," said Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Hospital in Pune. Private units charge around Rs 800 for a jab. According to Dr Prince Surana from the Surana Group of Hospitals that has tied up with business houses to inoculate slum-dwellers, hospitals approached him to offload their stock, particularly Covishield. "I was offered a discount of up to 30%," he said. Private players stocked up on Covid vaccines after availability improved in June, anticipating the summer’s high demand to stay. The peak of the pandemic's second wave had coincided with a reported shortage of vaccines. "They (private hospitals) failed to factor in the public sector that picked up at least three times more doses than private units and gave shots without charge," a hospital administrator in Mumbai said, explaining the correlation between falling demand in private hospitals and about-to-expire vials remaining on the shelf. The concern over "dead stock" has been more acute in big urban centres. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said: "The bigger issue is wastage as we lose about 5-6% of our stock to unused vaccines." Most states, however, have reported little wastage in the public sector. Some like Maharashtra are unaware of the volume due for expiry in the private sector that held more than 45 lakh doses till a week ago. Hospitals have been limiting procurement to small batches, and vials nearing the expiration date were used first. In Tamil Nadu, camps for free shots with CSR funds covering the expenses helped several private hospitals exhaust their stock, said health minister Ma Subramanian. UP has restricted the private sector’s role to prevent wastage. In Madhya Pradesh, immunisation in-charge Dr Santosh Shukla said the state’s current stock of over one crore doses is within its targeted requirement. "As for waste, MP’s consumption is +3% (extracting the 11th dose from a vial of 10)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hospitals-improvise-as-unused-covid-vaccine-doses-near-expiry/articleshow/87725570.cms||---

Special prosecution officer S P Yadav said since the probe report has mentioned Ashish as the prime accused and an SIT had gathered sufficient evidence against him, bail was denied to him and two of his aides, Luv Kush Rana & Ashish Pandey. ‘Over 60 farmers said Ashish was present at Kheri mowing spot’District governmen counsel (DGC) Arvind Tripathi told TOI, “The defence hid Ashis’s criminal history. Also, an SDM and a circle officer recorded statements saying Ashish was seen running away from the spot after the farmers were mowed down.” He said this was corroborated by over 60 farmers who had given statements that suggested Ashish’s presence at the incident spot. “The statements also said that he was sitting inside the Thar jeep in the co-driver seat. His presence was further confirmed by the SIT investigation, which said the mobile location of Ashish showed that he was there during the violence. The investigation also showed that he ran towards a cane field firing towards the farmers. The ballistic report of his rifle was also found positive in the forensic test. Since allegations against Ashish are grave and the investigation is still pending, the judge rejected the bail plea,” Tripathi explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kheri-case-bail-denied-to-ministers-son-and-2-aides/articleshow/87725669.cms||---

Around two dozen men, who onlookers said belonged to right-wing outfit Bajrang Dal, staged a demonstration in front of the house, where they burnt an effigy of the Congress leader, vandalised his house, and set fire to a portion of the residence. An FIR has been registered against around 20 people, police said. Only one of the accused has been identified by the caretaker, who said one of the agitators pointed a pistol at his daughter-in-law. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book, ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other portions of his vandalised house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?” He further said, “So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Calling the attack “disgraceful”, fellow Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted: “The mounting levels of intolerance in our politics should be denounced by those in power.” At the time of the incident, the caretaker of the house, Sundar Ram, and his family were present. Ram said that around 1pm, a mob of around 20 people gathered in front of the house. “We tried to reason with them but they started pouring diesel on the front door and set it on fire. One of them whipped out a pistol and pointed it at my daughter-in-law. They then opened fire at the window and broke the window panes. They must have fired around six to seven rounds,” Ram said. The caretaker added that he recognised two people in the mob, one of whom has been named in the FIR. Police reached the spot after Ram informed them. DIG Kumaon Nilesh Bharane told TOI, “Apart from one accused, identified as Rakesh Kapil, a resident of Mouna village, 20 others, yet to be identified, have been booked. For now, police cover has been provided at the house.” The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (punishment for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night), 552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/book-protesters-vandalise-salman-khurshids-nainital-home/articleshow/87725731.cms||---

Also, the total percentage of international students in US campuses dropped below 5% for the first time since 2015-16 and total international students in the country is now at a seven-year low. For India with 1.68 lakh students, though US institutions continue to be the top choice and represent the second-largest (18.33%) cohort among international students as per the 2021 Open Doors Report released on Monday, the Covid-19 period witnessed a decline in the numbers. As per the latest report, total international scholars in US campuses is now at 9.14 lakh, of which 2.04 lakh are in the ‘optional practical training’ period. Undergraduate and graduate students with F-1 status, who have completed or have been pursuing their degrees for one academic year, are permitted to work for one year on student visa to obtain practical training to complement their education. Data on year-on-year international students enroled revealed that the numbers peaked in 2016-17 when it breached the nine-lakh mark at 9.03 lakh. Since then it has been a gradual decline though the percentage of international students has been maintained at 5.5%. In 2020-21, the numbers came down to 7.10 lakh, which is lower than 2012-13 numbers of 7.25 lakh. The percentage of international students too came down to 4.6%, which again is a seven-year low. The India story follows a declining trend during the Covid-19 period since breaching the two-lakh mark in 2018-19. From 2.02 lakh in 2018-19 it dropped to 1.68 lakh in 2020-21. The three top countries which account for the largest number of international students in the US are China (35%, down 14.8 percentage points), followed by India (18%, down 13.2 percentage points) and South Korea (4%, down 20.7 percentage points). However, given the pandemic situation, the US authorities are happy with the numbers stating that over 62,000 visas were issued to Indian students this summer alone, more than in any previous year. Highlighting that US states remained open and welcoming to international students throughout the global Covid-19 pandemic, minister counsellor for consular affairs Don Heflin, at the launch of the report said, “Despite the global pandemic, Indian students were able to apply for visas and travel to the United States. We issued over 62,000 student visas this summer alone, more than in any previous year. This goes to show that the United States remains the destination of choice for Indian students looking to study abroad. We look forward to issuing many more visas in the year to come, to help Indian students achieve their dreams of US study.” Counselor for cultural and educational affairs, Anthony Miranda said, “International student mobility is central to US diplomacy, innovation, economic prosperity, and national security. The United States is the gold standard for higher education, providing world-class practical application and experience that gives our graduates an advantage in the global economy,” adding, “we value Indian students, as they build life-long connections with American peers to maintain and grow international partnerships, and to collectively address current and future global challenges.” The officials added that the 2021 Fall Snapshot?of the Open Doors report, which looks forward to the 2021-22 academic year, shows a substantial increase in student numbers this year,?further affirming that international students value a US education and remain committed to pursuing higher education in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-effect-indians-in-us-varsities-fell-by-13-in-2020/articleshow/87725957.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||India||Swede kindness takes over after midair stroke||MUMBAI: Last week when a Rajkot couple boarded an Air India flight to Chicago, they were just headed to attend their son’s wedding, but a midair medical emergency—the wife suffered a brain stroke—landed them in Stockholm, a city they had never heard of. However, right from the moment the flight was on ground, the hapless couple found helping hand everywhere, thanks to Sweden’s socialism and Indian diaspora’s resourcefulness, reports Manju V. The hospital didn’t ask whether his wife was eligible to be treated there, whether he had the money, said Dr Jaysukh Makwana (60), a dentist. The Indian embassy contacted Indranil Sinha, a researcher who worked nearby, who took the Gujarati and Hindi-speaking Makwana to places where he could find agreeable vegetarian, meals, helped him withdraw money and did a myriad other jobs to assist them. The Gujaratis then took over. Makwana said they were midair when his wife Usha (63) suddenly found herself immobile, her speech slurred. Luckily, a neurologist was on board the flight. “At one glance, he said, brain stroke,” recalled Makwana. The AI flight 127 was approaching the Norwegian sea then. The pilot, Capt N S Billimoria, had the Boeing 777 turn for a medical emergency, landing in Stockholm. “Had she suffered the stroke later, over the Atlantic, help would have been 5-6 hours away, too late,” said Makwana. In 45 minutes, the flight was on ground, the patient put into a waiting ambulance, while the local police escorted the husband for an emergency visa to the Stockholm Arlanda airport terminal. “I heard them say ‘Orlando’ terminal and was relieved we had landed in the US as my son is here,” he said. But they were in Stockholm. “I didn’t know where this place was. The only country we had travelled to was the US where our son works,” said Makwana. Air India had their bags delivered in no time. “The police was immensely helpful with the visas and dropped me to a hotel,” said Makwana. By the time he reached the hospital, Suresh Kumar from the Indian embassy had contacted Indranil Sinha, who worked in an institute located near the hospital. “I went to see him. I knew merely seeing an Indian in a foreign country would bring him some comfort,” said Sinha. In the following days, Sinha did myriad jobs to assist them. “I contacted my Gujarati friends and the word spread among their community,” said Sinha. On November 13, Makwana’s wife was moved from ICU to the general ward, while Kaushik Patel, a Gujarati Stockholmer moved him from the hotel to his home. “They drop me to the hospital in the morning, pick me up in the evening, daily. Another family brings me Gujarati lunch daily. Someone gave me a SIM card, another Indian bought me sweaters, the temperature is 3 degree Celsius. Someone else got me a mobile charger,” he said. “It’s the benevolence of the hospital staff, police, embassy officials and the local Indians. I have never experienced anything like this,” said the dentist. His son, living in Florida, US, will get married on November 20. It’s not known yet whether the Makwanas will be able to make it for the ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/swede-kindness-takes-over-after-midair-stroke/articleshow/87726007.cms||Manju V

Four more batches will land in Antarctica by mid-January 2022. Four batches will reach Antarctica by air using DROMLAN facility (a coordinated project between 11 countries for logistics service) and onboard chartered ice-class vessel MV VasiliyGolovnin. Once the entire contingent reaches the icy continent, it will launch two major programmes. The first project will encompass geological exploration of the Amery ice shelf at Indian Bharati station. This will help explore the link between India and Antarctica in the past. The second one will involve reconnaissance and preparatory work for drilling of 500m of ice core near Maitri that will help in improving the understanding of the Antarctic climate, westerly winds, sea-ice and greenhouse gases, a release from the ministry of earth sciences said. The ice core drilling near Maitri will be done in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey and the Norwegian Polar Institute. In addition to these programmes, the team will replenish annual supplies of food, fuel, provisions and spares for operations and maintenance of life support systems at Indian stations. The Indian Antarctic programme, which began in 1981, has completed 40 scientific expeditions till now and built three permanent research base stations, Dakshin Gangotri (1983), Maitri (1988) and Bharati (2012). As of today, Maitri and Bharati are currently fully operational. The Goa-based National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research, under the ministry of earth sciences, manages the entire programme. As India is committed to maintaining the icy continent free of Covid-19, the contingent has reached Antarctica following a strict medical exam at AIIMS-Delhi; training for snow-ice acclimatisation and survival at the mountaineering and skiing Institute of ITBP in Auli; and a stringent sanitary protocol, including a 14-day quarantine at Cape Town, South Africa. The crew is expected to return to Cape Town in late March/early April of 2022, leaving a team of 48 members for winter. It will also bring back the winter team of the preceding 40th expedition. The 41st expedition is being led by Dr Shailendra Saini, Scientist of National Centre for Polar & Ocean Research (voyage leader), Huidrom ageshwar Singh, metrologist, IMD (leader, Maitri station) and Anoop Kalayil Soman, scientist from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (leader, Bharati Station).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-sends-fresh-batch-to-antarctica-for-studying-climate-greenhouse-gases/articleshow/87726282.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||PM woos tribals, says earlier govts ignored their welfare||NEW DELHI : In a major tribal outreach to mark the first “Janjatiya Gaurav Divas”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bhopal attacked Congress -- without naming the party -- saying tribal welfare had been ignored and the role of tribal communities in the freedom struggle was denied the importance they deserved by previous governments in office. Stating that the government made tribal welfare a priority, the Prime Minister said, "the contribution of tribal society was either not told to the country, and even if told, very limited information was given" by those in power previously. This was because “those who ran the government in the country for decades after independence, gave priority to their selfish politics”. On Monday, Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is in power and which also has the largest tribal population in the country, became the platform for the Centre's political outreach. Last week at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Modi, the central government decided to observe tribal icon and anti-colonial warrior Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as “Janjatiya Gaurav Divas” annually to celebrate tribal history and culture. Addressing the large gathering in Bhopal, the PM said, “For the first time in the country after independence, on such a large scale, the art-culture of the entire country's tribal society, their contribution to the freedom movement and nation building is being remembered and honored with pride.” Earlier in the day, the PM inaugurated the Bhagwan Birsa Munda Freedom Fighter Museum in Ranchi. Addressing the audience virtually, PM also remembered former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee highlighting the latter’s role in the formation of the state of Jharkhand in 1999 and during whose tenure the tribal affairs ministry was carved out. The PM added that as part of the celebrations to mark 75 years of Independence an attempt is being made to revive the stories and history of tribal icons who were denied the recognition that they deserved in the decades gone by. During his address in Bhopal, the PM asserted that by not giving the tribal society the due importance, "the previous governments have committed a crime" and "this issue should be raised again and again". "A discussion on this should happen at every platform," Modi said. He remarked that the tribal region of the country has always been rich in terms of wealth and resources. But “those who were in the government earlier, followed the policy of exploiting these areas. We are following the policy of utilising the potential of these areas properly,” he said. Giving examples of how tribals were being mainstreamed through welfare schemes, the PM spoke about work being done in aspirational districts which include tribal areas. “Today, products by the artisans of the tribal section are being promoted nationally and globally. More than 90 forest produces are being given Minimum Support Price compared to 8-10 crops earlier. More than 150 medical colleges have been approved for such districts. More than 2,500 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras have been connected with more than 37 thousand self help groups leading to 7 lakh jobs,” the PM shared. He further shared that 20 lakh land ‘Pattas’ (rights) have been given to forest dwellers. “Emphasis on mother tongue in the New Education Policy will help the tribal people,” the PM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-woos-tribals-says-earlier-govts-ignored-their-welfare/articleshow/87726277.cms||---

He was arrested on November 2. After the defence moved a plea seeking home food for Deshmukh, the court said the jail had rules and told him to eat the jail food for now. “If there is any complaint, then I will consider,” the court said. “So far as the prayer of home food is concerned, let the accused be admitted to jail. The appropriate order will be passed later on dependent upon the complaints in the light of health issues of the accused,” the court added. The court remarked that home food could have also caused Deshmukh’s acidity after his lawyer listed his ailments. Urging the court to send Deshmukh to judicial custody and not release him during the pendency of the investigations, the ED in its plea submitted through special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar said he is an influential person, having served as state home minister, and if his judicial custody is not granted, he may tamper with evidence. “During the interrogation of Deshmukh, many crucial facts have been revealed, which are in his exclusive domain, as he (sic) being the key personnel, deeply and directly involved and having in possession of proceeds of crime,” the ED said. The ED alleged that Deshmukh had not provided the required information regarding the laundering of proceeds of crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-jail-food-for-now-court-tells-maharashtra-ex-home-minister/articleshow/87726323.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Compared to October 2020, the volumes doubled, and values rose 24%.The total M&A transaction stood at $3.3 billion across 61 deals, which is a multi-fold increase both in terms of deal volumes and values, as compared to October 2020. Positive domestic business sentiment across sectors and global economic recovery continue to aid the overall trend. Startup and IT sectors continued to drive M&A volumes, accounting for over half the deals with a value of $391 million. October also saw the emergence of five new unicorns – CoinSwitchKuber, Acko General Insurance (both fintech), Faasos, Licious (both food tech), and Vedantu (edtech).Domestic consolidation continued to dominate the M&A segment, with 79% of M&A deal volumes. This included a marquee deal – Tata’s acquisition of Air India. Compared with September, although the volumes almost doubled, it fell 48% by value. “October has been encouraging, both in terms of deal volume and deal value, indicating the continuum in deal activities. While volumes recorded a 2x increase over October 2020, deal values saw a strong 24% increase. The economy is being bolstered by the rapid improvement in high-frequency indicators such as the e-way bills, GST collection, power demand, rail freight and exports growth.

---||Bengaluru||Offer technical edu in mother tongue: VP||Bengaluru: Emphasising the need for education in the local language, Vice-President of India M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said technical and medical education should be offered in the mother tongue. “The President of India, Vice-President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice have all studied in their mother tongue as a medium of instruction. What more proof do you want?” he said while speaking at PES University convocation here.“I find that many technical books used by engineering students in India are published by foreign authors. It would be good if our learned academicians could promote knowledge economy by authoring books... I say so because Indian authors can better contextualise engineering course content with regard to Indian socio-economic conditions,” he added. Asking educational institutions to take the new National Education Policy seriously, Naidu said there is an urgent need to align university classrooms with emerging global trends such as 5G-based technologies, which find application in a wide range of areas, including agriculture, medical, administrative, commerce and industrial management. “I urge institutions to focus on agriculture and make it viable so that people continue in this profession. Universities must come out with new ideas to make agriculture more viable and profitable,” he added. Naidu also called for increased participation of private universities in space activities as the government has been boosting the role of private players in this sector. Karnataka governor Thawar Chand Gehlot congratulated the government for implementing NEP. “Impressive use of digital learning tools has increased classroom participation and has helped teachers manage lessons better. High- standard technical education is going to play an important role in any country’s success,” he added. ‘Be job creators’MR Doreswamy, chancellor of PES University, asked graduates to be not just job seekers, but also job creators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/offer-technical-edu-in-mother-tongue-vp/articleshow/87726367.cms||---

The federations are also running an online petition with over 1,000 signatories.The demands raised include making BTM Layout-KR Puram Metro line a multi-tier one running through Iblur; reviving Iblur-Carmelaram line and extending it to Sarjapur, upgrading Carmelaram station into a major interchange, putting in place a holistic mobility plan with “pedestrian-first” designs, and providing last-mile connectivity for Iblur-KR Puram and Iblur-Carmelaram corridors.“All this is part of the masterplan. We are giving the plan a relook and seeing how we can connect to Carmelaram,” said a BMRCL source.Sudarshan Shastry, secretary of Kasavanahalli Development Forum, alleged that civic agencies were chalking out development plans without proper planning. “Public consultation has never been a streamlined process,” he said.“Iblur is a major junction. Civic agencies are planning to create Metro, bus stations and other things, yet they fail to look at last-mile connectivity,” an Iblur resident said.Vishnu Prasad, a member of Bellandur Development Forum and one of the signatories to the online petition, said, “Bellandur houses eight SEZs, lakhs of IT employees and accounts for $30 billion exports, all in a 5km radius. It has the highest BBMP tax contribution and yet has three of the city’s 10 congested zones.”“All we are asking for is to make Carmelaram station an interchange and provide a holistic multi-tier Metro solution for Sarjapur Road and ORR,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rwas-seek-revival-of-carmelaram-metro-line/articleshow/87726369.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Water entered five houses in Kaval Byrasandra, three in Kammanahalli and one in a low-lying area behind Banaswadi railway station. The evening rain reduced traffic movement to a crawl and lowered visibility on flyovers, prompting motorists to move with their parking lights on. According to the weatherman, the sky will remain cloudy over the next two days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/evening-rain-floods-roads-houses-in-city/articleshow/87726370.cms||---

Considering this, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi disposed of the petition, filed by Bengaluru resident S Gowrishankar.The bench said in case of any specific violation of the rules, a complaint could be filed with the higher authorities. The petitioner claimed during driving tests, Rule 15 was being ignored as most tests were conducted on RTO premises. He claimed if Rule 15, with so many stipulations, is strictly adhered to, it will not be possible for RTOs to conduct 50 to 100 tests a day, as they are claiming now. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-hc-dl-testing-norms-are-stringent/articleshow/87726372.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Road accidents fell for 5th straight year in 2020||BENGALURU: As many as 7,523 people have been killed and 33,864 injured in 28,036 road accidents reported in Karnataka till October 21 this year, shows data with state police. The statistics are in sync with the trend of previous five years, when road accidents and injuries due to them declined. The year 2020, when Covid-19 struck, forcing the government to enforce lockdowns and restrict people from moving around, saw the lowest number of road accidents and related deaths during 2016-20. For the first time in this time period, the number of road accidents (34,718) and deaths (9,760) due to them dipped below 40,000 and 10,000, respectively, in 2020. The number of persons injured in road accidents too has come down over the last five years. While 54,556 persons were injured in road accidents in 2016, the number stood at 39,492 in 2020. Senior IPS officer and commissioner for traffic and road safety, Pratap Reddy, said strict enforcement of road laws and quick action by Emergency Response Service Support (ERSS) vehicles, which are extensively deployed along state and national highways, have resulted in fewer accidents and deaths. “Interceptors are deployed at various places to trace and fine over-speeding vehicles. Also, other routine measures such as drunk-driving checks have helped in bringing down accidents. Further, quick response by ERSS staff, who reach the accident spot in the fastest possible time, saved lives of many injured people. In urban areas, ERSS vehicles reach the accident spot within 20 minutes of getting an alert, while they take around 30-40 minutes in rural areas. Currently, we have around 700 ERSS vehicles patrolling different highways of the state,” said Reddy. Another senior IPS officer said good roads and widened lanes too have contributed to the dip in accident count. “Many national and state highways have been broadened into four or six lanes with grade separators and medians. Also, road engineering is getting better,” he said. “However, better roads and wide lanes are also leading to high-impact accidents. Vehicles moving at a high speed collide with one another, often killing more than two persons on the spot. If the same accidents were to occur on normal roads, fatalities would be less. Increasing highway patrolling is the best way to tackle such accidents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/road-accidents-fell-for-5th-straight-yr-in-2020/articleshow/87726375.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt owes Rs 20,000 crore to five Escoms||BENGALURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said a panel headed by former IAS officer K Jairaj will be set up to revitalise Escoms (electricity supply companies) of the state, but with dues of Rs 20,000 crore, the government is the biggest defaulter. While various departments and local bodies have to pay about Rs 5,975 crore cumulatively to five Escoms — Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Company (Cescom), Mysuru, Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (Gescom), Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (Mescom), and Hubli Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) — the finance department owes Rs 12,912 crore towards subsidy for 30.6 lakh irrigation pumpsets. Energy department officials said unless the government settles pending dues, Escoms cannot be revived. But the government is facing acute fund shortage and finance officials said they have informed the chief minister the dues are so huge that it will take a long time to settle them in phases. “Jairaj will have a daunting task on hand to revamp Escoms, given the huge amount of pending bills from the government itself. A cosmetic makeover will not help unless his panel recovers the outstanding dues. It is to be seen how he achieves this when the government is complaining of empty coffers,” said MG Prabhakar, energy expert and former advisory council member, Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission. The government order constituting the Jairaj committee is expected shortly. Bommai selected the former bureaucrat considering his vast domain experience as energy secretary for about 10 years. “I am waiting for the government order. The main issue is the financial crisis Escoms are facing. I am confident we can revive the companies with the CM’s guidance,” Jairaj said. Energy minister V Sunil Kumar said the outstanding dues are highest for Bescom. The company, which supplies power to eight districts (Bengaluru Urban, Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Ramanagaram, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, and Davangere) has to recover Rs 3,750 crore. Of that, BBMP and BWSSB owe Rs 3,310 crore. Gram panchayats cumulatively owe Rs 2,444 crore to all five Escoms. “The indifference of BBMP and BWSSB and lethargy of Bescom officials to ensure timely bill collection are the reasons for pending dues. It is important to recover them, else Escoms cannot settle what they owe to the power-generating companies, which is about Rs 2,500 crore,” said Sunil Kumar. He said as a strict measure, the energy department plans to fix prepaid metres at government departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-owes-20000cr-to-five-escoms/articleshow/87726377.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Police identified the deceased as Bhupat Singh from Madhya Pradesh. He was working with a construction firm as a drilling machine operator and stayed in a temporary shed at the site. Singh and his friend had finished dinner and stepped out to have cold drinks. They were walking towards a shop around 9.30pm when the gang of five miscreants asked them to stop. The miscreants asked Singh and his friend not to use the road where they were drinking and partying. But Singh and his friend did not listen and went towards a shop to buy cold drinks. As the shop was closed, they walked back on the same road when the miscreants intercepted them. A gang member took out a knife and stabbed Singh multiple times before fleeing. Singh rushed to a nearby hospital with the help of his friend, but succumbed to injuries by 11pm. Byappanahalli police detained a few suspects for the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-of-5-drinking-on-road-stabs-youth-to-death/articleshow/87726378.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru man cleaning bike with engine on loses finger||BENGALURU: It is common for bikers to clean their vehicle in the morning while the engine warms up. Riders often think that revving the engine will result in better on-road acceleration. However, a Bengaluru professional who was doing the same, lost a finger after it got stuck in the bike’s chain. On the morning of September 28, Rahul (name changed), who works with a logistics firm, was prepping his new motorcycle to head to work. He had the engine running and kept it on first gear, so that the tyre could spin and he could clean it faster. But to his bad luck, the cloth touched the chain of the vehicle, got dragged into it, severing two of his right-hand fingers. However, thanks to timely action, one finger could be saved after an eight-hour surgery by a team of doctors at Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road. Rahul, 35, who lives in Varthur, told TOI his family quickly covered the fully severed finger in a clean cloth, stored it in an ice pack and rushed him to hospital. He said the high RPM (revolution/rotations per minute) of his new bike’s engine and a lack of casing around the chain caused the accident. “I’d clean my old bike too the same way, which, however, had a casing around the chain. After I bought the new bike, during the first servicing, I was told the chain must be cleaned. On that particular day, I saw the chain spinning faster and was looking to clean it with a toothbrush. But as I was getting late, I decided to clean it with a cloth wrapped around my finger,” said Rahul. Rahul said the pain was so unbearable that he couldn’t even think of surgery at that time. “I wanted them to cut off even my index finger, which was partially severed, and let it heal,” he said, adding that his family members and doctors convinced him to undergo the reattachment surgery. Rahul underwent a plastic and microvascular surgery – from 12.30pm to 9pm — in which arteries, veins and nerves are joined using sutures thinner than human hair under microscope magnification along with fixation of bone, tendons, soft tissue and skin. However, after two days, his middle finger, which was reattached, began turning black due to blockage of blood supply and had to be eventually removed. Dr Kartik Shrinivas Tallam, consultant — department of plastic surgery, Manipal Hospital, Varthur Road said Rahul was discharged with a plaster and followed up for weekly dressing. After physiotherapy, he has even started writing now, the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-cleaning-bike-with-engine-on-loses-finger/articleshow/87726380.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Hit by insider jobs and leaks, BJP is in bitcoin fix||BENGALURU: That all is not well in the ruling BJP is best demonstrated in the ongoing political crisis emerging out of the bitcoin issue. The developments arising out of discord among some senior ministers and half-a-dozen chief ministerial aspirants are a testament to the inner conflict within the ruling party. “We are not sure whether there is a scam or not. Only an investigation will reveal that. But undoubtedly a lot of vital information is being leaked to opposition parties and media by our own party men,’’ said a senior minister. In a scathing attack on Bommai post the recent Hangal bypoll defeat, a senior minister was heard saying: “There is no collective leadership in the party. Only two people take decisions and others implement them...Let them give us the mantle. We will ensure 135 seats.” There is also talk within the BJP that two ministers, who are reportedly not on the most cordial terms with the chief minister, could be next in the line of fire with some sort of ignominy. They had expressed their desire to be chief minister of the state before Bommai was selected. Despite a volley of personal tirades against Bommai by the Congress on the bitcoin issue, some senior ministers, who were very vocal in defending his predecessor BS Yediyurappa, have maintained a studied silence suggesting that the cabinet is not in sync. According to some Bommai loyalists, Union home minister Amit Shah has reportedly directed party president JP Nadda to rein in disgruntled BJP functionaries in Karnataka who are indulging in spreading rumours to create confusion in the political scenario. Bommai had reportedly complained to Shah about two ministers who were allegedly leaking information to Congress leaders on the bitcoin case. Nadda has sought a report from the state unit to initiate action, sources said. Senior minister CN Ashwath Narayan said he is not aware of any such meeting between Bommai and Shah and also the direction given to Nadda. Several anonymous letters, including one by an ABVP leader, were also reportedly shot off to the party brass and the PMO about the issue. It was shared with media indicating the involvement of some party functionaries. The opposition, which had no documents to substantiate their allegations on the issue, picked up the content from these letters to slam the ruling party, thus embarrassing them. While the BJP is in damage-control mode, opposition leaders are upbeat that they’re able to put the saffron party in the state and the Centre in a spot. However, the whole scenario has exposed infighting in the opposition camp as well. There is apparently a feeling among a section that Siddaramaiah and DK Shiva Kumar are soft-pedalling the issue by making bland statements. This has prompted MLAs led by Priyank Kharge to pursue Congress general secretary in-charge of Karnataka and party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala to take up the issue at the national level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hit-by-insider-jobs-and-leaks-bjp-is-in-bitcoin-fix/articleshow/87726382.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||Ooty planter’s ‘daughter’ dupes two Bengaluru businessmen of Rs 19 lakh||BENGALURU: Two businessmen from the city have approached Sampigehalli police after a woman, posing as the daughter of a planter in Ooty, duped them of money. While the 28-year-old realtor lost Rs 6 lakh to Kamala of MCECHS Layout, Sampigehalli, the 34-year-old businessman hailing from Kanakapura claimed she took Rs 13 lakh from him. Police said the businessmen knew each other formally as they were common friends of the suspect.  Police have no other details of Kamala who befriended the men saying her father owns a tea estate in Ooty. Saying her black money got stuck in Kerala and she needed some cash to get it, Kamala borrowed money from them. Cops have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Kamala under IPC 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). “Our probe is in the initial stage now and the accused’s mobile phones are switched off,” a police official said. The businessman stated in his complaint that he met the woman earlier this year through a matrimonial website. “We became friends and one day, she took me to her house. Later, she took me to an under-construction building in Dollars Colony and said it was her house. That day, she requested me for Rs 3 lakh, saying she needs to pay towards interior decoration. I gave her the amount. One day, she displayed a video showing currency bundles and claimed her black money was stuck in Kerala. She took Rs 7 lakh from me to get it back. Some days later, she took Rs 3 lakh more, saying she will be shifting to a rented accommodation. Also, she has purchased a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) after raising a vehicle loan from a bank in my name. After that she remained incommunicado,” he said. The realtor’s complaint too ran on similar lines. “We became friends in January 2020 when she approached me seeking a house on rent. Later, she told me she owns many properties in the city and I should look after them as a manager. However, I refused. One day, she displayed a video of a currency bundle and stated that it was her black money. A few months back, she took Rs 6.5 lakh from me saying she needs it to bring back the black money,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ooty-planters-daughter-dupes-two-bluru-businessmen-of-19l/articleshow/87726383.cms||---

Apparently, Bangalore University’s physical education department had prepared the cheques but could not give them away owing to the university norm that financial transactions must be done online. The list of awardees with their bank account details are yet to reach the University finance department for transferring the amount and that has led to the delay, it is learnt.Speaking to TOI, university physical education director Dr T Lingaraju said that the list would be sent to the finance department by Tuesday and the amount would be credited to the students’ accounts in a day’s time. As one of the awardees pointed out, the money is crucial as it would help them in their education or pursuing sports, now that training camps and tournaments have resumed.While the Bangalore University awardees have to wait longer for their cash prizes owing to administrative delay, it is worth noting that Bangalore Central University (BCU) athletes received the amount in January itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/athletes-still-waiting-for-cash-awards/articleshow/87726388.cms||---

On their home ground, the Veda Krishnamurthy-led team will go into the contest as favourites having put up a commendable show in the league phase with both bat and ball.The Karnataka middle order has been hardly tested as the top order has been on a roll. D Vrinda was the top-scorer for the state with 340 runs from four league matches including two centuries and an equal number of half-centuries. G Divya has accumulated 306 runs from five matches (one 100, two 50s) while S Shubha has contributed 214 runs (three 50s). On the bowling front, off-spinner Chandu V has led from the front claiming 12 wickets in four matches with an economy rate of 3.34. She has been well-supported by Monica Patel and C Prathyusha.MP’s batting will be led by international Pooja Vastrakar and Neha Badwaik, who has been effective with her leg spin. Off-spinner Priti Yadav is their other prime wicket-taker.A major cause for concern is the weather. Though the Chinnaswamy stadium is equipped with one of the best drainage facilities, rain could play spoilsport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-face-mp-in-last-8/articleshow/87726390.cms||---
---||India||Government to move SC against Kerala HC relief for Swapna in gold case||NEW DELHI: In a politically-sensitive case involving the Left Front government in Kerala, the Centre has decided to move the Supreme Court against an order of the Kerala High Court quashing the detention of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case, under the stringent Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act). Suresh was recently released on bail after 15 months in jail by the Kerala HC under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) imposed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The gold smuggling racket was busted in July 2020, leading to seizure of 30 kg gold worth Rs 15 crore from an official consignment of the UAE consulate at Trivandrum International Airport. Later, Suresh and seven other accused were arrested and a probe by the Enforcement Directorate and the customs department revealed involvement of IAS officer M Sivasankar, then principal secretary of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The customs department has in its recent chargesheet in the case named Sivasankar as an accused who, it claimed, knew about the gold smuggling racket and was involved with Swapna Suresh. The government has taken an opinion from the law ministry to challenge the Kerala HC order quashing Cofeposa against Suresh. The quashing of the Cofeposa detention order came on October 8, two days short of Suresh completing an year in detention under the stringent act. Completing one-year detention under Cofeposa allows agencies to confiscate assets of all the accused, their relatives and associates and the burden of proof lies on the accused (that the properties are not illegally acquired from the ‘proceeds of crime’). In the same case, sources said, the Cofeposa imposed on six others have been retained, raising eyebrows in the government about the dual approach adopted in dealing with the particular case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-to-move-sc-against-kerala-hc-relief-for-swapna-in-gold-case/articleshow/87726396.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||India||Post-sunset autopsy allowed to boost organ donation||NEW DELHI: The government has made changes in post-mortem protocols to allow conducting post-mortem after sunset in hospitals with proper infrastructure, except for cases of homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies and suspected foul. The new protocol will come into effect from Monday. While the move is expected to bring some relief to mourning relatives and friends of deceased, it is also aimed at promoting organ donation and transplant as organs can be harvested in the stipulated time window after the procedure, the health ministry said. The ministry had received several representations on the matter, which were examined by a technical committee in the Directorate General of Health Services. It was ascertained that some institutes are already performing night-time post-mortem. In view of the rapid advancement and improvement in technology, especially availability of required lighting and infrastructure required for post-mortem, performing night time post-mortem in hospitals is now feasible, the ministry said. The protocol stipulates that post-mortem for organ donation be taken up on priority and be conducted even after sunset at the hospitals which have the infrastructure for conducting such post-mortem on a regular basis. The government further said that fitness and adequacy of infrastructure etc., shall be assessed by the hospital-in-charge to ensure that there is no dilution of evidentiary value. Also, video recording of post-mortem will be done for all post-mortem conducted in the night to rule out any suspicion, and preserved for future reference for legal purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-sunset-autopsy-allowed-to-boost-organ-donation/articleshow/87726481.cms||---

Over the past few days, the party leadership, including Subrata Bakshi, Firhad Hakim and Atin Ghosh, cautioned workers from indulging in anti-party statements. “We shall bring out a list which will reflect our idea of combining youth power with experience,” said a senior leader. Like its assembly election candidates list, octogenarian ward councillors will make way for younger candidates. According to senior leaders, another aspect the party is weighing on is whether sitting MLAs will contest the KMC polls. Led by Hakim, the state transport minister and chairperson of KMC’s Board of Administrators, this list includes BoA members Ghosh, Debasish Kumar and Debabrata Majumdar. While juggling heavyweight candidates, Trinamool is also unlikely to give multiple tickets to candidates from the same family. But what is more important is to bring in the north-south balance in the KMC office-bearers, said senior leaders. “South Kolkata and the added areas have a numerical superiority in the number of wards in the 144-ward KMC. While north and central have 50 wards, south and added areas have 84. Hence there is disproportionate representation in the MMiC demographically,” a leader said. However, one thing is clear — the Trinamool list is likely to see a lot of women and youths as candidates. “Even while renominating candidates, performance will be a key factor,” a leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zero-tolerance-of-indiscipline-over-kmc-ward-nominations-tmc-to-party-workers/articleshow/87724216.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 21 teams to nab motorists flouting pollution rules||KOLKATA: In the last four months, Kolkata Traffic Police has prosecuted 5,918 motorists for failing to comply with the vehicular emission norms — an average of 43 prosecutions per day. Now, as Delhi stares at a pollution-related lockdown, Lalbazar has deployed 21 teams to prosecute motorists who refuse to abide by pollution rules. The decision is a direct fallout of the rising number of pollution cases in the city, clearly noticeable ever since Lalbazar asked traffic guards to begin checking pollution levels in vehicles from July 1. Till then, only the anti-pollution cell was carrying out these checks. “We have asked everyone to pitch in. We want to play our part in keeping the city clean,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. Cops prosecuted 973 people for failing to display a pollution certificate (369) or not having one at all (603). By September, this number went up to 1,501 — 734 people in September could not produce their PUCs while 763 did not have one. In the past four months, 3,328 vehicles were asked to get fresh PUC done within seven days. Of these, 2,746 never bothered to get back to the department for a recheck within the stipulated time, inviting a Rs 1,000 fine under section 116 (6) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. Those without PUC were prosecuted under section 115 (7) of the CMVR. A few prosecutions also took place under section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act — not controlling air and noise pollution — which attracted Rs 2,000 as fine. While 18 of the 25 traffic guards who had begun the tests issued 505 notices, they ultimately prosecuted 114. The anti-pollution cell, on the other hand, served notice to 2,823 motorists and prosecuted 2,632 vehicles. “The focus of the AP cell is only on pollution, unlike the guards. The guards are learning the tricks and the numbers will definitely go up in the next few months,” said an officer. While TOI had reported in July that even guards have been asked to conduct anti-pollution drives, this will be the first time that as many as 21 teams will carry them out. This will include three teams from the anti-pollution cell and 18 from the guards. Sources said BS-III vehicles — mostly yellow taxis and small trucks — are the worst violators. “A few BS-IV and BS-VI vehicles, too, have been served notices,” said an officer. Sources said drivers will now have their smartcards seized at the time of getting notice. “We will release them as soon as the PUC is in order. So far, we were seizing multiple documents. But if we seize important documents, the driver will get the PUC problem rectified sooner,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/21-teams-to-nab-motorists-flouting-pollution-rules/articleshow/87724186.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The 45-day drive will focus on saving electricity by preventing power theft and misuse of feeders. According to the officials, an FIR was lodged against 31 customers of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (PESU) for their involvement in power theft on Day 1 and a penalty of Rs 13.55 lakh collected from the violators. As many as 1,768 buildings and houses were inspected by different teams in Patna at 13 locations, including Ashiana Nagar, Danapur, Khagaul, Dak Bungalow, Patliputra, Gardanibagh, Bankipore, Gulzarbagh, Patna City, Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, and New Capital. Dilip Kumar Singh, the general manager (GM) of the PESU that undertakes power supply work in Patna and some peripheral areas, told this newspaper on Monday that all the transformers and the houses connected to them would be checked during the campaign. “In case of theft, action will be taken against the consumer, FIRs lodged and penalties collected. All the grievances related to bills or faulty meters will also be addressed,” he said. The PESU GM continued, “The aim of the campaign is to ensure that people do not tamper with the meters for stealing electricity.” PESU has nearly 7,200 transformers and 6.5 lakh consumers under its jurisdiction. Singh said, “Almost 7% of the 100-odd houses our team inspects in a day are found to be stealing electricity. Most cases of pilfering are witnessed in eastern Patna that includes Gulzarbagh and Patna City.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/31-booked-on-first-day-of-drive-against-power-theft-in-city/articleshow/87723277.cms||Faryal Rumi

This, in turn, has put smiles on the faces of all the people associated with the hospitality sector and wedding industry who had been struggling to make ends meet amid the pandemic. Hotels, marriage halls, banquets, clubs and grounds in the city are fully booked till next year as many people who cancelled their wedding due to the pandemic, have decided to hold a grand wedding after Kartik Purnima on November 19. The general manager of a five-star hotel near J P roundabout B D Singh told this newspaper that he has no slot left as all the dates have already been booked for November and December. “People have even booked the hall, for April and May next year, in advance,” he said, adding that the hotel will hold at least five ceremonies in a day and hoped that his business will bloom after all the hardship he faced during the pandemic. A Nair, general manager of another hotel at Beerchand Patel Marg said, bookings are almost full for banquet halls, rooms and suites. “We still get lots of queries about the availability of banquet halls,” Nair said. An owner of a hotel at Bailey Road Ziaul Haque claimed that the trend of big-fat wedding is back among the clients. As people say that a wedding is incomplete without ‘band-baja’, they are rushing to make last-minute booking for an orchestra group. The owner of an orchestra band Sanjay Kumar said, the rate has been fixed as per the number of artists and duration. “It costs anywhere between Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 per procession,” Kumar said, adding that the demand has increased as the ‘lagan’ is approaching. Meanwhile, city markets are crowded as the bride and groom are moving from one shop to another in search of best dresses, shoes and accessories. Aniket Singh, owner of a garment shop at Khetan Market said, these days brides are opting printed and embroidered ‘lehenga’ in pastel colours. “Rajwada-style sherwani and collared-kurta with pants are in demand among the grooms,” he said. Another garment shop owner at Raja Bazaar Amit Choudhary has imported all the bridal dresses from Kolkata and Delhi. “I have matching dresses for the bride and groom and even for their parents,” Choudhary said. Not only gold jewellery is in demand but the artificial ones are also selling like hot-cakes. Dharmendra Kumar, a salesman of a shop at Churi Market said, he has a huge range of earrings, gold-plated bangles and necklaces. “There is a lot of craze of imitation jewellery as they offer a wide range to design and pattern,” he said. Besides, beauty parlours are also making a brisk business as both bride and groom want to glam-up for their D-day. The manager of a beauty salon at Frazer Road Soni Singh said that she has to hire more stylists because of the huge number of bookings for pre-bridal and bridal make-up. “I charge extra Rs 3,000 if the groom and bride ask for getting their make-up done at the venue,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-hope-to-revive-business-as-lagan-season-begins/articleshow/87723607.cms||Faryal Rumi

Earlier, on Sunday evening, unidentified criminals looted Rs15 lakh after shooting at a businessman, Dinesh Bhadani, under the Malsalami police station area in Patna City. The injured has been admitted to the PMCH. In Munger, the criminals pumped 4 bullets into the body of 28-year-old Deepika, the wife of CISF jawan Ravi Sharma, when she was going to the washroom in her house under the Kasim Bazar police station area in Munger at around 5am. The CISF jawan is posted at Dhanbad in Jharkhand. Reports reaching the police headquarters said Deepika was living with her mother-in-law Jayanti Devi and two brothers-in-law. Her brother Sanu alleged that Deepika had survived a murderous attack in 2017, three years after her marriage. Kasim Bazar police station SHO Dharmendra Kumar said the reason behind the murder was being ascertained. Meanwhile, two girl students were allegedly raped by a youth at a village under Akbarpur police station area in Nawada on November 8. However, the case was lodged with the police station concerned on Sunday after a video showing the crime went viral on social media. A police officer posted at Akbarpur police station said the accused, stated to be the son of a schoolteacher, called the girls on the pretext of helping them in practical examination and raped them. The accused was absconding. In West Champaran, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped by three youths from the Gaunaha police station area and taken to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh where she was gang-raped for over over a month. The girl was found in an unconscious state behind her house on Sunday. On October 20, the victim’s father had lodged a missing case with the Gaunaha police station. SDPO Kundan Kumar said the victim’s statement would be recorded under Section 164 of CrPC in the court. All the three accused were evading arrest, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-shot-in-munger-trader-robbed-of-rs-3l-in-madhepura/articleshow/87723305.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Kangana’s ‘freedom’ remark should be made fun of: Nitish||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said one should not take notice of what Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut spoke about the country’s freedom. Responding to a media query on Ranaut’s statement after his weekly ‘Janata ke Darbar mein Mukhyamantri’ programme, Nitish said, “Who does not know when the country got freedom? Such statements should not be given any importance. In fact, they should be made fun of. I do not pay attention to such people.” In a recent interview, Ranaut had said India got its freedom in 2014 (when PM Narendra Modi came to power) and what it got in 1947 was a “bheekh”. Asked for his comment on Ranaut’s ‘bheekh’ remark, Nitish replied, “I am surprised how such statements get published? Is there any importance of such things?” Nitish’s JD(U) is an ally of the BJP in Bihar and also at the Centre. The NDA government had recently awarded the Padma Shri to Ranaut. Two days ago, senior JD(U) leader and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha had demanded withdrawal of the Padma Shri given to Ranaut. Asked for his response on the ‘Hinduism is not about hate, Hindutva is’ remark made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Nitish said, “One should ask this question to Rahul Gandhi. Such people have their own method… They want to be in the limelight by saying something.” Without taking names of any opposition leaders, he added, “In Bihar, too, some people speak against me only to get publicity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kanganas-freedom-remark-should-be-made-fun-of-nitish/articleshow/87723253.cms||Madan Kumar

The target is to procure 45 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers across the state till January 31, state cooperative department minister Subhash Singh said. “The selected primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) and vyapar mandals have been asked to procure paddy from farmers at the minimum support price (MSP). The farmers who sell their produce at the procurement centres of the selected agencies will get their money without delay. Instructions have been issued to make all arrangements in this regard,” Singh said. The state has over 8,000 PACS and over 100 vyapar mandals, but only the selected among them have been pressed into paddy procurement. After purchasing paddy from farmers, the two agencies will get it milled at the identified rice mills in the state before delivering the rice to Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation (BSFCSC). The farmers will be paid Rs1,940 per quintal. Each of the ‘ryots’ (land owning farmer) will be able to sell 250 quintals of paddy, and a ‘bataidar’ (sharecropper), 100 quintals. The state cabinet has already given bank guarantee to the BSFCSC to raise Rs5,000 crore from the commercial banks to facilitate the timely payment to the farmers. The money has been made available to the district level central cooperative banks. Incidentally, the paddy procurement was first started on November 1 in the districts of Purnia and Kosi division, followed by the districts of Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran divisions on November 10. The paddy procurement in the districts of the remaining divisions, including Patna, Bhagalpur, Munger and Magadh, started on Monday. Due to the four-phase floods and heavy rain this year, including in October, the paddy harvesting was delayed and only 9,000 tonnes of paddy could be procured in 19 districts till November 14. In Patna district, 80.4 tonnes of paddy were procured from the farmers in 11 blocks, a district administration communique said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paddy-procurement-begins-in-19-south-bihar-districts/articleshow/87723773.cms||Abhay Singh

However, passengers are unable to avail full facilities as yet due to certain glitches in the passenger reservation system (PRS) server. According to ECR chief public relations (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has reverted train fares to pre-Covid period and started updating its PRS database by loading old numbers of the regular trains. All PRS booking counters are being kept shut daily for six hours from 11.30pm to 5.30am to update the database with old train numbers. Railways intends to complete the data feeding work by November 21, he said. Railways will do away with the ‘0’ digit used for special trains to the original numbers after upgrading the PRS system, he said, adding that information related to reservation, cancellation and enquiry will be available to passengers after upgrading the system. According to Railway Board sources, even though old fares have been restored in the regular mail and express passenger trains, railways will not make any refund of the excess fare to those who have already booked their tickets in special passenger trains. Besides, concession to senior citizens and in other different categories will not be given to passengers as per the new guidelines, sources said, adding the Board’s directives have also no clarity on the issue of providing meals, water bottles, bedrolls and other services to the passengers. According to sources, railways has restored 1700 special trains as regular passenger trains from November 14 across the country, including 148 from ECR. The special trains have registered about 113% revenue growth as these trains have been running as ‘special trains’ for the past 15 months across the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-restores-148-regular-trains/articleshow/87723589.cms||Kumod Verma

The comment comes at a time when India has been under pressure globally to reduce dependency on coal-fired power plants and cut emissions. Patra said this in his keynote address in the conference on ‘Growth and development in the BRICS economies’ organised by the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which was released by the RBI on Monday. “Medium-term challenges for the BRICS arise in the context of climate risks and emission commitments, which may engender energy shortages, technology gaps and hence pose risks to medium-term growth and inflation, especially for countries with large total emissions,” said Patra. He added that the immediate challenge was from elevated commodity prices for net importers like India, although they confer terms of trade gains for net exporters like Brazil and Russia. “For all the BRICS, rising food prices on account of natural calamities and demand-supply imbalances caused by the pandemic involve elevated inflation risks,” said Patra. In his address, Patra said capital accumulation is the biggest contributor to India’s growth and a striking feature of Indian investment is that it is financed primarily by domestic savings, with capital flows from abroad playing only a supplemental role. However, the saving rate has started slowing down after the global financial crisis (GFC). Eventually, this pulled down the investment rate from 2012-13. “Reversing this trend is critical to achieving higher growth,” said Patra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/emission-cut-vows-a-risk-to-growth-inflation-rbi/articleshow/87725727.cms||---

Upholding the spirit of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in its recent ruling, the bench said the subcontractor can raise the invoice by charging integrated goods and service tax (IGST) from its office in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. IGST is levied in case of an interstate supply of goods and services. Rulings given by the AAR have a persuasive value. Tax practitioners say that if this ruling is adopted pan-India, it will go a long way in reducing costs — both the cost of registration and other administrative costs for business entities. On the downside, the AAR also held that in the absence of an office in Karnataka, the subcontractor cannot register as an input service distributor. Such registration was required to avail of the input tax credit against goods/services procured from suppliers at the site and distribute such credit onward to its Noida registration. In this case, GEW India, a private limited company that had a unit in Noida and a registered office in Pune (Maharashtra), obtained a work order from Larsen & Toubro to execute a works contract inside a naval base at Karwar in Karnataka. It entailed a composite supply of goods and services, such as installation of a steel structure for harbouring of ships. The steel was fabricated at its Noida unit and installation was on-site. GEW India explained that they are likely to provide accommodation in Karnataka for the resident engineer and others who may visit the work site, but will not have any office or administrative staff. The AAR noted that the applicant company had only one principal place of business — Noida, for which GST registration had been obtained. Thus, there was no requirement for a separate registration in Karnataka for executing its contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-need-to-re-register-for-gst-aar/articleshow/87725724.cms||Lubna Kably

Town planning committee chairman at AMC Devang Dani in said on Monday that the estate department officials have been instructed to remove egg and non-vegetarian food carts from major arterial routes, very specifically from outside schools, colleges, religious places, parks and gardens etc. The diktat applies to both licensed and unlicensed street food vendors. The civic body officials such egg and non-veg food carts can conduct their business on internal roads but ensure it is not visible to those who use the arterial routes for commute. When asked to clarify on the conditions applied to operate from internal roads, Dani said, "All raw materials used for non-veg food preparations should be covered. The fish, poultry and meat should kept covered boxes," said Dani. In another significant decision, the town planning committee said that those persons who have a valid license for selling mutton, will have to do so in a closed enclosure. Moreover, the items being sold at such shops cannot be hung from a hook, he added. “If these rules are not adhered to, shops selling mutton will also be sealed,” the official said. Ahmedabad is fourth city after Rajkot, Vadodara and Bhavnagar municipal corporations have issued oral directives, especially ensuring that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ in the public eye. CM Bhupendra Patel when quizzed about removal of non-veg stalls from roads of major cities said the the decision has been taken by civic bodies like municipalities and municipal corporations. “People can eat vegetarian or non-vegetarian food. The state government has no objection whatsoever in this matter. But civic bodies can remove laaris if they are an obstruction in traffic. And the food sold should be hygienic,” said Patel. Patel said that the issue for the state government is whether food sold from such laaris is hygienic and whether such laarris are an obstruction for traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-bans-sale-of-eggs-non-veg-food-on-main-roads-out-of-sight-out-of-mind/articleshow/87724865.cms||---

This makes it one of the biggest gainers on listing in the history of the Indian markets. Compared to its IPO price of Rs 163 per share, the stock listed at Rs 575 and closed the first day’s session on the bourses at Rs 604 — an appreciation of 253% over its offer price, according to BSE data. The IPO frenzy that’s currently gripping Dalal Street also helped PB Fintech, which operates under the PolicyBazaar brand, to list at a 17% premium to its offer price and close the day with a gain of 5% for its shareholders. Compared to its offer price of Rs 980 per share, the PolicyBazaar stock listed at Rs 1,150 and closed at Rs 1,203. The two blockbuster listings of Monday followed another by online cosmetics retailer FSN E-Commerce Ventures, which operates under the Nykaa brand, last week. The stock, offered at Rs 1,125 per share, was listed at Rs 2,001 — a gain of 77%, which also catapulted its main promoter Falguni Nayar into the league of richest Indians. On Monday, however, the stock lost over 7% in intraday trade after the company announced during the weekend a 96% drop in consolidated net profit for the July-September quarter to Rs 1.2 crore. It ended over 3% down at Rs 2,281 by close of Monday’s trade on the BSE. However, there were some listing disappointments as well on D-Street. On Monday, SJS Enterprises, a decorative aesthetics manufacturer for the automotive and consumer appliances industries, listed at a marginal discount to its offer price of Rs 542 per share. It lost further ground through the session to close at Rs 510, a discount of nearly 6% to the offer price and down 6% on the day, BSE data showed. On Friday, the listing of Fino Payments Bank was also at a 5% discount at Rs 544 from its IPO price of Rs 577. On Monday, the stock — one of the leading payments banks in India — closed over 5% down at Rs 516, a discount of more than 10% to the offer price. The markets are now gearing up for the listing of tech-driven payments solutions pioneer One97 Communications, which operates under the Paytm brand, on Thursday. The company closed its Rs 18,300-crore IPO, the biggest in the country’s history, last week with the issue subscribed 1.9 times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sigachis-listing-gain-one-of-d-sts-biggest/articleshow/87725717.cms||---

Gujarat saw an estimated Rs 582 crore being spent by firms—public and private sector—for CSR activities in 2020-21. Of this, Rs 318 crore or 55% went towards the healthcare sector, shows data available on the National CSR Data Portal, an initiative of the union corporate affairs ministry. In percentage terms, this is the highest share that the sector has received ever since 2014-15, when it was mandatory for companies to spend 2% of their 3-year average net profit for CSR projects. The healthcare sector accounted for 33% and 23% of Gujarat’s total CSR expenditure in 2019-20 and 2018-19, respectively. “The companies changed their CSR priorities in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Since the pandemic started at the cusp of a new financial year, several companies made provisions and created special projects in response to the pandemic,” said Bhomik Shah, founder and CEO, CSRBOX, an Ahmedabad-based CSR research and advisory firm. “The funding which was to go towards education, water projects or any other initiatives was channelized towards battling the pandemic,” said Shah, adding that the trend of healthcare having higher share of the CSR spend is expected to continue partially in 2021-22 because companies have prioritized healthcare in the first half of the current fiscal as well. After the pandemic, the central government added expenditure incurred for fighting against Covid-19 to the list of eligible CSR activities. Companies wholeheartedly made contributions to the relief funds of the prime minister and state chief ministers. Corporate firms took up several initiatives such as distribution of masks, PPE kits, hand sanitizers as well as provided oxygen cylinders, put up oxygen plants and created Covid care facilities. The amount of funds spent towards CSR across Gujarat in 2020-21 is expected to increase further as the current estimate is based on the data reported by 280 companies. The estimate will be updated when more companies submit their figures. More than 1,200 companies spend money every year for CSR in the state, said people operating in CSR space. The ministry data showed that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Limited and Torrent Power Limited spent the maximum amount towards overall CSR activities in the state during fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/healthcare-sectors-share-in-states-csr-spend-jumps-to-55-after-pandemic/articleshow/87724835.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The seized drugs have an estimated international value of Rs 600 crore, DGP Ashish Bhatia told reporters here on Monday. This drug consignment was allegedly sent by a resident of Pakistan, Zahid Bashir Baloch. He is a wanted absconder in the 2019 case in which 227kg of heroin was seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. Acting on an input received by deputy superintendent of police, ATS, K K Patel, a team of the Gujarat ATS led by DSP Bhavesh Rojiya raided an under-construction house belonging to one Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed near the Dargah of Kotawala Pir in Jinjuda village of Maliya-Miyana in Morbi. The heroin was seized after the raid. Patel had received an intelligence input to the effect that one of the accused, Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodiya, and Ghulam Bhagad, residents of Jodia in Jamnagar and Salaya in Devbhoomi-Dwarka respectively, had smuggled in the narcotics through the sea route. According to the input, the two accused were going to meet at night at the house of the third accused, Shamsuddin Husseinmiya Saiyyed alias Pirzada Bapu. Consequently, an ATS team nabbed the accused with the heroin at Saiyyed’s house. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the consignment of heroin was brought by Hussein and Bhagad via the sea route and they had received the delivery from a Pakistani boat. Isa Rav Hussein, brother of Mukhtar Hussein, was in contact with Pakistani-resident Baloch and had exchanged the coordinates for the delivery of the drugs in a mid-sea operation. The drug consignment was delivered in the last week of October and it was initially hidden in the coastal region near Salaya. It was subsequently moved to Saiyyed’s house in Jinjuda village in Morbi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-ats-nabs-3-with-120kg-heroin-worth-rs-600-cr-from-morbi/articleshow/87724782.cms||---

Facilities like ELISA test, blood platelets and separate wards with sufficient number of beds are already available,” Pandey told this newspaper, adding that the number of patients suffering from dengue had declined considerably. The minister further pointed out that in the first week of November, the government had sent a health alert to all the district magistrates, civil surgeons, principals and superintendents of medical colleges and hospitals in the state and asked them to take urgent steps for preventing the spread of dengue. They were requested to undertake necessary steps for sensitization of medical and paramedical staff in government and private hospitals. “The health department has also instructed the officials concerned to organize medical camps in the dengue-affected areas and conduct fogging,” the minister said. The deputy superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Dr Satish Kumar, also admitted that there had been a decline in the number of dengue patients in the last few days. “Now, only four or five people suffering from dengue are admitted in the hospital. Most patients are only visiting the outpatient departments,” he added. In the last two months, dengue had spread its tentacles in different parts of the state. More than 200 patients had officially been admitted to government hospitals and active dengue cases were reported in as many as 24 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-minister-dengue-is-under-control-in-bihar/articleshow/87723532.cms||B K Mishra

The Yadav scion claimed that a series of such meetings had been conducted before and raised questions on their outcome. Interacting with the media before leaving for Siwan to attend the wedding ceremony of former RJD MP Shahabuddin’s daughter, Hera Shahab, Tejashwi alleged, “All the meetings called by the CM are high level ones which are attended by the same set of officials. They are not really review meetings because they are meant to find out the amount of revenue generated by different departments. Those who fail to bring money get transfer threats.” The leader of opposition also lashed at the Nitish government over “lawlessness” in the state. “Incidents of murder, corruption, kidnapping and rape have been occurring regularly under the present government’s regime,” he said, recalling the murder of Vishwajeet Singh, a former district board member from Dhamdaha, the killing of Buddhinath Jha, a journalist, and the gang rape of a woman in Nalanda during Chhath. Tejashwi continued, “The people of the JD (U) and the BJP were involved in the Srijan scam and the Muzaffarpur shelter case.” He also pointed out that it was his duty as the leader of opposition to raise his voice and hold press conferences. “Even Sushil Kumar Modi used to hold pressers, albeit fake ones,” he said. Meanwhile, JD (U) spokesperson, Neeraj Kumar, responded to Tejashwi’s allegations, saying his USP was false propaganda. “As far as review meetings are concerned, Tejashwi had attended some of them when he was the deputy CM. He, however, may not have understood much because of his poor educational background,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-targets-nitish-govt-over-lawlessness-in-state/articleshow/87723295.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Delhi||Delhi: SC refuses to entertain Centre’s plea on ration||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain the Centre’s plea against the Delhi high court order directing the AAP government not to stop or curtail the supply of foodgrains or flour to fair price shops. A bench of Justices L N Rao and B R Gavai said the September 27 order under challenge is interim and the matter is listed before the high court on November 22 and, therefore, it would not like to entertain it. Delhi government assured the apex court that it will put its policy on hold till the high court hearing.  The high court had passed interim order on September 27 allowing the government to stop supplying foodgrains to fair price shops (FPS) for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over the physical collection. It will again take up the case on November 22 for final adjudication on the issue, which has emerged as another flashpoint between the two governments. At the outset of hearing, the bench said that the issue was still being examined by the high court which passed only an interim order and asked the Centre to raise all contentions on validity of the scheme before the high court. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, contended that the issue could have a wider ramification as other states would also bring similar scheme which is in violation of National Food Security Act and pleaded the court to examine it. He said that the Act provides a mode for distribution of foodgrains and a state government could not be allowed to adopt a mode different from what was prescribed in the law and people have to take grains from fair price shops. “Delhi government is taking help of private agency and there will be no accountability. The high court erred in passing the order which virtually allowed the petition,” Mehta said. The bench again pointed out that it would not be proper to hear the case on merit as it was pending before the high court for adjudication. Countering Centre’s arguments, senior advocate A M Singhvi said that everything under the world was being delivered at home and even liquor was being supplied and raised questioned why the Centre was opposing the scheme for home delivery of foodgrains at the doorstep of poor people. He said that the scheme would put to an end diversion and pilferage of foodgrains. The bench then asked Singhvi regarding the present status on implementation of the scheme and he replied that preparation was going on in full swing but distribution had not started. Singhvi, thereafter, assured the court that the scheme will not be made operational till November 22 as the case was scheduled to be heard by the high court. The high court had allowed Delhi government to divert ration delivery to cardholders at doorsteps, provided that it does not cause any shortage in the fair price shops. It had said, “GNCTD shall first issue communication to each fair price shop holders, of particulars of ration cardholders, who opted to receive rations at doorsteps &, only then, ration, to extent that they're being supplied to such optees, needn’t be supplied to fair price shop holders.” The high court had passed interim order on a plea against Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh, which said that their share of ration will be diverted under this policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-refuses-to-entertain-centres-plea-on-ration/articleshow/87725168.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

He also set a target of laying 46,000 kilometres roads in the state, once the rains recede. The chief minister reviewed the state of roads with officials of the roads and buildings department at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday. He wanted officials to take up repairs in municipal corporations and municipalities on priority. He asked officials to complete repairs of all roads in the state by June 2022. The chief minister asked officials to focus on roads with the maximum extent of damage and start repair works, ensuring that the difference is visible after the work. Officials informed that there was a delay in work due to continuous rains and assured they would start repair on a stretch of 8,268 km by the end of this month after finalising tenders. Officials said all repairs would be completed between December and June. The chief minister directed the authorities to cover all bridges and flyovers and make plans to bring ROBs and bridges under Phase 1. He instructed the officials to focus on restoring roads and take pictures before and after repairing the roads, similar to the Nadu-Nedu scheme. He said to concentrate on repairs and maintenance of existing roads before starting the construction of new roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-directs-road-laying-repair-work-across-state/articleshow/87723934.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ‘Capital region farmers gave up land for better future’||VIJAYAWADA: Establishment of a state’s capital is a one-time exercise and cannot be done again and again as and when there is a change of mind on the part of the state government, said senior counsel Shyam Diwan on Monday, while putting forth his arguments on behalf of capital region farmers who gave away their lands for the construction of capital Amaravati. As the AP high court resumed its hearing on the batch of petitions filed against the government’s move to trifurcate the capital, Diwan built his argument outlining the sequence of events — right from bifurcation which eventually necessitated for creation of a new capital for Andhra Pradesh. Even in the State Reorganisation Act, the Parliament spoke about ‘a capital’, Diwan said, adding that though it does not necessarily mean only one capital, but the intention of the Parliament is to create a capital city for the state of AP to compensate the loss that arose after losing Hyderabad to Telangana. It was for this purpose that the Union government constituted an expert committee to identify probable locations for creation of a new capital city and extended financial assistance to the AP government in accordance with the State Reorganisation Act, he said. The expert committee took the opinion of people from across the state, in which 52% voted for Vijayawada-Guntur as the capital city, 10.72% in favour of Visakhapatnam, while 7% voted for Kurnool as capital city. Following the recommendations of the expert committee, the then state government came up with the Amaravati project and land was taken from the farmers under land pooling scheme by making them partners in the project. The farmers of capital region gave away their livelihood in the hope that they will get better opportunities that were promised to them by the state government in the form of fully developed returnable plots in the world-class capital city, argued Diwan. The Amaravati master plan is a statutory document which is still in force and without delivering on the promises made to the farmers, the state government cannot take away the executive and judicial wings away from the capital as they form an integral part of the capital, he argued, adding that the decision to trifurcate the capital is without reason and rationale. Referring to section 93(3) of the State Reorganisation Act, Diwan said the central government gave funds for the development of essential infrastructure like Raj Bhavan, assembly, secretariat, high court, and other facilities in the capital. Though a specific inference was not drawn in the bill about the location of the capital, a place consisting of these three wings which forms the core of governance can only be said as capital city, he added. The Amaravati master plan was prepared after conducting a detailed scientific study to make it the growth engine for the state by creating employment opportunities and attracting investments, Diwan said, adding that the capital vision was put to implementation by grounding phase 1 infrastructure works to the tune of Rs 51,687 crore, out of which Rs 5,674 crore has already been spent and works are at various stages of completion. However, after the change in government in 2019, all works have come to a grinding halt and turned Amaravati into a ghost city, he said. The hearing will continue on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/capital-region-farmers-gave-up-land-for-a-better-future/articleshow/87723963.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh ‘nurses’ European dreams as Covid-19 pushes demand||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses or graduates of nursing in Andhra Pradesh are now looking to capitalise on the existing demand for their profession in European countries. The Andhra Pradesh Non-resident Telugu Society (APNRTS) is putting forth a proposal to provide jobs for nurses from AP in eastern European countries like UK, Germany and France. The state is the second-largest provider of nurses in the country, with 220 colleges and schools from where 4,000 nurses graduate every year. A significant number of nurses are already shifting to countries such as the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, the UK and New Zealand after attaining three to four years of experience. Eastern European countries are now witnessing a high demand for nurses, especially during the pandemic. According to a survey conducted by Jobfeed, the UK has a shortage of nurses at 790 nurses per 100,000 inhabitants. In France, this number is 990 nurses per 100,000 inhabitants, 1,050 for the Netherlands, 1,080 for Belgium and 1,330 for Germany. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a nurse-to-people ratio of at least one nurse per 500 people. “There is a demand for nurses in European countries especially UK. The issue with other European countries is that they would prefer nurses who know the local language, which the state might find difficult to cater to. We are looking at the possibility of tying up with recruiters to provide job opportunities for nurses in the state,” chairman of APNRTS Venkat S Medapati said. In Andhra Pradesh and predominantly across the country, the nursing curriculum mostly focuses on the basics and does not include specialisations. Experts advocate that nursing institutions should upgrade their curriculum and include specialisations to prepare nurses for ward-specific roles. “The average salary for a nurse starting her profession in Andhra Pradesh is around Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 which isn’t great motivation and only a handful make it to big corporate hospitals. If nurses hold specialisations, then international recruitment agencies would take hold of them almost instantly,” Kangisetti Radha, a head nurse at a private hospital in Vijayawada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-nurses-european-dreams-as-covid-pushes-demand/articleshow/87723946.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

From skipping rope, toy car and doll to tennis ball, football, children’s guitar and cricket bat, the children got options to choose their favourite toys. “The programme was launched with the objective to empower the children and bring smiles on their faces with toys after a challenging period in their lives,” said Soumen Mitra, the commissioner of Kolkata Police. The programme was first launched on Sun Yat Sen Street off Lalbazar and the results were so encouraging that within two days, the group extended it to Durga Charan Mitra Street, Girish Park, Topsia, Bagbazar and Tallah Park. “We believe that getting a toy is the right of every child as it facilitates his or her mental development. The programme will be extended to other parts of the city in the coming weeks,” added Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chalo-kheli-brings-cheer-to-children-of-a-lesser-god/articleshow/87724252.cms||---

The family is yet to lodge a formal complaint in this case. The police also spoke to locals who reportedly rescued Saha from the manhole. “We are investigating the case from all angles after initial post-mortem opinion suggested head injuries. It also stated death was due to soil and muck blocking the lungs and respiratory tract of the victim. We are waiting for the final post-mortem report to decide on our next course of action,” said an officer. On Monday, PWD and KMC formed a committee to check for open manholes across the city. They have also decided to spread awareness on the issue, especially in the slums. Maintaining the manholes or ensuring that drains are properly covered is the responsibility of the agency that maintains that particular road, like KMC, KMDA or PWD. PWD submitted a report on Sunday where it admitted that Dum Dum Road is maintained “from the office of the assistant engineer PWD Kolkata North sub-division”. The report said “action will be taken for more vigilance along with KMC’s drainage wing officials so that this type of incident is avoided”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manhole-death-cops-speak-to-kin-pwd-kmc-form-jt-panel/articleshow/87724244.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||No child’s play: What hospitals can do if third wave of Covid-19 strikes||NEW DELHI: Those under the age of 18 constitute nearly 41 per cent of India’s population. Several studies have raised the concern that if a third Covid-19 wave were to happen, it may affect them more. The World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Emergency and Trauma (WHO-CCET) of Southeast Asia has formed a committee of experts to develop a toolkit that can be used by hospitals in India to deal with a potential crisis, in case it occurs. According to the toolkit, published in the Journal of Emergency Surgery, Trauma and Shock, 57 million children might be at risk of getting affected if a third wave hits the country. To treat them, the toolkit suggests, resources to cater to 5.7 million hospital admissions and 2.8 million ICU patients need to be readied. It recommends that hospitals should have well-defined areas before a surge in patient volume in the form of the triage or screening area, paediatric ICUs, high dependency units and step-down wards. “Ideally, all beds should have the capability to deliver oxygen. The use of adult beds may be considered. The beds should be set at the lowest possible height from the floor and electronic controls should be done away with,” suggest the experts. Any patient presenting fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and difficulty breathing, or diarrhoea, skin rash and the presence of a recently confirmed Covid-19 case in the household, should be tested for the infection. A child having an unstable airway or inability to ventilate with rising PCO2 levels with respiratory insufficiency and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, among others, should be considered for ICU admission. The experts involved in the development of the toolkit include doctors from AIIMS, Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Manipal Hospital and Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida, US, among others. The toolkit also stresses on the need to train staff to care for the psychological needs of children admitted to hospital with Covid-19. In certain cases, consultation with a mental health professional may be useful. Dr Arun Gupta, a paediatrician, who is also the president of Delhi Medical Council, said the chances of a third wave were low. However, he stressed on the need to prepare on the lines suggested by the expert committee. “Many hospitals are already doing it,” he added. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre recently told TOI they have commissioned two new ICU floors with an augmented capacity of 28 beds. “The ICUs will be operationalised by July 31 complete with the latest, state-of-the-art ventilators and monitors newly acquired for a possible third wave with special emphasis on paediatric care,” he added. AIIMS Trauma Centre has been designated for Covid-19 treatment. Malhotra said they had procured 40 ventilators with paediatric mode, fibre-optic bronchoscopy, laryngoscope and cardiac monitor with paediatric cuffs, among others, with emphasis on managing children with Covid-19. While it is feared that the third wave might affect children more, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-childs-play-what-hospitals-can-do-if-third-wave-of-covid-19-strikes/articleshow/87725200.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Chandigarh||UT adviser to review IT park general housing scheme next week||Rajinder.Nagarkoti1@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: UT adviser Dharam Pal will review the IT Park general housing scheme next week. He has asked Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) officials to submit a status report of the project, which will be reviewed next week. Recently, the UT urban planning and engineering departments approved the plan to construct 728 flats under the general housing scheme on around 16.6 acres of land in two pockets at IT Park for Rs 643 crore. The CHB also filed an application with the Chandigarh MC seeking fire NoC. CHB officials contacted MC officials on Monday, seeking early issuance of fire NoC for the project. The board has got structure, public health, electrical, town planning and architectural related approvals from the departments. All these points were assessed by the urban planning and engineering departments. The scheme, which was approved by the board of directors of the CHB last December, will have 728 flats. Though the exact prices of flats are yet to be decided, the tentative cost ranges between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 2.75 crore. The project land is part of 123 acres that the CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a protracted legal battle. Former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore had given the go-ahead to its design last July but the project could not take off due to the pandemic. The project report was placed before the board of directors in a meeting held last December and the scheme was given in-principle approval. Sources said that the CHB would develop the project on two plots, measuring 10.51 and 6.43 acres. In all, there will be 728 flats of three categories (4, 3 and 2 BHK) in seven-storey towers. The towers will have two basements with provision for parking of two cars for each flat, in addition to surface parking for visitors. CHB got possession of 123 acres after a residential project, Prideasia, failed to take off. The board decided to launch the scheme after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites in an e-auction a few years ago. Due to high reserve prices, not many developers evinced interest in the auction. The board will develop the scheme on two plots, measuring 10.51 acres and 6.43 acres. High-end flats for government officials of the Chandigarh administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of ‘Makkal Sabhai’ programme in the city on Monday, Balaji said it takes 30 minutes to cover a road stretch which can be crossed in 10 minutes. “The reason is the roads are badly damaged. They are neither re-laid nor repaired,” he said. Noting that city residents have demanded that the roads have to be re-laid, Balaji said work on identifying the roads that need attention was going on. Once the roads are identified, a project estimate would be prepared, he said. “Once we figure out the extent of funds required for setting right the road infrastructure, it will be taken to the chief minister,” he said. Similarly, bad roads in rural areas are also being assessed, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-roads-to-get-a-makeover-min/articleshow/87725165.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This will be Patel’s first visit to Vadodara after being elected as the chief minister.The scale of the programme can be guessed from the fact that a large stage and enclosure has been prepared for the event in the Navlakhi Ground. The event may have been termed as a get together in the Gujarati new year, but it will be on the scale of a general board meeting. Sources in the BJP said that around 10,000 people are expected to gather at the event. Members have already been asked to ensure a healthy turnout from their areas. The party has also prepared 114 food counters at the venue. These will be manned by 700 volunteers. It aims at feeding persons from the gathering within 28 minutes and even set a record. It also aims to waste minimum food. The large gathering’s idea has, however, not gone down well with many. Activist Shwejal Vyas who was booked earlier for violating guidelines said that if the large gathering took place, he plans to register a police complaint later. He has already sent a message to the city police commissioner regarding the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/huge-crowd-expected-at-bjps-sneh-milan/articleshow/87725173.cms||---
---||Goa||Long breaks don’t help, players will never be ready to perform at 100 percent during ISL: Ivan Vukomanovic||Panaji: To explain just why the eight-month break between the end of last season’s Indian Super League (ISL) and the upcoming edition is harmful to the health of Indian football, Kerala Blasters coach Ivan Vukomanovic takes the help of a car. “Imagine,” he says, taking a pause. “You have a car and have been driving for several months. Then you just park the car in the garage and leave it there for six months. When you restart the car, there will be some lamps blinking, some starting problems.” Starting problems are common in the ISL as players remain out of action for a long time. Last season, for example, Kerala’s engagements ended on February 26. By the time they play their next match – in a new season – it will be almost nine months. To overcome the problem of being out of action for such a long time, Kerala started early. They were the first, in August itself, to assemble for pre-season training. “All over the world professional footballers don’t have such a long break between seasons. If you have such a long break every year, every season, very often players at the beginning of ISL or during the league will get injured more and more. “If you look at the big picture, it means players will never be ready to perform 100 percent during the ISL. Our idea was to start early, avoid long break, avoid injuries and get the players in normal shape with many friendlies,” said the Serbian coach who took charge of the team this season. Vukomanovic is “happy and content” with how the pre-season has shaped up. The players, he feels, have improved “physically, technically and tactically.” But this could have possibly been even better, if plans for a pre-season abroad were not scuppered by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The idea was that players and, as a team, you get the chance to get in touch with different foreign teams for friendlies. You play (against them) and measure yourself against teams from certain countries, at a certain level. The players can train as much as they wish but the best is playing friendly games. “We wanted to play against strong teams where the team can see the difference and realise how it works at a higher level in Europe. Unfortunately, it didn’t go through because of the pandemic and subsequent restrictions. But, anyway, I am positively surprised and content with everything here in Goa and Kochi,” said Vukomanovic. While Goa and Kochi helped Vukomanovic iron out his team’s flaws, the same cannot be said about Kolkata. Kerala took part in the Durand Cup, fielded a strong side, but they were not just knocked out at the group stage, their training was also heavily disrupted by the weather. Vukomanovic, though, prefers to look ahead rather than reflect on the difficult nights when he didn’t know whether they could train the next day, whether it would be in the morning or afternoon. “I always say that I don’t like to lose time or discuss things that we cannot control. Despite the weather conditions, which were very cruel, the Durand Cup this season arrived in such an unpleasant moment for everyone. “If you speak from a pre-season perspective, not one team was physically or tactically ready to play and many players were busy with the national team. It was a kind of period where we wanted to go through without any injuries. Certain things we couldn’t control were the conditions and training grounds, and we accepted that as part of our pre-season,” said Vukomanovic. Kerala Blasters open their campaign against last year’s finalists ATK Mohun Bagan on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/long-breaks-dont-help-players-will-never-be-ready-to-perform-at-100-percent-during-isl-ivan-vukomanovic/articleshow/87745165.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Father granted pre-arrest bail in son sexual assault case||MUMBAI: Observing that false implication of a 48-year-old father can’t be ruled out, Bombay high court while granting the man anticipatory bail said that the mother sought to co-relate affection of the father for his son to an alleged incident this year so that she could invoke provisions of Pocso Act. The parents of the 15-year-old boy “divorced” in 2019. “Rather, story narrated in the FIR appears to be unbelievable as there is no plausible explanation coming forth for delayed FIR and about suppression of fact of divorce being given by the applicant [accused man],” the court said. The court said that despite the woman claiming she was supported by three brothers, there is no explanation for the delayed FIR. “The alleged sexual assault on son in 2011, 2016 etc is reported in 2021. Affection of father for son is sought to be co-related to 2021 incident to invoke provisions of Pocso. Allegations are not supported by medical evidence,” the court said. The high court also said that the man’s relationship with another woman, at this stage, cannot be termed as ‘illegal’ as second marriage under religious laws by which the parties are governed is permissible. “But for bald allegation, no evidence is discovered to substantiate the same.  Apart from above, it is required to be noted that in March 2019, applicant [accused man] claimed to have given talaq to the complainant and it is subsequent thereto old issues are cropped up by the complainant for registration of offence,” the court said. It pointed out that despite getting divorced, the man and woman lived together until March 2020. The man, a public servant, moved high court after a special Pocso court rejected his plea for pre-arrest bail in June. The man’s lawyer, Madhukar Dalvi, submitted that the entire contents of the June 2021 FIR were completely cooked up as afterthought, as the man had already given divorce in March, 2019. Dalvi submitted that the FIR contains allegations which are as old as eight years for which there is no convincing explanation. The estranged couple married in 2001 and have two children. The woman, in her complaint, also accused the man of domestic violence, dowry harassment and having an extra marital affair. It was also claimed that in 2011 and 2021, the touched his son inappropriately. The court, however, said, that “it is required to be noted that grown-up children have never complained about alleged incidents to any other person than the complainant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sex-assaulter-father-granted-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/87725206.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||Nagpur company develops country’s first armed drones for the forces||NAGPUR: Private defence manufacturer Economic Explosives Limited (EEL) has developed the first indigenous drones and loitering munition systems. These were showcased before chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who visited the company’s facility here on Monday. EEL has expressed readiness to go ahead with the project and offer it to the armed forces in the coming months. The systems are billed to be better suited to the terrain along all Indian frontiers. EEL has said its product costs would also be substantially lesser than what is being imported by the armed forces at present. The Army at present has similar systems from Israel and Polish sources, independent sources told TOI. Apart from the drones, the company has also developed anti-drone missiles, which can fire a salvo and take on a swarm of drones well before it can strike. User trials are planned in the coming months for different versions of the drone as well as the anti-drone systems, said sources. EEL is a fully owned subsidiary of Solar Industries Limited (SIL) — headed by businessman Satyanarayan Nuwal. A press release by the company said a loitering ammunition is also known as a suicide drone. The munition loiters over a given area and swoops down to strike when the target is located. India has so far been dependent on importing these systems. Solar Group will be the first indigenous company to develop it in-house. The company as developed three versions weighing 1.5kg, 4kg and 10kg, with range of 15, 25 and 100km respectively. During the demonstration, a source explained the drones have a fully indigenous computer system, which can spot a target and capture images. Based on it, the control crew can launch an attack. Two fixed winged planes and a hexacopter have been developed. The first round of user trials are expected to be held in January this year for one of the drones. After that, the drones with the capacity of carrying relatively higher payload would be tested. The systems can be used against enemy personnel as well as assets like bunkers or ammunition dumps. The EEL release said it has developed the anti-drone system, which is capable of soft kill, which means impairment of its system, and also striking it down using micro missiles. This is also the first of its kind in India, said sources. EEL had recently bagged an order to make multimodal hand grenades for the Army. Rawat had come to Nagpur for a visit to the Headquarters Maintenance Command of the Indian Air Force (IAF).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-company-develops-countrys-first-armed-drones-for-the-forces/articleshow/87725217.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Drastic jump in poaching of tigers in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The seizure of one more tiger skin and various other body parts from the Gondpipri forest range under Central Chanda Division on Sunday night just shows the drastic jump in poaching of tigers in Maharashtra. The state has recorded 35 tiger deaths, with half (17) of the deaths due to poaching, in the last 10 months. A comparison of the figures of last five years from the database by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), which works with local communities and government agencies to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade across the country, reveals that Maharashtra tops in tiger poaching over the two top tiger bearing states — Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. In 2021, even as MP recorded 39 tiger deaths, including 11 by poaching, Maharashtra tops the chart with poaching of 17 tigers followed by Karnataka, where 17 tigers have died including 4 by poaching. Even in the case of leopards, Maharashtra is on top. Since January 1, 2021, 165 leopards have died. This includes 24 due to poaching and 141 due to other reasons. As per the forest department, 153 leopards have died in the last 10 months in the state. Of this, 61 died in road hits. As per the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018, Maharashtra has 312 tigers. Even as tiger numbers have increased from 190 in 2014 to 312 now, poaching too has gone up. A comparison of the figures of last five years shows in 2017, 22 tiger deaths were reported with 7 poaching cases. In 2021, 35 tigers have died. The poaching and seizure cases have more than doubled to 17. The state forest department figures till November 12, 2021, reveal that 26 tigers have died this year including 8 by poaching. However, the figures don’t include the seizure of body parts since July this year, wherein 58 accused with tiger body parts and bones were arrested by the Nagpur forest division officials. “The seizure involves killing of at least 7 tigers from the region. All the 58 accused have been remanded to magisterial custody (MCR) and investigations are still on,” senior forest officials told TOI. If this figure of 7 tigers is added to the state figure of 26, then the number of tiger deaths comes close to the WPSI database. Nitin Desai, Central India director of WPSI, says, “The way the tiger skin seized in Gondpipri has been skinned, it appears to be a handiwork of local poachers. Organized tiger poaching was effectively stopped due to widespread enforcement actions in 2013.” “This led to a boom in tiger population in Central India. Apart from their historic ranges, tigers are appearing at unbelievable places. They often get killed in electric traps or wire snares set up by local poachers to kill herbivores for bushmeat. It is exactly for this reason that all local poachers must be dealt with strongly or we will keep counting such dead tigers,” Desai said. “A quick look at the statistics reveals that there is a drastic increase in cases of local tiger poaching/seizure of tiger parts in 2021 as compared to the previous four years. It needs to be investigated if local poachers were desperate for money and tried to sell tiger parts, or they were being instigated by someone to do so,” he adds. “Similarly, leopard mortality has gone up drastically in the last three years. The committee on leopard deaths has made some recommendations and the same is being implemented. Only time will tell if they yield any positive result,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drastic-jump-in-poaching-of-tigers-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87725105.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

On November 12, the Bombay high court gave the petrol pump owners in Nashik a week’s time to answer to the show-cause notices issued by the police commissioner. Pandey had issued show-cause notices to three petrol pumps in Panchavati when they were found violating the ‘no helmet, no petrol rule’ at the petrol pumps from August 15. The court has also ordered the police commissioner to pass a speaking order within a week’s time after the hearing of the petrol pump owners. The HC has further stated that no coercive action will be taken against the petrol pump owners for one week from the date of order passed by the police commissioner. Pandey confirmed the orders issued by the court In case the owners are aggrieved by the order, they can approach the appropriate authority or court. Senior office bearers of the petrol dealers’ association told TOI that they would soon be going to the police commissioner to respond to the notices. Ahead of the implementation of the ‘no helmet, no petrol’ rule, Pandey had issued the order for the same and had also held a meeting with petrol pump owners. After the rule was implemented, the police had found that three petrol pump owners were selling fuel even to bikers not wearing helmets. The police had issued them show-cause notices asking why the no objection certificates (NoCs) issued to them by the police should not be cancelled. The petrol dealers association had moved the high court for its intervention into the matter. On November 12, the court gave the association a week’s time to answer to the show-cause notices. Pandey said. “The police want all petrol pump owners in the city to adhere to the no helmet, no petrol rule.” Members of the association of petrol dealers, on the condition of anonymity, said they all were bound to follow all rules, but there were certain difficulties in following the orders like not letting bikers without helmets enter the premises, getting the form filled about why a biker is not wearing the helmet, etc for which they had approached the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hc-sets-deadline-for-nashik-petrol-pump-dealers-to-respond-to-show-cause-notices/articleshow/87722827.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The agriculture department has ordered 3.43 lakh tree saplings for Coimbatore under a scheme called Tamil Nadu Mission on Sustainable Green Cover in Farm Lands. While distribution of tree saplings will start in a week, officials are planning to finish it in a month as conditions are conducive for plantation with the state receiving heavy rainfall recently. The main aim of the scheme is not only to increase the tree cover of the state but also the income of farmers. R Chithra Devi, joint director of agriculture, Coimbatore district, said the agriculture department has placed the orders for the saplings with the forest department. “Farmers have to register through the Uzhavan app and can receive the saplings from the designated nurseries free of cost. Small and micro farmers, women farmers and farmers from scheduled caste and scheduled tribe will be given preference,” she said. Timber value species like teak, red sandal, acacia, vengai, sandal, manjal kadambu, rosewood, malai vembu (Melia dubia), mahagony, karumaruthu, poovarasu as well as medicinal value trees such as neem, pungan, tamarind, maruthamaram, thandrikkai, thoobamaram, Indian gooseberry, murungal maram, chinnamon, manila tamarind and vilvam will be distributed. Agriculture officials said farmers will receive Rs 7 per tree for each year as incentives for three years between the second and the fourth year. Farmers will get 50 saplings for one acre if they plant them in bunds, whereas those farmers who want to take up tree cultivation in farm fields will get 160 saplings per acre. An official said Coimbatore city has better tree cover among the top five big cities in the state according to a survey conducted last year. When it comes to forest area Coimbatore district stands second with 1,975 sqkm preceded only by Erode district with 2,307sqkm. The official said in the phase one, 73 lakh saplings will be distributed to farmers across the state at a cost of Rs 28.57 crore and during the phase two, 112 lakh saplings will be distributed at a cost ofRs 43.84 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/agri-dept-launches-drive-to-make-farmers-plant-trees/articleshow/87725210.cms||V Devanathan

According to the data of the city police, by the end of September this year, the police had registered 327 cases of vehicle theft. It comes to more than one vehicle getting stolen from the city every day. By August-end, the police had registered 269 vehicle thefts, which means that during September, 58 vehicles were stolen from the city. Even on Sunday, three vehicles were stolen from different parts of the city and the day before that, four vehicles were stolen at different police stations. Meanwhile, of the total 327 vehicles that were reported stolen, only 44 have been detected this year, resulting in the detection rate of 13%. Senior police officials said that detecting vehicle thefts becomes a challenge as the burglar has not been seen by anyone. Vehicle thieves commit the crime easily as they find them parked unguarded all over the city. Nonetheless, the police are always working to get information about vehicle thieves so that they can be traced and arrested. Vehicle thieves generally steal bikes and sell them off at cheap prices in the rural areas. When the buyers ask for documents, the burglars tell them that they would take the remaining amount of the deal after bringing the documents. However, on selling the bikes on the part payment of the deal, the burglars never return to the buyers since they do not have the documents of the stolen vehicles. ACP (Crime) Vasant More said, “The police are continuously putting in sincere efforts to detect all cases, including those of vehicle thefts. Citizens on their part should also ensure that they park their vehicles in secure places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/327-vehicles-stolen-in-nashik-till-september-end-this-year/articleshow/87722846.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: First of 2 board exams for CBSE Class 12 from today||MUMBAI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will hold its first of two board exams from Tuesday for class XII students for ‘minor’ subjects. CBSE schools successfully did a dry run on Monday. Class X students begin their exam Wednesday. School heads said no complaints were received from centres during Monday’s dry run. This academic year CBSE decided to have two board exams. The 90-minute objective-type question papers will be answered on OMR sheets — each question has multiple choices; the right answer has to be marked. The exam will cover 50% of the syllabus. The second board exam will be in March-April in offline or online mode, depending on the Covid situation. During Monday’s dry run, schools printed dummy question papers. Students were allotted exam centres. Each class will have 12 students. Question papers will be given to students at 11am and they will get 20 minutes to read it. At 11.20am, the OMR sheets will be distributed to students. Question papers will reach centres via email by 9.30am. Schools did a trial to know how many copies of the question paper can be printed before it is handed over to students at 11am. Students too have undergone practice sessions on using the OMR sheets for the first time. “The OMR sheets have been designed to avoid malpractices by students and teachers too,” said a principal. A student, after circling one of the four answer choices (a,b,c,d), has to write the circled alphabet in another box. The alphabet written in the box will be treated as the answer to be assessed. In case a student does not attempt a question, that too needs to be mentioned in the box provided for that. “This way, even the examiner will not be able to manipulate answers,” explained a principal. Five sets of a question paper will be given in each class to avoid malpractice by way of sign language, said a principal. Invigilators and students must wear masks. Each centre will have an external observer. Differently abled pupils will get 20 minutes extra after the exam ends at 1 pm for others. Schools must upload OMR sheets by 5 pm the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-first-of-2-board-exams-for-cbse-class-12-from-today/articleshow/87725221.cms||Sandhya Nair

A five-member delegation of the state IMA unit visited Ahmednagar on Monday and met the doctors and nurses of the civil hospital, officials involved in the investigation and the lawyers of the arrested doctors and nurses. Talking to TOI, Dr Mangesh Pate, member of the team and national secretary of IMA Hospital Board of India (HBI), said that there is great anguish among members of IMA following the arrest of the doctor and the nurses. “If the authorities do not take measures for the release of those arrested, then IMA would be forced to start a strike. We want justice for the arrested doctor and the nurses,” said Pate. He added that the IMA is pained by the deaths of the 11 Covid patients. “We are also anguished by the manner in which the doctor and the nurses were made soft targets in the incident. Our feedback is that the medical fraternity of the civil hospital and the para medical staff did everything to save the lives of those admitted in the ICU and also helped in preventing the spread of the fire. Had the medical oxygen tank at the hospital caught fire, the consequences would have been more disastrous,” added Pate. In the meantime, the doctors and nurses of the civil hospital are continuing with their agitation due to which the OPD services remain affected. They are rendering emergency services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/release-arrested-doc-nurses-of-ahmednagar-civil-hosp-ima/articleshow/87722848.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Bard of Chhatrapati Shivaji bows out, leaves his mark on Maratha history||Pune: Babasaheb Purandare lived for and breathed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His 10-volume Shivcharitra Raja ShivChhatrapati, thousands of lectures, and the epic play ‘Jaanta Raja’ not only took the illustrious life and battles of the Maratha king to every household in Maharashtra and beyond, but also embedded the mighty warrior’s memory further in the conscience of the people. Purandare, an eminent history scholar, died at 5.07 am on Monday in a Pune hospital of age-related pneumonia. He was 99. His last rites were performed with state honours. For seven decades, Purandare was a ‘Shivshahir’ or bard of Shivaji Maharaj. He trekked to hundreds of forts the Maratha king had conquered, visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji and meticulously preserved every little piece with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent story-teller and narrator, an author, playwright and novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to common citizens in easy-to-understand but vivid language and did not lose sight of the fact that historical research was a science. Renowned humorist P L Deshpande captured the essence of Purandare's commitment to his passion in his pen sketch in the book ‘Gangoat.’ Deshpande appreciated Purandare's command over details which ensured history did not get disconnected from the present. “He reads literature with equal interest. He can watch a Hindi film, listen to Radio Ceylon, attend classical music concerts and knows the score of a cricket match. While trekking to forts he takes equal interest in the birds that nest there or flowers that bloom,” Deshpande wrote. Purandare was so immersed in the life of Shivaji Maharaj that he could almost see events from the king’s life unfold while commuting on Pune’s roads. Deshpande recalled one such instance. He wrote, “We were travelling in a car on the road below the Nava Pul and going towards Sambhaji Park. When we passed the Rokdoba temple near Congress Bhavan, Babasaheb told me to stop. ‘See that spot? Shivaji Maharaj's horses had waited there for him. It was April 6, 1663. Maharaj had severed the fingers of Shahiste Khan at Lal Mahal and escaped. He came straight here, took his horse and rode to Sinhagad’,” wrote Deshpande, adding that one had to be prepared to get delayed while travelling with Purandare as he often ended up narrating exciting episodes from the life of the king.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bard-of-chhatrapati-shivaji-bows-out-leaves-his-mark-on-maratha-history/articleshow/87725233.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Delhi||Delhi safe unless there’s new Covid-19 strain: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that unless there was a new strain of novel coronavirus heading towards the city, Delhi appeared to be safe. After European Union ambassador Ugo Astuto called on the chief minister and discussed the handling of Covid-19 in Delhi and the prevailing pollution situation, the government said in a statement that Kejriwal told Astuto that several serological surveys had been conducted in the national capital and the latest survey revealed great results. “We have found out that 96 per cent of the people of Delhi have developed antibodies to fight the existing strains of Covid-19. So, at a layman level, unless there’s a new strain of the coronavirus heading towards us, Delhi appears to be safe,” Kejriwal said. “This also means that of this 96 per cent, there would have been quite a few people who would’ve caught the virus, but were not consciously aware of it because of its mild or asymptomatic nature,” he added. The chief minister also told the ambassador that the Delhi government was constantly monitoring the cases as well as the trends of Covid-19 and keeping an eye out for any situation where the graphs might seem to increase. “We have been actively working upon our vaccination programme as well. The seriousness that we’ve shown to raise awareness and vaccinate our population has contributed significantly in keeping Covid-19 at bay,” he said, adding that about 50 per cent of Delhi’s eligible population had been fully vaccinated and about 90 per cent had received at least one dose. According to the statement, the chief minister was keen to understand Europe’s experience with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases and asked the ambassador for his inputs in protecting Delhi from a similar scenario. The ambassador replied that it largely depended on the rate of vaccination and ideally it should be easier to handle when most of the population had taken the jab, the statement added. Kejriwal also apprised the ambassador of the Delhi government’s efforts towards controlling pollution throughout the year. He said about 5,000 to 6,000 industrial units of Delhi were made to switch to green fuel in the form of PNG. “We have tied up with IIT-Kanpur to develop a real-time pollution identification mechanism that will help us know what source is causing pollution at what point of time, so we can take immediate action over that information and put curbs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-safe-unless-theres-new-corona-strain-cm/articleshow/87725228.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Void in history and culture after Babasaheb Purandare, says PM Narendra Modi||PUNE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi led people from all walks of life in paying a wealth of tribute to eminent history scholar Babasaheb Purandare who passed away on Monday in Pune of old age. “I am pained beyond words. The demise of Shivshahir Babasaheb Purandare leaves a major void in the world of history and culture,” the Prime Minister said in his tweet. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “A constant adoration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj has remained the source of energy for Babasaheb. No other worshipper of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj like Babasaheb Purandare could be found in the globe. He tried to reach each and every place, where Maharaj had gone. Creating true followers of Maharaj in each household was the mission of Babasaheb.” Veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar said, “I am really shocked by the news of Shivbhakt Babasaheb Purandare’s demise. He took the remarkable works of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to household through his writings of ‘Shivcharitra’. ” Purandare was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital for old age-related pneumonia and was undergoing aggressive treatment, treating doctors said. He is survived by two sons, a daughter and grandchildren. The mortal remains were kept at his house in Parvati areas for people to pay their respects. The last rites were performed at Vaikuntha crematorium with full state honours. Hundreds of followers, including the who’s who of the cultural, social, political and other fields, were present at crematorium. Moreshwar Balwant alias Babasaheb was born on July 29, 1922 at Saswad near Pune. He was passionate about studying and writing on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from childhood. His early writings were complied in the form a book, called ‘Thinagya’ (Sparks). He was honoured with the state’s highest civilian honour, ‘Maharashtra Bhushan’ in 2015, and is a recipient of the country’s second highest civilian award Padma Vibhushan in 2019. Popularly known as ‘Shivshahir’ (bard of Shivaji), Purandare has delivered more than 12,000 lectures on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his valour in the last eight decades. He was seen as an expert and an authority on the history of the Maratha empire, forts built by its warriors, battles fought and works of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He penned and directed the grand historical play Janata Raja in 1985 based on the life and times of his idol. It is a theatrical performance with over 200 artistes, horses and camels and dazzling sets. It has been translated and enacted in different languages. The shows were conducted in India and abroad. Among his scholarly works are Raja Shivchhatrapati, Janata Raja, Maharaj, Shelarkhind, Gadkot Kille, Agra, Lal Mahal, Purandar, Rajgad, Panhalgad, Sinhagad, Pratapgad, Purandaryanchi Daulat, Mujaryache Mankari, Fulwanti, Savitri and Kalawantinicha Sajja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/void-in-history-culture-after-purandare-says-pm/articleshow/87724310.cms||Umesh Isalkar

DDA is set to launch a new scheme next month and on offer will be around 15,000 flats, according to officials. “Although this scheme will not have new flats, applicants will be able to buy flats at rates going back to even 2014,” an official said, adding that the decision had been taken keeping in view Covid-19. The proposal to launch the scheme was to be brought before the authority in its meeting, which was to be chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, but it has been postponed, sources said. In 2014, DDA offered around 25,000 flats, with prices ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore. The price range remained similar in 2017 for 12,000 flats. The next housing scheme in 2019 saw the price ranging between more than Rs 10 lakh for one-bedroom flats in Narela and Rs 1.7 crore for a three-bedroom flat in Vasant Kunj. However, out of the more than 8,400 allotted flats, around 3,000, mostly one-bedroom ones in Narela, were surrendered in a month. The last housing scheme DDA launched was on January 2, 2021 and saw 22,752 applications for the 1,354 flats on offer. The draw of lots was held on March 10 for the 253 mostly three-bedroom flats, 757 two-bedroom, 52 one-bedroom and 291 EWS/Janta flats in areas like Dwarka, Jasola, Vasant Kunj etc. Sources said the new scheme would offer flats in Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Jasola, Narela etc. The bulk of the flats will be one-bedroom or those for the EWS category in Narela, they added. A large number of DDA flats are in different stages of construction, including premium three-bedroom flats and penthouses in Dwarka, but they won’t be offered this time. DDA wants to offer these flats only after the real estate sector witnesses better growth in the near future, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddas-new-housing-scheme-will-offer-flats-at-old-rates/articleshow/87725243.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Pune||Lack of info on availability of guides: PhD candidates||PUNE: Candidates desirous of pursuing doctorate degrees from the Savitribai Phule Pune University have blamed lack of information on availability of PhD guides for various departments for delay in their admission to doctoral programmes. The university recently introduced revised guidelines for admission to PhD courses and based on these, the requirement for PhD guides has also changed. The entrance test for admission to doctoral programmes was conducted recently and results announced, but students are still awaiting allotment of PhD guides. A candidate, who cleared the entrance, said, “Department representatives have still not provided the data regarding the number of guides required under various categories to the admission cell of the university. This has led to delay in admissions and students are suffering due to it.” The entrance exam for PhD programmes was conducted in September for all the departments of Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune division, and also for the research units at its affiliated institutions in Ahmednagar and Nashik. Subsequently, the results were also declared. However, the university has so far not compiled information regarding the guides, claimed PhD aspirants. Prafulla Pawar, registrar, Savitribai Phule Pune University, said, “The university has set up a committee to find a balance between the number of students who have cleared the PhD entrance examination and the available guides. The committee will study the revised guidelines for PhD admission and study the number of reserved category students clearing the exam to strike a balance.” The University Grants Commission has already issued guidelines regarding PhD admissions and the committee will follow the norms. The state higher and technical education department has sought a proposal from the Savitribai Phule Pune University regarding new aspirants who are willing to be guides to PhD students. This will ease pressure on existing guides and give students a chance to select the perfect guide for their thesis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lack-of-info-on-availability-of-guides-phd-candidates/articleshow/87724320.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The activity, which had evoked good public response in past, was halted due to the pandemic more than one-and-a-half years ago. On Monday, historian Dulari Qureshi said Covid-appropriate behaviour was mandatory for those participating in the proposed heritage walk. “The heritage walks conducted so far have covered different monuments and historically important locations in and around Aurangabad. We are glad to resume the initiative, which is spreading awareness on city’s heritage. This, in turn, can be helpful in conservation efforts,” she said. Qureshi said the Daulatabad fort is more popularly known as the ‘invincible fort’ due to its powerful defence techniques. “Historically the fort was founded by the Yadava dynasty’s Bhillama V, in 1187. The fort was later conquered and ruled by different dynasties. Geographically, the fort is very strategic and tactical,” she said. The upcoming heritage walk will start at 8 am and all participants are required to assemble near the ticket counter of the Daultabad fort. Participants need to carry drinking water and food with them. Organisers, including Rafat Qureshi, Aniket Joshi, Swapnil Joshi, Sanket Kulkarni, Aditya Waghmare, Latif Sheikh, Shrikant Umrikar, Kamaji Dak, Kiran Vangujar and Sanjay Paikrao have invited all heritage lovers to join the walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/heritage-walk-to-resume-to-cover-daulatabad-fort/articleshow/87723597.cms||---

The revenue of the civic body through property and water taxes has already been affected due to the pandemic, and inadequate workforce is adding to the problem,” Kulkarni said. “The recruitment of temporary staff will help the NMC increase the property and water tax collection to some extent and the pressure on the existing manpower will also reduce. From sanitation workers to engineers all will be recruited on honorarium basis,” he added. Over 2,000 posts are vacant in various departments of the NMC and around 40 employees and officials are getting retired every month. “Hence, existing staff is under tremendous pressure and it is affecting their health,” he said. “The NMC could not recruit on vacant posts earlier as administrative cost was over 35%. Hence, the civic body is mulling to recruit temporary manpower on honorarium basis,” he added. The fire brigade department is also facing a severe workforce crunch. According to the fire department, the NMC has 151 government-approved posts of firemen, of which, 58 are vacant. Moreover, the civic body has 15 government-approved posts of fire officers of which 11 are vacant. The situation is similar to the other departments of the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-hire-500-temporary-staff-on-honorarium-basis/articleshow/87722869.cms||Tushar Pawar

They can also earn minor degrees in other branches by getting 18 credits in them. This was decided in a recent academic council meeting of Anna University. “If students get high grades till fourth semester in BE, BTech programmes, they will be allowed to select specialised courses in ME or MTech degree programmes. If they clear six specialised courses in a related field or get 18 extra credits, they will be awarded with honours degree,” Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj told TOI. If a mechanical engineering student or civil engineering student completes six courses in artificial intelligence or machine learning, he or she will get a BE mechanical engineering degree with a minor in artificial intelligence or machine learning, he added. The university is also thinking about implementing it for the second year students after making necessary changes in the regulations. As per the 2021 regulations of Anna University, a student needs to secure a minimum 160 credits to get BE or BTech degree. Colleges welcomed the move saying it would increase placement opportunities. B Chidambararajan, principal of SRM Valliammai Engineering College, said, companies are expecting interdisciplinary skills among students with the emergence of newer technologies such as IoT. “In the present trend, a mechanical student should know about programming to improve his chances to get placement. So, interdisciplinary courses are the need of the hour and it is a welcome move by the university,” he said. P Deiva Sundari, principal of KCG College of Technology, said, the move to introduce interdisciplinary degree (minor degree) will improve admissions in core engineering branches. “An honours degree will encourage students to specialise in any particular area in their relevant field. For example, a computer science degree student can specialise in full stag or data science,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/clear-six-addl-courses-get-honours-in-engg/articleshow/87725238.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Declare Panje wetland as ‘bird sanctuary’: Bombay HC issues notice||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday issued a notice to the Maharashtra coastal zone management, national and state wildlife boards and others on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed to declare Panje as a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Act. The PIL filed by environmental NGOVanashakti and its Project director Stalin Dayanand, argued by advocate Zaman Ali, sought directions from the high court to declare “Panje-Dongri Wetlands” as a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 “on account of a scientifically conclusive fact that Panje wetlands is a unique bird habitat that supports a quarter of a million birds that belong to more than a hundred distinct migratory species and provides important ecosystem services, as recommended by internationally renowned scientific organisations...” The PIL said, “If Panje-Dongri wetlands are not protected, migratory birds will pose an extreme high-security risk to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport.”s The PIL also made the central government, through the ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, additional principal chief conservator of forests as parties. The PIL said that in 2015 Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) recorded more than one lakh birds in the winter at Panje wetlands and in 2019 an expert study suggested that wetlands of Panje be declared a bird sanctuary too due to its unique bird habitat. In February, the NGO said it wrote to the secretary of forest department to make a declaration saying Panje-Dongri wetlands holds intrinsic ecological value for Uran and acts as an important bird habitat as it’s a roosting site for more than 100 migratory bird species and a habitat for protected species. The matter is slated to be heard on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/panje-wetland-as-bird-sanctuary-bombay-hc-issues-notice/articleshow/87725265.cms||Swati Deshpande

AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said the Rajasthan unit would be launched within two months and it would contest the next assembly polls. The state will have assembly polls on its 200 seats in November-December 2023. AIMIM, which was confined to the Old City of Hyderabad and Telangana for decades, has been striving to expand its base in the country for the past few years and has tasted some success too. In addition to having seven MLAs and an MP from Telangana, AIMIM has opened its account in assembly polls in Maharashtra and Bihar. It won an MP seat too from Aurangabad, five MLA seats in Bihar and a number of seats in the urban local bodies of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh besides Telangana. Though it failed to open its account in the recent elections to Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the Owaisi-led party is eyeing state assemblies in UP, Gujarat, MP and Karnataka. Owaisi, during his day-long visit to Jaipur, told reporters, “We hope to receive support from across the state. Rajasthan is subjected to loot and misgovernance by both Congress and the BJP, which has created scope for a third force.” Raising the issue of ‘mistreatment’ of Muslims in Rajasthan, he said, “The ruling Congress has stopped all communication with Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of the voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying core issues concerning them.” Criticising Congress Muslim MLAs in the state, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, these legislators are mere ‘showpieces.’ “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” said the AIMIM chief. This is the second visit of Owaisi to Jaipur in the past 50 days, during which he is attempting to grab some space in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of the voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party will contest but has hinted that it will cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 seats where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-foray-mim-takes-another-step-towards-going-national/articleshow/87728349.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Opposition targets govt over CAG’s queries on KIIFB anomalies||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the initial audit conducted by comptroller and auditor general (CAG) on KIIFB, it had pointed out several anomalies in the appointment of staff and on the disbursement of their salaries. However, these were not made part of CAG’s final report based on clarifications given by the government in the exit interview, it is learnt. The Congress-led opposition alleged that the state government had hidden this “special report” of CAG against KIIFB from the public. “The state government should clarify why this report was not made public till date. There are serious allegations against KIIFB in this audit report,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. “Besides the report tabled in the assembly, this special report was handed over to the government at the same time. But it was kept as a secret and now it has come out through Right to Information Act. It has listed out all the backdoor appointments being made there and unnecessary expenses being done at KIIFB,” said Satheesan. The government should conduct a detailed probe into the allegations reported in the audit report since the fund mobilized by KIIFB is public money from the motor vehicle tax and fuel cess, he said. CAG, in its initial audit, had raised several queries which included the non-recovery of Rs 31.86 crore, expenses incurred for pravasi chitty, from KSFE. It said KIIFB expended Rs 18.56 crore towards the development of software and technological components for the pravasi chitty and Rs 13.3 crore in connection with the various programmes arranged for its publicity. Due to this, Rs 31.86 crore spent by KIIFB for pravasi chitty remained unrecovered. It had also raised lack of transparency in the appointment of chief project examiner in KIIFB. Violation of government guidelines in contractual appointments, leading to non-adherence to reservation norms, was also raised by CAG in the preliminary audit. It had said that the creation and appointment of posts in KIIFB are without government approval or orders. Enhancing the pay of the official after appointing for a consolidated pay is in violation of the conditions prescribed in the recruitment order, it added. It further said that appointments were made to non-existent posts on the pretext of a recruitment procedure to one existing post and another non-existing post to accommodate certain persons. Irregular payment of allowances and other benefits to employees, including stipends to internees, were found without government approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-targets-govt-over-cags-queries-on-kiifb-anomalies/articleshow/87724358.cms||---

All of them were later released on bail. Police have so far booked 14,673 people in connection with the November 12 rally by Raza Academy to protest alleged atrocities against Muslims in Tripura and the violence that erupted the following day during the bandh called by BJP and other organizations. Sources said Raza Academy had not sought permission to take out the protest march to the collectorate on November 12. While 8,364 people have been booked and nine of them arrested for the violence caused during Raza Academy's march, police have booked 6,309 and arrested 53 of them for causing damage to government and private property during the retaliatory bandh on November 13. A press release by police commissionerate said nine cops, including an officer, were injured in stone-pelting by purported members of the BJP and other organizations. The release said squads have been formed to arrest those booked. Dr Bonde, who was detained at Nandgaon Khandeshwar on Sunday and released later, was arrested from his residence on Monday morning, while other BJP leaders including Chaudhary, Gawande, Kulkarni, AMC House leader Tushar Bharatiya, AMC’s former standing committee chairperson Radha Kuril, corporators Surekha Lungare and Ajay Samdekar, ex-corporator Sanjay Agrawal, party office-bearers Gajanan Deshmukh and Mangesh Khode, VHP’s Santosh Gaharwar and Nilesh Marodkar surrendered before the police in the day. Though police were also on the lookout of MLC Pravin Pote, he has reportedly escaped to Mumbai, it is learnt. Police said property worth Rs 5.15 lakh was damaged during the violence on November 12. Meanwhile, curfew was relaxed for two hours between 2pm and 4pm on Monday, but citizens could not avail of this relaxation as no attempt was made by the administration to convey this to them. Internet services continued to be snapped for the second day on Monday. Amravati CP Aarti Singh told TOI that the situation was being reviewed and final call on the curfew would be taken only after instructions from the home ministry. According to police, on November 12, Raza Academy and several other Muslim organizations in Amravati had submitted a memorandum to the collector against violence in Tripura last month. BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal and other right-wing organizations had called for a bandh the next day and gathered at Rajkamal Chowk for the protest. Later, a mob went on a rampage in nearby Muslim-dominated areas like Itwara Bazaar and Namuna, pelting stones on shops and damaging properties. Following this, police had resorted to lathi-charge and firing teargas shells to disperse the protesters. Later, the police had imposed Section 144 in the city for four days. Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said in Mumbai he will visit violence-hit Amaravati on November 17. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane alleged that Raza Academy was behind the violence in different parts of the state. He alleged, “Raza Academy is a terrorist organization and its founders stay in Afghanistan and follow Taliban ideology. They don’t do any social work and had also opposed revocation of triple talaq.” Rane said, “The state government should arrest all senior leaders of Raza Academy. If any violence happens against Hindus, we will not tolerate.” “Raza Academy had organized a march on November 12 against Tripura violence. I have the pamphlets that they had distributed. I challenge the Academy to show evidence of Hindus burning down masjid in Tripura. Burning of masjid by Hindus was fake news.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amravati-violence-maha-ex-min-bonde-13-others-arrested-let-off-on-bail/articleshow/87725224.cms||---

Colleges said the pupils have been disconnected with physical schools ever since the pandemic started. They may have faced extreme digital exposure, pandemic-fatigue, delayed admission process and disconnect to the physical academic world. Siddharth Jabade, vice-chancellor of Vishwakarma University, said, “ It is possible due to online education, some students may not have their Std XII fundamentals clear.

Students and teachers will have to follow the other guidelines as well, including washing or sanitising of hands before entering classrooms, keeping all doors and windows of classrooms and staff rooms open for proper ventilation, not sharing food and stationery and maintaining social distancing. Ready to step into the campuses after a gap of 20 months, colleges and universities have drafted health and safety protocols for both students as well as staff. At St Xavier’s College, nobody will be able to enter the campus without a mask. Students must either wash or sanitise their hands before entering classrooms. Teachers and students will have to carry their college IDs and all Covid-appropriate measures have to be followed in the canteen and library. “We have issued detailed health and safety guidelines and everybody must follow it,” said Father Dr Dominic Savio, principal at St Xavier’s College. At Maulana Azad College, the authorities have put up posters everywhere on the dos and don’ts to be followed on the premises. “Temperature of everyone stepping into the campus will be checked at the gate. All must wear their masks when inside the college. We have put up banners and posters on the campus, reminding students to follow the safety guidelines.

---||Pune||When Purandare spoke, he brought Shivaji Maharaj to life before the audience||PUNE: Babasaheb Purandare lived for and breathed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His 10-volume Shivcharitra Raja Shivchhatrapati, thousands of lectures and the epic play Janata Raja not only took the illustrious life and battles of valour of the Maratha king to every household in Maharashtra and beyond, but also infused the ideals of the mighty warrior in the very conscience of the people. Purandare, an eminent history scholar, passed away at 5.07am in a Pune hospital of old-age related pneumonia on Monday. He was 99. The last rites were performed at Vaikunth crematorium with state honours. For more than seven decades, Purandare was a Shivaji Maharaj bard (Shivshahir). But his words were grounded in solid proof and facts. He had trekked to hundreds of forts that the Maratha king had conquered and had visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji Maharaj. He meticulously preserved every little acquisition with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent story-teller and narrator, an author, a playwright and a novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Renowned humorist P L Deshpande captured the essence of Purandare’s greatness in his pen sketch in the book ‘Gangoat’. Deshpande wrote: Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to the most common people in an easy-to-understand and vivid language, but he never lost sight of the fact that history research is a science. He displayed the openness of mind to study new material and incorporate it in his writings provided it was based on facts and solid proof, he said. Deshpande was appreciative of Purandare’s command over details which ensured that history did not get disconnected from the present. “He reads literature with equal interest. He can watch a Hindi film, listen to Radio Ceylon, attend classical music concerts and knows the score of a cricket match. While trekking to forts, he takes equal interest in the birds that nest there or the flowers that bloom,” Deshpande wrote. Purandare was so immersed in the life of Shivaji Maharaj that he could almost see some of the events from his life unfold while commuting on Pune’s roads. Deshpande recalled one such instance in his pen sketch: “We were travelling in a car on the road below the Nava Pul and going towards Sambhaji Park. When we passed the Rokdoba temple near Congress Bhavan, Babasaheb told me to stop. ‘See that spot? Shivaji Maharaj's horses had waited there for him. It was April 6, 1663. Maharaj had severed the fingers of Shahiste Khan at Lal Mahal and escaped. He came straight here, took his horse and rode to Sinhagad’,” wrote Deshpande, adding that one had to be prepared to get delayed while travelling with Purandare as he often ended up narrating some exciting episodes from the life of the king he adored. Purandare leaves behind a wealth of unparalleled work on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In his passing, the state has lost an ardent scholar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/when-purandare-spoke-he-brought-shivaji-maharaj-to-life-before-the-audience/articleshow/87724370.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Actor assaulted at KBR Park, phone snatched||HYDERABAD: A robber allegedly attacked a Tollywood actress and snatched her mobile phone while she was on her evening walk at KBR Park on Sunday night. She suffered injuries while resisting the attack. The incident exposed the poor security near the park. Ironically, no one witnessed the assault. Actress Shalu Chaourasiya went to KBR Park for an evening walk around 6.30pm, Banjara Hills police said. Around 8.30pm, when she was walking on the outer track and reached a location, opposite a popular coffee shop on Road No. 93, Jubilee Hills, a miscreant came from the rear and pulled her aside. Lighting at the location was poor. “After pulling me, he stuffed a cloth into my mouth. Later, he pushed me against a rock and banged my head thrice. Then, he threw me to the ground, stomped and hit me,’‘ Chaourasiya told police. The culprit then grabbed a big stone and tried to hit her. “That is when I pushed him aside and jumped on to the other side and saved myself. He asked for money and gold ornaments. When I did not give in, he tried to kill me. He was saying, I’m not going to leave you alive,’’ she said in her complaint. He dragged the actress on the ground for some distance, continuously beating and kicking the victim. He then snatched her phone and fled from the spot. She suffered injuries to her head and legs. He also even punched her in the face resulting in injuries to her lips too. Later, she called ‘Dial 100’ with the help of a passer-by and police reached the spot. When they verified nearby CCTV cameras, they found that they were not working. Police are now relying on CCTV footage of nearby establishments besides tracking the location of the victim’s phone to nab the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/actor-assaulted-at-kbr-park-phone-snatched/articleshow/87725955.cms||---

There were just 1,132 Covid patients in intensive care units across Maharashtra, the data further showed. Nineteen districts in Maharashtra are reporting fewer than 50 active cases, with nine districts reporting a single-digit caseload, the health department data till November 15 showed. Covid task force members said that the state appears to be slowly moving towards an endemic stage, though they satded it was too early to say for sure. “Critical patients, meaning those in need of oxygen support, are reducing significantly. The number has dropped even in terms of daily critical patients being reported at hospitals. Though the percentage of critical patients among total active patients is the same, the absolute numbers of severe infections have fallen considerably, and Covid-19 vaccination seems to have played a major role in this reduction,” a state public health department official said. The official added, “The main purpose of the vaccination is not a reduction in reinfection, but a reduction in severe Covid cases/critical admissions and therefore, mortalities — a trend seen post-vaccination.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force told TOI, “We are slowly and surely moving towards endemicity, though it is too early to say we are there. Maharashtra must wait for another two weeks for the Diwali-effect on Covid cases to become apparent. If there is no significant surge in cases by the month-end and, depending on how fast we can vaccinate the rest of the population, the state could quickly move towards achieving Covid endemicity. But all this will depend on the emergence of a new variant” Pandit said another seven to 14 days will have to elapse for any festival-related surge in Covid cases to show. “Reduction in Covid mortalities and single-digit active cases in several districts is, however, indicative of the pandemic being under control with low test positivity rates in various districts. Some districts have had active cases in single digits for weeks now, which is significant,” Pandit said. Around mid-September, at least 14 districts in Maharashtra had an active Covid caseload of below 50, while seven of these had active cases in single digits. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “The number of Covid patients being admitted at the hospital is six currently. The single digit Covid admission trend has persisted for four weeks now. There have hardly been any Covid mortalities at our hospital in the last two months, a trend indicative from zero Covid deaths in Pune city for some days recently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nearly-50-drop-in-number-of-critical-patients-in-state/articleshow/87727371.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Pune||Pune: Health department sets sights on 60k shots per day across district||PUNE: The district health office (DHO) is aiming to administer at least 60,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine per day under the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive, with 30,000 being aimed at the rural population and 15,000 each in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. In its action plan, the DHO has identified 241 villages and 16 wards in rural and urban areas of the district which are low performing in vaccine coverage. It has formed around 2,500 teams to achieve its daily target. Pune ZP’s district health officer Bhagwan Pawar told TOI that the drive began last week with teams visiting the low performing villages and households. “The response has been quite dull. We are targeting at least 30,000 shots per day, however, the response is not satisfying. Teams are reporting that unvaccinated beneficiaries do want to get vaccinated now, as the pandemic has eased across the region,” said Pawar. According to Pawar, hesitancy and reluctance to get vaccinated is worrying officials. He said that to convince people about the advantages of getting vaccinated, the health teams are working on large scale awareness drives in the region. “Each team comprises two people and they are visiting every household in the 241 villages which are low performing in terms of vaccination,” he said. Meanwhile, the action plan said only the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is does not have any low performing ward tag. On Monday, the district recorded the vaccination of 45,615 beneficiaries across 647 government and private vaccination sites until 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-department-sets-sights-on-60k-shots-per-day-across-district/articleshow/87724391.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Delhi: 13 days after acid attack by stalker, 26-year-old loses battle of survival||NEW DELHI: After struggling for 13 days, a 26-year-old woman who was attacked with acid in Outer North Delhi’s Bawana area breathed her last on Monday afternoon at RML Hospital. The victim’s husband told TOI that he wants the accused to be hanged till death. “I don’t know how to bring up my children now, or what to tell them. We don’t even have money. I am a daily wage labourer and we live by the day. I did not have money for transportation so I stayed back at the hospital. They said they would give the body on Tuesday,” he said. Two days ago, the woman had lost her eyesight and her kidneys had developed complications as well. On November 3, the woman had sustained severe burn wounds after a man who allegedly wanted to marry her threw acid on her for refusing his marriage proposal. Police arrested the accused, Montu, from Bihar on November 8. He was later taken to Outer North Delhi for recovery of a weapon where he fired at the police party and in retaliation, the team also fired and he was injured. He was known to the victim as he was living in the same neighbourhood in Samaypur Badli. The victim was also from Bihar. The victim’s husband said, “I want my children to study, but we need to have money for that. They have been at my brother’s house since my wife was attacked. Our lives are over now. After her demise, it will be tough to bring the kids up on my own. I want that accused to be hanged now. If my wife is no more, he should also not live”. Doctors treating her earlier said that she suffered damage in her internal organs too. The victim had around 45% third degree burns, mostly on her face, upper torso. The victim had also suffered a lot of blood loss and was transfused blood earlier. Police had earlier also arrested the man who sold the acid to Montu. He was booked under Section 285 of the IPC. Police said he was nabbed after several raids were carried out in parts of Uttar Pradesh. The accused has been identified as Ram Sewak who hails from Shahjahanpur but resides at a rented apartment in Outer Delhi. Sewak had procured the acid from Nangloi and the cops are trying to trace its source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13-days-after-acid-attack-by-stalker-26-year-old-loses-battle-of-survival/articleshow/87725299.cms||Sakshi Chand

The women were taken to a hospital where doctors declared them dead,” the officer said. There was no visible injury mark present on the body of any of the deceased. “The exact cause of the death will be clear only after postmortem.” Police are probing the case from all angles.

There is no reason for violence in here based on what has happened in Tripura,” Pawar told reporters in Nashik. Responding to questions, the NCP chief said he suspected that such violence is being unleashed by vested interests as the assembly elections are due in some states, including Uttar Pradesh. Lauding chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Pawar said the CM is doing a good job and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its term. “The Opposition has predicted the MVA government’s downfall since the day the three-party coalition came to power. I am confident that the MVA will complete its term,” he said. According to him, the state is facing a severe financial crisis and the ongoing ST employees strike is inconveniencing the common people. Pawar said he did not agree with the demand to merge the transport utility with the state government. “The state government and MSRTC representatives should sit down and find a solution to the problems,” he added. Later, he inaugurate the two-day convention of the Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal. Saying that the state’s financial condition was not very good, Pawar added that only the proper demand of the mahamandal would be addressed. Pawar, Bhujbal condole death of Purandare NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal condoled the death of noted historian and author Babasaheb Purandare.

Kondiba Devrao Tonge (58) and his wife Paryagbai (55), from Sonkhed village of Loha taluka in Nanded district performed the puja alongside Pawar. Pawar, addressing a gathering of devotees after the ceremony, said, "We have prayed for peace in the state and for unfettered continuation of our traditional Wari. The pandemic is not over – it has popped up again in China, Russia, and Europe. People should seek Covid treatment under the guidance of the health department only. Vaccine is a must, and everyone must get both doses.” The town of Vitthal-Rukhmini temple has witnessed high footfalls of over 5 lakh devotees. The administration put in place all preparations anticipating a high turnout. Last year, Kartiki Ekadashi was celebrated in a low-key manner due to Covid-19 restrictions. The bhakt niwas facilities in Pandharpur, Tuljapur and Akkalkot have been fully booked. Due to the high number of devotees, Covid safety norms took a backseat.

The seized bags were distributed to the farmers following the orders of the deputy commissioner on Monday. Mohali chief agriculture officer Rajesh Raheja said, “The suspected case of black-marketing was unearthed at Sahni fertilizer, Lalru. Following a tip-off, our team checked the store. The DAP stock was not available there till November 14 late evening. At night, a truck, which was dispatched from Ludhiana on November 10, was found parked outside the store. It is suspected that the truck took long to reach here as on the way the DAP was black-marketed. We have lodged a complaint with the police to investigate the matter further.” “On Monday, our team distributed the stock among farmers in the presence of Derabassi tehsildar,” he added. DAP is a preferred fertilizer in India because it contains both nitrogen and phosphorus, which are primary macro-nutrients and part of 18 essential plant nutrients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/suspected-dap-black-marketing-case-in-lalru/articleshow/87724395.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Lucky draw, street plays to boost immunization||PUNE: From offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students for motivating unvaccinated population, health officials in Maharashtra are going the extra mile to woo citizens to take the Covid shot. The officials are using creative methods like organising street plays and providing door-step counselling to push vaccination, besides deploying educational tools like posters and hoardings. State immunisation officer Sachin Desai said, “District collectors are making use of different creative methods to achieve 100% vaccination coverage.” In Chandrapur, the civic body is offering electronic and home appliances under a lucky draw to ensure that 39,000 unvaccinated citizens come forward to take the first shot. “We don’t want to leave any stone unturned. An LED TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine and 10 mixer grinders would be awarded to the citizens through the lucky draw initiative. This move is improving the vaccination numbers to some extent in Chandrapur,” municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite said. “The winners will be announced after November 24,” Mohite said. The district administration in Chandrapur is also pasting stickers outside commercial establishments with unvaccinated staff to keep customers informed. In Yavatmal, where over 10 lakh citizens are yet to take the first dose, the administration is seeking the help of schoolchildren. Akola resident deputy collector Sanjay Khadse said they would give ‘Sanman-Patra’ (felicitation certificates) to children who convince unvaccinated people in their homes and localities. The vaccination in Nashik city and rural parts of the district has crossed 74%, but the vaccination has remained slow in the limits of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) where only 27% of the beneficiaries have been administered the first dose of the vaccines. Aurangabad’s immunisation officer Smita Nalgirkar said, “We are carrying out door-to-door visits of health teams. Besides, we are making phone calls and spreading public awareness in general,” Nalgirkar said. Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 3 had held a virtual meeting involving authorities from Aurangabad and other districts where vaccination coverage is relatively lower.

---||Jaipur||If India can talk to China, why can’t it do so with Pak: Farooq Abdullah||Jodhpur: Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah said on Monday here that if India could talk to China, why can’t it do so with Pakistan. He said that only dialogue is the way out of all problems between India and Pakistan. While talking to the media on his two-day private visit to Jodhpur, Abdullah, in a veiled attack on the centre, said that China was already in our territory and advancing everyday, and still we are talking to it. “If we can talk with China, why cannot with Pakistan. China is in our territory and is advancing everyday,” said Abdullah citing CDS Bipin Rawat that China was the biggest enemy of India. Emphasising on improved Indo-Pak relations, he said that relations of Hindus and Muslims are affected due to this strained relation. “If we have to improve our relationship, we will have to ease these differences and will have to find some ways. And the only way for this is dialogue,” he said citing the Pakistan visit of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to have a dialogue with his counterpart Nawaz Sharif. “We see attacks are taking place on Muslims in the country, they are being beaten, mosques are being blown up. Its impact is felt on our children,” he said. Talking about the situation in J&K post abrogation of Article 370, Abdullah said that there is pressure everywhere. Citing media, he said, “Media was not free there. No one can write freely and if you do, you can go to jail.” Referring to the youth there, he said that there are lot of educated youth there but they have no employment. “What is their future,” he asked. He further added that there are so many problems in J&K as there is Pakistan on one side and China on the other. “We are stuck between them. We do not know if there will be war someday. Only we will suffer, we will be killed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/if-india-can-talk-to-china-why-cant-it-do-so-with-pak-farooq-abdullah/articleshow/87725327.cms||---

Talking to reporters after inaugurating a computer laboratory at Kalapatti government high school in the city on Monday, Poyyamozhi said that though there is a standing instruction that complaint boxes should be installed in all the schools, students don’t know how to use the facility. “Once all the schools resume in-person classes in a full-fledged manner, awareness programmes will be conducted for students and they will be encouraged to make use of the complaint boxes. The schools too will be instructed to constitute committees chaired by a female teacher. Students can approach the committee and register complaints about sexual harassment on the campus,” he said. A formal announcement regarding the same will be made after November 19, he assured. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/committee-to-check-sexual-harassment-in-schools-soon/articleshow/87725321.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS MLC picks: 2nd term for Kadiyam Srihari, Gutha Sukhender Reddy; Padi Kaushik Reddy gains||HYDERABAD: TRS supremo and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao seems to have taken the tried and tested route while finalising candidates for the upcoming legislative council elections. While the official announcement will be made on Tuesday, party sources said names of Gutha Sukhender Reddy, Kadiyam Srihari, Padi Kaushik Reddy, MC Koti Reddy, Takkalapally Ravinder Rao, Erolla Srinivas and Akula Lalitha have been finalised. All of these names were frontrunners in the race with hardly any surprises. Going by the list, the party is considering two SCs, one BC woman and three OCs to represent the upper castes. KCR reportedly called up the candidates and informed them about their candidature. Sukhender Reddy, Kadiyam Srihari and Akula Lalitha will get a second term in the council. Sources added that Sukhender Reddy will be sent to the upper house through the governor’s quota. He will replace Kaushik Reddy, whose nomination governor Tamilisai Soudararajan was unwilling to approve. In another significant development, Siddipet collector P Venkatrama Reddy took voluntary retirement and is likely to join the TRS. He will contest the MLC poll on a TRS ticket under the local authority constituency either from Medak or from his native district of Karimnagar. He had about one year left to retirement. The name of former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, who belongs to the SC community, was finalised because he played an active role in popularising the Dalit Bandhu scheme. Similarly, another SC leader, Erolla Srinivas worked as the first chairman of Telangana SC commission. The TRS president has decided to give an opportunity to party general secretary Takallapally Ravinder Rao, a Velama, after considering his service to the party. Under the women’s and BC quota, Akula Lalitha has been given chance. She belongs to Munnuru Kapu community. M C Koti Reddy, a leader from Nalgonda, got an opportunity in the council as KCR had promised to accommodate him during the Nagarjuna Sagar by-election earlier this year. Koti Reddy joined the party from the Congress during the election. Sources added that KCR considered former council speaker S Madhusudhana Chary’s name too, but instead decided to send him to the Rajya Sabha next year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has notified elections to six vacancies under the MLA quota and 12 vacancies under local authority constituency quota and other constituencies. Under MLA quota, last date for filing nomination is Tuesday and polling will be held on November 29. The second round of elections will take place soon as the last date for filing nominations (second notification for filling up 12 seats) will end on November 23 and polling will be held on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mlc-picks-2nd-term-for-kadiyam-gutha-kaushik-gains/articleshow/87725959.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man freed in stabbing case after 9 years over ‘casual’ investigation||NEW DELHI: Nine years after a case was filed against a man for allegedly stabbing another man with a knife, a court has acquitted him citing contradictions in the prosecution’s case and “casual” investigation by police. Additional sessions judge Parveen Singh set aside a magistrate court’s order by which the man was sentenced to two years in prison in 2019 under IPC 326 (causing grievous hurt by using a dangerous weapon). The man had moved the sessions court against his conviction and sentence. The sessions court said on Wednesday, “There is nothing on record to show that the hurt caused endangered the life of the injured or that the injury caused was life threatening in nature. In absence of any such opinion by the doctor or a categorical finding by the court, the appellant could not have been convicted u/s 326 IPC.” The investigating officer (IO), the court observed, did not want to work hard enough to find the alleged weapon of offence or he knew that there might not have been such a weapon. Its non-recovery becomes important as there was a probability that the injury might have been caused by a piece of glass instead of a knife, and also in view of an absurd explanation given by the IO, the judge noted. The IO said the appellant had claimed that he had kept the knife in his pocket, but, on reaching home, found that it had made a hole in the trouser and fallen somewhere, the court said, adding that the explanation seemed unbelievable. It pointed out that in the alleged medical history of the case, it was recorded that the injury was a “glass injury to the abdomen”, but the IO claimed to have noticed it only during the cross-examination. “This reflects the casual manner in which the IO had conducted the investigation,” it noted. Merely because of the medical report stating “stab cut positive”, the magistrate court could not have reached the conclusion that it was a knife injury, not by a broken glass or glass, the judge observed. Although the prosecution claimed the victim was stabbed during a conversation between the two, the sessions court pointed out that during cross-examination, the complainant had said the accused was silently listening to his conversation with another driver and had nothing to do with it. “This is not a minor variation because the motive of the appellant to stab the victim stands demolished by this cross-examination.” The IO also chose not to find and join any independent public witness, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-freed-in-stabbing-case-after-9-years-over-casual-investigation/articleshow/87725326.cms||Usha Das
---||Pune||Pune: Two CNG furnaces proposed for dhobi ghat crematorium||PUNE: The Pune cantonment board (PCB) has forwarded a Rs1.5crore proposal to the Principal Director of Defence Estate (PDDE) of the Southern Command, seeking financial sanction for setting up two CNG-operated furnaces at its crematorium in Dhobi ghat. This follows complaints by citizens about the almost two-decade-old existing electric furnace not working properly. Rajabhau Chavan, an activist, said, “During the peak Covid period, many citizens faced difficulties at the crematorium. The cantonment should consider people’s concerns and complete the work at the earliest.” “The proposal is pending with the PDDE office. We are likely to get the requisite sanction to go ahead with the project,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. A PCB official said, “The existing electric furnace was set up in 2002, but now it is not functioning properly as its electric coils have worn out. As a result, the furnace is not able to maintain temperature for even two hours.” The existing chimney, too, is in a bad shape and the smoke generated at the site does not go out. It gets accumulated within the premises. It makes relatives and families uncomfortable at the place, said PCB officials. “In the event of disruption in electricity supply, we are unable to operate the furnace effectively by using the generator. Hence, we have proposed two CNG-operated burners,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-cng-furnaces-proposed-for-dhobi-ghat-crematorium/articleshow/87724402.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Face shield, mike for teachers for stress-less lectures||KOLKATA: Wearing masks while addressing one class after another for is not an easy proposition but that’s what teachers are gearing up to do as schools and colleges reopen on Tuesday after the pandemic hiatus. The different institutes are also taking additional measures, such as providing them with face shields and installing microphones in classrooms, to make it easier for them. Our Lady Queen of the Missions School will be among those distributing face shields to teachers so that they feel less constricted while talking. “We don’t want teachers stressed out, wearing masks while taking classes. We will initially try out with the face shield and see how comfortable they are,” said principal Sister Rani. At DPS Ruby Park, teachers will not have to speak very loudly as microphones have been installed in classes. Ram Mohan Mission principal Sujoy Biswas agreed that teachers had to be comfortable while taking classes for long hours. “We will try out face shields and see if they feel comfortable in them. Talking for long hours through the mask is a torture. We will monitor the situation on the day of reopening and take feedback from our teachers,” Biswas said. La Martiniere for Boys has organised for headphones with microphones to relieve teachers’ stress. The problem is likely to be worse for teachers at government and aided schools. The state has prepared staggered timing with classes IX and XI scheduled from 10am to 3.30pm and classes X and XII from 11am to 4.30pm. Teachers and other staff will have to reach school by 8.30am-9am and stay on till 5pm. Taki House headmistress Swagata Basak said, “We have requested all teachers to be present at least for the first 10 days. After that, we will get a clearer picture.” A south Kolkata college professor seemed concerned. “I don’t know how to manage a full class, wearing a mask. I’m practising but after talking for five to 10 minutes, I feel strained. We have to take online classes for first- and second-years the same day we take offline classes.” Scottish Church College has decided physical classes will not be for more than four hours, each honours class being assigned one hour. Vice-Principal and history professor Supratim Das said, “We have prepared a new schedule in such a way that nobody is overloaded. Teachers will not take offline classes for more than two hours. They can take their masks off during the break. They don’t have to wear masks for online classes.” Colleges in the suburbs may face some difficulties due to lack of infrastructure. Political science professor at Hiralal Mazumdar Memorial College at Dakshineswar Pradipta Mukherjee said, “Giving lectures with a mask on may be difficult. The risk factor is also there as many UG sudents are not vaccinated. We don’t know how to manage hybrid mode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/face-shield-mike-for-teachers-for-stress-less-lectures/articleshow/87724405.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The leopard was already trapped in a cage and the forest department suspects that it was trapped by poachers. The two-hour-long operation saw the team using a tranquiliser gun and ferrying the feline to a rescue centre in Ranibagh of Nainital district for treatment before releasing it back into the wild. Forest Rangers Bhupal Singh Kaida of Rudrapur and Roop Narayan Gautam of Barhaini forest range reached the spot with a medical team after being informed by villagers. As the news about the caged leopard spread in the area, a big crowd gathered on the site. The presence of a big crowd made the rescue operation complicated. Gautam said, “The cat was stuck in the cage. Poachers might have installed the cage to catch some wild animals for their meat. We are still trying to find out the actual reason behind this. A probe has begun and a case will be registered against the farm owner if found guilty.” Meanwhile, veterinarian Ayush Uniyal said that the big cat has suffered injuries in its hind legs and will be treated at the centre. “The forest department will be fixing a radio collar on the leopard before releasing it in the wild,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/leopard-caged-by-poachers-rescued-in-u-s-nagar/articleshow/87724411.cms||Aakash Ahuja

During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725330.cms||---

In August, the administration had decided to go for a fresh plan as the officials of the Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) had said UT’s 2009’s plan could not be updated as the Centre had issued new guidelines.The UT adviser has asked the department concerned to submit the report on progress made.To solve the city's urban transport problem, the administration had fixed a meeting with RITES, in which options of MRTS, like metro, monorail and skybus, were discussed. Before moving ahead, the UT adviser had directed the transport department to get an updated RITES-2009 study. The last mobility plan for the MRTS was prepared by the RITES in 2009. Since then, many things have drastically changed on the ground like volume of traffic, entry of vehicles into the city and rush on many routes.The administration had in 2019 rejected a detailed study conducted by French company Systra for a mobility plan under the Smart City project. Citing wrong methodology for carrying out the study aimed at suggesting ways to solve traffic congestion and offer possible modes for mass rapid transport system, the administration had set it aside. The French agency had suggested three Tricity corridors and a combination of bus rapid transit system (BRTS), light rail transit (LRT), modern tram and monorail as possible modes of transport along these corridors. The UT administration had then asked a team of Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and other experts to check the study and found flaws with methodology and figures.The RITES, in their earlier study, had proposed that a metro would cover a distance of 52.4 km, of which 40.4 km will be in Chandigarh, and the rest in Mohali. The alignments were proposed both above ground as well as underground. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had prepared the detailed project report of the first phase. Later in 2017, the Central government had declared Metro as unviable for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-adviser-seeks-report-on-new-mobility-plan-for-mrts/articleshow/87724407.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

There are approximately 40 lakh students in colleges run by technical and higher education departments in Maharashtra. Over 60% of them have received first dose of Covid vaccines. The state held “Mission Yuva Swasthya” for vaccination of college students. But low attendance in colleges that resumed physical classes on October 20 proved a dampener. “We have decided to prioritise the vaccination of college students by holding near-home camps at community halls and other public places. The aim is to vaccinate those left out during the vaccination on college campuses,” said the state immunization officer, Sachin Desai. There are about 5,000 institutes of higher and technical education in the state. Also, about 40 lakh students study in deemed and private universities. The state health department held vaccination camps on the premises of 1,608 colleges across the state and inoculated a total of 1,08,613 students in the weeklong special drive from October 25 to November 2. Santosh Parchure, the director of the students’ welfare department at SPPU, said, “After the good response students during the previous drive in the Pune division, we shall extend it further and ensure that maximum students benefit. Many are waiting for their second dose. Also, there are few students who have not taken first shot.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand's biggest biodiversity park, spread across 50 hectares, to be set up in Garhwal||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s biggest biodiversity park will be set up at Garhwal’s Muni Ki Reti. Dubbed the Shiwalik Biodiversity Park (SBP) and spread across 50 hectares of land, its aim is to conserve the natural landscape of the area. The park is expected to bring in around 5 lakh tourists who visit Rishikesh every year. It will have 33 types of conservation concepts, all developed at the cost of Rs 65 crore. The project will be executed in three phases over the next five years. Interestingly, the park is expected to generate employment for at least 7,000 people, according to preliminary estimates by forest authorities. Forest officials say objectives behind building the park include biodiversity conservation, promotion of natural products (testing, processing, value addition, marketing, and quality control), livelihood enhancement, eco-restoration of degraded forests, nature education, promoting responsible visits to the Himalayan natural treasures, and teaching the importance of various types of ecosystems. The SBP is divided into two parts, the Herbal Eco-Par, spread across 6.32 hectares, and Nature Park Area, across 43.05 hectares. The biodiversity park will also have miniature replicas of iconic sites in Uttarakhand such as the Char Dham shrines. It will have a valley of flowers with a water body, a nature learning centre, butterfly conservatory, open-air aviary, a theme-based light and sound show called 'Conservation of the Maa Ganga River', a natural herbal haat, a conservation park, some livelihood-based activities, five nature trails, and a Sanskriti Gram. The biodiversity park would have a Shivalik transition zone, a rich ecotone, hillside grasslands, gentle active plains, tropical deciduous forests, bushlands, and upper Bhabar landscapes. These different landscapes would be interconnected by nature trails and would support more than 1,000 species of plants. The park is surrounded by the main Char Dham roads, NH-58 and NH-94, which is why the department is expecting a handsome income generation through the set-up. “The project is based on the utilisation of natural products with zero carbon footprint and sustainable utilisation of resources. The Shiwalik Biodiversity Park will serve three important functions besides enhancing the quality of the urban environment – educational, cultural, and conservational,” said DS Meena, DFO of Narendra Nagar. The authorities aligned the project with the National Biodiversity Action Plan and the Convention on Biological Diversity during planning. Meena added, “The park will have over 450 species of medicinal herbs/shrubs and trees in the arboretum. It will also have a seed bank to save the rare, endangered, and threatened species of plants.” Muni Ki Reti seems to have untapped potential, which the authorities are trying to use for the livelihood generation of the locals, as more than 35 lakh pilgrims pass through this area for the Char Dham yatra every year. The Kumbh mela and kanwar yatra also provide additional opportunities for income generation for the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-biggest-biodiversity-park-spread-across-50-hectares-to-be-set-up-in-garhwal/articleshow/87724428.cms||Shivani Azad

He had about one year left for retirement. Talking to reporters soon after announcing his resignation, Venkatrama Reddy said he chose to quit so as to join the efforts of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for the rapid development of the state. Venkatrama Reddy said he has seen KCR's vision and endeavour for Telangana's development from close quarters as district collector .

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Proposal for petrochemical cluster in Nagapattinam scrapped||TRICHY: In the wake of the stiff opposition from the opposition parties, the state government has withdrawn its proposal to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) to establish a petrochemical cluster in Nagapattinam. In the announcement, published as a newspaper corrigendum, M-TIPB stated that the request for proposal (RIP) for preparation of DPR for establishing a petrochemical cluster has been withdrawn due to administrative reasons. The objective of the cluster was to set up 90 lakh tonne capacity petroleum and chemical related business units around the refinery being constructed by Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in Nagapattinam at an estimated cost Rs 31,580 crore. The decision of the Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau (M-TIPB) to cancel the bid for preparing the DPR was welcomed by PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss. He said that the PMK welcomed the move of the state government to abandon the proposal, which will jeopardise the objective of the protected special agriculture zone. On October 30, Ramadoss issued a statement condemning the government for floating a proposal to prepare a DPR. Citing that the proposed site falls under the protected special agriculture zone of the Cauvery delta region, the PMK leader had accused the DMK for attracting investments instead of safeguarding the agriculture and environment of the state. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam also issued a statement on November 1 terming the move as DMK government’s ‘double-standard’. In the statement on Monday, Ramadoss demanded the government to include the petrochemical industries in the banned list under The Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/proposal-for-petrochemical-cluster-scrapped/articleshow/87725349.cms||---

He said that both DNA profiles matched with 99 % accuracy. “We had already confirmed that the death of Lokka was due to sudden cardiac arrest. Following the DNA match, we have now confirmed the identity of the deceased as Lokka,” the police officer said. “There was no foul play behind the death of Lokka. So, we are going to file a petition before a court in Coimbatore to close the suspicious death of Lokka’s case,” he added.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges take tech help to spread reopening message||KOLKATA: College and university authorities took help of all social media platforms — used by students — to share information and guidelines about campus reopening. This made communication effective and helped reach students quickly instead of the “official notifications” on websites that most students don’t notice. From information about vaccination to sharing plans of reopening to publishing health and safety protocols, college authorities shifted focus to platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, YouTube and even Instagram. Students, many of whom have been waiting eagerly for colleges to reopen, were quick to respond and share the information. “We sent out a detailed notice to students on various class specific groups. Several students responded with queries, which were cleared by the teachers in charge. The college has been taking help of several tech platforms even during online classes and examinations,” said an official of St Xavier’s College. Colleges even collected vaccination certificates through WhatsApp groups to get the number of fully vaccinated students. “Teachers started counseling students days in advance about the reopening and the protocol to be followed. The method proved to be effective as all students use WhatsApp and are very quick to respond,”said Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College. The college also has an official YouTube channel. Most principals said students do not check circulars and notices on official websites. Initially some colleges faced problems shifting to online classes but now almost all have WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels. “During admission we have found most students don’t check the college website. Some even missed the deadline. But for reopening we could not take any chances because it’s a matter of safety,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.  Many colleges have also started sharing information on health facilities available on campus. “We have a health centre on campus, where facilities have been increased. We have also tied up with a private hospital and informed students on how to use the facilities in case of emergency. All this is being done through various social media groups,”said an official of Jadavpur University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-take-tech-help-to-spread-reopening-message/articleshow/87724445.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||India||Calcutta HC remarks on CAT bench can be expunged in Alapan case: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday told the Centre that it can expunge the adverse remarks made by Calcutta High Court against the principal bench of the CAT while giving a verdict in favour of former chief secretary of West Bengal Alapan Bandyopadhyay but observed that it cannot be said that the HC had no jurisdiction to pass order. The HC, while setting aside the order passed by the principal bench of CAT on the Centre’s plea for transfer of the case filed by Bandyopadhyay from the Calcutta HC bench to itself, said “The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides, it is unfortunate that the principal bench of the CAT nurtured such efforts by passing the impugned transfer order, thereby paying obeisance to the diktat of Union of India.” Challenging the order passed by HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta contended before a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that it was a “disturbing order” and very unwanted observation passed by the court and must be set aside. He said that the bureaucrat was an All India Cadre Officer and he can challenge departmpartmental action only before the principal branch of the tribunal. The bench, however, said the officer has since retired and he has the option to file the case where he stays. Mehta, however, insisted that the HC had no jurisdiction at all and again referred to the “disturbing” observations. He said that such language could not be allowed to be used even by litigants in a constitutional court. The bench said it can order to expunge the remarks and again observed that there was nothing wrong in the case being heard by the Kolkata branch of the tribunal as ordered by the HC. “Part of the cause of action arises in Kolkata itself and the HC has jurisdiction. What is wrong about it. Regarding observation we can take care of it,” the bench said. The bench, however, deferred the hearing for next week after Mehta contended that he wanted to place relevant case laws before the bench to buttress his point that HC had no jurisdiction. Bandyopadhyay had been issued a showcause for allegedly abstaining from a meeting held by the Prime Minister in Kalaikunda in May this year. On May 31, the last day of Bandyopadhyay’s tenure, he was directed to go to Delhi to join the central government’s service. He, however, retired on the same day without going to Delhi. Although the state government offered to extend his tenure by three months, Bandyopadhyay turned it down. The central government started disciplinary proceedings against Bandyopadhyay and he approached the Calcutta bench of CAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/calcutta-hc-remarks-on-cat-bench-can-be-expunged-in-alapan-case-sc/articleshow/87726596.cms||---

As part of the national campaign to restore the old pension scheme, hundreds of employees gathered at Parade Ground and held a march to the secretariat. The campaign's national president, Vijay Kumar Bandhu, and general secretary Stidhi Pragya said that the whole country is once again mobilised to restore the old pension scheme. Representatives of about 50 employees' organisations have joined the campaign. In January 2004, the central government introduced a new pension system, NPS, for government employees recruited after December 31, 2003, to replace the one under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. The new pension scheme does not provide the guarantee of minimum pension on the last basic salary drawn by the employees, according to a protesting employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-employees-demand-restoration-of-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/87724449.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Trichy||3 years after Gaja, coconut farmers still struggling||Trichy: It has been three years since Cyclone Gaja turned the lives of the coconut farmers of the delta region upside down in a single night on November 15, 2018. The severe cyclonic storm had uprooted 59.29 lakh coconut trees, which were the mainstay of the farmers in the area. Trees raised on around 2.50 lakh acres in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Pudukottai districts were destroyed in the strong winds. Though the then government distributed coconut saplings and a compensation, most of the farmers are still struggling to revive the saplings as well as their lives.Thanjavur was the worst hit district as around 40 lakh coconut trees in Pattukottai, Peravurani and Orathanadu were completely destroyed, farmers said. The state government had provided a compensation of Rs 1,100 per tree, free saplings and input cost to the farmers who lost their trees. But the saplings have not grown well and withered due to the attack of rhinoceros beetles, V Veerasenan, a coconut farmer from Ponnavarayankottai in Pattukottai taluk in the district, said. “I had around 250 coconut trees on five acres. Now I have hardly 25 trees. Most of the farmers could not get full compensation as the enumeration was done in an improper way. The free saplings given by the government are not growing properly. Still, the saplings remain as saplings as the breed supplied was not fit for the soil in the area. The government announced to disburse manure, fertilizers for five years free of cost. However, we received it only once. The government disbursed black gram seeds to raise as intercrop among the coconut groves to get extra income. But that too yielded nothing as the seed was substandard,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3-years-after-gaja-coconut-farmers-still-struggling/articleshow/87725370.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||Plastic waste choking storm water drains in Trichy city||Trichy: Non-biodegradable waste including plastic dumped in public places played a major role in several areas getting inundated in the city. During the storm water drains clearing drives recently, piles of plastic, glass and cloth waste that clogged the storm drains were retrieved.Despite having three major rivers and several minor channels crisscrossing the city, several localities with storm water drains were marooned by rainwater last week due to poor maintenance. Plastic waste clogging the drains also contributed to inundation in localities that have drain infrastructure. Since the storm water drains were open in most parts of the city, commercial establishments and residents litter plastic waste in them, which affects the flow of water.In the localities that have Tasmac liquor bars, Trichy Corporation workers have recovered several empty glass bottles and plastic cups that clogged the drains causing inundation. In Karumandapam, the run-off water that was supposed to merge with Koraiyar inundated RMS Colony and Kalyanasundaram Nagar due to the clogging.“Earlier, garbage bins were placed in public places. Once they were removed, people started throwing waste on vacant spaces that eventually end up in drains,” S Thirugnanam, a resident of New Colony, Karumandapam, said. Corporation and the state highways department were also to be blamed as most of the stormwater drains in the city were left uncovered. While the concrete slabs above the drains prevent waste from entering the drains, authorities were reluctant to cover them as the drains are used as sullage carriers, which need to be cleaned frequently. “Placing slabs will hinder the cleaning and silt removal process. Anti-social elements are damaging the slabs to sell the iron rods in scrap yards, we are covering the drains in a phased manner,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plastic-waste-choking-storm-water-drains-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87725356.cms||Deepak Karthik

Although political parties repeatedly insist cadres to refrain from erecting banners that affect the public, the warning stays only on paper as cadres are undeterred by enforcement agencies.In Srirangam, political banners by DMK has occupied a portion of the centre median near Thiruvanaikoil junction. Locals said that the recent rainfall and bad weather may cause the banners to fall over and also cause accidents. Recalling the incident in Chennai in 2019 where a woman was killed after being knocked down by a banner and run over a by a truck, the locals added that political parties have not learnt any lesson. “Publicity on the centre median is against court directives. Law enforcement authorities are turning a blind eye to such violations although they are aware,” said Suresh Venkatachalam, coordinator, Arangamanagar Nala Sangam. Authorities fearing repercussions from political parties are hesitating to remove illegal hoardings and initiate legal actions against the offenders. Similar hoardings are occasionally cropping up on Sastri road, Anna Nagar link road and MGR statue.“Our high command has strictly told cadres in a written order to avoid placing banners in public places. We will remove the hoardings,” a functionary with DMK said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/political-banners-crop-up-on-medians/articleshow/87725363.cms||---

In business, he foresees a future in the zero-wood homes and has set a five-year deadline to make Polywood a zero-debt company. In fact, Dhabriya comes from a family that has zero presence in business. His grandfather was an illustrious teacher who had won the President’s award. His father was a BITS professor. His brother and sister too are in academics. Recalling his inspiration for entrepreneurship, Dhabriya says, “I was aspirational since my younger days. While doing mechanical engineering in MBM College in Jodhpur, I used to hear about Birlas and Tatas, and Singhanias. Their stories used to fascinate me.” After the engineering degree, he secured a scholarship of Rs 1,200 to pursue a post-graduation in Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology. “During PG days, I became more aware about scope in the plastic industry. Thoughts of replacing wood with plastic and saving trees took shape. The fact that my father was a nature lover, the idea of creating a wood substitute animated me,” reminiscences Dhabriya. After PG, he bounced around a couple of ill-fitting jobs for around 4 years, but found interest in plastic extrusion technology that can create doors and windows. In 1995, he set up Polywood with a capacity for 12 tonne of products. Today, it makes products worth 1,000 tonne having five plants (three in Jaipur and one each in Karnataka and Coimbatore). While expanding product portfolio and entering new markets, Dhabriya wanted to work for big clients. But he could not win projects. “Big clients prefer companies having well-recognised credentials and high corporate governance standards. It was hard for a small company like mine from a tier-II location to prove that. That’s when I decided to go public. Polywood became the first from Rajasthan to list on BSE’s SME exchange in 2014,” says Dhabriya. The valuation of Polywood was at Rs 17 crore when it raised Rs 3.30 crore. Today, the market capitalization is around Rs 125 crore. Dhabriya says the listing fecilitated him to work with the likes of Shapoorji Pallonji and DLF. After PVC and UPVC doors, windows, false ceiling, Polywood innovated new products like wall paneling, flooring and products that replace sunmica under D-stona brand made of marble waste. Recently, Dhabriya tied up with Italian and French firms to make modular furniture made of paddy and wheat husk, and forest waste. “Compared to wood, medium density fibre (MDF) has better characteristics. Companies like Livspace and HomeLane have a thriving modular furniture business made of MDF. We are confident this segment will help us achieve our revenue target of Rs 500 crore in the next five years,” says Dhabriya. At 56, he is the oldest player playing polo in the country now. Recalling an event that pushed him to the game, Dhabriya says, “Once, I had lent money to a polo player. Since he could not pay back, he offered me his horse. I brought it thinking my son would like to learn polo. He tried but got bored. Then I wanted to sell it but could not.” But in the short time, he developed a fascination for the animal. “When I started to ride it, I felt its power, a sense of thrill and speed. I took the help of polo player to learn the game. At 41, I played my first game. Recently, I started an arena polo facility which has been hosting tournaments. As captain of the Polywood team, I won a tournament last year,” says Dhabriya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/listing-increased-my-acceptability-among-big-clients-says-dhabriya/articleshow/87725373.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

This will also be the film’s international premier. In addition, films from the five BRICS nations— Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa— will be showcased through the BRICS film festival, which will be held parallel to the main film festival.

Everybody in the world is talking about food security, everybody realizes how important it is. During the earlier pandemics, more people died of hunger in the world than the pandemic itself. Thanks to the work of our farmers, you (employees of FCI) were able to provide adequate food grains to every single citizen of India. From food security, we have progressed to farmer security and from farmer security, we are progressing to consumer security. So, the world now sees India as a trusted partner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/indias-first-food-museum-inaugurated-in-thanjavur/articleshow/87725371.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deshmukh influential, could tamper with evidence, says ED||MUMBAI: Urging the special PMLA court to send former state home minister Anil Deshmukh to judicial custody and not release him during the pendency of the investigations, the Enforcement Directorate in its plea submitted through special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar on Monday said that he is an influential person, having served as state home minister, and if his judicial custody is not granted, he may tamper with evidences and consequently hamper the PMLA probe. “During the interrogation of Anil Deshmukh, many crucial facts have been revealed which are in his exclusive domain, as he (sic) being the key personnel, deeply and directly involved and having in possession of proceeds of crime,” the ED said. Deshmukh had been in ED custody from November 2 until Monday. The ED alleged that Deshmukh, who played a crucial role, had not provided the required information regarding the laundering of proceeds of crime. “Therefore, judicial custody is required to unearth the trail of funds, for corroboration and confrontation with other persons involved even with accused himself in the case,” the probe agency said. Meanwhile, the court allowed Deshmukh’s plea to continue his medicines and have a bed in jail. Deshmukh’s lawyers, Inderpal B Singh and Aniket Nikam, cited his age and ailments and battle with Covid-19. “He has back issues and is unable to lie on the earth… He is not a young man,” the defence said. The court perused the medical papers of JJ Hospital from Friday, which showed that Deshmukh had complained to the doctor about suffering from lower back pain for many years. “Considering the age of accused and his ailments, the jail authority is asked to provide a bed to the accused in jail,” the court said. Before the hearing commenced on Monday, on the special court’s query, Deshmukh responded that he had no complaints of ill-treatment and harassment at the hands of ED officials. The prosecution submitted a reply to Deshmukh’s handwritten application for the retraction of his statement recorded during ED custody. In the handwritten plea submitted to the court on Friday, Deshmukh had stated that he retracts answers that may have been taken from him in a “malafide manner from me by creating stress, confusion and mental obfuscation owing to my physical distress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-influential-could-tamper-with-evidence-says-ed/articleshow/87725377.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Kerala gold smuggling case: Centre to move SC against HC||NEW DELHI: In a politically sensitive case involving the LDF government in Kerala, the Centre has decided to move the Supreme Court against an order of the Kerala High Court quashing the detention of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case, under the stringent Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act). Suresh was recently released on bail by the HC after 15 months in jail under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) imposed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The gold smuggling racket was busted in July 2020, leading to seizure of 30kg gold worth Rs 15 crore from an official consignment of the UAE consulate at Trivandrum International Airport. Later, Suresh and seven other accused were arrested and a probe by the Enforcement Directorate and the customs department revealed involvement of IAS officer M Sivasankar, then principal secretary of CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The customs department has in its recent chargesheet in the case named Sivasankar as an accused who, it claimed, knew about the gold smuggling racket and was involved with Swapna Suresh. The central government has taken an opinion from the law ministry to challenge the HC order quashing Cofeposa against Suresh. The quashing order came on October 8, two days short of Suresh completing an year in detention under the stringent Act. Completing one-year detention under Cofeposa allows agencies to confiscate assets of all the accused, their relatives and associates and the burden of proof lies on the accused (that the properties are not illegally acquired from the ‘proceeds of crime’). In the same case, sources said, the Cofeposa imposed on six others have been retained, raising eyebrows in the government about the dual approach adopted in dealing with the particular case. A Cofeposa detention order is issued in extraordinary cases where the government has designated a joint secretary level officer in the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in the finance ministry to strictly review the proposals from Customs, DRI and ED and issue such orders. The states are also empowered to issue detention orders under Cofeposa, but only by a designated officer not below the rank of secretary. The customs department has claimed that the accused were repeat offenders and had smuggled several consignments of gold from the UAE totalling about 167kg between November 2019 and June 2020, all in the garb of diplomatic consignments involving consulate officials. Once arrested under Cofeposa, the accused is completely immobilized with all his operations freezed and bank accounts attached. During 2018-19, the CEIB had issued 51 detention orders under the Act. This was the highest so far in any year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centre-to-move-sc-against-hc-order/articleshow/87724450.cms||Pradeep Thakur

The police have identified the victim as Shahbuddin Ansari, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh. An officer from the Talegaon MIDC police said the victim was a painting worker and was staying at a rented accommodation in Indori village. “On Sunday night they were gambling inside the room, when the suspect and the victim got into a brawl over the rules of the game,” the officer said. He said the suspect, who stayed nearby, went home and returned with sharp weapons. His two relatives accompanied him as well. “The trio first brutally kicked and punched Ansari. The suspect’s relatives then held Ansari by his hands and the suspect stabbed him in the stomach, chest and near the left eye,” the officer further said. Another friend of Ansari took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. “We have arrested all the three suspects,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-stabbed-over-gambling-quarrel-three-men-arrested/articleshow/87724432.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to officials, several measures have been taken to reduce pollution levels caused by heavy construction activity all across the 82-km-long Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut stretch. Apart from constant sprinkling of water, 20 anti-smog guns have been deployed to settle the dust. "RRTS construction is in full swing on the entire route. Besides maintaining the pace of the construction, National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is taking proactive steps to minimise inconvenience to locals in the area. In this direction, extensive pollution control measures are also being taken in and around the construction sites," said NCRTC PRO Puneet Vats. He added that apart from establishment of water pumps at casting yards, air monitoring devices have also been installed at various points along the route to bring down dust levels. “Arrangements to remove the soil accumulated on the roadside by using broomer machines have also been made,” Vats said. Notably, post-Diwali, smog has been lingering in UP districts including Meerut and Ghaziabad, where RRTS construction is in full swing. The AQI levels (as per data released by the Central Pollution Control Board) are consistently in the ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ category. Presently, around 10,000 workers are engaged in the project that will connect Delhi, Meerut and Ghaziabad with a high-speed rail link. The project is slated to reach completion in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pollution-mitigation-major-challenge-for-delhi-meerut-rapid-transit-project-20-anti-smog-guns-deployed/articleshow/87723703.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Trichy||Encroachments shrink Kottapattu tank capacity||Trichy: Kottapattu tank, the second largest in Trichy city is facing a slow death with encroachments and poor maintenance shrinking the water storage capacity. As the tank was not desilted, the recent rain exposed its vulnerability as it flooded the nearby residential settlements instead of storing the water. Spread on 70 acres, the tank in ward 35 is fed both by rainwater accumulated in catchment areas and Cauvery water through the New Kattalaimettu canal. The Cauvery water would first fill the Sempattu tank near Trichy airport and the Kottapattu tank and finally the Mavadikulam tank in Ponmalaipatti. However, the channels interconnecting the tanks were not properly maintained and the sluice gates were encroached. During the recent rain, the tank flooded JK Nagar, RS Puram and other localities in Khajamalai. Authorities were forced to reduce the water level by pumping the rainwater to the drains. “The recent rainfall was wasted, the tank could have augmented the groundwater table in the Ponmalai localities if it was desilted,” K C Neelamegam, state treasurer, Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam said. The tank is presently maintained by the revenue department. Though the tank can store water for 10ft deep, officials said that even the 6ft level is causing inundation in adjacent areas since the bunds and supply channels were not properly maintained. “We have closed the water flow from the new Kattalaimettu canal. If the revenue department hands over the tank to us, we can develop the tank and bund as a recreational site besides improving the storage capacity under the Jal Jeevan Mission,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-shrink-kottapattu-tank-capacity/articleshow/87725360.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Indrani Mukerjea if she wishes to withdraw her bail petition||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday heard at some length on merits a bail plea filed by Indrani Mukerjea in the Sheena Bora murder case, and in the end orally asked her counsel, Sana Raees Khan, to take “her instructions” and inform if she wishes to withdraw it. Justice Nitin Sambre after a patient hearing orally observed, “on merits am not convinced.’’ He asked if she would like to withdraw the plea or attract an order on merits. Khan said since Indrani is in Byculla woman’s jail, she would need time to speak with her. The judge posted the matter for orders on Tuesday. Khan said it was the first bail plea of Indrani, 50, on merits before the HC. She pointed to various “contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies’’ and, citing SC orders, said Indrani is in jail for six years “as a pre-trial punishment” with no end in near sight for the trial. She said only 67 witnesses have been examined and the CBI has 185 more to go, apart from likely defence witnesses and the trial may drag on, thus impinging her fundamental right. Even on health grounds bail may be granted as Indrani’s “latest Sept 2021 report from JJ Hospital says she has an irreversible neurological condition, thus needing care,” Khan said. She said, “Entire case hinges on approver Shyamwar Rai’s story. He was arrested two days prior to her, on possession of arms. He denied such possession later destroying his credibility and as such foundation of case collapses.’’ Rai was Indrani’s driver and co-accused and is now the state witness. Khan also cited depositions by doctors and experts to argue that the skeletal and teeth remains as well as skull exhumed in 2015 after Indrani’s August 25, 2015 arrest from Pen and the one found in 2012 by Pen police in Raigad are not the same. CBI prosecutor Sandesh Patil with DP Singh said she has been denied bail five times since 2017. CBI said summons were issued to Rahul, son of co-accused Peter Mukerjea, but trial was held up due to Covid-19 and resumed on Feb 17. “Rahul Mukerjea will prove motive for murder and also that he dropped Sheena Bora near Amarsons showroom, Khar at 6.30 pm on 24.04.2012.” The CBI said that submitted that at the stage of granting of bail, the court can only go into the question of the prima facie case established for granting bail. It cannot go into the question of credibility and reliability of the witnesses put up by the Prosecution. “The question of credibility and reliability of Prosecution Witnesses can only be tested during the Trial,” it submitted. CBI reply also said mere long delay in trial and long period behind bars by themselves singly or conjointly are not enough for grant of bail as held by the Supreme Court in 2007 in C Yadav vs State of Maharashtra. It also cited another SC ruling in the case of “Rajesh Rajan Yadav v/s CBI in 2007 where it held that there is “no absolute rule that a long period of incarceration by itself would entitle an under trial to bail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-indrani-if-she-wishes-to-withdraw-her-bail-petition/articleshow/87725395.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mangaluru||Kodikal shuts down to protest desecration of Naga idol||Mangaluru: Activists of pro-Hindu outfits including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Jagran Vedike on Monday observed a bandh in Kodikal town to protest the alleged ‘desecration’ of the nagabimba or the idol of the snake god at the Nagabana temple on Friday. The bandh received widespread support among the people of the town, with most shops remaining closed in an expression of solidarity with the pro-Hindu outfits. In addition to the closure of businesses, bus services to Kodikal were suspended on Monday, while traffic movement was blocked along its roads. The protesting activists held a rally, to which many residents joined along the way, from Kodikal Katte to Nagabana, demanding police action against those responsible for the desecration of the idol. Secretary of VHP’s Mangaluru division Sharan Pumpwell, reiterating the outfit’s demand for stringent action against the culprits, said, “This will prevent attacks from Hindu shrines from recurring. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai must respect the religious sentiments of the people along the coast, who voted for Hindutva. This is the third time that idols of the snake god are being desecrated in the region. The first such incident was reported in Panambur, while the second was reported from Kuloor.” Gurupura Vajradehi Mutt pontiff Sri Rajashekarananda Swami alleged that police had arrested a mentally-challenged individual, charging him with desecrating the Naga idol at the Kuloor temple. “We are giving the cops 24 days to nab the culprits behind this attack in Kodikal. We will call for a bandh either in Mangaluru or call for a shutdown of the entire district if police do not take action against the miscreants responsible for desecrating our shrines. We have confidence that Mangaluru city police will solve the case soon, and we will present them with gold medals,” the seer said. Meanwhile, Mangaluru city police stepped up security in Kodikal, where they deployed additional forces on Monday. Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, Mangaluru City South MLA Y Bharath Shetty and other BJP leaders paid a visit to the Nagabana temple in Kodikal to take stock of the damage done to the Nagabimba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kodikal-shuts-down-to-protest-desecration-of-naga-idol/articleshow/87723659.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Bio-fungicide it developed can also be used in treating cumin wilt, says CISH||Lucknow: ICAR-FUSICONT, a unique bio-fungicide to control fungal disease causing wilting of banana crops, can also prove effective in managing the cumin wilt disease in Rajasthan, a study has found. ICAR-FUSICONT was originally developed by ICAR-Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH). While originally it was used to treat banana wilt, in a recent experiment, the CISH team also found it effective in managing the cumin wilt disease in Rajasthan. “Cumin wilt disease is causing losses of several crores of rupees, and in many places, the entire crop is being wiped out due to epidemics of the disease. Thousands of people in Rajasthan depend heavily on cumin, which is a short-season crop that can be grown with low input costs and yields high returns. ICAR-FUSICONT was used to manage this disease and successful results were obtained,” said director CISH Shailendra Rajan. He said Ph.D. students of renowned scientists of the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, T Damodaran conducted experiments in Rajasthan to test whether ICAR Fusicont can also control cumin wilt in the Jodhpur district and found that it was effective for cumin as well. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Gudamalani from the Barmer district requested Lucknow ICAR institutes to supply the product so that it could be extensively tested in their fields, he added. He said the experiment began in November 2020 in farmers’ fields in the hotspot area, using technology as a seed treatment at the time of sowing and later with irrigation water. Farmers saw encouraging results, which attracted scientists from Krishi Vigyan Kendra and other ICAR institutes to see the outcomes of the initiatives. They communicated with the Lucknow scientist to further discuss the possibility of using this technology to manage this unsolved problem in Rajasthan. “Farmers who used the technology last year are satisfied, and convinced that the banana technology can also be used with cumin, an important spice crop. The spice crop accounts for a significant portion of Indian spice exports,” said Rajan and added that the problem has been present in various parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan for many years on sandy soils. Researchers and farmers have been looking for an effective control measure for the wilt problem, but no remedy has been recommended that can successfully manage the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bio-fungicide-it-developed-can-also-be-used-in-treating-cumin-wilt-says-cish/articleshow/87705133.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Kota however, the air quality remained ‘very poor’ for the third consecutive day. For the forth straight day, the air quality in Udaipur continued to deteriorate as it AQI touched 348. For the second time in Jodhpur, the air quality turned ‘very poor’ this season. The first time its air quality turned ‘very poor’ was on November 5 (day after Diwali). Amid rising AQI in Delhi-NCR region, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) convened a crucial meeting on Sunday. The meeting, while soliciting views from the state governments of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, advised states to take measures to deal with the situation. The adverse air quality scenario in Delhi-NCR was a combined result of paddy stubble burning, vehicular pollution, post-Diwali pollution, dip in temperature and a dust storm moving in from the South-Westerly directions of the Thar desert which brought in huge quantities of dust that further amplified the PM2.5/PM10 levels significantly. Considering different aspects causing a spike in the air pollution levels, the commission during the meeting reiterated that actions recommended by the orders of the sub-committee, shall be strictly implemented by the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipurs-air-improves-aqi-of-other-raj-cities-deteriorates/articleshow/87725382.cms||---

The government has allowed schools to open with 100% capacity looking at the low number of Covid cases being reported. However in most of the districts, a large number of parents seem to be still reluctant to send their children to school. Bal Vidya Vidhyashram School principal Pratima Sharma said that response was better in lower classes. “Response was good in lower classes as higher class students have become habituated with online classes. In class XI, mid-term is going on so they were not in high number. We are conducting classes in online and offline modes,” said Sharma. A similar response came from Subodh Public School, Jaipur. According to the school administration, attendance was around 55% and it was expected to rise in the coming days. Cambridge Court High School is functioning in 50% capacity and will open 100% from Wednesday. Principal Lata Rawat said they would be keeping the option of online classes. Some parents were concerned about their kids attending school. Monika Sharma, a parent of class II student said, “I had gone to pick up my child from school. It was difficult to see children of smaller classes not maintaining social distancing. I request government not to risk the lives of children as cases of Covid have started to rise again.” Some parents also complained about online classes being shut down by schools forcing parents to send their children for physical classes. Surprisingly, the state government in its SOP released has not mentioned whether schools have to continue online classes along with offline. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh said, “We are receiving complaints from many parents that schools have shut down online classes. Parents are being forced to send students to school, which is risking their lives. Government must take action against such schools. The government hasn’t clarified this statement whether online classes should be available. This is being used by the private schools.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-reopen-in-full-capacity-parents-reluctant-to-send-kids/articleshow/87725375.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Experts bat for sero-survey among a sample of Covid-19 vaccinated population||PUNE: Experts have called for a sero-survey among a sample of vaccinated population to estimate the antibody levels months after completion of their inoculation schedule. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, told TOI, “It has been some time after the last sero-survey in Pune. Hence, another sero-survey is required, especially after many healthcare workers have completed over six months post-vaccination. It will help in gauging whether a booster shot is required or not.” Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of the Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, said, “It would be ideal to pick people in Pune’s select pockets and test serum samples for antibody levels six months after the total vaccination. Authorities now have data on completely vaccinated individuals, who have had months elapsing after the second dose of the vaccine.” He said, “Such people could be picked for the sero-survey. If there is a declining level of antibodies, then a booster shot could be recommended. Booster shots in such cases would ensure maintenance of population immunity against Covid to keep another surge at bay.” Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, however, said evidence in western countries showed that booster shots should be given to immunocompromised patients or those at a higher risk of Covid. He said, “Antibody titers tend to reduce after a few months post-vaccination. However, the absence or reduction of antibodies in the serum does not necessarily mean an absence of immune memory, which is also induced by vaccination. So instead of only correlating sero-survey to check for circulating antibodies post-vaccination, a sero-survey is needed to detect if there are any neutralizing antibodies in the population.” Antibody titer is a type of blood test that determines the presence and level (titer) of antibodies in the blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-bat-for-sero-survey-among-a-sample-of-vaccinated-population/articleshow/87724452.cms||Neha Madaan

Around six nurses attempted to scale the parapet of the building to jump. One of the nurses suffered low blood pressure and was taken to hospital, but later she returned to join the protest. Around 11am, hundreds of nurses from all over the state blocked the entry and exit of the building for over six hours. The office staff, including the director, were locked inside and visitors were also not allowed to move till the police acted and let them out from the backdoor. The nurses raised slogans against Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and said they would end their lives if their demands for regularisation were not met. Led by Karanjit Kaur (Ludhiana), Ninder Kaur (Muktsar) and Kamaljit Kaur Patti, the NHM nurses forced the employees and Health Services and Family Welfare, Punjab (HSFWP), director to remain inside the building for hours. Patti said, “We have been pressing for our demands for regularisation of our services for the past many years. We want to be brought on a par with other ranks, but the Punjab government has been giving only assurances. Today we laid a siege to the building and will not move till we are heard and our demands met.” Many nurses were seen carrying their babies in their laps while protesting and raising slogans against the Punjab government. Director not allowed to leave The protesting nurses did not allow Om Prakash Gojra, director, health services and family welfare, Punjab, to leave the building around 4pm. As he came out, he was gheraoed by the protesters and was forced to retreat. On seeing him go back, the protesting nurses celebrated their win by clapping and raising slogans in their favour. Later, when the director told them that he had to go for a meeting to discuss their issue with the CM, they let him go around 4:30pm. They are knocking at wrong door: Director The protesting nurses’ union is knocking at the wrong door as the National Health Mission (NHM) employees aren’t governed by HSFWP, said director Om Prakash Gojra. “So, they should have protested outside the office of NHM in Sector 38 instead of Sector 34. They came to the wrong door,” he added. The NHM office is housed at Prayaas Building in Sector 38-B, while the nurses protested at Parivar Kalyan Bhavan in Sector 34.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-nurses-climb-building-in-sector-34-threaten-to-jump/articleshow/87724463.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Unfair contract conditions can be challenged: Consumer redressal panel||T’puram: In a judgement that has far-reaching consequences, Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has reserved the right to maintain petitions that challenge provisions of a contract that are unfair to a consumer. Considering a petition filed by United India Insurance challenging the maintainability of a plea by the family of a deceased fisherman in Kollam, commission president justice K Surendra Mohan ruled that as per Section 47 and 2(4) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the commission can maintain complaints against ‘unfair’ contracts. The basis of the petition was a case filed by Jessy Malar, wife of late Charles, seeking compensation for the untimely death of her husband. Charles and three others ventured into the Arabian Sea for fishing at 5am on Oct 17, 2019 from Kollam harbour. At 3pm, there was heavy thunder and lightning close to the vessel and Charles fainted. He was brought to Benziger Hospital by 4:30pm where he was declared brought dead. Charles was covered by a group insurance policy issued by United Indian Insurance in conjunction with Matsyafed. When the family tried to claim the insurance money of Rs 10 lakh, the firm refused it on the ground that Charles died of a heart attack. As per the insurance contract, ‘death due to natural cause and diseases, including heart attack’ won’t come under its coverage. But, Jessy contended that the policy provisions were arranged by Matsyafed and she had no role in it. She said the condition that the insured is not covered for ‘death due to natural cause and diseases, including heart attack’ is an unacceptable term, liable to be set aside by the commission if it exercised its power under Section 49(2) of the Consumer Protection Act (2019). Quoting an apex court order in 2006, the counsel of the insurance firm argued that the prayer for declaring the term of insurance policy as null and void on the ground that it is unfair, went against the existence of the policy and cannot be sustained. The removal of the said clause will be illegal and result in policy collapse. The counsel also pointed out that the term that is sought to be set aside by the complainant is not an unfair condition. The commission dismissed the arguments as untenable and said it has power to entertain such complaints, against ‘unfair agreement conditions’, as per the provisions of the new act passed by Parliament in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/unfair-contract-conditions-can-be-challenged-consumer-redressal-panel/articleshow/87724494.cms||B S Anilkumar

The girl’s body was found in a cane field on Saturday midnight. Her family had refused to cremate the body on Sunday as they wanted the culprits to be arrested, compensation and a government job for a family member. It was only after Pilibhit district magistrate Pulkit Khare spoke with them that they relented. Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit superintendent of police, told TOI, “The autopsy report said there were multiple injuries on the girl's body and she died of strangulation. The forensic report will confirm the allegation of sexual assault. We are expecting a breakthrough in this case soon.” Locals at the village say that people often gather and consume liquor near the sugarcane field where the girl’s body was found. The village pradhan had earlier lodged a complaint to the effect at the local police outpost but no action was taken. A few empty beer bottles and wrappers of snacks were found near the body. Former state minister and Samajwadi Party leader Hemraj Verma, who has been in constant touch with the bereaved family, has demanded the state government to provide Rs 1 crore as compensation to the victim’s family. SP workers also took out a candle march on Monday evening as a mark of protest against increasing crime in the state. Verma told TOI, “The BJP government in the state is unable to control the crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/as-cops-hunt-for-killers-pilibhit-schoolgirl-is-cremated/articleshow/87722998.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Department officials said hostel facilities are being inspected and a notification regarding their reopening will be issued soon. Colleges reopened in October but several outstation students have not been able to attend in-person classes as hostels remained closed. Joint director of the department of higher and technical education, Kirankumar Bondar, said hostels in colleges affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune district are ready for reopening. “Most hostels are operated by the management of the institutions. Some hostels are under the revenue department and institutions have been asked to take charge so that they can be reopened for students,” said Bondar. Many hostels were being used by the district administration during the pandemic as quarantine centres. Some of these hostels are still under the district administration. A student based in Solapur, Ashraf Baig, said he has not been able to return to Pune despite enrolling at a college hostel as it has not opened. “I have got both doses of the vaccine but cannot stay in private accommodation as it is unaffordable. Students had also written to the college authorities to open the hostel and promised that we would follow all precautionary measures. If the government allows hostels to reopen, it will be good for us,” said Baig.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/college-hostels-gear-up-to-reopen-soon-providing-relief-to-outstation-students/articleshow/87724467.cms||---

The plea also invoked a section through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. On Wednesday, a non-bailable warrant was issued against Singh, the third such.

They were allegedly mowed down by Ashish's convoy. In retaliatory action, farmers had allegedly lynched three BJP workers. Special prosecution officer S P Yadav said that since the investigation report has mentioned Ashish as the prime accused in the case and a special investigation team (SIT) had gathered sufficient evidence against him, bail was denied to him and two of his aides, Luv Kush Rana and Ashish Pandey. District government counsel (DGC) Arvind Tripathi told TOI, “The defence hid Ashish's criminal history. Also, an SDM and a circle officer recorded statements saying Ashish was seen running away from the spot after the farmers were mowed down." He said this was corroborated by over 60 farmers who had given statements that suggested Ashish's presence at the incident spot. "The statements also said that he was sitting inside the Thar jeep in the co-driver seat. His presence was further confirmed by the SIT investigation, which said that the mobile location of Ashish showed that he was there during the violence. The investigation also showed that he ran towards a cane field firing towards the farmers. The ballistic report of his rifle was also found positive in the forensic test. Since allegations against Ashish are grave and the investigation is still pending, the judge rejected the bail plea,” Tripathi explained. Judge Mukesh Mishra had in the afternoon reserved the judgment after arguments between district government counsel Arvind Tripathi and Ashish Mishra's counsel Awadesh Singh. The judgment was later pronounced in the evening. Advocate Harjeet Singh, who is representing the farmers, said a key contention during the arguments was disclosure of past criminal history. “The bail application was filed by the brother-in-law of Ashish and the application mentioned he didn’t have any criminal history. However, the police report said that he had two FIRs registered against him in the past at the Tikunia police station. Over 60 farmers had seen him at the spot firing from inside the jeep. We are happy his bail was rejected,” he said. Ashish's counsel Awadesh Singh said that he will approach the high court as his client is "innocent and was framed because he is the son of a minister." He added: "The old cases against him are already closed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-was-at-kheri-violence-spot-govt-counsel-tells-court-bail-denied-to-ashish/articleshow/87723016.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The incident took place at around 3.05pm when three employees of Maa Janki petrol pump located at Hajipur in Vaishali district were on their way to R-Block in Patna to deposit the money in the Bank of India branch. The criminals, who had covered their faces with helmets and masks, stopped the car alleging that it had dashed against their motorbikes. As soon as the driver of the car stopped, the robbers snatched the bag containing the money. Three employees of the fuel outlet, including manager Anunay Kumar, were travelling in the car. The bag was held by one Sanjeet on the back seat. He was assaulted with pistol butts when he resisted the loot. The manager told the police that they had left the former minister’s residence at New Patliputra Colony for the bank with the cash. The robbers waylaid the car near Atal Path at Indrapuri road number 10 and looted the money at gunpoint. They then drove away towards R-Block roundabout. City SP (central) Ambarish Rahul along with police officials of the nearby police stations rushed to the site and also quizzed the car driver, Chandan Sharma, a resident of Lalganj in Vaishali, and Sanjeet, a native of Saran district. Authoritative sources said SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma later visited the residence of Veena Shahi, the daughter-in-law of former Union minister late L P Shahi. City SP Rahul said the CCTV footage along the Atal Path was being obtained to ascertain the identity of the gang involved in the loot. “We will crack the case very soon,” he told reporters. The former minister’s son-in-law, Harshendra, told the police that the employees used to carry the money in the same vehicle for a long time. “The staff have been associated with the agency for long,” Anunay, the manager of Maa Janki Transport Service, told the investigating officials. Earlier, a trader was shot at and robbed of Rs15 lakh under the Malsalami police station area in Patna City late Sunday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs41-41-lakh-looted-from-ex-ministers-petrol-pump-staff/articleshow/87724490.cms||Ramashankar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anticipatory bail for CA booked in bogus surety case||Mumbai: In a relief for a city chartered accountant (CA), the Bombay high court recently granted him pre-arrest bail after he was booked for submitting a bogus surety. Justice Surendra Tavade passed the order on a plea by Behram Pardiwala (66) who was booked on May 27 by D B Marg police station for cheating by personation, forgery and using as true a certificate known to be false. His petition said he has been practising since 36 years and provided services to high net individuals and respected personalities such as former attorney general late Soli Sorabjee and jeweller Dinshah Gazdar and their families. Pardiwala was a co-testator of a man’s will. After his death, his brother in December 2015 filed a complaint that the will was forged and fabricated. Pardiwala surrendered to Tardeo police, was jailed and released on bail in March 2016. In 2018, it was found that the man who stood surety for him had submitted false and bogus documents. When Pardiwala learnt an offence was registered against Padwekar, he approached the magistrate who allowed him to furnish cash security. Pardiwala’s advocates Sujay Kantawala and Neha Ahuja said the FIR does not attribute any illegality to him. Justice Tavade, in his November 4 order, said it was the duty of Pardiwala’s advocate to verify the document of surety, which he had verified and after scrutiny it was accepted. “Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicant (Pardiwala) was concerned with the preparation of the document of his surety. Prima facie, no offence is made out against the applicant,” he said, directing that if arrested, Pardiwala will be released on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 with a condition to attend the police station whenever called.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-anticipatory-bail-for-ca-booked-in-bogus-surety-case/articleshow/87725421.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Four people, including three salesmen at the showroom, have been arrested. All the chains have been recovered. Sanjay Goel, director of the jewellery showroom, has announced a cash reward of Rs 2.50 lakh for the probe team for 100% recovery of the stolen chains. Abhishek Yadav, Muzaffarnagar SSP, said a joint team of the crime branch and city police was formed to crack the case. After exhaustive scanning of CCTV footage of the area, sleuths noticed a man with a slight limp leave the shop and disappear after walking some distance to an area where CCTV cameras were not installed. A few hours later, another man was seen in the area with a different set of clothes but with the same gait. Suspicious, the sleuths zeroed in on one Tushar, a resident of Muzaffarnagar . Based on the information he provided, police arrested a sales assistant at the shop, Abhishek, and two of his colleagues, Kanhaiya and Ketan. The SSP claimed, “Abhishek, Kanhaiya and Ketan planned the heist. They also bought Tushar, alias Lucky, in the plan. Posing as a customer, Tushar entered the jewellery shop on November 7. The salesmen had already put a plastic box filled with the gold chains at a select spot, which Tushar picked up and walked out.” The robbery was “discovered” later and police summoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/distinct-gait-helps-police-nab-jewel-thieves/articleshow/87723752.cms||Mohd Dilshad

But the manufacturer and retailer of Jaipur Kurti brand on ecommerce platforms like Myntra, Flipkart, and Ajio says the real growth phase is waiting to be unwrapped soon. “We have created a roadmap to reach Rs 400 crore revenue by 2026. For that we need to raise capital. Multiple options are on the table, including diluting additional equity at the right price,” explains Mundhra who listed Nandani Creation on NSE’s SME bourse in 2017 and now traded on the main board of the exchange. Part of the plan is also to strengthen the company’s online platform jaipurkurti.com and go offline with 60 stores. Currently, it has opened four in Jaipur and one in Sriganganagar. Another five will come up by the end of the current financial year. “Some of the funds will be used for rebooting our online platform and building an offline presence. The rest will be invested in creating more production capacity. Whatever we produce today flies off the shelves. That is why we need growth capital now,” adds Mundhra. While Jaipur Kurti has enriched its product portfolio with indo-western wear, Mundhra says the soul of the company resides in ethnic wear. “India lives in its traditions and culture. Holi, Diwali, Rakhi, weddings and a host of festivals and rituals create demand for ethnic wear round the year. That has continued to support our growth and will remain at the core. However, to give variety to our customers, we are expanding our trendy ensembles,” says Mundhra. Recalling his early days, Mundhra says that formal education never interested him but later he wanted to make a mark and create his own identity. After making some money from trading, he took up job works for kurtis. But a visit to Delhi in early 2012 became a turning point. “After seeing Jabong and Snapdeal billboards in a metro station I thought this is going to be the new theme for young India. On the same day, after reaching Jaipur I booked jaipurkurti.com domain and the rest is history,” says Mundhra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sales-boy-to-kurti-king-jaipurs-mundhra-on-a-roll/articleshow/87725457.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

He said there are several apprehensions about the project and government is committed to clearing them. People should understand that the project will be an integral part of state’s development. Vijayan also sought their support to exert pressure on Centre to set up more natural calamity warning systems, centres in Kerala. Centre hasn’t considered our long-pending demand of setting up a Doppler radar at Wayanad-Kozhikode border. At present, state has two such radars but it is insufficient. It needs such systems in every district due to the prevailing situation, he said. Vijayan said the Centre was encroaching on the powers of the governments in several sectors. There is a need to strengthen ties between state and Centre in sharing development, welfare initiatives and MPs must stand with the government to ensure that Kerala’s demands are fulfilled by Centre. GST arrears and vaccine supply are the examples of such efforts, he added. Kerala must get GST compensation for five consecutive years after July 2022. For this, MPs must put in extra efforts and get it sanctioned from the Centre. The state has concerns over the proposed power sector reforms and the port policy. The restrictions imposed on states for releasing disaster funds should be relaxed. Vijayan sought their help to secure sanctions for the light metro projects in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode.

This has disappointed visitors coming for bird watching from the lake's regulatory end. UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai says the cut will be filled by the UT engineering department as soon as water level goes down, after which the visitors can enjoy bird watching from the regulatory end. However, visitors can still enter the Sukhna Lake nature trail and enjoy a walk and bird watching from the Lake Club side. This monsoon, the UT administration had opened Sukhna floodgates on five occasions as the water had reached near danger mark of 1,163 feet. A senior UT official says they had opened gates as a precautionary measure to avoid flood-like situation in Baltana, Zirakpur. The gates were opened on September 30, September 23, September 21, August 14 and August 9. Two floodgates had to be opened in August last year after the water level crossed the danger mark. On September 24, 2018, incessant rain in the catchment area had forced officials to open two floodgates. At that time, these were opened after a gap of 10 years. After opening of the floodgates, the Sukhna Choe carries the excess water to the Ghaggar River.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cut-on-nature-trail-to-make-way-for-water-from-catchment-area/articleshow/87724522.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

They are undergoing treatment in a private hospital at Peelamedu. A health official with the city corporation said both the infected were elderly people - a 63-year-old woman from RS Puram and another 68-year-old woman from Peelamedu. “They are not related and hail from different parts of the city.” The official said the two had symptoms similar to Covid-19 and approached the private hospital for Covid-19 testing. While they tested negative for Covid-19, they were found to be infected with swine flu. The official said the family members and contacts of the infected people were being closely monitored. “Presently, Tamiflu tablets are being distributed to the people who came in contact and the family members of the infected. We have asked them to stay in isolation.” He said 64 medical camps were being conducted daily in the city limits by the urban primary health centres to monitor dengue, Covid-19 and swine flu cases. The official said there was no need to panic. He, however, advised the residents to follow precautionary measures. “People have to wash hands frequently, wear face masks, disinfect floors and avoid touching surfaces often. The swine flu symptoms are similar to that of Covid-19. People have to isolate themselves immediately, if they develop symptoms. They have to be in isolation until they test negative for the infectious diseases.” Swine flu infected people, he said, could recover without any complications. “However, it can, as in the case of Covid-19, create complications for the people with comorbidities.” City corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, meanwhile, asked the people to keep their houses and surroundings clean, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. “People should approach medical camps or the nearest government hospital, if they have any symptoms like fever, cough and headache.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/swine-flu-surfaces-in-city-two-test-ve-for-infection/articleshow/87725449.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Pay Rs 22-cr property tax arrears: MC notice to PU||Chandigarh: After an exercise of almost six months, the municipal corporation has finally prepared about Rs 22-crore property tax arrears of Panjab University (PU) and sent a notice. It has asked PU to pay as soon as possible or face action as per rules. This is the biggest property tax amount notice issued to any single authority during the ongoing current financial year.MC’s tax branch had conducted a detailed survey of all the buildings and areas of PU to calculate the amount. Since the campus is quite big with many multi-storey buildings, the authority had deployed its technical and other staff for the physical survey. “The arrears were prepared considering all buildings in the records. Earlier, the residential areas of the university were not taken into account, and it is a big chunk of the campus. But this time, all houses of the PU employees have been considered,” sources said.Earlier, there was ambiguity over the amount to be paid and buildings covered under the property tax. The MC had multiple meetings with the officials concerned. PU officials met senior MC officers and submitted their own records too, which differed from the civic records, so it was decided by both PU and MC to have a fresh survey.Since the property tax is one of the significant sources of revenue, the civic body has been putting in all efforts to collect the maximum amount. The defaulters are being sent notices and some properties have also been sealed in the recent past.PU paid Rs 68L tax Panjab University has deposited property tax of around Rs 68 lakh for the current financial year. But now the university has to pay a huge amount of arrears to avoid further action by the municipal corporation.-----Rs 46.5cr taxAs per records, the municipal corporation has received Rs 46.5 crore in property tax from both residential and commercial properties. Out of this, Rs 13 crore have come from the residential properties and remaining Rs 33.5 crore from commercial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pay-rs-22-cr-property-tax-arrears-mc-notice-to-pu/articleshow/87724513.cms||Deepak Yadav

They heard MSRTC’s contempt plea even as the union was not willing to end the strike. The union’s advocate Gunaratan Sadavarte refused to participate in the HC-appointed committee’s second meeting on Tuesday, saying it has no faith in it. He said 36 employees had died by suicide and two attempted immolation. “Nobody should end their life in such a way. Inform your (union) leader that every life is precious,” said Justice Varale. The judges said when a worker, who is the only earning member, dies by suicide, it is a loss of the entire family. “It is our appeal, an earnest request, that nobody should take such an extreme step,” said Justice Varale. Sadavarte thereafter agreed to submit the union’s memorandum and suggestions to the committee. The judges directed the state to place minutes before the court on November 22, adding “that minutes may also indicate the progress or otherwise. Senior advocate S U Kamdar for MSRTCsaid people in rural areas were facing hardships in the absence of other convenient and economic transport. He said some employees are cooperating and the union must not stop them. Sadavarte claimed 92,000 staff are supporting the union, “When they are not going to drive vehicles, where is the question of disturbing?” he asked. The judges said since the union believes in “peaceful agitation”, they expect it will “show the same spirit to their fellow colleagues”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-dont-stop-staffers-willing-to-work-hc-tells-msrtc-union/articleshow/87729425.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Jaipur||Report on contractual staffers almost ready, says energy minister BD Kalla||JAIPUR: Water and energy minister BD Kalla has said the three-year-old committee of contractual workers constituted by his government had almost prepared its report on the working conditions of the staffers on contract. He issued a statement mentioning that during the previous government in the state, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, was the chairman of the panel constituted for contractual workers, but it did nothing during its entire tenure for the interests of contractual workers. Kalla said regarding some of the issues raised by the Rathore in Bikaner on Monday, the report was almost ready. In such a situation, those who were sitting idle for five years had no right to talk about contract workers, he said. The minister said that ever since the committee of contractual workers was formed during the tenure of the present government, about 10,000 contractual workers had been regularised with bonus marks under the medical and health department, whereas no benefit was given to the contract workers at the time of the previous government. Kalla said most of the committees constituted by the state government under his chairmanship had completed their work on time.  The work of committees related to the naming of schools after freedom fighters and implementation of the public manifesto was going to be done regularly. Their meetings were also being organised regularly and work was pending with the committees, he said. Kalla also said when Rathore was a cabinet minister in the previous government, the state government had handed over the work of electricity in Bikaner, Bharatpur, and Kota to private companies for 20 years and Rathore should now tell under which rule its 'contract' should be cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/report-on-contractual-staffers-almost-ready-says-energy-min-kalla/articleshow/87725462.cms||---

There is no shortage of vaccines and it has no adverse effect. Hence, people should understand that they are responsible not only towards the health of their families, but society too,” he said. Special emphasis should be given to ensure adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour in educational institutions, he said, and directed officials to visit schools and colleges regularly. “Submit a report to me through the zilla panchayat CEO,” he said. Deputy director of public instructions (DDPI) Malleswamy said that the attendance in classes from 1 to 5 was 51%, while it was 69% in classes from 6-8 and 81% in classes from 9-10. The district has 210 children who lost parents, including five losing both the parents, he said. The Lokayukta directed officials to expedite the distribution of the government’s ex-gratia. On the vaccination of children, the DDPI said the district had identified 2,467 physically-challenged children. A vaccine drive will begin soon after the stock arrives, he added. The Lokayukta visited a government higher primary school in Gandhinagar and the vaccine centre at the Wenlock District Hospital.

Meanwhile, BJP leaders continued to back striking unions, while some leaders addressed a protest at Azad Maidan.

Around 85,000 employees, along with 28 different unions, are still on strike as the deadlock continued for the 19th day on Monday.

Though red flags are erected at all beach stretches to indicate no swimming zones, a lifeguard said it is not easy to manage a beach when crowd swells as most of the visitors swim wherever they want even after being warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/13-tourists-rescued-over-the-weekend/articleshow/87725529.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Flight movement, passenger traffic go up||Coimbatore: The city airport has recorded an 11.3% increase in flight movement in October, compared to September. As per the data available with the Airport Authority of India (AAI) officials, the city had handled 1,112 flights in October, against 999 flights in September. However, only 56 international flights were operated last month, compared to 178 in the comparable period in 2019, when operations were normal. The dip in the international flight has affected the international passenger traffic as well. The airport has, however, recorded a 15% increase in passenger traffic last month, when the airport handled 1, 25, 053 domestic passengers and 6,824 international passengers, compared to September. “Both the passenger traffic and flight movement are on the rise every month. It shows people are confident of the safety protocols taken by the AAI. Moreover, decrease in Covid-19 infection and increase in the vaccinated population have further bolstered the confidence of fliers,” an airport official said. Flight movements were disrupted during the peak of second Covid-19 wave from May. While the airport had resumed flight operations in July, it was only after August that the airport began to record a good passenger traffic. Tour operators, meanwhile, said most of the people were flying out of the city for business and leisure activities. “Most of the flights are witnessing packed movement, thanks to the government’s decision to allow flights to operate with 100% occupancy from October 18. The airport will record more fliers this month, as we have got a few more connections in the winter schedule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flight-movement-passenger-traffic-go-up/articleshow/87725474.cms||V Devanathan

The accused, N Rajasekar, 62, a silambam and kalari instructor from Pappanaickenpalayam in the city, was booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Preliminary inquiry revealed Rajasekar was in a relationship with a woman. His friend A Muruganandam, 57, a wall painter from Mariamman Kovil Street, also tried to have an affair with the woman.

Also, it is likely that the session is held in Mumbai and not Nagpur. A senior minister said that since the biennial election to the Maharashtra Legislative Council will be held on December 10, all parties have been asking the government to defer the session by at least a week. Officials, however, said that although political parties want the session to start late, a final decision will be taken by the business advisory committee which is headed by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and has representatives of all political parties. Also, due to Thackeray's recent cervical spine surgery, the session may be held in Mumbai itself this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-winter-session-of-legislature-may-be-delayed/articleshow/87725494.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Teen girl in Beed alleges rape by 400 men, including 2 cops, over 4-6 months||AURANGABAD: The Beed police probing a case of child marriage and alleged rape subsequently by several men were stunned after the 17-year-old victim claimed in a statement given to the child welfare committee that she had been raped by around 400 men, including two policemen, over the past four to six months. The girl’s statement was recorded on November 12, days after a first information report (FIR) in the case had been registered with the police. Sources said the girl was initially reluctant to lodge a complaint but gave her statement after she was counselled. The police have now taken the girl’s supplementary statement on record and launched a fresh probe. They suspect it to be a case of human trafficking and that the minor was forced into the flesh trade. When contacted, investigating officer and additional superintendent of police Kavita Nerkar said, “The girl was rescued by an NGO and brought to us, following which an offence was registered on November 8. So far, six men have been arrested and a minor boy has been detained and sent to a correctional home.” Among those arrested are the girl’s father, the man she was married off to and an alleged pimp. The girl said in her statement that she was married when she was 13 but left her husband due to alleged differences and exploitation by him. She returned to her parents’ home some time ago. She further stated that after her father molested her earlier this year, she left home in May or June and had been staying in and around the Ambajogai bus stand, from where the NGO volunteers rescued her. The police have registered a case of rape, gang rape, molestation and voluntarily causing hurt, besides invoking sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Beed superintendent of police R Raja told TOI, “Four days after registration of the FIR, the victim has alleged that she has been raped by 400 men. We are verifying the claim and will act accordingly.” DISCLAIMER: (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/girl-17-alleges-rape-by-400-men-including-2-cops-over-4-6-months/articleshow/87726664.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kota narcotics officer’s suspension to continue||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court upheld the Central Administrative Tribunal order to continue the suspension of Sahiram Meena, a former deputy narcotics commissioner of Kota, who has been accused of corruption and possession of disproportionate assets by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). Meena challenged the central administrative tribunal’s order citing that the ACB failed to file chargesheet within three months of his arrest and the extension of suspension from service was illegal. The ACB raided his office and residence for accepting illegal gratification. He was placed under suspension on February 1, 2019. A criminal case was registered against him after ten days. Later on, another case of disproportionate assets to his known source of income was registered against him. His suspension was extended on April 24, 2019, which was challenged by him in the administrative tribunal. The tribunal had upheld his suspension. The petitioner then challenged the tribunal order in the high court. The high court, while upholding the decision of the tribunal, said, "We do not consider that the order passed by the tribunal suffers from any illegality or perversity to call for interference. We cannot resist mentioning that the petitioner was facing serious charges of corruption. The petitioner was suspended on February 1, 2019, and retired from service upon attaining the age of superannuation on July 31, 2019.

---||Kochi||Police summon hotel owner, driver||Kochi: Police probing the Chakkaraparambu accident – in which three persons, including two models were killed – said that the statements of the hotel owner, where the victims attended a party on the night of the accident, and the driver of another car which followed their vehicle will be crucial in identifying if there was more to the accident than what meets the eye. Police have identified that the driver of the Audi car, which was seen driving close to the victim’s car, too had attended the party at the hotel in Fort Kochi. A senior officer said that summons were sent to the hotel owner and the car driver and they are likely to appear before the investigation team on Tuesday. Police were still considering it as a drunken driving incident but the inability to get access to full recordings at the party had led to some suspicions. “An investigation is underway and after collecting more witness statements, we will get better clarity on the incidents,” said an officer. Police are also investigating if something, other than the influence of alcohol, caused the driver to increase the car’s speed. On Monday, the investigation team interrogated the driver, Abdul Rahman (25), also the accused and sole survivor in the case. Though police had sought a three-day custody on Monday morning, the court only granted custody of the accused till the end of the day. He was later granted bail by the court. The accused, who was remanded on Monday evening, is likely to execute bail on Tuesday. Earlier, his counsel had opposed police custody, arguing that the youth was undergoing severe mental trauma and that he was physically weak after being injured. The case pertains to the accident that occurred in the early hours of Nov 1, when the car rammed a tree at Chakkaraparambu while trying to avoid hitting a bike. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer and Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan died on the spot. The third passenger Mohammad Ashiq (25) later died at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-summon-hotel-owner-driver/articleshow/87724561.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Not up for jab? Street plays, lucky draws may change your mind||Nagpur/Pune: From offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students to motivate the unvaccinated, health officials in Maharashtra are going the extra mile to woo citizens to take the Covid shot.The officials are also using creative methods like organising street plays and providing doorstep counselling to win citizens over in favour of vaccination, in addition to deploying routine educational tools like posters, hoardings and mass media.The above 18 population in she state is 9.14 crore. Of them, 6.9 crore have taken the first dose. However, the remaining 2.23 crore have not yet taken even a single shot.State immunisation officer Sachin Desai said, “We are doing every bit to motivate and convince the state’s unvaccinated population of above 18 years to take the shot. District collectors are making use of different creative methods to achieve 100% vaccination coverage.”State health minister Rajesh Tope recently told collectors across the state to opt for measures aimed at persuasion and not coercion to boost vaccination. The state is working towards giving at least one dose to all the 9.14 crore eligible population by November 30.In Chandrapur, the civic body is offering expensive electronic luxury and home appliances under a lucky draw to ensure that the 39,000 unvaccinated citizens come forward to get the first shot.Municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite said, “We don’t want to leave any stone unturned. An LED TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine and 10 mixer grinders would be awarded to the citizens through lucky draw. This move is certainly improving the vaccination numbers to some extent in Chandrapur.”“The beneficiaries have to drop a photocopy of his/her first dose in the special box kept outside every vaccination centre. We are going to announce the lucky winners after November 24,” Mohite said.Chandrapur district administration is also pasting stickers outside commercial establishments where staff is unvaccinated so that customers have a choice whether they want to enter such a shop or not.In Yavatmal, where over 10 lakh citizens are yet to take the first dose, the administration is seeking the help of schoolkids. “We are telling parents that they need to take the shot for the safety of their kids. We are also involving school kids to motivate unvaccinated family members and neighbours,” said district collector Amol Yedge.Akola resident deputy collector Sanjay Khadse said they would give ‘sanman patra’ (felicitation certificates) to kids who are able to convince unvaccinated people in homes and localities.Nashik district’s health official Kailas Bhoye said, “We are taking help of religious heads in Malegaon to create awareness to increase vaccination.”Vaccination in Nashik city and rural parts of the district has crossed 74%, but has remained slow in the limits of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) where only 27% of the beneficiaries have been administered the first dose.Aurangabad’s immunisation officer Smita Nalgirkar said concerted efforts were being taken to enhance vaccination coverage among the unvaccinated.“We are carrying out door-to-door visits of health teams to reach out. Besides, we are also making phone calls and spreading public awareness in general,” Nalgirkar said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 3 had held a virtual meeting involving authorities from Aurangabad and other districts where vaccination coverage is relatively lower.(Inputs from Prasad Joshi from Aurangabad & Tushar Pawar from Nashik)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-up-for-jab-street-plays-lucky-draws-may-change-your-mind/articleshow/87723102.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Over 42.4 lakh people late for second Covid-19 jab in West Bengal||Kolkata: Over 42.4 lakh people in Bengal, who received their first vaccine doses, have not turned up for their second doses in time. Even as the state government is trying to step up its second dose vaccination drive in November, the reluctance of people to take the second dose is is baffling experts. Since November 8, the state government has been trying to trace and vaccinate the people who have not taken their second doses. As part of the special drives on November 8, 4.3 lakh people were administered their second doses — the highest in recent months. Since then, the state is trying to prioritise the second dose recipients and inoculate 2 lakh recipients every day. On Sunday, this has dipped to 40,674 second dose recipients. After the Centre’s nod, Bengal has already announced it will soon launch the house-to-house search for eligible adults who are yet to get vaccinated. Bengal’s vaccination drive is moving at a fast pace with around 8.5 crore people being vaccinated. Over six crore people of the seven crore eligible population has already received one dose while the other 2.5 crore people have received both their doses. The skewed first-dose and second-dose recipients in Bengal are also throwing up an anomaly, sources said. A senior health official said, “At several meetings district officials and KMC officials have been sensitised on the need to step up the second dose vaccination drive. Those, who have not taken their second doses, need to be identified and encouraged for vaccination. The Centre is likely to provide some clarity on the booster doses by the year-end. Given this situation, second dose vaccination needs to be completed in time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-42-4l-late-for-2nd-jab-enough-shots-says-state/articleshow/87724554.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Kasganj cops find ‘kidnapped’ girl at railway station, produce her in court||AGRA: A week after a 16-year-old girl was allegedly “kidnapped” by 22-year-old Mohammad Altaf -- who was later found "hanging" from a 3ft-high water tap in the washroom of the thana on November 9 – the Kasganj police on Monday produced her in court for recording her statement, claiming she was found “sitting alone” at the town's railway station on Friday evening. Police said they are yet to nab the “unknown” friend with whom Altaf had allegedly "sent the girl into hiding". This development came even as videos of her with Altaf, sitting and laughing together, surfaced on Monday, raising more uncomfortable questions for the Kasganj police, five of whom have been suspended and a few unnamed ones booked for murder. SP Kasganj Botre Rohan Pramod said, “Altaf and the minor girl were in a relationship. Altaf had persuaded the girl to leave her home with his friend and planned to catch up with them later after arranging some money. Altaf’s friend Rinku took her to Mathura and Agra. On the basis of inputs from a police surveillance team, the girl was rescued from Kasganj railway station. Rinku managed to escape, and efforts are on to nab him. The girl will be handed over to her family on Tuesday after the court proceedings are over.” Police said the girl is being kept at a ‘One Stop Centre’ until the court formalities are over. Such centres provide integrated support and assistance under one roof to women affected by violence. The FIR, filed by the girl's father against Altaf and his "unknown" friend, stated that she had left her home with Altaf's friend, "taking her clothes and academic certificates along to Delhi". The FIR was registered at Sadar Kotwali police station under section 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the Indian Penal Code. TOI had earlier reported that an FIR for kidnapping against Altaf was registered after he died in police custody on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Altaf’s father, Chand Miyan -- citing the TOI report -- sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday demanding a judicial or CBI investigation in the alleged murder of his son. Miyan also demanded that a second postmortem of his son’s body -- which was buried on Wednesday -- be conducted by doctors from All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). Miyan said he and his wife will be forced to go on a hunger strike if the chief minister does not hear his prayers. While police claimed that Altaf hanged himself with the drawstring of his jacket’s hoodie in the washroom of the lockup at Kotwali Sadar police station, his family disputed the theory. The autopsy report mentioned “asphyxia” as the cause of death, but makes no mention of any bruises or injuries on the rest of the body. The family members had claimed that they were not shown the body before the postmortem on Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-cops-find-kidnapped-girl-at-rly-stn-produce-her-in-court/articleshow/87723809.cms||Deepak Lavania

Milind was among the 26 Maoists who were killed in Gadchiroli near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border on Saturday. A teary-eyed Viplab, also a social activist, received the body of Milind after post-mortem at Gadchiroli district hospital. The family took the body to Yavatmal for the last rites. His wife, Angela Sontakey, too was present. The cops also collected samples from his kin for DNA sampling. Viplab said Milind’s death was a second blow to the Teltumbde’s family within a year after the arrest of his elder brother Anand in Elgar Parishad case. He added that his uncle’s death was somewhat mysterious as none with him survived. “The family would have a discussion about the encounter. We will also speak to Angela about it and later take a decision about our future course of action,” he said. The lawyer said his uncle had left family in 1996 stating he intended to work and dedicate his life for the masses, especially the deprived and downtrodden. “When my grandmother (Milind’s mother) tried to hold him back, he told her that she should live happily with her four other sons and three daughters,” he said adding Milind was loved by all in the family. “My uncle did not even turn up for the funeral of his father or another brother,” said Viplab. It’s learnt Milind, who was childless, was a leader of workers’ union while working with Western Coalfields Limited (WCL). “He (Milind) was a well-known leader of workers’ union in Chandrapur and Wani belt,” said Viplab and added that his uncle was an active and popular social worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/milind-died-for-the-cause-of-displaced-and-jal-jungle-jameen/articleshow/87723112.cms||Soumitra Bose

Chandrasekaran added that "India must use this decade – or techade, which is the right term for the country - to go from $3 trillion to $12 trillion by 2031.” “China really took off between 2000 and 2010 and went from being a US$1.2 trillion economy to a US$6 trillion one, driven by manufacturing. It did it in partnership with the USA. In this techade, India needs to use technology to triple its GDP from $3 trillion to $12 trillion by 2031," he said. He added, “We need to create tech city clusters with connectivity, skill ecosystems and access to risk capital where Indian talent learns in India and transforms India. The country must focus now on modern technologies and data.” Sydena Mufaddal Saifuddin, AMU chancellor, while congratulating Chandrasekaran and lauding the role played by the Tata Group, said that "a business can only be considered truly profitable if it is a means to improving the lives of others." The university's vice-chancellor, Tariq Mansoor, said that the university is “privileged to include Natarajan Chandrasekaran in the illustrious group of recipients of the honoris causa degree in the past, such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Dr CV Raman, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, prime ministers, presidents and kings of nations such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Germany, Iran and Egypt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/every-indian-must-be-provided-a-mini-pad-for-life-if-india-wants-to-be-12-trillion-economy-by-2031-says-tata-group-chairman-at-special-amu-convocation/articleshow/87723822.cms||---

In most of the cases, the Covid test reports that led to a scare among people have been negative. Experts said the overlapping symptoms will persist till the end of the month as other viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and rhinovirus remain active. These are the normal seasonal viruses that have been on the prowl since Durga Puja, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology, Raja Dhar. He added that these symptoms would be more common than Covid now. At Peerless Hospital, positivity rate has been 7%-8% over the last one week. “While most of the positive cases are mild ones barring those seeking hospitalizations, a vast majority of those undergoing tests at our hospital have been negative and have other viruses. Influenza A seems to be the most common one but the symptoms are similar to Covid,” said internal medicine consultant, Arindam Biswas At AMRI Hospitals, the number of tests has been around 200 a day while the positivity rate has dropped below 5%. “Most of the people are getting tested with Covid-like symptoms that are turning out to be non-Covid virus,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Positivity rate has dropped to around 10% at Medica Superspecialty Hospital from 25% till early-November. “We are testing around 200 each day and most of the people are suffering from non-Covid viral attacks. But the symptoms are very close,” said Medica chairperson, Alok Roy. There has been a sharp spurt in influenza cases due to the temperature change triggered by the frequent drizzles over the last two days, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist, Sauren Panja. He said RSV has also been striking children. It causes infection in the lungs and respiratory distress that is leading to a Covid scare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/overlapping-signs-trigger-cov-scare-many-scramble-for-tests/articleshow/87724560.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Headed by Konark Rai, who hails from Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district, SASTRA, which operates under the aegis of Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU) in Gujarat, among other things aims to “elevate sprouting innovators and facilitate an efficient work environment dedicated to the advancement in the domain of national security.” Stating that it will particularly focus on integrating modern technologies and relevant doctrines to support the security forces of India and its allies, the incubation centre said the primary objective is to facilitate a three-way engagement between academia, industry and the government for innovation, incubation, indigenisation and technology acceleration in the security sector. “The country needed SASTRA because homegrown innovators lacked a platform backed by the ministry of home affairs that could help in taking security innovations to the next level. Launched in September 2020, SASTRA is currently supporting six startups related to autonomous systems including drones and boats. Most of the prototypes are ready and final products are set for deployment,” Rai, managing director, SASTRA, told TOI. Pointing to how the association is a pioneering effort that would strengthen national security with emphasis on civil defence fusion, Rai said that RRU has now signed an agreement on its behalf to commercialise innovations developed and patented by the navy. Rai, who started his schooling at Bishop Cottons Boys’ School in Bengaluru later studied at Sri Sathya Sai Loka Seva School, Alike and St Victor’s School in Puttur and did his graduation from Gujarat National Law University before working as a political and policy analyst in the United Nations. Elaborating about the agreement, Rai said the navy has agreed to assign licenses of four innovations developed and patented by them — surgical gowns called ‘Navrakshak’; oxygen recycling system called ‘Aadyant’; a low-cost digital stethoscope called ‘Spandan’ and technology for a dental dome: a ‘mobile micro-dental clinical amplifying bio-aerosol protection’ — to SASTRA for commercialising. “The navy has a wide range of innovations for which patent applications have already been filed. Through NIIO (Naval Innovation and Indigenisation Organisation), it has agreed to assign the license to SASTRA, which will manage and commercialise such products by entering into Transfer of Technology (ToT) agreements with select MSMEs to ensure that products gets mass produced for the larger benefit of the society,” Rai said. The NIIO, launched on August 13, 2020, puts in place dedicated structures for the navy to interact with academia and industry towards fostering innovation and indigenisation for self-reliance in defence. “At SASTRA, we work towards an Atmarakshit Bharath and at the service of those serving the nation,” Rai, whose parents Pramod Kumar Rai and T Shobha Rai are based in Puttur, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ktaka-man-heads-centre-aimed-at-commercialising-security-innovations/articleshow/87723740.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

On Monday, Team TOI visited Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s headquarters in Civil Lines, district collector’s office, high court and Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Giripeth off Amravati Road to find out implementation of the norm.At collector’s office, an employee was deputed at the entry point to check vaccination status of the visitors. Over 600 visitors were checked and only the fully vaccinated carrying a proof were allowed to proceed to meet collector R Vimala. However, there was no verification at rest of the offices on the same premises. When pointed out, the collector said, “No one is allowed to enter my office without showing vaccination proof. It is sad if it is not being followed at other places, though we have given orders for strict implementation.”At NMC, two employees were tasked to verify vaccination status, but they didn’t stop anyone to ascertain it. One of them said the civic health team remains there only till 2pm and leaves after it. The health team vaccinates the unvaccinated visitor in case they are willing and then they are instantly allowed entry.There was no check or deployment of any staff at the high court and RTO. Team TOI found visitors were not even wearing mask properly, which is also compulsory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-must-for-entry-fizzles-out-at-govt-offices/articleshow/87723132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi preps for liquor-buying high, but expect dry run to begin with||NEW DELHI: The experience of buying liquor in the city will get transformed from Wednesday when huge stores will replace the existing small ones, which resemble cabins and are dirty and stuffy. The new stores would be like showrooms and people would be able to walk through, explore the stock on the shelves and pick the liquor they like. All existing 600 state-run shops would close down on Tuesday according to the new excise policy that seeks to make the government exit the liquor business. The 850-odd new mega liquor stores opening under the new excise policy are nearly ready and most of them are getting final touches. Within a few days, all of them would be ready to welcome customers. The transition is likely to push Delhi into a liquor crisis for a brief period because all 600 government-run shops would close on Tuesday night, but not as many new ones would be opening the same day. The last week has been tough for buyers as they have been experiencing a growing liquor crisis. The existing shops stopped replacing the stock because they were in an exit mode. They wanted to sell everything before winding up. Many regular buyers TOI spoke to said they were finding it difficult to get their preferred brands and had to stand in long queues outside the shops to buy liquor. “I didn’t get the brand I wanted even after checking out three shops in east Delhi. This had never occurred in the past. The shelves of most shops were almost empty and they were just selling the remaining stock,” said Dhirendra Tanwar, an east Delhi resident. On October 1, around 250 private liquor shops shut down under the new excise policy and the pressure of the demand immediately shifted to the 600 state-run shops. These shops were directed by the government to increase their stocks to meet the sudden rise in demand. The queues outside the shops got longer due to the demand-supply gap. Delhi government is making all efforts to ensure that a liquor crisis doesn’t occur. It has given provisional licences to over 350 stores, which means they can start sales. In all, 206 brands have been registered till now. “Ten wholesale licensees have procured 9 lakh litres of liquor of various brands so far. Delhi is not likely to slip into a liquor crisis due to the transition into the new regime from November 17,” said a government official. However, a trader said under the old regime around 400 brands were registered, which meant people looking for the other 194 brands were likely to be disappointed. “There was a delay in giving provisional licences by the excise department, which also delayed opening of shops. The granting of licences should have been fast-tracked,” added the trader. Under the new excise policy, Delhi has been divided into 32 zones with 8-10 wards each having 27 liquor stores on average. It is estimated that Delhi government would earn Rs 10,000 crore annually as excise revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-preps-for-liquor-buying-high-but-expect-dry-run-to-begin-with/articleshow/87724584.cms||AlokKNMishra

Tomar alleged that last month, he was abducted from the Civil Lines area by armed men in a car. He claimed that former MLA Vijay Yadav was in the car and he was made to speak with DP Yadav over the phone.

Hence, they were given priority as frontline workers even before government officers for vaccination. Since many have still not taken their jab, we came up with this new initiative,” municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite told TOI. If shopkeepers and employees are found to be unvaccinated, warning stickers will be pasted prominently at the shop. The sticker will state ‘The people working in this shop have not yet received the Covid-19 preventive vaccine. Consumers should take note of this and enter at their own risk’. Mohite warned that these stickers are government property and they should not be removed without the permission of an authorized person. “Otherwise, punitive action will be taken against the shopkeeper,” he said. He informed that CMC squads have already started checking hawkers, service providers and vendors in the markets for vaccination certificate. Those lacking it are removed from the marketplace. There is also an offer of winning a lucky draw against getting the vaccine till November 24. It is mandatory for every employee of industrial estate, industry units and private offices to show proof that of at least the first dose. “Other measures like door-to-door vaccination through mobile vans, special vaccination camps and rampant awareness drives too are in place to achieve the 100% vaccination target by month end,” Mohite said.Official sources informed that of the CMC’s target of vaccinating 2.51 lakh eligible citizens, 81% have taken the first doses, while 45% have taken their second dose. Target is to achieve 100% first dose vaccination by November end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cmc-to-put-warning-stickers-on-shops-with-unvaccinated-staff/articleshow/87723139.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||Purandare shared a special bond with Nagpur, Vidarbha||Nagpur: At an event held on February 6, 2017, Shiv Shahir Babasaheb Purandare was at his usual best, narrating episodes from the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj when one of the volunteers of Laxmi Nagar Nagarik Mandal politely told him that the police wanted the programme to conclude by 10pm. This made the great orator and historian angry. “How dare they (police) ask me to stop Shiva Charitra? Tell them to go and stop illegal activities first,” said Purandare, literally scolding cops from the stage. The event, ‘Shiv Kalyan Raja’, continued at the Laxmi Nagar ground well past 10pm. Current president of the organizing committee Prasanna Mohile still remembers the anger in Purandare’s eyes. Purandare, who passed away early Monday morning, shared a special bond with Nagpur. He had great friends and followers and got the right kind of support from the region whenever in need.“In the early years of his career, Babasaheb used to go door to door to sell ‘Shiva Charitra’. Rajabhau Kulkarni was his close friend. With Kulkarni’s help, hundreds of copies were sold in Vidarbha,” recalled Prafulla Mategaonkar, a senior theatre activist who was a close associate of Purandare in Nagpur. “I consider myself fortunate to have worked with Babasaheb during the organization of Janata Raja, a mangum opus in Nagpur,” said Mategaonkar, who coordinated local artistes for the Janata Raja show. The theatrical marvel was staged four times in Nagpur and every show was house full. Shiva Charitrakar Vijayrao Deshmukh, a historian who wrote about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, recalled Purandare as a ‘Shiva Yogi’. “It was his inspiring oratory that re-introduced Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to entire Maharashtra for decades together. We had a 65-year-long association with Purandare. Establishing ‘Shiv Srushti’ was his dream and all his followers should start working to fulfill it,” said Deshmukh. Datta Shirke, coordinator of the Shiv Rajyabhishek Sohola Samiti, which organizes an annual programme to commemorate the coronation day of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Gandhi Dwar, said the inspiration came from Babasaheb Purandare. “He used to take part in all our events. Age was never a barrier for him. He used to visit Nagpur especially for our coronation day event,” recalled Shirke. Purandare’s last visit to Nagpur was in 2019 when he attended the Marathi play ‘Vasudeo Balawant Fadke’ presented by Prafulla Mategaonkar. He had interacted with the audience after the show and shared many unknown facts about the great freedom fighter. “He was a great storyteller. He had many undocumented stories which he used to share with us during our informal sessions. We will miss a man who was a personification of Maratha history,” said Mategaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/purandare-shared-a-special-bond-with-nagpur-vidarbha/articleshow/87723146.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Despite govt nod, cops penalize pvt buses plying on MSRTC routes||Nagpur: Lack of coordination between Regional Transport Office and Maharashtra Police is causing hardships for commuters of strike-hit Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus service as they are forced to travel in private modes of transportation.The state police across the region are acting against private bus operators for ferrying passengers without a valid permit.Bus operator Santosh Jog threatened to stop ferrying passengers to rural areas if the action continues. He further said that action is being taken on various routes forcing private bus operators to cancel the trip midway.Jog also stated that operators are being forced to pay fine for violating the Motor Vehicles Act. “This despite the fact that we are providing the bus service as per the order of the state government,” he said.After MSRTC employees launched their strike, from November 10 the RTO resumed the bus operation with the help of private operators. Since then, the transport department here in Nagpur has been operating almost 300 private buses, which included many school buses, and additional 200 kali-pili four-wheelers to ferry passengers on ST bus routes.Deputy RTO Ravindra Bhuyar admitted that the private operators are facing police action for ferrying passengers without valid permit. He, however, clarified that the operators were roped in by the state government itself.Bhuyar further said that on November 9, the state government had ordered that private vehicles of all types including cars, school buses, private buses, jeeps and even goods vehicles be allowed to carry passengers in both stage and contract carriage format from MSRTC bus stops and other places.As per the government order, local administration should actively monitor and assist in these efforts to mitigate the situation, stated the order issued by additional chief secretary Ashish Kumar Singh.As per this order, the RTO should allow operation of buses from MSRTC depot in Ganeshpeth itself. However, the traffic police are not even allowing them to ferry passengers from outside the bus stand.Another bus operator and president of Nagpur Private Travels Association, Mahendra Luley, too confirmed that state police is taking action against private buses, which is causing inconvenience to the already-harried passengers.A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said that the action is being taken under sections 66 and 192 of Motor Vehicles Act, which states that for ferrying passengers a vehicle requires proper permit from the transport department. The officer refused to comment when asked about the government order which allows even private vehicles to ferry passengers without valid permit. He claimed that police haven’t received any specific order from the government in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-govt-nod-cops-penalize-pvt-buses-plying-on-msrtc-routes/articleshow/87723156.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi: EDMC will use drone tech to fumigate areas tough to reach||By Siddhanta MishraNEW DELHI: With the number of dengue cases rising, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to use drone technology to fumigate areas that are difficult to reach manually. “We have given approval to the project for conducting insecticide spray with the help of a drone in those areas where it is very difficult for our workers to reach. If this turns out to be successful, we will expand the coverage area,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. The east corporation has reported 183 dengue cases in last week and a total of 518 cases this year so far. Locations along the Yamuna Khadar are likely to be fumigated by the drone. “A stretch of three kilometres has been identified to carry out the spraying of insecticide. There are several areas in east Delhi where it is very difficult to fumigate, as they have dense forest, thorny bushes and the soil is also mushy. Many times our fumigation vehicles get stuck in the mud. Through this technological help, we hope to fumigate such locations,” said Ajay Handa, additional medical health officer, EDMC. The stretch has been specifically chosen where there are no houses. A company based in Gurgaon has been hired by the corporation to conduct the spraying of insecticide. The concept is based on the spray mechanism that is done when covering a large open field during locust attack on crops, said Handa further. The first run will be conducted on November 17. Meanwhile, the corporation has identified several vulnerable and affected areas and is paying special attention to them. In these hotspots, the civic body sends a team of domestic breeding checkers and field workers to kill the infected mosquito and create awareness among the residents. The civic body has so far sprayed insecticides outside 6,75,459 houses. It has found 32,220 houses with mosquitogenic conditions and launched prosecutions in 6,271 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-will-use-drone-tech-to-fumigate-areas-tough-to-reach/articleshow/87724601.cms||---

The exam is conducted by the Centre and implemented by states, with the purpose of checking the academic progress of students studying in Std III, V, VIII and X. Schools and students are randomly chosen across the country and they appear for the test on the same day and time. In Maharashtra, Std III students have not yet been given permission for physical classes which proved to be a challenge for teachers. Khimesh Kumar Badhiye, teacher at Dharmaraj School in Parseoni taluka of Nagpur district said, “We were able to convince parents that this is for their benefit. In fact, in rural areas parents are interested in sending their kids to school but so far permission has come only for Std V-X,” said Badhiye. Speaking to TOI back then, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “This is a country-wide exam so we have to go ahead with it. Regardless, only some students chosen randomly are being called and all safety protocols will be followed.” In Nagpur district, almost 7,000 students were present for the exam. The regional level supervisors for (Std III) were Madhuri Khode, Vaishali Sawarkr and Sunanda Bhagat. While for Std VIII and X, supervisors Jayashree Kantode, Jyoti Ambade and Nilesh Mule were appointed under block education officer Kailash Lokhande.

It was Peter, the house owner, who was shocked at the sight in the morning and awoke all the remaining family members and rushed them out of the house. The power supply to the house has been disconnected and the house is deemed to be structurally unsafe for living. Fire force personnel, corporation councillors and revenue authorities reached the spot and did not let anyone enter the house considering the dangerous state of the building. Peter, who calls out at auction in fishing harbour, has been living with his family in the house for 21 years. “Pappa usually wakes up early and goes to buy milk. We woke up this morning hearing a frantic call from him and we were shocked to see that our compound had disappeared,” said Mary Shyja, daughter of Peter. Six children, including twins aged 2.5 years old, were in the house when the incident happened. “We are fortunate that we could move out of the house. Sometime at night we had heard a sound, but we ignored it,” said Mary. At the onset of rains, they had kept their certificates and identity cards in a separate file. A few months ago, cracks had developed in the house and renovation was done recently. The family members were initially moved to a convent. The twins develop fits during extreme cold and when the condition of children was known to residents, Pushparaj, who is their neighbour and now resides in the city, offered a temporary stay for the family in his house. All the family members were moved to the neighbouring house which had been remaining locked for a while. “At present, we just need to take care of our children. We are thankful that we got a house to stay temporarily. There are loans to be repaid, even the document of the house was mortgaged. This was our life saving and we are scared for our future,” said Mary Shyja. By evening, medicines and milk for children were procured for the family. Peter told the media that unscientific excavation in the area posed threat to his house. Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima said that the house was in an extremely dangerous situation and that it was totally unsafe to live there. Meanwhile, there was a mild respite in showers in the district on Monday. However, instances of earth caving in at many places have caused anxiety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/narrow-escape-for-family-as-part-of-their-house-caves-in/articleshow/87723870.cms||---

The SIT was formed after a controversy erupted over allegations of a payoff to an NCB official in the cruise drug bust case and images of witnesses accompanying the accused to the NCB’s office with Aryan Khan and selfies with him emerged. Malik had alleged that the case was fabricated. NCB had then said He was trying to settle scores after his son-in-law was booked in a narcotics case. The SIT had taken over six cases but the priority will be to broaden the investigation into these three cases, according to deputy director of NCB, Sanjay Singh. “Due to shortage of manpower we have now taken up only three cases to relook at investigations carried out and later, we will take up the other three,” Singh told TOI. The three other cases pertain to the arrest of accused from Mumbra, Jogeshwari and Dongri for dealing in contraband.

The total number of cases now stands at 5,277, which is the highest number of cases recorded from Delhi in the past five years.Of the 2,569 cases reported, 1,772 cases were from the three corporations and the remaining from New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment and Railways areas. There are also 470 cases, which are from outside Delhi and are not part of the total number of cases.The north corporation has witnessed 808 cases under its jurisdiction, followed by the south corporation (781). The east corporation recorded 183 cases within a week. The number of confirmed deaths due to dengue was nine till last week. Under the epidemic act, Delhi government in October made it mandatory for all the health facilities in the city to report the cases to the administration, hence, old cases are also being reported. According to health experts, there are three primary factors behind the increase in the number of dengue cases. Firstly, it is the four-year trend of the disease according to which every fourth year, there is a major outbreak of dengue. Secondly, prolonged monsoon, which resulted in water stagnation in different parts of the city, led to increased mosquito breeding and thirdly, the disease has been notified by the government and hence, all the hospitals, clinics and labs have to report dengue cases to the authorities. “Some instances of repeat cases and mismatch in data have also come to the fore,” said a corporation’s health department official. In a meeting held with the state health secretary, health officials from all the local bodies discussed the spurt in the number of dengue cases, the issue of repeat and old cases being reported by private hospitals, said an official who attended the meeting. However, the officials are hopeful that the number of cases may go down in the next two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dengue-case-tally-at-5-yr-high-as-number-crosses-5000-mark/articleshow/87724609.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bella Casa looks to hit 1k-crore valuation mark in three years||Sometime before their sons joined the family textile business Bella Casa Fashion and Retail Ltd in 2004, Harish Gupta and Pawan Gupta were confident of a retail upsurge in the domestic market. By then, their export revenues were about Rs 10 crore. Convinced that their sons would drive the shift in strategy, the Guptas set up their big manufacturing factory in 2004 in Sitapura. The growth strategy played out on the expected lines. From home furnishing products like bedsheets, comforters and pillows, they forayed into the lifestyle segment manufacturing women’s and men’s wear. “We trusted our foresight when we shifted the focus from trading in fabrics to manufacturing in 1996. Our father late K R Gupta started the company in 1959. But as the economic environment changed, it was not difficult for us to change the template. Similarly, when we foresaw a bigger domestic story on the horizon, we nimbly repositioned our business model,” says Harish Gupta, chairperson of the company. As the domestic demand gained in size, the company added another manufacturing facility in 2008. Today, it has three factories with a production capacity of 1.4 million pieces a month. Unlike many traditional family businesses, the promoters of Bella Casa were keen to go public. Besides raising funds to invest in growth, they were aware of other benefits that listing brings in its wake. Pawan Gupta, MD, says, “Even though we are a family business, we are highly aspirational. So, the decision to go public was collective and unanimous.” Gaurav, the third generation to join the busines along with Saurav, says, an unlisted company has many limitations. “By going public, a company not only gets access to funds but also improves its corporate governance standards which is a key to unlocking many opportunities.” “A listed company is favorably positioned to work with the banking partners, attract customers and gain visibility,” adds Gaurav. When it listed on the BSE’s SME platform, its valuation was Rs 14 crore, which has risen to Rs 250 crore after migrating to the main board. Saurav says, “Those who invested Rs 1 lakh at the IPO, their shares are worth Rs 15 lakh now.” The company has set a long-term target of becoming a unicorn in the next 10 years. Saurav says, “We want to become a Rs 1,000-crore company in the next 3 years. We will additionally invest Rs 150-200 crore to reach there by venturing into every category in fashion. We are currently investing in brand building, scaling up distribution, enhancing manufacturing efficiency, digitizing all functions and looking at possible acquisitions to shore up growth,” adds Saurav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bella-casa-looks-to-hit-1k-cr-valuation-mark-in-3-yrs/articleshow/87725594.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Anoop Radhakrishnan’s cartoon, which won the Academy’s Honourable Mention for 2019-20, portrays leaders of four world powers attending a global submit on Covid, with the Indian representative caricatured as a saffron-clad monk with the head of a cow. BJP leaders, including its state president K Surendran and PK Krishnadas, have described the cartoon as insulting the nation and demeaning India’s fight against the pandemic, and demanded that the decision to confer the award to such an “anti-national cartoon” be withdrawn immediately. “If the government won't correct this decision, society will not allow those responsible to go scot-free,” Surendran warned in a post on social media.There were tense moments during BJP’s march to the Academy office here on Monday as party activists tried to breach police barricades. Meanwhile, Radhakrishnan has filed a police complaint alleging that he has been receiving numerous abusive and threatening calls after he was selected for the award. Police decided to provide him security and personnel have been posted near his house at Vyttila in Kochi. Nemom Pushparaj, president of Lalithakala Academy, said that the aggressive protests against the cartoon award indicate rising intolerance in society. The cartoon award winners this time were selected by a jury headed by cartoonist EP Unni and artist Paul Kallanode as one of the members. “There is no question of going back on the selection of the award winners by a competent jury,” said Pushparaj. Earlier, the Catholic church had come out against the selection of a cartoon by Subhash Kalloor attacking controversial Bishop Franco Mulakkal but Academy officials had decided to go ahead with the presentation of the award to the cartoonist for 2018-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cartoon-row-again-at-lalithakala-academy/articleshow/87724653.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Delhi||Delhi: Students’ groups clash on JNU campus||NEW DELHI: Following an altercation between two groups of students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday night, both the sides — JNU Students’ Union and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) — blamed each other for the “violence on the campus”. Allegations of vandalism inside the JNUSU room and students being injured were also made by both the groups. They also took out protest marches on Monday in the campus. Meanwhile, police on Monday registered two FIRs under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (common intention) at Vasant Kunj (North) police station regarding the altercation. Cops claimed no one was injured in the clash. JNUSU said a study circle, Hundred Flowers Group, had booked the union room on November 11 for a reading and discussion session scheduled on November 14. However, it was alleged that ABVP members occupied the room following which heated discussions and a clash occurred. Aishe Ghosh, JNUSU president, said, “We reached the union room after receiving calls that ABVP members were refusing to leave. When we asked the ABVP members to shift their meeting elsewhere, they refused. Soon, they started heckling and targeted a student and started beating him.” Vivek Pandey, a student allegedly attacked by ABVP members, said, “When I reached the union room, they were sloganeering. Suddenly, 10-15 people gathered around me and started hitting me. They even tried to throw chairs on me.” On the other hand, ABVP stated that derogatory language was used by students who had assembled along with the JNUSU members. Shivam Chaurasia, president of ABVP’s JNU unit, said, “We were holding our weekly meeting in the common room. Suddenly, people walked in and said that prior permission was required. They started pushing us, used derogatory language and even tried to instigate those present there.” In a statement, the JNU administration said, “Students are aware that this venue is a common activity or facility centre. Every student is entitled and free to use the place, adhering to JNU’s rules. Violence and unruly behaviour have no place in an academic institution and the JNU administration strongly disapproves of it.” “Students are advised to use the common facilities with a sense of cordiality and responsibility and in harmony with each other. Nobody should be allowed to disturb the peaceful existence and functioning of others,” added the statement. On Sunday, the PCR got a call that slogans were being raised and a quarrel was probably taking place between two groups at JNU. A team from Vasant Kunj (North) police station visited the campus and found that slogans were being raised, but there was no quarrel. An inquiry showed that heated arguments took place between two groups of students for organising a seminar in the students’ union hall. Later, ABVP members visited the police station and gave written complaints. One student from a Left-affiliated organisation also lodged a complaint. DCP (Southwest) Gaurav Sharma said they conducted an inquiry and then registered the FIRs. “No one has been arrested. People involved in the incident were named in both FIRs,” he added. Asked whether students were injured in the clash, an officer said they had received four MLCs, which suggested that no one was injured. However, police spoke to both sides and asked them to maintain peace inside the campus. The investigators also scanned several videos to identify the people involved in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-groups-clash-on-jnu-campus/articleshow/87724626.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Daily green challenge to promote nutritious diet||Mangaluru: Leafy green vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. In an attempt to promote its consumption, Mamatha Rai, president, Kadike Trust, working for the revival of Udupi sarees, has launched a campaign called daily green challenge. On social media, Mamatha has been introducing several edible greens along with recipes for several days. Mamatha told TOI, “I completed 25 days of the challenge on Sunday. This is an attempt to spread awareness about wild edible greens that can be grown easily and under any climatic conditions. For many, greens only mean consuming spinach, methi or coriander leaves bought from the market. The challenge is to use leaves grown in the home garden everyday,” she said. Mamatha has been wanting to take this up as a challenge for a long time, and introduce people to a rich variety of greens that can be grown even in limited space naturally. “I live in a rented premise and have been growing edible greens in pots. Five years ago, we had documented more than 100 edible greens from our garden. I am planning to write about 30 leaves and recipes and then take a break due to the workload of the Udupi saree revival project,” she said. She shares the details including the scientific name of the leaf, common names in Kannada and English as well as the recipe of the dish cooked at home with pictures to support them. Some of the leaves introduced and recipes shared include rasam from Peperomia Pellucida, chutney from Brahmi leaves, aromatic rice by cooking the leaves of Rasana, juice using Indian moon seed plants leaves, curry (palya) by cooking black nightshade leaves with pre-soaked pigeon pea, Mexican mint leaves and onion pakoda and many more. She also writes about the benefits of leaves. All details are shared on social media platforms and as well as among weavers. “The response has been positive so far. While adding nutrition to the diet is the need of the hour, this change is needed amid the climate crisis as most of these leaves grown are from climate tolerant plants. Also, the kitchen waste and grey water can be diverted to this home garden. Once I complete 30 days, I will probably take a break and return with more edible greens after some time,” said Mamatha, who has been a vegan for the past six years and has given preference to a plant-based diet for environmental reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/daily-green-challenge-to-promote-nutritious-diet/articleshow/87723537.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Zuarinagar witnessed tense moments after the private contractor broke the culvert while laying the pipeline on Friday. Residents demanded that the work should be immediately stopped to repair the culvert. After Sancoale sarpanch Girish Pillai and local panch Arish Kadar inspected the site, the contractor was asked to stop the pipeline work till the culvert is repaired. Pillai said, “The contractor was warned earlier to work with precaution. We are not against any work of any company but we cannot tolerate such irresponsible work as it causes problems to the public.” The contractor had damaged one pillar of the bridge (culvert) and was trying to do some patch work over it, he said. Pillai said, “There are around 200 small industries and a population of 30,000. Small as well as big vehicles use the culvert daily. If any incident happens the locals will hold the panchayat responsible.” He said that the panchayat will write to authorities about the incident, including the Verna police station and the South Goa collector. “The work can only re-start after the contractor repairs the culvert and the public works department (PWD), who had constructed the bridge (culvert), gives a stability report of the repair work,” Kadar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/private-contractor-damages-culvert-while-laying-gas-pipeline-near-vasco/articleshow/87725611.cms||---

He has also started a petition on change.org, which has been signed by nearly 40,000 people within two months. “Medical insurance has become a necessity and a must have protection for the working class, thanks to the ever spiralling medical costs. However it is subjected to 18% GST which makes it very expensive. It puts a burden on the already slim earnings of the middle class, retirees etc,” read the petition. Seeking a reduction of GST to 5%, Madhava Endlur, retired insurance professional who put up the petition, said: “Owing to the limited availability of quality medical care in the public space, common man is forced to go to expensive private hospitals. People are forced to buy expensive medical insurance policies to safeguard themselves from high cost of treatment in private hospitals. To levy 18% GST on this already expensive product is an absolute unjust.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-insurance-staffer-fights-for-gst-cut/articleshow/87725092.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Unhealthy medical insurance GST hurting families seeking cover||HYDERABAD: The hefty 18% GST on medical insurance is pushing many families across Telangana into a debt trap. Unable to sign up for an insurance cover at that price — the GST levied on medical care and hospitalisation, incidentally, is only 5% — many are left draining their savings or turning to lenders, to meet medical emergencies. Among the worst affected are the elderly. “My uncle recently suffered a paralytic attack and we had to rush him to Hyderabad from Bhongir for treatment. We not only had to dip into our savings but also borrow from friends, relatives and neighbours to meet cost of Rs 25 lakh,” said Yadama Suresh, nephew of the 65-year-old patient. The family is now completely financially drained. “While we had been looking for an insurance for him,we couldn’t go ahead with it as the premium being quoted by the firm was close to Rs 1.2 lakh, since he has hypertension,” Suresh added. In yet another case, a cancer patient’s treatment was halted midway as the family ran out of funds. They too couldn’t opt for the expensive insurance. “When we exhausted all the money we had collected from selling our house, for my elder sister’s treatment, the hospital refused to do even one chemotherapy session. We ultimately had to shift her to a government hospital,” said P Shivakumar. Doctors admit the high cost of insurance is creating ‘medical hostages’ (term coined during the pandemic where people were denied treatment for lack of funds) and burdening families with high debts. “It is true that the high rate of premium — apart from lack of awareness — has become the main hurdle for people hoping for an insurance. This has led to further widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. The government should bring in a policy change to ensure that premium rates are reduced,” said Dr Mahesh Kumar, president, Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA). Demanding a change are senior citizens too. “I pay Rs 87,000 per year in premium for a Rs 10 lakh coverage, which includes about Rs 20,000 GST. This is too much of a burden for a retired private company employee,” said Sastry Gollapudi, echoing the sentiments of many others who’ve had to sell off gold, properties and other belongings. “The medical insurance premium for senior citizens is at least three to four times more costly compared to a middle-aged person. Charges get extremely expensive when one is above 70 years. Given limited means of most senior citizens and need for an insurance cover, it is very important that the government of India reduces the GST to 5%,” said Madhava Endlur, who is fighting for this change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unhealthy-med-insurance-gst-hurting-families-seeking-cover/articleshow/87725077.cms||Amrita Didyala

LOUIS (MISSOURI): At a time when social and political controversies have led to a slowdown in the rate of vaccination across the US -- latest CDC data shows only 67% (avg) have taken at least one shot – Indians there continue to be coming out in large numbers to get the jab. In fact, multiple reports put them at the top of the charts with at least 40% (approx.) of Indians being already fully vaccinated. Among other reasons, it’s also the pain of loss that’s driving them to the vaccination centre, say locals. For instance, when Appala Naidu Gandi heard the news about one of his family friends in India passing away from Covid-19 complications early this year, he was heart-broken. It also left him scared. “I panicked and worried for everyone I knew in India,” Gandi, who has been working as an onsite project manager for HCL, recollected. “It was also unfortunate to realise how vaccines were readily available in the US, while places in my home country were facing a shortage,” he added. Gandi was among those who, when the vaccine was first available in the US, drove his family 321 km to get the shot. The trust in the medical science behind the vaccine, apart from lived personal experience of knowing loved ones die from Covid-19, were the main reason, he admitted. Like Gandi, several other members of the community living in the US –rattled by the goings-on back home as the second wave of Covid-19 peaked – chose to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. Among them was Srinivas Manchikalapudi, former president of the North America Telugu Society (NATS) in St Louis. “The best we could do is get vaccinated and continue to wear masks and social distance,” he said. In collaboration with NATS, Manchikalapudi also hosted vaccine drives and outreach programmes. According to demographic data from covidvaccine.mo.gov, Asian-Americans’ vaccination rates exceed the state’s average of 46.5%. Data shows 58% of Missouri’s Asian population has initiated vaccination and 50.5% of Missouri’s Asian population are fully vaccinated. Dr Annu TerKonda, a general internal medicine physician who treats Covid-19 patients, said that percentage of Indian Americans being vaccinated is much higher. She predicts upwards of 80% of eligible Indian Americans in Missouri are at least partially vaccinated. “Most are well educated and have a high level of scientific knowledge,” Dr TerKonda said. Dr TerKonda was among those involved in Telugu Association’s recent vaccine drives in St Louis. She said updates about relatives in India suffering during peak of delta variants added to the urgency. Though association’s recent drives saw a moderate turnout – of about 20 people per drive – its president, Ranga Suresh Chakka, predicts it is because a majority of Telugu community have already been vaccinated. “Most of them who walked in for our drive were children above the age of 12 who had just been cleared for vaccination,” he said.

The students have already lost almost a year due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The students have been complaining about the missing multiple choice questions (MCQs) section in their exams. National Medical Commission (NMC) regulations and guidelines say that 20 per cent of the question paper must contain MCQs whereas the Kaloji health university has completely eliminated this section, they said. When the court questioned the varsity whether it was willing to conduct a second supplementary exam as a one-time measure because the pandemic crippled all spheres of life, the university said it had to obtain NMC permission. However, the NMC counsel said that it was for the university to explain whether it deviated from the pattern fixed by the NMC. The judge reserved his orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-reserves-order-on-medicine-exams/articleshow/87725190.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The petition came in the wake of recent remarks made by Ranaut on India’s independence. The lawyer, in his petition, stated that the actress’ remarks were offensive and hurt the feelings of citizens across the country. The lawyer cited a reference to an interview where the actress had termed India’s independence in 1947 as “charity” and that real freedom was only won in 2014.  “There is utmost chaos and disturbances in the entire country, which will warrant stringent action against her for sedition and bringing disrepute to the Constitution ,” Aijazuddin went on to say. The lawyer stated that Ranaut’s statement “attracts charges of sedition under the provisions of IPC Section 124-A (sedition), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and so also Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.” In his letter, the lawyer pleaded the CJI to take suo-motu cognisance by initiating enquiry and directing the Union government to take penal action against the actress. The city also saw sporadic protests over the remarks from various groups. The petition came in the wake of recent remarks made by Ranaut on India’s independence.

Sanjay’s convoy was also attacked at Chillapally village in Suryapet district, police said. Police, who were unaware of the sudden tour of Sanjay, had a tough time in bringing the situation under control and averting the clashes from escalating further between BJP and Telangana Rashtra Samithi adres. Later in the day, police registered a criminal case against Sanjay for violating the model code of conduct in the wake of MLC elections. In another case, TRS cadres were booked for pelting stones on the BJP leader’s convoy and creating obstruction. A similar case was registered against the BJP for retaliating against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre. Nalgonda police said that they were clueless about Sanjay’s sudden plan to visit paddy procurement centres and mills in the district. It was only at 9 am they came to know about his tour from the media. When senior police officials contacted the district BJP leaders, local BJP leaders met deputy IG of Nalgonda AV Ranganath and sought permission for Sanjay’s programmes. By this time, Sanjay’s convoy had already reached Choutuppal. Police hurriedly made bandobust arrangements. “Sanjay’s meeting in Nalgonda went off peacefully. However, when he went to Miryalaguda, stones were pelted by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre on the convoy of Sanjay. There were nearly 50 vehicles in his convoy. The rearside windshield of an SUV was broken,” Nalgonda police said. At another place, eggs and tomatoes were hurled on BJP leaders by Telangana Rashtra Samithi cadre. Police had to intervene to control the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-workers-hurl-stoneseggs-on-bandis-convoy/articleshow/87724656.cms||---

However, Delhi Police has not made any headway into the probe to identify the culprits. On paper, police seem to have ticked all boxes. An FIR was promptly filed after the incident was reported on January 5, 2020, and the police brass transferred the probe to Crime Branch wherein a special investigation team (SIT) was formed to investigate the case. The SIT even set up a camp office at the admin block of JNU. Footage from CCTV cameras was retrieved and mobile videos were obtained and examined by forensic experts. Technical and mobile surveillance was used to establish the identity of people present at the spot. Later, several people from Left-wing and Right-wing groups were sent summons for questioning. Around 100 people have been questioned till now, including DU student Komal Sharma. The SIT recorded the statements of injured students, teachers, wardens, security guards and others who were either witnesses or suspects. Police also wrote to Google and WhatsApp seeking information about the chat content of the suspects and the details of WhatsApp groups they were members of. Cops also released photographs of suspects. Despite all this, no arrests were made and no chargesheet was filed. Asked about an update in the case, senior officers didn’t say much, except that the investigation was ongoing. However, sources told TOI that the case had gone cold and no breakthrough was expected anytime soon. The investigation was conducted in full swing for about two months, but the team later got busy with the riots and Covid-related cases. Since then, documenting procedures have been going on. A top source told TOI that it was unlikely that any arrests would be made. At the most, a chargesheet without arrests would be filed, eventually leaving the decision to the court. Asked whether a closure report would be filed, an officer replied that they were gathering evidence and would take the case to a logical conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-months-on-no-headway-in-jnu-violence-probe/articleshow/87724650.cms||---

Since, the AP government has taken up expansion and new schemes without approvals from the ministry of water resources (MoWR), appraisal from KRMB and also the Apex council, it should be brought to the notice of MoWR for taking necessary action. TRS government said it is also against provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. In a letter to KRMB recently, Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar said HNSS project and its expansion was being done by the AP government and tender notices were issued. “The AP government has recently issued tender notices for enhancement from 3,850 cusecs to 6,300 cusecs for the main canal and eight pump houses at a cost of Rs 4,652 crore,” Muralidhar said. He said the Telangana government has requested KRMB to restrain AP from drawing more than 34 tmcft water from Srisailam reservoir.

Kiran, who hails from Mapranam in the district, was nabbed by the probe team from Kollamkode in Palakkad district, on Monday, the crime branch DSP V A Ullas said. Kiran was a commission agent of the bank, and not a direct employee. However, nearly Rs 23 crore have flown into his account from the Karuvannur bank. Even though the police have not found any document establishing that Kiran has a membership in the bank, he was sanctioned a loan of Rs 45 lakh. He has also availed loans from another 41 benami accounts, several of them amounting above Rs 50 lakh each, the police sources said. Kiran, however, has said that he was not an employee of the bank and was not involved in the fraud. Kiran had been absconding for the last several months. As per the information received by police, he had been hiding in several north Indian states as well as Tamil Nadu. He was arrested when he was on his way to Kollamkode by bus, the DSP said.

---||Goa||State hopes to clear 5,000 forest claims by Dec 19: CM||Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said that at least 50% of the 10,136 pending claims under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, and land ownership rights can be expedited and processed by December 19. He, however, put the onus of delay on traditional forest dwellers saying that poor attendance at gram sabha meetings convened for scrutiny and verification of the claims has delayed the process. Sawant said that at least 5,000 claims, which have been pending for around 10-12 years, can be cleared if the tribals and forest dwellers participate in the meetings being held by November-end at the panchayat-level. “We are trying to fast-track the sanads for the tribals. Our efforts are to give at least 50% of the beneficiaries their sanads or land titles. If the gram sabhas can fast-track the process at their end, then over the next two months we can give at least 5,000 people their sanads,” Sawant said after handing of land title documents or sanad documents to a handful of forest dwellers. Sawant said that forest right cases, as per provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 are being sped up. As on March 31, the state had granted just 46 sanads or land titles to the scheduled tribes (ST) and other traditional forest dwellers. As per the provisions of the act, when a forest dweller files a claim for land title, it passes through three levels of checks. Once the claim is received, the forest rights committee (FRC) does an on-ground verification along with forest department officials. The committee verifies both, the individual and community forest right claims. The FRC and the gram sabha then hold a meeting to pass a resolution on the claims, where the meeting must have a quorum of 50% with a third of them women. The claims are then sent to the sub-divisional level committee (SDLC) and then for final approval to the district-level committee (DLC). “Often, due to lack of quorum for gram sabha meetings, the meetings to verify claims are cancelled. Some people say they have got their sanad certificates so they no longer want to participate in the gram sabha meetings. This is wrong. All tribals must remain together and help each other get the titles for their land,” Sawant said. He also announced that the proposal for a tribal research centre at Sanguem and a Birsa Munda freedom fighters museum at Farmagudi would be set up in the near future. Five model tribal villages will also be set up to showcase the culture, traditions, music and handicrafts, which will also attract tourists. A national tribal dance festival and tribal craft festival in Goa is also on the anvil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-hopes-to-clear-5000-forest-claims-by-dec-19-cm/articleshow/87725628.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Addressing a press conference on Monday at Telangana Bhavan, Rythu Bandhu Samithi chairperson Palla Rajeshwara Reddy, Rajya Sabha MP Badugula Lingaiah Yadav and other leaders from Nalgonda condemned the alleged attack on farmers. The leaders accused the BJP of bringing sticks and stones in cars to create terror in Miryalaguda.  “BJP government at the Centre informed Telangana government they were not going to procure paddy in the next agriculture season and even asked the state to encourage farmers to go for alternative crops. But Bandi Sanjay is instigating farmers,” Rajeshwar Reddy said. They also accused the BJP of adopting a dual policy on paddy by procuring two crore metric tonnes in Punjab while denying the same in Telangana. “BJP leaders should get an official letter of assurance to procure paddy from the state,” Lingaiah Yadav said. In a statement, Nalgonda minister G Jagadish Reddy said Sanjay was creating terror at procurement centres in the name of visit. “People of Nalgonda will teach a lesson to BJP leaders,” the minister said. In another press meet, animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav called Sanjay a liar. “Sheep distribution programme was taken up by the government by availing a loan of Rs 3,550 crore from NCDC.

With an ambitious target of procuring 50 lakh tonnes for the current market season, the state government will be opening 6,884 procurement centres across the state. The government has already issued orders to the district administrations on paddy procurement. The government has instructed the AP State Co-operative Marketing Federation Ltd (Markfed) to carry out procurement in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts while leaving the task in the rest of the 10 districts to the AP Civil Supplies Corporation. The Primary Agriculture Marketing Societies (PACS) and the District Cooperative Marketing Societies (DCMS) have been made agencies to assist the farmers and the procurement agencies. The two agencies would also shoulder responsibility of making payments to the farmers while the respective district collectors would monitor both procurement and payment. The government has also directed the collectors to ensure that the farmers are paid within 21 days from date of procurement.

High noise levels affect hearing, impact cardiovascular health, and lead to annoyance, sleep disturbance and high blood pressure in individuals. Children and the elderly, especially those with existing physical and mental illness, are more susceptible to noise and face the brunt. Charbagh recorded the highest noise pollution of 79.5 decibels, revealed CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Researchs’ post-monsoon noise pollution survey. Indiranagar was the noisiest among all the residential localities in the city both during the day as well as at night, recording noise levels of 72.9 and 62.5 decibels respectively. After Indiranagar, Gomtinagar (61.1), Aliganj (59.2) and Vikasnagar (57.8) were the noisiest residental areas at night while among commercial areas, Charbagh recorded highest noise pollution of 79.5 decibels at night, followed by Aminabad (69.8), Chowk (67.2) and Alambagh (66.3). “Due to increase in vehicular traffic, blowing of horns by heavy vehicles like trucks and trailers, use of loudspeakers, blowing of sirens led to increase in noise pollution. Exposure to high noise has several adverse impacts on health and can even lead to loss of hearing if a person is exposed to deafening noise for a prolonged period,” said IITR chief scientist G C Kisku. Not only on humans, but high noise pollution has a harmful impact on the overall environment, plants, and animals. Noise pollution was recorded above permissible limits, both during day and night, at all locations monitored by CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nights-turned-noisier-trigger-alarm-as-experts-warn-of-severe-health-hazard/articleshow/87725635.cms||---

Telangana industries and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao asked the Centre to release Rs 900 crore for backward districts financial assistance and provide concessions for industrial promotion under AP Reorganization Act, 2014. He said the 15th finance commission recommendations were not being implemented as far as Telangana is concerned. Participating in the meeting of chief ministers’ and finance ministers of states held by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, KTR made a detailed presentation on state policies and schemes for industrial and infrastructure development in the state. “The youngest state in the country, which is just 2.5% population in the country’s population is contributing five per cent of country’s GDP. During the formation of the state, the GDP of the state was Rs 1.24 lakh crore, now it rose to Rs 2.37 lakh crore. When it comes to state’s GSDP rose to Rs 9.8 lakh crore now from Rs 5 lakh crore in 2014,” the minister said.  “The Centre should discourage unhealthy competition among the states and behave wisely on giving concessions for setting up industries.

Four others Ramanathan, 44, owner of the unit, his wife Panchavarnam, 40, Hameedha, 55, and Kartheeswari, 33, are feared trapped under the building debris as they are missing from the spot.According to official sources, Ramanathan owns the unit at Nehruji Nagar at Sivakasi where cardboard tubes are produced. These cardboard tubes are mainly used for the production of fancy or aerial variety of crackers. Fancy variety of crackers were also illegally manufactured inside the unit.On Monday afternoon, when the employees were working in the unit, a fire broke out triggering an explosion. Due to its impact, the entire unit on a two-storeyed building collapsed.Velmurugan and Manojkumar who sustained 60% and 30% burn injuries respectively were rescued and rushed to the Sivakasi government hospital for treatment. Fire and rescue services personnel from Sivakasi rushed to the spot and are carrying out the work to remove the debris.Speaking to TOI, an official from the department said that they received a call at around 3.15pm. Though the team rushed to the spot, it was unable to go near the building for more than 30 minutes, as the crackers were continuously exploding. Only after the explosion stopped, they put out the fire.The official said that on seeing the nature of the explosion, they suspect that crackers were illegally manufactured in the unit. The building is two-storeyed with a ground floor, first floor, a few rooms and a water tank on the second floor. Huge quantity of chemicals that are required for manufacture of crackers was said to have stored in the building. Since the chemicals have to be carefully handled, the work on removing the debris is going at a slow pace. Only after the debris is completely removed, we would be able to tell if anyone is trapped, said the official.The Sivakasi Town police are conducting investigations about this incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/four-missing-as-illegal-fireworks-unit-in-sivakasi-collapses-in-blast/articleshow/87724675.cms||---

When TOI visited the site on Monday, the otherwise serene landscape was seen buzzing with construction activity. About 1,500 staff and workers are toiling day and night to catapult it into a major learning hub, located some 30 kilometres from Vizag. The demo given by the technical team to TOI from a model classroom at the site offered a peek into the tectonic shift in the digital technologies that IIM-V is bringing into every classroom. The redesigned learning spaces with high-tech classrooms are aimed at preparing students for the future. The institute planning to conduct the next academic session from the permanent campus by readying essential structures like academic blocks, hostels and other student amenities. Speaking to TOI, IIM-V director Prof M Chandrasekhar said the classrooms at the permanent campus would be Operation Digital Board (ODB)-compliant to offer near physical learning experience to the students. “The smart camera tracking system would help conduct paired classrooms. Students can see the professor in close-up even as he/she moves around, during virtual classes. And the students can conserve naturally with the professor or students during virtual classes,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. “The capacity creation at the permanent campus will come in handy to meet the future inevitable growth of the institute and scaling up of academic programmes. The National Education Policy-2020 envisaged a multidisciplinary approach in academic institutions. The academic bank of credits, proposed under NEP-2020, will give freedom to students to learn from multiple institutions at the same time. This would help IIM-V expand its horizon. The advanced digital technologies embraced in the permanent campus will help offering full-time online programmes. IIM-Vizag does not need to create separate studios for this setup as every classroom doubles up as a studio as advanced technology is an integral part,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-to-soon-move-into-permanent-campus/articleshow/87723938.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Commuters complain that the careless driving and incessant honking have become a major distraction on the roads and are leading to accidents. On Monday, a speeding private bus went out of control and crashed into 13 vehicles before coming to a stop by hitting a roadside tree at Foreshore Road. Although a broken brake pedal was prima facie identified as the cause of the accident, speeding has been a major cause for concern especially on this stretch. Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod said that the city has been witnessing serious traffic congestion and urged police to take proactive action to control it. “There have been complaints about private buses stopping at random locations in the city to take passengers instead of stopping at the designated stops. I have raised the issue in the district development committee (DDC) meeting and the collector has promised to take appropriate action,” said Vinod. The city police are planning to launch a dedicated WhatsApp number for the public to report rash driving. Police officers said that with the new WhatsApp number residents will be able to tip police about rash driving by sending videos or pictures or simply through a message. All those who were involved in Monday’s accident had a narrow escape. It was private bus Maria, which commutes between EdakoVechi and Kakkanad, that met with the accident around 11am on Monday. Police said that according to those who saw the accident the bus started speeding after taking the curve near the Foreshore Road. “The bus first hit a car moving in front of it with two women, including an elderly person. The bus then hit vehicles parked on the right side of the road. An autorickshaw overturned in the impact of the collision. The windshield and bumper of the bus sustained damages. All the other vehicles, including two autorickshaws, also got damaged,” said an officer. Police said that as many as 20 persons were taken to the hospitals nearby but all were discharged soon after. Central police recorded the statement of the owner and driver of the bus. A case was registered for offences including rash driving, an officer with the central police said. Police said that CCTV footage in the area would be checked to find if the bus was speeding. “Minor accidents happen in the stretch often as bus drivers try to take the sharp curve here very quickly. There was some academic programme at an educational institution nearby and several cars were parked on both sides of the road when the accident occurred,” said an officer. On November 1, three youths had died in an accident at Chakkaraparambu due to alleged drunken and rash driving. As per the statistics of the state police, in 2020, a total of 1,437 accidents were reported in the city. Among these 98 were fatal, 1,067 had victims with grievous injuries, 195 with minor injuries and 77 where no one was injured. A total of 101 deaths and 1,122 grievous injuries were reported in accidents in the city last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vehicle-pile-up-raises-concern-over-rash-driving-by-pvt-buses/articleshow/87723991.cms||---

Senior state-level leaders have already undertaken trips to some of the districts where the saffron party has good strength in the local bodies. Party sources said the leaders talked to the rank and file and local party leaders on the winning chances of the party if it were to enter the fray in the MLC polls. There are 12 vacancies in the local bodies quota. The party is considering fielding candidates from Rangareddy, Nizamabad and Karimnagar where it has a significant presence in the local bodies. “We are reviewing the situation and will take a decision in next few days after consulting with local leaders,” N Ramchander Rao, former party MLC, said. The party is also considering various options to cause ripples in TRS camp by trying to secure some TRS MLAs’ support for nominating its candidates in the MLC elections to be held under the MLA quota. Going by the numbers, the BJP can manage to field its candidates in the local authorities constituencies, but it falls short of seven legislators in the MLA quota as 10 legislators are required to propose a candidate. “Even if the behind-the-scenes strategies fail, the saffron party’s moves are going to hit a raw nerve with the ruling party,” party sources said. Some BJP leaders cited the example of senior TRS leader K Keshava Rao who enlisted the support of Congress MLAs while contesting for the Rajya Sabha MP seat. Sources said party state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar will take a call on fielding the candidates. “Even otherwise, aggressive efforts will be made to poach rebel TRS leaders into the saffron party,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-eyes-mlc-pie-now-despite-lack-of-numbers/articleshow/87724716.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In the minor’s rape, Ajay alias Ajju Ratan Parik, 22, Sahil Rajmani Singh, 24 and Rameshwar alias Ballu Indramani Tiwari, 22, were convicted by the court of Dilip Mahida, special judge for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act cases. Two minor accused involved in the crime were given the benefit of age. “They developed friendship with the Class X girl over Instagram and later morphed her image to make an obscene photo. They started blackmailing her and took turns to rape her,” said Arvind Vasoya, public prosecutor.  In the case of the 22-year-old woman in Kapodra, the court of Amrut Dhamani, additional sessions judge, sentenced Mishra to 14-year jail. “Mishra had entered the survivor’s house when her husband was not present at home.

Cut to March 2020, with the pandemic forcing the academic institutions to shut down for months on end, he had no other option other than adapting to the new reality of online education for his ward. This is not an isolated case as lakhs of students in Andhra Pradesh had to switch to online platforms to achieve academic continuity in the last two years. But medical experts point to the increasing vision problems in children that has come about with the increase in screen time, particularly with prolonged usage of smartphones in the last decade. The results of a recent mass screening programme under Dr YSR Kanti Velugu programme corroborated this trend. The state government conducted eye tests on nearly 66 lakh schoolgoing children in Andhra Pradesh as part of the Kanti Velugu initiative. Spectacles were prescribed to 1.58 lakh students, while other eye conditions were identified in 2,621 children among those screened. Surgeries were performed on about 309 students. Renowned ophthalmologist and former regional eye hospital superintendent Dr VVL Narasimha Rao said prolonged exposure to electronic gadgets will do cause harm in children than adults. “There has been an increase in the number of eye complaints in children in the last two years. Unfortunately, parents are left with the only option of online learning for their kids. But parents should make sure their kids take frequent breaks in between classes,” said Dr Rao. Dr Rao added that screen time of children should be limited. “Not only online classes, some children have their eyes glued to video games even after attending virtual classes. Children tend to blink less frequently while playing video games or attending online classes, leading to itchy, dry eyes.” Narava Prakasa Rao, convenor of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Forum, said parents should engage children in physical activities once online classes are over for the day. “It has been brought to our attention that some children are immersing themselves in cartoon shows or video games even after classes rather than physical games. This will be a double burden on their eyes,” said Prakasa Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/smartphone-learning-presents-spectacles-to-1-58-lakh-students/articleshow/87723979.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Three earthquakes of above four magnitude were reported in Peddpalli in Telangana, Gadchiroli and Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh also witnessed a microearthquake. The experts said that seismic zonation hasn’t changed. “There earthquakes do happen, and it is just a coincidence that they occurred in a short period. The places they occurred are not that close, and the quakes are unconnected. It’s not a new phenomenon. These are all below 4.5 magnitude and are considered small earthquakes. For instance, in Karnataka, due to hydro-seismicity, rainfall percolating into earth crevices resulted in microquakes. This will not occur in all regions,” National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) chief scientist M Ravi Kumar said. Tectonic plates are in constant motion and when two plates collide, a big earthquake occurs. But in interior tectonic plates, stress builds up, and when this stress is released, small quakes occur. “We are away from the plate boundary. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, including Hyderabad, are in zone 2 and fall in low seismic risk zone and only certain parts fall in zone 3,” he added. Srinagesh Davuluri, a siesmologist and professor, department of civil engineering, IIT Madras, said, “The intervening region where Godavari river flows in Telangana and Maharasthra is classified as seismic zone 3 and the south coastal AP from Kakinada down up to Chittoor as seismic zone 3. Other areas, including Hyderabad, are in zone 2 of low risk.” “Nothing to worry about the recent quakes. They fall in the Godavari rift valley. This region is conscious with weak zones within the crest of the earth. Accumulated stress in the form of seismic energy is released, leading to tremors,” he added. NGRI has been studying both the inter and intra plate earthquakes for the past six decades. Initially, NGRI had a single station on its campus in the city, but now it operates more than 200 seismological stations across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/series-of-quakes-part-of-pressure-release-experts/articleshow/87724729.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The renewable energy park attached to the children’s park still remains closed. T J Vinod, MLA, has asked government to probe the alleged anomalies in the renovation of the children’s park. “Many facilities in the park are yet to be arranged. The park was inaugurated after the renovation in February 2021, works were pending though. But the park had been remaining closed. Even nine months after the formal inauguration, many of the renovation works are yet to be completed. On Sunday, the park was reopened for the children, but works are incomplete,” Vinod said. “Computer arcade game, bumper cars, pedal boats, toy train and skating facilities are not ready. The CCTV surveillance cameras which are part of the safety and security system in the park are yet to be activated. The sprinklers to water the lawn and plants in the park also are not functional,” Vinod said. Vinod has submitted memorandums in this regard to health, women and children welfare minister Veena George, and district collector Jafar Malik. He also brought the attention of the authorities to the anomalies in the renovation works. Vinod asked the government to book the culprits and also to expedite the works. The renewable energy park attached to the children’s park is full of bushes. “The authorities should clear the undergrowth urgently and reopen it for the children. Decades ago, there had been facilities for imparting traffic awareness to the children in the park. The facility is lacking now. Authorities should restore the facility. This will help create a new generation who knows, respects and abides by traffic rules thereby making our roads safer,” said Ranjith Thampy, an activist. Most of the toys at the renewable energy park have been damaged due to various reasons. According to the officials with the children’s park, some of the toys are to be imported while some other toys are to be brought from other parts of the country. The pandemic has affected the manufacturing of toys and their transportation, the officials say. They also said that the toys can be procured without much delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/renewable-energy-park-out-of-bounds-for-kids/articleshow/87724004.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nearly 50% drop in number of critical patients in state||Pune: With a consistent drop in fresh Covid infections, the number of critical patients in the state has reduced by nearly half, from 5,048 last month to 2,783 on November 8, as per public health department data. In all, there were 1,132 Covid patients in intensive care units across Maharashtra. Nineteen districts in Maharashtra are reporting fewer than 50 active cases, with nine districts reporting single digit caseloads, the data till November 15 showed. Covid task force members said the state appears to be slowly moving towards an endemic stage, though they said it was too early to say for sure. “Critical patients, meaning those in need of oxygen support, are reducing significantly. The number has dropped even in terms of daily critical patients being reported at hospitals. Though percentage of critical patients among total active patients is the same, the absolute numbers of severe infections have fallen considerably, and Covid-19 vaccination seems to have played a major role in this reduction,” a state public health department official said. The official added, “The main purpose of vaccination is not a reduction in reinfection, but reduction in severe Covid cases/critical admissions and therefore, mortalities — a trend seen post-vaccination.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force, told TOI, “We are slowly and surely moving towards endemicity, though it is too early to say we are there. Maharashtra must wait for another two weeks for the Diwali-effect on Covid cases to become apparent. If there is no significant surge in cases by the month-end and, depending on how fast we can vaccinate the rest of the population, the state could quickly move towards achieving Covid endemicity.” Pandit said another 7-14 days will have to elapse for any festival-related surge in Covid cases to show. “Reduction in Covid mortalities and single-digit active cases in several districts is, however, indicative of the pandemic being under control with low test positivity rates in various districts. Some districts have had active cases in single digits for weeks now, which is significant,” Pandit said. Around mid-September, at least 14 districts in Maharashtra had an active Covid caseload of below 50, while seven of these had active cases in single digits. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “Total number of Covid patients being admitted at the hospital is just six currently. The single digit Covid admission trend has persisted for four weeks now. There have hardly been any Covid mortalities at our hospital in the last two months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-nearly-50-drop-in-number-of-critical-patients-in-state/articleshow/87724750.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Testing time for schools as CBSE term exams start today||NEW DELHI: The Central Board for Secondary Education Term 1 exams begin on Tuesday for Class XII and Wednesday for Class X. The schools have arranged for photocopy machines, taking care to stock extra ink cartridges and papers because they are required to print out optical mark recognition (OMR) answer sheets and do not want to be caught at a disadvantage. AK Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, has installed an extra photocopier. He said, “For now, the exams are scheduled in my school only on Wednesday. It is on a minor subject, so we don’t expect any problems. We might face difficulties when the exams are in important subjects like English and Hindi.” Unlike students of private schools, government school students will not be writing the exams in their own school, but in other test centres. Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at Government Boys' Senior Secondary School in Ghitorni, said, "Our school is not an exam centre, but the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya nearby is one.” In another government school at Madanpur Khadar on Monday, the authorities checked the internet speed, which had only recently been enhanced after hybrid teaching and learning, comprising online and physical lessons, began at the school. On Monday CBSE organised a mock drill for the schools in printing the OMR sheets and question papers. Term 1 exams will comprise multiple choice questions with the students marking their answers on the OMR sheets. Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School, said, “Conducting the mock drill proved helpful because we learnt how the mass printing needed to be done. Each school's email ID has been submitted to the education board and that is how we get the link for downloading the OMR sheets.” All the examinations, which are to be conducted from November 16 to 29 and again from 26 December onwards, will have question papers supplied in an encrypted mode. Forty-five minutes prior to the day’s exam, the school will be able to download the question paper. The exams will begin from 11.30am instead of the regular 10.30am. The students of 26,000 schools affiliated with CBSE in India and 26 abroad will be writing the exam. Because the examination will be conducted in the schools, the board has appointed observers at each examination centre to preserve the sanctity of the examination process. There will be one observer with centres hosting 500 examinees and two for those with more than 500 students. The city coordinators are responsible for appointing the observers at the examination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/testing-time-for-schools-as-cbse-term-exams-start-today/articleshow/87724730.cms||Shradha Chettri

The recommendations were put forward on the second day of the workshop on ‘Vypeen island protection and sustainable development’ on Monday. “The availability of quality fish is coming down in the state. Hence, prospects for aquaculture methods like cage fish farming and biofloc is high at Vypeen which is a favourable place for fish production. “Farmers can cultivate and harvest Vannamei shrimp (whiteleg shrimp) on the compounds of their houses itself. It has high export opportunities,” said Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos) registrar B Manoj Kumar. “Shrimp can be cultivated in biofloc method and harvested in seven months. By expanding pokkali farming, cage farming can be done along with prawn farming at pokkali fields. Aquaponics method also can increase job opportunities,” he said. Other than creating job opportunities associated with fish farming, export of marine and value-added products also will create employment. The workshop also discussed the prospects of inland tourism in the area by giving thrust to the tradition of the island, culture, history, pokkali farming and water resources. “Since the population density is high at Vypeen, possibilities of setting up small-scale industries in electronics, organic vegetable farming and waste management can be explored,” Kumar said. The workshop is held in the backdrop of climate change induced incidents at Vypeen. The area witnesses recurring episodes of sea erosion and high tide. It has been envisaged to formulate a master plan for the island by consolidating the expert views and traditional knowledge emerged at the workshop. The workshop will conclude on Tuesday and water resources minister Roshy Augustine will inaugurate the valedictory function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-for-novel-fishing-methods-at-vypeen/articleshow/87724018.cms||---

A petition was filed by Congress candidate Madan Mohan Rao, who had lost the election to Patil by a margin of 6,000 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. According to the Congress leader, the election of Patil needs to be set aside because he suppressed the fact that he was convicted by a Jharkhand court. Senior counsel K Vivek Reddy,who appeared for the Congress leader, said Patil had suppressed the pending criminal cases filed against him in Jharkhand under the Forest Act (Bihar Amendment) and the criminal conviction under the Payment of Wages Act. The Congress leader also alleged that Patil had not given wide publicity to the cases that were registered against him as was mandated by the Election Commission. Senior counsel Haren Raval, appearing for Patil, said that the trial court only imposed a penalty for non-maintenance of labour records and minimum wages in contract work at a forest area of Jharkhand. Patil is a partner of the firm and the alleged conviction did not come under the purview of the prohibitions imposed by the Election Commission, he said. The arguments would continue on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patil-dismissal-plea-hearing-begins-in-hc/articleshow/87724735.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The CM was addressing a function organised at the Cultural Complex here on the occasion of the 146th birth anniversary of tribal icon Birsa Munda on Monday. He said that the tribal population inspires all to protect the natural resources. “We appreciate the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to celebrate the jayanti of Bhagwan Birsa Munda as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas,” said the CM, and highlighted the sacrifice of Birsa Munda for the country’s freedom. “He sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 in 1900 that proved to be a mantra of country’s independence in a short span of 47 years,” he added. “The state government is committed to take care of the tribal population and benefit them with all welfare schemes and programmes for their well-being,” said the CM, adding that the state government has initiated a number of steps for their welfare and development. “After 2017, as many as 54 forest villages have been granted the status of revenue villages so far. Work is in progress to benefit them with land pattas, ration cards, Ayushman cards and employment opportunities,” said Yogi adding that the government respects the tribal population and is committed to protect their dignity. The CM accused the previous governments of ignoring the tribal population. “The welfare work of tribals should have been done just after the independence, but there was no thought and vision,” he said, adding that they remained neglected till 2014. The CM also highlighted the leadership of PM Modi in successfully tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that people were given free vaccination, food grains and financial help during the pandemic period. The function was attended by the mayor Mridula Jaiswal, UP ministers Ashutosh Tandon, Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and Anil Rajbhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tribal-population-is-saviour-of-natural-resources-biodiversity/articleshow/87724026.cms||---

So affected were the boys from Vasant Vihar in south Delhi that they began working on a zero-waste management project. From January 2018, the brothers began getting the people of their colony to segregate household waste, gradually including people from adjoining colonies. The duo educated the residents about the importance of waste segregation and proper disposal of trash. They created a WhatsApp group and started the collection of segregated dry wastes from the houses. This stellar effort of the kids, called OneStepGreener, has found recognition beyond the city. They were adjudged winners of the KidsRights International Children’s Peace Prize, which has a cash component of 100,000 euros (Rs 84.9 lakh), at a ceremony held at The Hague. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi handed over the award to the Agarwals. Satyarthi tweeted, “India may be the land of a hundred problems, but it’s also the land of a billion solutions. Pleased to confer the KidsRights International Children’s Peace Prize ’21 on Vihaan and Nav. This Children’s Day, I reiterate — nothing is more important than voices of young people.” Having recycled around 1.8 lakh kilos of dry waste, Vihaan, a Class XII student, said, “We have educated over 60,000 people on waste management and afforestation through talks and training. We have saved about 25 lakh litres of water and prevented around 1,029 cubic metres of landfill space being used. The electricity saving has been equivalent to lighting 1.5 lakh houses. The oxygen generated is around 2.8 crore pounds and the carbon sequestered, 1.7 lakh pounds.” Nav, a Class IX student, added, “OneStepGreener currently services homes, schools and offices in more than 14 colonies in Delhi and Gurugram. We have planted an urban mini forest in Vasant Vihar and reforested neglected parks.” The brothers homes, clubs, offices and school a monthly schedule for the pick-up of dry waste. The waste collected goes to factories for reuse and to certified recyclers. “This ensures that waste is permanently eliminated from the landfills and reduces the depletion of Earth's precious resources,” smiled Vihaan. After winning the award, the brothers said they felt “elated, grateful and humbled” and hope KidsRights would help their voices to be heard. They plan to soon start pickups in other cities across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-delhi-kids-win-global-award-for-managing-waste-tree-plantation/articleshow/87724755.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Lucknow||1090: A decade of women’s safety||LUCKNOW: As many as 20 lakh complaints of harassment of women and girls—both offline and online—have been resolved by Women Power Line (WPL) 1090 since its launch in 2012. “There has been considerable increase in rate of crime against women and more efforts are required to curb them. WPL 1090 has made efforts in this direction. Even UNICEF has praised the agency and given it 98% success,” said DGP Mukul Goel, who launched multiple awareness programmes through community participation related to women’s security by women and child security organization 1090 on completion of its 10 years. Goel along with UPSRTC MD Navdeep Rinwa flagged off LED vans under the ‘safe city’ project with the message of awareness about crimes against women and calling 1090 for help. “The vans will run for eight hours a day for the promotion of messages around women’s safety,” he said. Additional director general of police WPL 1090 Neera Rawat said that emphasis has been laid on spreading of awareness about 1090 through community participation. “We have decided to distribute placards and pamphlets with messages of awareness among village chowkidars, RWAs, youths engaged with NSS, and security guards of offices. If they notice any woman or girl being harassed, they can share this information about 1090 with them,” said Rawat. About 200 buses operated by UPSRTC will also carry the message through banners. These will ply in far-flung areas of the state. Besides, tickets will also carry the information. An official of WPL 1090 said that it was for the first time that UPSRTC had been roped in for the cause of women’s safety. All these activities and expansion are a part of Mission Shakti 3.0, the campaign of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1090-a-decade-of-womens-safety/articleshow/87725680.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC to watch out for December surge as more international tourists expected in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC on Monday said it will watch out for any rise in Covid-19 cases and any possibility of a new variant next month following the expected increase in travellers from abroad for Christmas and year-end festivities. The BMC said there has been no visible rise in cases after Diwali so far. However, the civic body said the 14-day Covid cycle ends around November 20 and it would continue testing aggressively to monitor the situation. Civic officials said they will be as vigilant in December as they expect an increase in overseas travellers. Recently, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said with the ministry of aviation allowing airlines to operate at 100% of their scheduled capacity and the Christmas season lined up, passenger traffic is inching towards pre-Covid levels. It is a known fact that due to Covid restrictions, several overseas travellers had been unable to visit Mumbai last year. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the health department, pointed to news reports that Mumbai airport has been witnessing a record number of passengers. “In December we expect an increase in international travellers landing in the city either to meet families or as tourists, considering that travel restrictions have eased and also a large number have been vaccinated. Besides, socialisation may also be at its peak. Any new variant may be enough to rock the boat and therefore we will be monitoring it very closely. We would be requesting testing of travellers and also appeal to those with even the slightest symptoms to get tested,” said Kakani, adding this is one of the reasons why they have been conducting cyclic genome sequencing, which is a study of changes in the structure of the virus over time at regular intervals. Officials said increasing vaccine coverage of the city’s population is encouraging. The BMC is taking various steps to increase vaccination, including calling citizens who may have missed their second dose, holding vaccine-on-wheel camps around high footfall areas and encouraging housing societies to inform them in case anyone has missed their dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-watch-out-for-dec-surge-as-more-intl-tourists-expected-in-city/articleshow/87724766.cms||Richa Pinto

A student from the KMC tweeted about the incident. Noticing the tweet, Mattewada police visited KMC campus on Monday and enquired with students. Mattewada Inspector T Ganesh said, “We thoroughly examined the hostel premises, interacted with the third-year and fourth-year students. We tried to trace the number of the student who tweeted. However, could not trace the person. All hostellers said there was no such (ragging) incident.” The tweet alleged that fourth year students forced first year students to consume alcohol. A central team from Hyderabad visited the KMC and also concluded that no such ragging incident took place. The central team camped at KMC campus. KMC principal Dr D Mohan Das stated that third year students were busy making arrangements on campus and in the meantime a third year student held a birthday party on campus. “There may have been a little clash. But, there was no ragging reported on the campus. However, KMC constituted an enquiry panel.” The false information was tweeted and Prime Minister tagged.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Liquor prices set for a sharp dip from today, some beers too will cost less||KOLKATA: Tipplers are getting ready to raise a toast as the price of all kinds of liquors — India Made Foreign Liquor, beer, bottled in origin liquor (BIO), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) and wine — are dropping by a hefty 20%-30%. For beer, the fall is marginal though (5%-6%). But for some IMFL, the dip will be up to 30%. According to the prices registered with the excise so far, prices of some leading premium and semi-premium whisky brands have been slashed by 30% — from Rs 1,350 to Rs 920 for a 750ml bottle. For deluxe whisky brands, the fall will be 25%-26% — from Rs 980 to Rs 710. In case of popular rum brands, the price dip will be around 15%-18% — from Rs 640-Rs 650 to Rs 540. Price of some overseas spirits bottled in India will down by over 30% — from Rs 2,290 to Rs 1,640. Beer prices of some leading brands for both lager and strong beer have come down by 5%-6% — from Rs 130 (strong) to Rs 120 and from Rs 119 (lager) to Rs 115 (650 ml). “Prices of vodka, BIO, OSBI, Gin and brandy will be registered eventually in another couple of days. In the first batch, only those prices have been registered that are high selling products. For beer, the marginal fall comes after a major price slash in October 2020, making it even cheaper than the pre-pandemic level for some brands. On Tuesday, excise officials will meet liquor retailers to discuss a new distribution structure. It was learnt that the excise department had a series of meetings with leading liquor and beer companies over the last few months following a series of representations from various bodies related to liquor trade. The consumption of IMFL in the state was in decline since the upward revision in price in April 2020. The price of IMFL has increased by almost 40%-50% in two phases since the pandemic set in. In the last quarter of 2020-21 (Jan-Feb-March 21) and first two quarters of 2021-22 (Apr-June and July to Sep), liquor consumption was down by 30%-35% compared to the same period of 2019-20. The trend continued in the third quarter of this fiscal year despite it being a festive month. Sources in the liquor industry said that even in October, sales were down by 20%. In a sharp contrast, demand for beer has witnessed a jump. The price of beer was slashed by 20%-30% in October 2020. An executive of a beer company pointed out that there had been a robust growth in beer demand since the price drop. “We are getting a very encouraging response,” he added. Bengal is a market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer annually. The total consumption of IMFL in 2020-21 was little over 10 million cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-prices-set-for-a-sharp-dip-from-today-some-beers-too-will-cost-less/articleshow/87724049.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

CM thanks PM for idol brought back to KashiAddressing a function organised at the Rudraksh International Convention centre after the installation ceremony, Yogi said, “There was no other better place than KVT to install this idol, which returned here after being stolen 108 years ago. It will make the coming generations aware about how the symbols of culture and heritage of India had been left to be stolen and smuggled in the past and also inspire them to preserve it.” Expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts for bringing the idol back to Kashi, he said, “The theft of idols for smuggling used to hurt the sentiments of the people but the previous governments did not bother. The PM is ensuring the return of such idols from across the world. While returning from the US recently, the PM brought back 156 such idols and antiquities with him.” “Kashi has always been an attraction for people from across the world due to it being an ancient centre of Sanatan Dharma and spirituality. Despite this fact, Mahatma Gandhi had to give a bitter reaction over the sanitary condition in and around the KVT in 1916 during his visit. In the name of Mahatma Gandhi, many ruled the country for decades but never tried to ensure development of the shrine and city as per its stature,” said Yogi, mentioning that after over 100 years of Gandhi’s remark, how the PM ensured the development of KV Dham (corridor) as per the stature of this shrine. “The idol of Goddess Annapurna, which has returned due to efforts and inspiration of the PM, has been consecrated on the courtyard of KVT in its ‘Ishan kon’ (northeast point) as per Vastu Shashtra on the auspicious occasion of Devthan Ekadashi,” said Yogi, praising the PM for beginning construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya by ensuring a permanent solution of the five-century-old dispute, efforts for cleaning of river Ganga, making Yoga global, ensuring that no one starved during the pandemic with the best Covid-19 management in the world and giving the vision of development of everyone without any discrimination as per Vedic traditions.” Regarding the delayed arrival of the rathyatra (carrying the idol) from New Delhi on November 11, Yogi said, “When the rathyatra to bring this idol to Kashi from New Delhi was planned, it had been decided that it will move 4-6 hours per day and halt in different cities in night. But, lakhs of people kept turning up on roads in all districts through which it passed. Thus, the possibility of a night stay on the way to Kashi ended.” He said that he had reached Kashi on Sunday evening and also visited Durgakund, where the rathyatra had to halt at night after entering Kashi in the afternoon, but it reached during wee hours on Monday. Earlier, UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari, who had left Ayodhya with rathyatra on Sunday morning, reached Varanasi at 4 am. Tiwari said, “Delay was caused as thousands of people at hundreds of points in Pratapgarh, Sultanpur and Jaunpur had surrounded the rathyatra to welcome it and offer prayers to the idol of the goddess. To avoid any further delay, the rathyatra could stay at Durgakund for a few minutes only after reaching there around 7 am.” A huge crowd also showered petals on the rath yatra before it reached KVT. Before the arrival of the idol inside KVT, a band of 11 priests had started rituals of consecration. After the idol was brought down, Yogi took it inside the temple in a silver palanquin and completed the rituals of consecration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-installs-retrieved-18th-century-goddess-annapurna-idol-at-kvt/articleshow/87724048.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The civic body’s water works department is aiming to provide water connections to these areas within a year. The water works department has floated tenders to lay Ductile Iron (DI) pipeline in these areas and the work is expected to start in the next three to four months. Water works department officials said that the tenders have been floated to lay DI pipeline in Nageshwar, Jamnagar road, Vardhman Nagar, Raiyadhar, FCI godown road and other areas. The total cost of the project is Rs 26 crore. A population of around 70,000 will be benefitted by the project. Madhapar, Ghanteshwar and Manharpar were merged with RMC’s west zone a year ago. These newly merged areas are still deprived of many basic facilities. Some of the households get piped water through the old gram panchayat network while the majority of the population is dependent on groundwater and water tankers. Nageshwar and Vardhman Nagar, among the fastest developing areas, are highly dependent upon groundwater. Pushkar Patel, chairman of standing committee said that the tenders will be approved by the standing committee. “Once the pipeline is laid these areas will be connected with RMC’s main network,” Patel said. Devang Mandkad, chairman of the water works committee said, “We aim to provide drinking water to these areas through our network within a year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/new-rmc-areas-to-get-water-connections/articleshow/87724790.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: Farm fire share in PM2.5 close to 50 per cent in peak season||NEW DELHI: The daily percentage of emissions from harvest-stubble burning in the PM2.5 pollutants in Delhi varied from 25 per cent to 48 per cent between November 4 and November 13, the highest on a single day being 48 per cent on November 7, according to SAFAR data. Though the central government informed the Supreme Court that farm fire pollutants comprised 10 per cent of the city’s bad air, experts said the magnitude of stubble burning in the pollution crisis should not be diminished because farm fires were not a year-round phenomenon and registered high impact figures only in October-November. Data from different studies over the years brings out the varying nature of farm fires' share in the pollutants in Delhi’s air. A study by IIT-Kanpur in 2016 stated the contribution of biomass burning to the city’s PM2.5 was 26 per cent in winter and 12 per cent in summer. Another by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) titled ‘Bending Delhi’s Air Pollution Curve’ said the relative contribution from farm fires was the highest (31.4 per cent) between October 15 and November 15, 2020, reducing then to 8.6 per cent between November 15 and December 15, 2020 and 4.1 per cent between December 15, 2020 and January 15, 2021. TImesViewDelhi is choking again and it is undeniable that stubble burning has played a role. Exactly how large that role is might differ from one study or report to another, depending on the month and other factors, but there is little doubt that only a sustained and concerted effort can stamp out the menace.According to data shared with TOI by the Union earth ministry body, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), in the past, the average share of stubble fire emissions between October 1 and November 30 was 16 per cent in 2020, 13.5 per cent in 2019 and 12 per cent in 2018. Chandra Bhushan, CEO, International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iForest), said, “The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution might be 4-10 per cent annually, but it goes up to 40 per cent on some weeks. The right way to present facts is to highlight that harvest stubble is not burnt for 365 days, only for a few weeks in a year. During the stubble burning season, it causes high levels of pollution.” Advocate Ritwick Dutta, founder and managing trustee, Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment, similarly noted, “The important point here is that the monthly contribution of stubble burning may be around 10 per cent, but we have to look at the 15-20 days when the share is highest. Average monthly or seasonal contributions do not signify the daily impact.” Explaining this, he said, “If there were five heavy rainfall days in a month, the mean rainfall of the year would still be low if we were to include data of other months.” Dutta added, “Meteorology ensures that stubble burning adds a dangerous dimension to Delhi’s pollution in the winter months. If the base load of pollution (other components like emissions from vehicles, industries and dust) is high, even a 10 per cent addition from the farm fires can be significant.” A Delhi government official also asserted, “If we include only the stubble burning period, the percentage of the farm fires’ share in pollution will be quite high. But if we include September, December and January in the calculations, when the farm fires are negligible, the average contribution is shown as low.” Pointing out how the measured taken by the central and state governments in the past few years, such as in-situ and ex-situ methods to discourage farmers from burning stubble and an attempt at banning stubble burning, hadn’t yielded the desired results, L S Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW, said, “While these existing measures need to be scaled up and improved, the governments should also come up with farmer-friendly plans to manage the harvest stubble in the upcoming season. The focus should be on promoting short-duration crop varieties and diversifying from paddy.” Some experts said efforts should be intensified to curb other sources of pollution too. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “SAFAR data shows that the average contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels varies widely and is not consistently high as it depends on wind direction, wind speed and intensity of stubble burning.” Given this, she said, “So, while stubble burning requires urgent attention, Delhi and NCR’s multi-sector action has to be more stringent in addressing local pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fire-share-in-pm2-5-close-to-50-in-peak-season/articleshow/87724822.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Atmanirbhar hit: Food carted out of vendors’ tables in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Over the past 25 years, Ahmedabad has largely transformed into a cosmopolitan city, largely attracting families from various states owing to major national-level institutions, central government offices, MNCs and the bustling industrial corridor, which has been its economic lifeline. Recent census figures on migration have revealed that of the total 25.6 lakh migrants in the city, 6.9 lakh belong to outside the state. The fact that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation chose to embark on a campaign to evict non-vegetarian food carts on Tuesday has not appealed to many families, including those Amdavadis who do not eat eggs at home but are regulars at some of the egg larris across the city. On Tuesday, a gamut of issues were discussed in the town planning committee meeting chaired by Devang Dani on the difficulties that may arise while executing the eviction drive on Tuesday. “Many of the street vendors were being enrolled under the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (SVANidhi) Yojana, just before the eviction announcement was made. This central scheme provides highly subsidized loan of Rs 10,000 to street vendors who were hit during the pandemic and wanted to kick start their business. Such a move could hurt the implementation of the scheme itself,” says a senior estate department official of the AMC. Dani said, “We had received complaints from residents in Maninagar, Khadia, Paldi, Narol, Nikol and several such places against such non-vegetarian food larris outside religious institutions and schools.” The senior estate department official added, “Also, we are enforcing Clause 232 of GPMC Act which relates to clearing encroachments from streets. Under that, one cannot differentiate between a non-vegetarian, vegetarian or a tea stall,” added the official. Another important issue pointed out to Dani was that non-vegetarian joints like egg carts are usually set up during evenings when there are no schools or colleges functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/atmanirbhar-hit-food-carted-out-of-vendors-tables/articleshow/87724813.cms||---

The incident took place on October 10. The victim, Amit Kumar, is a resident of Ashram and had arrived at the police station after being shot. He was taken to a hospital by the cops and admitted for treatment. He was found to have sustained a bullet injury on his back. “In his complaint, he stated that he was returning home from his office and had reached in front of Sanjay Jheel on NH-24 Service Lane, when two bikers came from behind and the pillion rider fired at him. As he fell down, the bikers fled,” DCP (east) Priyanka Kashyap said. An FIR was registered and investigation taken, up but there were no leads initially. However, the cops used technical surveillance and found that the shooters could be from Bareilly. The victim also gave some leads in this regard. Cops then arrested two men, Abhijeet and Sumit Gupta, from Bareilly. During interrogation, it was found that the victim had given Rs 4.5 lakh to Gupta, which the latter could not return. So, he roped in two others and decided to eliminate the victim. The third suspect, Sumit Patel, was also arrested by the police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-arrested-for-shooting-at-man-in-e-delhi-last-month/articleshow/87724814.cms||---

On Friday too, Srikanth, who was the handler of accused C Chennakeshavulu, was quizzed on photos. In his deposition earlier, encounter case investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy had claimed that he was too busy giving orders to control the mob and it was much later that he realised the CLUES team had not followed his order to record the entire topography of the crime scene. But in the photos and videos shown to the witness on Monday, there was no sign of any crowd trouble near the area with the four bodies that was cordoned off with yellow tape. After showing a photo, the commission’s advocate asked: “Is it not correct that this photo reflects that the crowd was far away on the highway at a distance of about 500 metres and not advancing towards the crime scene?” Srikanth replied: “It is true.” The cop was also shown a video of the tent being set up by cops and asked if it wasn’t too close to the crime scene. Srikanth said he could not be sure. The head constable also said that he did not know who the two men in white coats seen walking in the field and entering the tent in the videos were after the panel sought to know if they were doctors. When asked if at any point the inquest was hampered by the crowd on December 6, Sriknath said he did not notice, adding that there were only a few people in civil dress near the tent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/last-police-witness-quizzed-over-crowd-hampering-probe/articleshow/87724817.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Nagpur||Weather change, temperature fluctuations bring flu-like illnesses||Nagpur: The sudden change in weather and rise in temperature, which is not usual in November, has made cough, cold and flu-like illnesses more common in the last two weeks in the city. General practitioners are seeing more patients with symptoms of sore throat, cold, and fever. These symptoms are similar those of Covid-19. These also include many people who have taken both doses of vaccine. According to experts, seasonal cough and cold is common and should not be misunderstood as Covid-19. Still, going for a Covid-19 test is not a bad idea. “Patients of all age groups are coming with complaints like fever, sore throat, cough, cold, sneezing etc. We ask them about their Covid vaccination status first. If symptoms persist despite general medication, I suggest some of them to go for Covid test,” said Dr Pragati Kamble, a general physician from Manewada. However, people are reluctant to undergo testing, said many doctors. “People ask for generic medication and treatment. A majority of them believe that one or two doses of vaccine have given them full protection from infection. Secondly, home isolation is still not permitted in Nagpur. So, people do not want to spend days in hospital,” said Dr Vishal Joshi. Experts told TOI that the vaccine offers nearly 100% protection from serious diseases and hospitalization as well as oxygen need. But, it’s not a guarantee of protection from infection. “Some 5-10 patients are getting detected every day in the district for the last one week. This means at least 50 people are getting infected. As they have vaccine protection, they are not developing symptoms or must be experiencing very low symptoms,” said a senior member of the Covid task force. According to infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, non-Covid cough, cold and fever, which are being experienced by many people these days, are very infectious. “Hundreds of people are developing these symptoms daily. This is happening not only in Nagpur but everywhere. Nothing wrong in getting tested if your doctor suggests,” he said. Doctors said that it’s a win-win situation if a person tests negative. In case of testing positive despite vaccination, symptomatic treatment will cure most patients. An official from health department said they are doing their level best to ensure contact tracing and random testing in Nagpur, but still the number of tests is down. “If people come forward for testing like they used to earlier in July-August, it will in fact reduce the test positivity rate. We can also detect many asymptomatic cases,” he said. Testing is good Covid-19 testing facilities are still available at all NMC centres Many private labs are providing Covid testing at low prices now If you have symptoms and your doctor suggests, get yourself tested Even vaccinated individuals may get tested on developing symptoms Vaccinated people can get infected, but their illness won’t turn serious On testing negative, proper medication can be planned on seasonal flu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/weather-change-temperature-fluctuations-bring-flu-like-illnesses/articleshow/87724068.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aspirants await outcome of pleas in SC on med quota||Mumbai: Even as the Supreme Court’s hearing in a bunch of pleas challenging the government’s decision to apply OBC and EWS reservations to all-India medical quota seats is scheduled on Tuesday, undergraduate and postgraduate aspirants are anxiously awaiting the outcome. The court stayed the postgraduate counseling process till November 16. Undergraduate admissions in the states, on the other hand, can start once the all-India admission rounds commence. Admissions are already delayed on account of the pandemic in both UG and PG courses. A postgraduate medical aspirant, Dr Zubin Driver, said that many postgraduate aspirants who rely on the income from stipends are at home waiting for the admissions to commence. “Our admissions are already delayed due to the second wave of the pandemic. We do not mind the delay now due to the court case, as long as the decision is favourable. In a seat matrix issued for colleges, very few seats or none were vacant in the open category even in sought-after MD/MS courses. Technically, 35% seats are for open category students, so courses with three seats should ideally have one seat in open category, which was not the case,” he said. Undergraduate admissions in the state run parallel to the all-India round admissions. The first round of admissions in the state, starts after the first all-India round concludes. With the new quotas challenged, the seat matrix and admission schedule are yet to be released for the all-India rounds. The state’s Directorate of Medical Education and Research is also yet to receive the state rank list from the Directorate General of Health Services, said an official. But he added that students need not worry as the admission process will take its course and students will not be at loss. A parent, however, said that the delays add to the anxiety of students, especially in medical courses, where the seats are limited. Last year, too, admissions were pushed till December due the pandemic and in the state, it was further under disorder due to the state’s impending decision on Maratha quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aspirants-await-outcome-of-pleas-in-sc-on-med-quota/articleshow/87724818.cms||---
---||Varanasi||NEET solvers’ gang: Bid by accused to secure release foiled||Times News Network Varanasi: The attempt by one of arrested members of the NEET solvers’ gang, Osama Shahid, a native of Mau and a final year MBBS student at KGMU, to secure bail was foiled by the Varanasi police commissionerate on Monday. The commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said on the complaint of the father of one of the 16 aspirants, who were in contact of this gang, a fresh FIR was lodged with Sarnath police following which the court of the chief judicial magistrate sent Osama to 14-day judicial remand. This process was completed by the police before the formalities of his release could be completed as Osama had managed to get bail from the High Court, officials said. The fresh case against Osama and seven other members of NEET solvers’ gang was registered by the father of one of the 16 aspirants belonging to Jhansi. He alleged that his son was preparing for NEET in Kota (Rajasthan) when the gang lured the boy to arrange an impersonator for clearing the exam, the police said. “Earlier on Sunday, the Varanasi police had sent a letter to the vice-chancellor of KGMU, Lucknow, seeking lifetime ban on Osama,” the CP said, adding that the letter had details as to how Osama was involved with the gang and was instrumental in ensuring that ineligible candidates get selected. Osama was arrested on September 14 after his connections with the Patna-based inter-state solvers’ gang came to light during a police investigation. The solvers’ gang was busted by the police with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from a NEET centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under Sarnath police station. Apart from Osama, the police had also arrested Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar, although the kingpin of gang Pravin Kumar alias PK alias Neelesh is still absconding. With the progress in investigation, the police detected that 25 aspirants were in contact with this gang. Of these, 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine skipped the exam. Police sought the help of the National Testing Agency director in the investigation. Later, NTA withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for two years from appearing in examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-bid-by-accused-to-secure-release-foiled/articleshow/87724056.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath seeks Centre’s help to boost development||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday requested the central government for more ATMs, certain policy changes to benefit MSMEs and approval for more hospitals and industrial parks for better economic development of the state. Speaking during a virtual meeting between Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and chief ministers of all the states, Yogi said the state government was working hard to achieve sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. “As part of the process, more ATMs and a better network of banks is required across the state,” he said. He also highlighted that in view of the limit of Rs 100 crore as minimum investment under the Centre’s performance-linked incentive scheme, the garment industry under the MSME sector was not able to take advantage of it. The CM requested for relief from minimum investment clause for readymade garment units in eastern UP so that they could compete against similar industries in Vietnam, Bangladesh etc. “Keeping in view the vast power consumer base in the state, we also request to be allowed capital outlay under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme. Working capital loans for discoms are also not being sanctioned as per the standards identified by the Centre because of which they are being forced to take loans at higher rates of interest,” the CM said, requesting for the Centre’s cooperation in ensuring that the rules laid by it are followed. Appealing to the Centre to provide approvals for setting up a bulk drugs park in Lalitpur district and a plastic park in Auraiya district, the CM said a central policy to promote investments in the upcoming defence corridor was also being expected. Appealing for its quick implementation, Yogi said it would help in speeding up work on the corridor in UP. On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for a construction unit where Brahmos missiles will be manufactured in the corridor’s Jhansi node.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-seeks-centres-help-to-boost-devpt/articleshow/87725700.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Battered by lockdown and cyclones, Boipara hopes business will return with reopening of campuses||KOLKATA: Reopening of campuses not only means return of students to colleges and universities. It will also give a fresh lease of life to Boipara on College Street. Booksellers and vendors are already witnessing a rise in footfall since the date of reopening was announced last month. With several competitive examinations scheduled later this year and earlier next year, book trade is expecting a good business. Shutting down of campuses also robbed the iconic Indian Coffee House, Paramount and other hangout zones in and around College Street of the business and the characteristics vibe. But they are looking forward to turning a new page. “The pandemic, along with two cyclones in the last two years, completely broke our backs. The business hit rock bottom and stock got destroyed in Amphan last year. But we are hoping for a turnaround in the next few weeks once students start returning to campuses and several examinations are notified. We are expecting to make up for our losses,” said a book trader. Boipara is a km-long stretch on College Street flanked by hundreds of stalls of second-hand books, rare academic journals, fiction, maps and everything in between, making it the world’s biggest market of second-hand books. It is also the biggest market for books in the country. Battered by the pandemic, lockdowns, two cyclones and status quo in academics, business in Boipara had hit an all-time low. “Lakhs of livelihoods are linked to this trade and reopening of campuses will revive it,” said Bimal Chandra Mondal, a book-stall owner in College Street. The iconic coffee house, where getting a place to sit is considered a matter of good luck, lost its vibe as a big portion of the student crowd went missing after the pandemic. “Coffee house is a meeting point come hang out. People from different colleges converge here after their classes. But since campuses were shut, students could not come over. During the first half, almost 40% seating space remains vacant but this will change in the next few days when college reopen,” said Tapan Kumar Pahari of the Indian Coffee Workers’Co-operative Society Limited, which runs the iconic coffee house on College Street. Paramount on Bankim Chatterjee Street, too, is a popular haunt of college students that has been eagerly waiting for the return of the student community to College Street. “The footfall has been down by almost 50%,” said an employee. College Street and it vicinity has over 15 colleges, two universities, a government hospital and several coaching institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battered-by-lockdown-and-cyclones-boipara-hopes-business-will-return-with-reopening-of-campuses/articleshow/87724061.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Naitam, now recuperating from an injury at Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, had a close shave after a bullet fired by a Maoist during the encounter at Mardintola forest near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border grazed past his skull. The commandos had killed 26 Maoists in the encounter on Saturday. The commando had tied a towel around his skull to stop bleeding and waited for around 10 hours in pain before receiving first aid. His colleague, Sarveshwar Atram, son of a teacher, sustained a grave injury on the right knee after falling for around 10 feet on a solid rock. Atram too had contributed in gunning down around 70-75 Maoists. Despite the numbing pain, Atram too had fought from 7am to 3.30pm to keep the Maoists at bay. “When the question is about life and death, the pain becomes obsolete and it fails to draw one back. If I don’t act and think about the pain, death would be inevitable,” said Atram who had applied a gel on the knee to keep going for the rest of the 9-10 hours. The C60 commandos had returned with 26 bodies of Maoists from the spot, including their central committee member Milind Teltumbde, and other senior cadres. The encounter has dealt a big blow to the rebel movement in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Naitam said he almost lost consciousness after the bullet grazed past my skull. “Blood was oozing from the right side. I informed my buddy who was engaged in firing. My colleagues had anti-clotting kit but they were not in a position to abandon firing to reach me. It was a critical period. I could not crib about my injury but ensured there was no blood loss,” said Naitam who has fought several gunbattles with the Maoists and returned victorious on most occasions. “I have lost some of my best friends in different encounters but never felt demoralized as I am servicing the motherland,” he said extolling the efforts of Addl SP, Operations, Somay Munde who was leading the operation from the front. The commando said the jawans were spread out in smaller groups in different sections and were not aware what was happening with others. “Every group was focussing on specific tasks,” he said adding the operation had started on Friday night. The jawans walked all through the forest to reach the location where there was an input of Maoist presence, said Naitam, adding there was no idea about Milind’s (Teltumbde) presence. “We just knew some big cadres,” he said. Apart from Naitam and Atram, some of their colleagues who too are recuperating from injuries included Maharu Kudmethe and Tikaram Katenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ab-tak-pachattar-says-injured-c60-commando-involved-in-many-encounters/articleshow/87724798.cms||Soumittra S Bose

If necessary, the department will operate a separate window for issuing CF to school vehicles. The state government had extended the validity of CF till September 30 from March 2020. This left a large number of vehicles without a valid CF. “Since many of the vehicles were parked idle for long, they may develop technical snags all of a sudden,” said a technical officer of Kolkata PVD. “With several buses set to rejoin some popular routes to cater to the morning-hour rush, we want everyone to ensure that safety is not compromised,” said an officer from the special raid section of traffic police, adding that random checks will be carried out on vehicles carrying students. DC traffic Arijit Sinha further pointed out that the CF was mandatory to ensure that the vehicle was road-worthy, it had been serviced and that brakes, tyres, lights and wipers were in running order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/surprise-checks-for-cars-ferrying-kids/articleshow/87724084.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||BJP skipped as TRS & MIM numbers stacked against it||HYDERABAD: The BJP skipped the GHMC standing committee election because it does not have the majority of votes. According to party insiders, the 47 votes they currently have would not be enough to secure even a single slot in the GHMC’s apex council because of the rules of the contest. Explaining the reasons, a leader said, “With TRS and AIMIM having a deal, we cannot manage to obtain the majority votes as rules that came into effect in 2010 as part of the GHMC Act. The regulations state that all 150 members vote for 15 standing committee members, with the latter being chosen based on the number of votes they receive, there is no sense in contesting it.” In fact, the BJP has filed a writ suit in the high court challenging two norms. According to the new rules, there should be one person on the committee for every ten wards, and standing committee members can run from any ward and receive votes from all members. “This is not representative voting. The contending member should be from that set of ten wards and only those ward members should vote for them, and those who voted may truly demand their right and budget in the council,” the BJP leader said. Any number of members may run for a seat in the council, but when voting occurs, only 15 members should be counted. If a member votes for more than 15 people, his or her vote is ruled invalid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-skipped-as-trs-mimnumbers-stacked-against-it/articleshow/87724839.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

On Monday, AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch an extensive drive to remove all non-vegetarian larris from public roads. “There are as many as 6,000 food cart operators in Ahmedabad who sell non-vegetarian food.

Maheria said most egg and meat food cart operators are from other states. “They are mainly poor Hindu migrants from like UP, Bihar and Odisha whose families survive on the income generated here.

Though farm fires were high at 3,125, the share of stubble burning to PM2.5 reduced to 10 per cent as winds slowed down. However, the contribution of farm fires is predicted to rise on Tuesday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said visibility due to smog reduced on Tuesday compared with Monday. “The visibility at Palam was between 1,000-1,500 metres. At Safdarjung, it was 800-1,200 metres,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “Like Sunday, winds were mostly light or calm on Monday at Safdarjung over the past 24 hours. At Palam, light winds at the speed of 5-7kmph were recorded between 11.30am and 3pm. However, relative humidity increased by 10-15 per cent on Monday evening,” added Jenamani. The minimum temperature was 10.3 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, and the maximum 26.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. Air quality is predicted to remain in the “very poor” category for the next three days. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said, “AQI is in the very poor category and is unlikely to improve on Tuesday as winds at transport level are increasing. This will bring in more farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi.” “However, winds are forecast to blow from the east and slow down, which will improve air quality on November 17. Surface winds will slow down further on November 17 and 18, which is likely to reduce dispersion of pollutants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-gasps-as-aqi-remains-very-poor/articleshow/87724851.cms||---

The state government has no objection whatsoever in this matter. But civic bodies can remove larris if they are an obstruction to traffic. And the food sold should be hygienic,” said Patel.

The trouble began after the section which was in Sardar Mahal was shifted to Phoolbagh. Now, locals say that they are being made to run between the two places to get a simple job done, be it for the certificate or corrections. “I submitted an application for rectification in my daughter’s birth certificate. It’s two weeks and I am still doing the rounds of Phoolbagh and Sardar Mahal everyday,” an upset Mairaj told TOI. The residents said that the matter was brought to the notice of local leaders but they reportedly turned a blind eye towards the issue. Taking strong exception against the shifting, Telangana Telugu Desam Party( TTDP) urged the GHMC mayor and commissioner to bring all matters in Circle-9 under one roof for the convenience of applicants from Charminar. “The people have to suffer a lot for birth & death certificates. Applicants are being told to submit documents at Phoolbagh area and pay challans at Sardar Mahal. It should all be at one place for people living in and around Charminar,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, TTDP (GHMC, minority vice-president).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-locals-fume-as-pain-marks-birth-death-certs-process/articleshow/87724857.cms||Omar bin Taher

This is one of the largest seizures of marijuana by the NCB. On October 18, Washim police’s local crime branch (LCB) had intercepted a truck that had entered the district from Hingoli. That truck was found carrying marijuana weighing around 1,150 kg concealed in poultry feed. The seized material was estimated to be worth around Rs 3.45 crore. Following the seizure an offence was registered at the Risod police station. In the latest case, the seized marijuana has a valuation of over Rs 3.30 crore. An offence in this regard has been registered at NCB, Mumbai. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede told TOI, “Our team has seized a truck carrying 1,127 kg of marijuana at Manjram of Naigaon tehsil in Nanded district.” He said the 12-wheeler truck was carrying the contraband concealed in 100 iron bars. “Preliminary probe has revealed that the seized material was coming from Andhra Pradesh and investigation is underway to ascertain its destination,” Wankhede said. The NCB team has arrested two accused — Gokul Rajput, the owner of the truck who was driving the vehicle when it was intercepted, and his help Sunil Mahajan. “Based on specific information, a team of NCB seized a total of 1,127 kg of marijuana at Manjram on November 15, and arrested two people. This consignment, being carried in a 12 wheeler truck, was to be delivered at Jalgaon and later distributed to other parts of Maharashtra,” read a press release by NCB. A senior NCB official said, “The suspects have claimed that they were tasked with delivering the large quantity of marijuana at Jalgaon which is used as a base to land the banned item before it is dispatched in smaller quantities to cities like Pune, Mumbai and Thane.” Authorities said a transit remand for the accused was acquired for taking them to Mumbai where they will be produced before special NCB court on Tuesday for seeking their custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ncb-seizes-truck-carrying-over-1000kg-of-marijuana-in-nanded/articleshow/87722579.cms||Mohammed Akhef

On Monday, AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch an extensive drive to remove all carts selling non-vegetarian food from public roads. The AMC decision comes in the wake of Rajkot and Vadodara mayors announcing similar decisions a few days ago. “All non-vegetarian food carts will be removed from all public roads, those operating near schools and colleges, religious places, marriage halls and community halls starting from November 16 Tuesday,” Devang Dani, the chairman of AMC’s town planning and estate management committee. When asked how many illegal or legal, non-vegetarian or vegetarian food carts are operating on the roads he did not have any answer. “We will conduct a survey,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dani-clueless-about-number-of-food-carts-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/87724884.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Is Gujarat govt ready to launch RTI portal, asks high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday questioned the state government on whether it is ready to launch a portal through which citizens can file applications seeking information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and asserted that the government can work out modalities later. The bench headed by Chief Justice Aravind Kumar asked the government to reply to its question on Wednesday. The court’s query came in response to two PILs filed three years ago, demanding online processing of RTI applications and to create a payment gateway for those who seek information online. Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Saurabh Soparkar submitted that the petitioner wants RTI applications to be processed online through a portal. The Centre and other states have already started accepting RTI applications through portals. He questioned why a developed state like Gujarat cannot do it. He termed the affidavit filed by the state government irrelevant and submitted that the government has taken three years on pretext of awarding contract to companies for the purpose of creating systems on how to track files with regard to RTI applications. “I want RTI application to be filed online and a payment gateway to pay fees, nothing more and nothing less. I do not desire to track the files in government department,” he submitted. The state government submitted that the process of finalizing the system is underway. To this, the chief justice said whether the concerned government secretary can state on an affidavit that he would receive all RTI applications online. “We want a three-line answer whether you are ready to process RTI applications online or not? We do not want all details. The moment you enter in all those details, it will be surrounded by mystery,” the judge sought reply after two days. After the senior advocate submitted that there are government agencies who want to set up payment gateway for free , another petitioner-advocate Sandeep Munjyasara drew the court’s attention on how the state government has taken three years to make a clear statement on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/is-state-govt-ready-to-launch-rti-portal-asks-high-court/articleshow/87724889.cms||---

A senior police officer said that a case was registered against the constables at Model Town police station for forging driving licences to get the job in Delhi Police by “deceitful means”. The dismissal order stated that the 12 constables are unfit for service. According to the police, more than 81 candidates had applied for the job in 2007 and several tests were conducted before the selected individuals received their appointment letter. An order issued by Delhi Police, signed by DCP Pankaj Kumar (operations and PCR), stated: “It has clearly been proven that the delinquent constables (drivers) deliberately and knowingly submitted a forged/fake driving licence by adopting deceitful means to seek recruitment. They all gave their residential address of Mathura in their licence, there’s no record of their residence in Mathura. It shows that the constables procured licences by adopting forged mean.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-papers-12-pcr-constables-dismissed-after-13-yrs-of-service/articleshow/87724931.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP govt slams AAP over pollution spike in Delhi||LUCKNOW: With Delhi government closing down schools and imposing other restrictions in the national capital after air quality plummeted to extremely dangerous levels, UP government on Monday questioned an alleged expenditure of Rs 940 crore on publicity over the past seven years, saying that during the same period it did nothing to protect the city’s environment. UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the Delhi government spent hardly anything on pollution control even as reports of highly toxic air and extremely poor quality of water in the Yamuna river were coming in. “This is the realty of the Kejriwal government. It is high on rhetoric but dismally low on action. The pollution in the Yamuna even during the Chhatth festival, coupled with poor air quality, is testimony to the total failure of the Delhi CM on pollution control. While he has failed to perform in Delhi, he is trying to give suggestions to other states,” the minister said. Demanding “urgent remedial measures” to bring pollution in Delhi under control, Singh said Kejriwal owed an explanation to the people of UP on why he was against them. “In the name of controlling pollution, he stopped construction work in Delhi and this is directly impacting workers. During the Covid-19 crisis last year, they cheated labourers from UP by turning them away and now once again he is snatching away their bread and butter,” the minister alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-slams-aap-over-pollution-spike-in-delhi/articleshow/87725719.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Lucknow||UP: Chief Secretary sends missive, asks officials to pick calls of MPs, MLAs||LUCKNOW: The UP government’s repeated directives to officials asking them to always pick up phone calls of public representatives, including MPs and MLAs, as per necessary protocol, have once again turned out to be a case of ‘talking to a brick wall’. The fact came to light recently when the Chief Secretary R K Tewari sent a stern missive to all additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries of various departments and the director general of police. The communique, dated November 11, also marked to all divisional commissioners and DMs, categorically mentions that officials in some districts neither pick the calls of public representatives vis-à-vis public welfare related works nor do they call back. The development comes barely two months after a parliamentary monitoring committee headed by UP assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit pressed for strict compliance of protocols due towards the public representatives as per the orders issued by the state government. Officials said the committee got several complaints about officials not following the parliamentary protocols besides being callous in responding to correspondence from the elected representatives. The chief secretary’s communique further points out that in case of being unavailable at the time of call, officials will call back’ soon after coming to know about the lawmaker’s phone call. All the officials in the districts should ‘save’ the phone numbers of the respective MPs/MLAs in their phones and in office records. The timing of the missive is being seen as the earnestness of the BJP to ensure public welfare work and development projects are not affected ahead of the UP assembly elections due in the next few months. CM has himself many times asked officials to take suggestions and feedback from MPs/MLAs while implementing various welfare schemes. During a recent region-wise meeting of BJP, party MLAs told the CM that officials are ‘unresponsive’ and do not pay heed to their suggestions. The government had sent out a similar communique on March 23 stating that officials are ‘making excuse’ of not having phone numbers of public representatives 'saved’ in their phones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cs-sends-missive-asks-officials-to-pick-calls-of-mps-mlas/articleshow/87725726.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Ahmedabad||Cops file chargesheet in 8 days||Ahmedabad: Gandhinagar police have filed a charge sheet against a 26-year-old man, accused of raping three minor girls and killing one of them, before a special POCSO (protection of children against sexual offences) act court in the capital in a record time of just eight days. This is a rare precedent set in the country, where an accused has been charge-sheeted around a week. Earlier, an accused of a rape case was charge-sheeted by Surat police in 11 days. Senior police officers of the local crime branch (LCB), investigating the case, confirmed the development and said, “We have filed a 500-page charge sheet against the accused Vijay Thakor, resident of Vansjada village in Kalol taluka of Gandhnagar, after taking testimonies of 62 witnesses of the rapes and murder cases.” The officer said that Thakors’ involvement has also surfaced in four other cases of loot and attempt to murder on four other women which he had committed in a time span of around five months. “He used to talk with women who were moving alone and or struck conversations in the guise of helping them in their work or asking about some address. Then he used to attack them with a stick. He did this to four women and two of the four have gone paralytic after the attacks,” said an officer. Thakor – a labourer with a private firm in Santej – is married and has a six-year-old daughter, said police. “After his wife became pregnant a second time, he hunted for minor girls as he believed they would be unable to narrate his sexual predation to anyone, leaving him safe,” police said. Police received the first complaint on November 4. A woman labourer living near Rancharda village approached Santej police, alleging that an unidentified man had abducted her five-year-old daughter and left her at a secluded place. “The girl’s medical check-up confirmed that she had been raped,” said a police officer. Two days later, Santej police received a similar complaint from a casual labourer, who hails from Dahod. He told police that his three-year-old daughter had been kidnapped on the night of November 5 from their makeshift shanty near Khatraj crossroads. Thakor entered the hut when everyone was asleep and abducted the child. Thakor killed the three-year-old because she had been screaming loudly crying for help. He then raped her body and dumped it in a culvert near Moti Bhoyan village in Gandhinagar. The body has been recovered by the police on November 7- the day when Thakor was caught from his home in Vansjada. After being caught, Thakor confessed to have raped another seven-year-old girl in the last week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-file-chargesheet-in-8-days/articleshow/87724899.cms||---

---||Delhi||Ready for lockdown, but neighbours must do same for better results: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: As people continue to gasp for breath in the city, Delhi government informed the Supreme Court of its readiness to impose a lockdown to curb pollution but suggested a complete lockdown in Delhi-NCR to fight the air crisis. The court had recently asked the Centre and Delhi government to consider a lockdown of two days to check the generation of local pollutants given the extreme deterioration in the air quality. TimesViewLockdowns heap untold misery on the city’s poorest, already reeling from months of suffering due to Covid, which had reduced job opportunities and incomes. They should only be contemplated as a last resortThe state government argued that a complete lockdown in Delhi to curb local pollution would be meaningful only if it is replicated across the National Capital Region. “Given Delhi's compact size, a lockdown would have limited impact on the air quality,” Delhi government said in its affidavit. “This issue would need to be addressed at the level of airshed involving NCR areas. In view of the above, we are ready to consider this step if the same is mandated for the entire NCR areas by the government of India or by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region.” Track the pollution level in your cityIn the affidavit filed by an environment department official, the state government explained the remedial measures it had already taken to fight air pollution, including banning construction activities apart from closing educational institutions and directing all government officials to work from home for a week. Private offices have also been advised to switch to work from home mode to keep vehicles off the streets in an effort to reduce vehicular emissions. Delhi government explained that over the past several years, it has been observed that the AQI does not reach the 'severe' level between February and September. “November 2021 saw seven severe days in the first 13 days of the month and corresponded with an increased number of stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana averaging around 4300 incidents per day.” The court was informed about the measures being taken to counter air pollution. The government installed a smog tower at Connaught Place, while a pollution source apportionment study was carried out to gather targeted information on the local sources of pollution in Delhi for evolving pollution control and mitigation strategies. The government has identified 13 pollution hotspots and action is being taken on specific mitigation measures such as removal of plastic waste and garbage. The government has also implemented the directions and advisories of the Commission for Air Quality Management regarding road dust management, abatement of air pollution from dispersed sources, safeguarding and enforcement and greening and traffic management. The government has developed a comprehensive action plan to eliminate the paddy crop residue and stubble burning in Delhi, created a web portal to deal with construction and demolition waste, while road-owning agencies have set up dust control and management cells. Action is also being taken against petrol and diesel vehicles older, respectively, than 15 years and 10 years. At the same time, electric vehicles and private charging stations are being promoted in the city. A tender has been floated for the installation of 100 charging stations across Delhi. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday with an AQI of 349 at 3pm. The effective fire count by the Union earth sciences’ forecasting body, SAFAR, showed a high figure of 3,125, but the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 10% with the winds too slow to transport the farm fire emissions. The air quality is likely to remain ‘very poor’ for the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-for-lockdown-but-neighbours-must-do-same-for-better-results-govt/articleshow/87724879.cms||AlokKNMishra

With no relief granted by special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court, NCB will now approach the court in Pune.

NCB said that he is in Yerwada jail and they wanted to record his statement as a chargesheet has to be filed. “Since Gosavi, whose statement applicant agency (NCB) intends to record is not in judicial custody of this court but in judicial custody of JMFC court, Pune, it is for the agency to approach court concerned for relief.

---||Hyderabad||Including tobacco products under food illegal: Traders||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday reserved its judgment in a batch of petitions filed by traders of gutkha, khaini and other tobacco products, challenging the ban imposed by the state on their production, transport, storage and sale. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajsheker Reddy heard senior counsel Vivek Kohli and a few other advocates and reserved its judgment. Kohli in his argument said that the Centre had equipped itself with the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution) Act, 2003, known as COTPA law. “This law has not been repealed and is still in force. In the meantime, the Centre has brought Food Safety and Standards Act and has delegated the powers to states to deal with food safety issues,” he said. “But, the states have erroneously included tobacco products in the list of food items though they were never part of food. It is illegal to subject tobacco products to action under two laws,” he said. They should deal with tobacco products under COTPA only, and under this law, they cannot be banned, but only their sale can be regulated, he said. “That is what they have been doing in respect of cigarettes but are applying different yardsticks in respect of gutkha and khaini,” Kohli said. Refuting the allegations against police, Telangana home department counsel T Srikanth Reddy said the Supreme Court has upheld the powers of police to book gutkha traders under IPC provisions. “Several high courts have upheld the notifications issued by the state food commissioners,” he said. Nagesh Bhimapaka, state health department counsel, argued that only those tobacco products which are chewed were considered as food and hence the action of the state in banning them was correct. “The cigarette is not chewed and hence it is allowed,” he said. The bench reserved its judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/including-tobacco-products-under-food-illegal-traders/articleshow/87724861.cms||---

He will now reach Ghazipur on Wednesday and take the expressway route to reach Azamgarh as a part of his ‘Vijay Yatra’. “I am happy that the Prime Minister will inaugurate the expressway — a project of the Samajwadi Party government,” he said, adding that the ruling BJP cannot name a single project that the government had laid the foundation of and inaugurated it as well. Citing an instance that took place during the BSP regime, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav recalled how he had planned to cycle his way from Noida on the then newly constructed expressway but the government stopped him. “We carried the bicycles on our shoulders and crossed the new expressway and inaugurated the project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-open-purvanchal-eway-symbolically-akhilesh/articleshow/87725733.cms||---

This is after the admission committee carried out three rounds of admissions so far this year for a total of 14,700 seats, said sources close to the development. “The number of vacant seats at GU collages are expected to increase to 7,000 after admissions for medical, paramedical and pharmacy colleges are held in the state,” said sources. After three rounds of admission, GU has given the task of filling the vacant BSc seats to the colleges. “These colleges will have to come out with a merit list and the admissions are to be endorsed by the university. This is going to be quite a task given the large number of vacant seats,” according to sources. The response from students for admission in GU science colleges has been quite dull this year. So many seats are vacant in a year when the Class 12 candidates have got the benefit of mass promotion points out to the lack of interest among students for these courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gu-likely-to-have-7000-vacant-bsc-seats/articleshow/87724909.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Farmer’s dead body found hanging from tree, kin suspect murder||Kanpur: Panic prevailed in Dalelpur village, under the limits of Bidhnoo police station of the district, after a body of a 35-year-old farmer, who had gone to irrigate the crop on late Sunday evening, was found hanging from a `Babul’ tree on Monday morning. As soon as the news of the death of the farmer spread, locals thronged the spot and alerted the family members, besides the police. Family members, however, raised doubts after coming across a blood-stained shirt, besides injury marks on the body and a shawl lying at a distance of nearly 50-meters from the spot. At the same time, the family members claimed that the miscreants had hanged the body of the victim after killing him. The police immediately called the forensic team and got the evidence collected and said that the reason would be clear only after the autopsy report. The victim, identified as Naresh Kumar (35), a resident of Dalelpur village of Bidhnoo police station area, had gone to the fields on the banks of the canal on Sunday evening to irrigate the crop. His wife, Mithlesh said that she had last spoken to her husband at around 10 pm on Sunday, wherein he had told her that he will return home after irrigating the land by next morning. The incident came to light on Monday morning after the villagers, who had gone towards the canal in the morning, came across the dead body of Naresh hanging from a `Babul’ tree, follwoing which they raised alarm. On being informed, wife Mithlesh, daughter Deepika, Ragni and son Raju rushed to the spot. The victim’s wife alleged that the shirt from which the dead body was found hanging does not belong to her husband. The injury marks have been found near the left eye. The family members claimed that the miscreants, after murdering the victim, had hanged his body to give it a colour of suicide. A blood-stained shirt and Naresh’s shawl were found at some distance from the spot. His slippers were found lying under the tree. On the arrival of the police, the family members staged a protest and demanded to call in a forensic team and a dog squad. After some time, the forensic team reached the spot and collected evidence by taking possession of a blood-stained shirt, shawl and slippers. When the dog squad did not come, the relatives again refused to hand over the dead body to cops for postmortem. CO Ghatampur Sushil Kumar Dwivedi tried to convince the family members and after nearly five hours, subsequently, a dog squad was requisitioned. Police station in-charge Atul Kumar Singh said that the matter is being investigated. The situation will be clear only after the post-mortem report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/farmers-dead-body-found-hanging-from-tree-kin-suspect-murder/articleshow/87724100.cms||---

---||Delhi||200 trees de-concretised in south Delhi, HC told||NEW DELHI: The south corporation on Monday informed Delhi high court that it has deconcretised 1,200 trees in an area and has launched a special drive to ensure all such trees are freed. In an affidavit filed before Justice Najmi Waziri, the corporation said it had identified 1,736 trees in Vasant Vihar that require removal of concrete. “In 70 trees, nails and wires strung around have been removed and in 24 trees, anti-termite medicine has been sprayed,” the civic body stated. The south corporation also assured the high court that the drive to deconcretise trees in the area will continue. Meanwhile, the forest department has told the high court that its tree officer will carry out a joint survey in Vasant Vihar to identify any concretised trees and inform PWD and SDMC to take steps. The court had recently taken note of what it dubbed “victimisation of trees” and demanded an explanation from the civic body and Delhi government on why hundreds of trees have been concretised. It acted on a plea by activist Bhavreen Kandahari seeking preservation of trees. The court was shocked by some of the photographs shown by the petitioner’s advocate, Aditya Prasad, and noted that “right up to the tree trunk, nails have been embedded and metallic wires have been strung along the trees.” The court had earlier noted that “concretisation of the street is unmindful of the directions of this court and that of the NGT, it shows disregard of the law not only by the municipal corporation but also by the road maintaining agency – the public works department” and directed them to file an affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/200-trees-de-concretised-in-south-delhi-hc-told/articleshow/87724915.cms||Abhinav Garg

On November 6 (Bhai Dooj), the state had recorded 661 cases; on the Monday after it, 751 cases. It clearly seems to a Monday effect: with fewer tests conducted over the weekend, the tally is lower on Mondays (when the results are available) than on other weekdays. In Mumbai, less than 200 cases were registered as 23,723 tests were carried out against the usual 35,000-plus. Four deaths were registered. With only 258 critical cases in the city, a civic doctor said it’s clearly a lull between Covid waves. Only 7% of the 17,501 Covid beds in the city are occupied. “It is nearly 10 days since Diwali and the state has not reported any significant spike in Covid cases. We are now ensuring that people who are still unvaccinated take their dose as early as possible,” said an official. CM Uddhav Thackeray’s officer on special duty, Sudhir Naik, tested positive on Monday and was admitted to a private hospital as a precaution.

---||Goa||Since 2017, Goa assembly sat for average 16 days in a year: ADR||PANAJI: In the past five years, Goa’s 40 elected lawmakers worked for an average of just 16 days a year. A detailed performance report by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) highlights the plummeting graph of the Goa legislative assembly since 2017, with the House often meeting for a single day to meet Constitutional obligations. The report also shows that of the 40 MLAs, just 11 participated in the business of the house every single day out of the 80 days that the House functioned. Ministers are not required to mark their attendance. Congress MLAs Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Digambar Kamat asked the most questions. Most of the questions revolved around water supply, panchayats and rural development, and education. “Many want to know whether this track record of 16 days is good or bad,” said ADR representative Bhasker Assoldekar. “I would suggest, compare it with the 312 days the 16th Lok Sabha sat in five years from 2014, which is almost 62 days in a year against the Goa assembly’s 16. (This was) perhaps partly due to Covid-19.” The report shows that the duration of the state legislative assembly has been on a decline since 2017, with the number of sittings declining from 24 days in 2017 to eight days in 2021. The number of bills passed by the lawmakers also saw a corresponding decline from 28 in 2017 to 12 in 2021. The longest session was from July 15 to August 9, 2019. The House met for just a single day on four different occasions. In 2018, well before the Covid-19 pandemic, the House was convened just twice for a total period of 16 days, indicating the BJP government’s move to skirt legislative debates in the state assembly. The Constitution does not stipulate the number of days that a legislative assembly should meet, but does state that not more than six months should pass between sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/since-2017-goa-assembly-sat-for-avg-16-days-in-a-yr-adr/articleshow/87725737.cms||---

According to police, Jebaliya and Dhandhal families had a long-standing rift over a money dispute. On Monday morning three men identified as Munna Dhandhal, Uday Dhandhal and Raghu Dhandhal arrived at Nagarka village in a car and opened fire at Shardul Jebaliya killing him on the spot. In retaliation, the three were attacked by the Jebaliya family. They too suffered serious injuries and are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Botad. Additional cops have been deployed at the hospital to prevent further untoward incidents. While cops said that the accused fired only a round at Jebaliya, which hit him in the chest, sources claimed many rounds were fired indiscriminately. Cops have sought help from forensic experts to ascertain how many rounds were fired. Meanwhile, based on a complaint filed by the deceased’s father, Bhoja Jebaliya, police have booked the trio for murder and also under the Arms Act. Another offence was also registered by police for the attack carried out on the three accused. Following the incident, senior police officials including deputy superintendent of police Chetan Mundhwa reached the village. “There was a past rift due to which the clash broke out on Monday morning.

---||Lucknow||‘Indian Road Congress norms overlooked’||Lucknow: Accusing the BJP of having compromised with the quality of construction involving Purvanchal Expressway project, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was aware that specifications of the Indian Road Congress -- apex body of highway engineers in the country – have been thrown to the wind to reduce the project cost. The former UP CM said that the material used in the expressway and scant regard to specifications of the road congress will not only take its toll on the quality of the construction, but also make journey by road more cumbersome for commuters. He said as per the Indian Road Congress the expressway should have a 12-metre divider, but the median has been compromised to reduce cost. “These specifications of the Indian Road Congress came after the Lucknow-Agra expressway was completed and should be adhered to by all new expressways constructed thereafter but have been overlooked in Purvanchal Expressway,” he said. “It is not only about the median. Government advertisements claim that geo cells have been put in place to hold the soil from being washed away by water during rains. In layman’s language these geo-cells are known as plastic sheets. Government claims bitumen used in the process will contain rubber for improved quality and performance. But the recent rains saw sections of the expressway being washed away,” Akhilesh said. “Were geo cells missing from the part of the expressway that were washed away in the rains? If mixing rubber in bitumen has improved the quality of the expressway then why has the riding quality come down,” he questioned. He said the riding quality of Purvanchal expressway is such that it will leave commuters with stomach ache and backaches. “Desh ke Pradhan Mantri ji aa rahe hain ... unki jankari mein ye cheezen hain kin nahi (Country’s Prime Minister is coming to inaugurate the project. Is he aware of these issues).” the former UP CM said. The SP chief went on to question the basis on which some top construction companies were dropped from the project by the ruling BJP. “Will the PM ask the UP CM why country’s topline companies were dropped from the project. Not that I am rooting for these industrial houses, but these very companies are associated with the construction of Ram Temple, statue of Sardar Patel and some most important projects of the country. Why were they dropped from the project,” Akhilesh questioned talking to the media at party headquarters. The 341-km-long Purvanchal Expressway, a section of which is slated to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will connect UP’s nine districts, including Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur. Samajwadi Party on Monday accused the district administration in Ghazipur of not only stopping the party from proceeding with their Vijay Yatra to Azamgarh using the Purvanchal expressway, but also claimed that authorities have placed boulders at all entry points of the expressway. He said if permission was not granted to him to use the expressway, he would inaugurate it symbolically by offering flowers as the project is originally that of the SP government. Though initially the SP chief was slated to take expressway route from Ghazipur to reach Azamgarh on Tuesday, looking at the response of the district authorities he postponed his event by a day. He will now reach Ghazipur on Wednesday and take the expressway route to reach Azamgarh as a part of his ‘Vijay Yatra’. “I am happy that the Prime Minister will inaugurate the expressway — a project of the Samajwadi Party government,” he said, adding that the ruling BJP cannot name a single project that the government had laid the foundation of and inaugurated it as well. Citing an instance that took place during the Bahujan Samaj Party regime, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav recalled how he had planned to cycle his way from Noida on the then newly constructed expressway but the government stopped him. “We carried the bicycles on our shoulders and crossed the new expressway and inaugurated the project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/indian-road-congress-norms-overlooked/articleshow/87725741.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Speaking after inaugurating the office of a BJP office-bearer in Aurangabad, Danve said, “During the time of the Congress government, petrol prices were linked to the international market. It is not the Union government that does the work of increasing petrol prices... These rates are decided in America, and, therefore, it is wrong to blame us.” The senior BJP leader said that even now, the Union government has reduced its taxes but, “the state governments led by Congress and other parties are not ready to reduce their share of taxes. We should tell this to the citizens.” Danve made the statements while inaugurating the office of BJP office-bearer Raju Shinde in Aurangabad late on Sunday. He was accompanied by BJP leaders from in and around Aurangabad. Danve said that currently, the country is being run on the money from the Union government. “None of the three parties in the state government sit together or take decisions. If we tell this to the people, I am sure that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders will struggle to save their faces in the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” Danve said. The statement has been criticised by people’s representatives from MVA, with some of them recalling the BJP leadership’s statements on price hike while it was in the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wrong-to-blame-union-govt-for-fuel-price-rise-says-danve/articleshow/87722606.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Ahmedabad||Change in Afghan regime: Pakistani drug lords clear stocks||AHMEDABAD: The big shots in the drug cartels have gathered in UAE and decided to sell drugs in large scale as soon as the Taliban took over power in Afghanistan — the biggest producer of opium in the world. The Times of India on September 22 had published the news on how the drug mafia are desperate to pump in prodigious quantities of heroin into India through the Gujarat coast. ATS officers said that the sender of the 120kg heroin consignment – Zahid Bashir Baloch had met the accused Mukhtar Hussein alias Jabbar Jodia, and Hussein’s brother Isa Rav was in constant touch with Baloch for around three years. Before the drug was delivered near the international maritime border to Hussein and his aides in the territorial water of Pakistan on October 23, Hussein had a meeting with Baloch who told him to sell the consignment at the earliest. There was a desperation showed by Baloch as he also knew that the Taliban government might not further allow opium or any drug trade on its land in Afghanistan. Apart from the Gujarat ATS, officers of other agencies believe that concentrated efforts are being made to push heroin produced in Afghanistan into India. The officers said that the drug lords not only fear confiscation of the narcotics stock by the Taliban but apart from staggering financial losses, they also face the prospect of summary execution if caught in the narcotics trade. These factors are fuelling the drug stock clearance runs to India conducted by apparently desperate Pakistani drug lords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-in-afghan-regime-pak-drug-lords-clear-stocks/articleshow/87724998.cms||---

Forest officials suspect that the tiger is likely to have been poached in Gadchiroli. Sources said the officials received a tip-off about two people in Gadchiroli having a tiger skin in their possession.

---||Chandigarh||Farm leaders’ misguidance behind fire in fields: J P Dalal||CHANDIGARH: Haryana has made a provision of around Rs 200 crore this year to curb the stubble burning in the state. State agriculture and farmers welfare minister J P Dalal also claimed that stubble burning in Haryana was not the reason behind poor air quality in Delhi but use of firecrackers during Diwali and the wind direction were responsible for causing such a high level of pollution. “Haryana has almost negligible incidents of stubble fire this year as compared to previous years but because of defiance in districts due to pressure and misguidance by farmers’ leaders like Gurnam Singh Charuni, the incidents of fire have been reported,” he alleged. Farmers were being misguided by some “self-styled farmer leaders” only to create a situation of confrontation with the government and perhaps that was the reason why a number of stubble fires in two-three districts was high this time, he added. Incentives to curb stubble burningFrom 2018 to 2021, the state government has provided around 32,489 machines to individuals and 21,236 machines for around 4,200 custom hiring centres (CHC) on subsidised rates for mitigation of stubble burning, Dalal said. According to the minister, around 19,000 machines have been provided this season, of which 9,000 have been given to individual farmers and around 10,000 to the custom hiring centres on subsidised rates. A total of Rs 174 crore subsidies have been given in this season only to control stubble burning incidents, he added. Around 96,000 acres have been diversified for other crops from paddy this year through a special scheme for which Rs 7,000 per acre incentive has been given, he pointed out. On long term measuresA large number of projects have been initiated, including setting up of 4-30 megawatt (MW) paddy straw-based biomass power plants, in which one lakh metric tonne paddy straw is needed. The number of plants would be increased, which would use 14 lakh MT stubble would be required. This could be the permanent solution to this problem, the minister said. Doing better than Punjab Asserting that the situation in Haryana was much better than Punjab, Dalal said while 67,165 incidents had been reported in Punjab as per satellite imagery, Haryana’s figure was less than 10% of it. He said that only around 5,400 incidents of stubble fire had been reported in Haryana till date. Delhi pollution not due to farm burning The minister claimed that stubble fire in Haryana may have miniscule impact but there are several other factors contributing to this. He added that it happened every year after Diwali and firecrackers used during the festive season is the main reason. According to Dalal, direction of wind was also sometimes the reason behind such poor quality in NCR. No dearth of fertiliser in the stateTalking about the dearth of fertiliser in the state, the agriculture minister claimed that there was no actual shortage and till last week, the supply of fertiliser had already crossed the stock received by the state till November 30 last year. “We are regularly in touch with the Centre, and in the past three days, eight racks of DAP have been received and nine more racks are expected in the next three days. The Centre is providing 7,000 to 8,000 metric tonnes of DAP and NPK fertilisers every day,” he added. According to the minister, around 2.10 lakh metric tonnes of DAP has been made available in the state, of which 1.82 lakh metric tonnes has been purchased by farmers. Around 3.84 lakh metric tonnes of urea, 93,000 metric tonnes of SSP and 37,000 metric tonnes of NPK are available in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-leaders-misguidance-behind-fire-in-fields-dalal/articleshow/87724956.cms||Ajay Sura

The state transport utility employees are protesting to get the MSRTC merged with the state government. However, with around a week gone, none of the factions are ready to back down. Also, every year additional MSRTC buses used to ply to Pandharpur on the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi. This time around, as the buses are not plying due to strike, the MSRTC workers conducted Vitthal puja on Monday on the premises of the bus stand. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers’ association in Kolhapur, said, “Our demand is crystal clear and there is no backing off now till it gets approved. Today (on Monday), on the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi, we performed Bhajan-Kirtan on the bus stand premises and prayed for better sense to prevail with the state government to approve our demands as early as possible.” Meanwhile, passengers continued to have a hard time as they are relying on private and goods transport vehicles. Samadhan Shinde, a passenger who hitched a ride on a milk truck, said, “My village is in the remote areas of Shahuwadi tehsil and every day the ST bus used to ply to our village twice. Now, as the buses are not plying, villagers are struggling to travel from one point to another. I had to request a milk transport truck to drop me till Kolhapur bus stand. The fares of the private buses are too high and unaffordable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/msrtc-staff-strike-enters-second-week-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87722612.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

District magistrate Vishakh G Aiyer, after receiving the complaint, has constituted a two-member committee to probe the alleged irregularities in the construction. CDO Mahendra Kumar and SDM Sadar Anurag Jain are members of the committee. The two officials inspected the newly-constructed pavilion on Sunday. The biggest problem of the new players pavilion is that its sewer system had not been connected with the main line besides seepage at points and out of order transformers. The committee had sought a copy of the work order and invoice from the executive engineer of Avas and Vikas which was the construction agency. The committee had asked the PWD engineers to check the quality of construction of the building on the basis of its site plan and DPR on this basis of which the committee will submit its report to the DM Kanpur Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/two-member-panel-to-probe-irregularities-in-construction-of-pavilion-in-green-park-stadium/articleshow/87724144.cms||अनंत नारायण

Sanjiv Inamdar was the manager of Ambawadi branch of PNB when the alleged scam occured. With him, two persons — Mayank Shah and Rikin Shah of Jainal Enterprise — were also sentenced to undergo imprisonment. Inamdar was fined Rs 7.5 lakh while Mayank and Rikin were asked to pay fine of Rs 7 lakh each. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act in December 2004 against the accused. It was alleged that the then chief manager of PNB had sanctioned cash credit (hypothecation) facility of Rs 40 lakh to Mayank Shah, proprietor of city-based firm in conspiracy with other accused on the basis of forged documents, without carrying out physical verification of the immovable property. This allegedly caused loss of Rs 40 lakh to the bank. After investigation, a chargesheet was filed in October 2006 against seven accused. During the trial, two accused passed away and the case against them stood abated. The court acquitted two persons and held the then bank manager guilty of corruption alongwith two others of forgery and cheating. Special judge V R Raval handed ordered down the punishment and imposed a fine of various amounts for conviction under different offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pnb-manager-two-others-get-five-yr-jail-term-for-loan-scam/articleshow/87724995.cms||---

Following an incident on November 1, when she was abused by her mother-in-law, she’d left for her parents’ house and from there lodged the complaint under IPC Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 294 (b) (uttering obscene words). The woman stated that she had wed a Bapunagar resident in 2016 and for about two months she was happy at her matrimonial home. Soon after, her in-laws began abusing and insulting her for not bringing 500g of gold but only 250g in her dowry. They threatened she will have to live and work like a servant unless she brought another 250g gold from her parents, as there were other members of the community who were ready to give 500g gold in dowry to give the hands of their daughters in marriage. They forced her to do menial work and treated her like a maidservant, the woman alleged. She said after this she had gone to her parents, but they convinced her to return and start life afresh. But things didn’t change and her in-laws kept up their abuse. Finally, on November 1, while she was working in the kitchen, her mother-in-law entered the kitchen and abused her over noises from utensils. Thereafter, she went to her parental home and filed her complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-harassed-for-250g-dowry-deficit-in-gold/articleshow/87725020.cms||---
---||Goa||Tree felling posing threat to one of Goa’s highest peaks||KERI: One of the highest peaks of the Western Ghats in Goa at 726m, Vagheri’s private forests, which come under the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, are under threat due to increased illegal tree felling activities allegedly being undertaken by some of the land owners at the behest of a Delhi-based firm that plans to set up an eco-tourism project here. The Vageri hill covers Keri, Zarme, and Pali areas of Sattari and has for ages been known as the abode of the tiger. In 1999, the Sawant committee appointed by the Goa government had identified 200ha area in Keri as private forests. Subsequently, the Karapurkar committee and V T Thomas committee had also identified private forests on the Vagheri hill. Despite this, owners of private forests here have allegedly made attempts to sell their land to a Delhi-based firm. Taking advantage of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, land owners sought permission to clear bushes and instead undertook tree felling illegally. “Last year we booked an offence against unidentified persons for illegal felling of trees. We also told the owners not to repeat the illegal felling,” Keri range forest officer Vivek Gaonkar told TOI. Deputy conservator of forests Santosh Phadte said that he has already instructed forest officials not to allow any forest clearance and to take necessary steps for the protection of the private forests at Vagheri. “Six kilometres of the pathway going to privately-owned forests passes through the sanctuary and we have instructed our staff to restrain unnecessary entry to Vagheri hill,” RFO of the sanctuary, Deepak Tandel said. If these eco-tourism plans materialise, it will cause irreparable loss to the wildlife, ecology and environment, environmentalists said. Environmentalists said that damage was first wrought to the hill’s ecology after the state forest department undertook tree felling here with a view to afforest it with exotic tree species. Later, cashew plantations taken up by local communities had posed a threat to its natural cover. However, the more recent tree felling and clearing of bushes for proposed eco-tourism activities has only served to accelerate the degradation of the hill’s natural habitat, they said. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s directives, Goa government had constituted a state-level expert committee on January 24, 1997, under the chairmanship of Sadanand Sawant to identify private forests. The Sawant committee had identified private forests contiguous to government forests having 75% forestry species and 40% canopy cover. In 1999, government-owned forests were included in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, which also had a one-kilometre eco-sensitive zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tree-felling-posing-threat-to-one-of-goas-highest-peaks/articleshow/87725774.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Lucknow||Expressways to put Uttar Pradesh on fast track of progress||By invitation: Pravin SinghLUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is the land of opportunities in terms of business, industries and human capital. The last four-and-a-half years have seen an unprecedented boost to infrastructure to bring this vast state on the driver’s seat to ensure nation’s development. The objective of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is to make Uttar Pradesh the driver of development activities. PM Narendra Modi had also said recently that “a determined approach to boost infrastructure in the state is turning UP into an ‘express state’”. The expressway projects launched since 2016 include Purvanchal Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway, Ganga Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority has been given the responsibility of completing these projects. While Purvanchal Expressway is set to be inaugurated by the PM on November 16, work on other expressways is continuing at a fast pace. GatiShakti Boost: The development of expressways in UP is set to get a boost with the GatiShakti National Master Plan for infrastructure development. It aims to ensure integrated planning and implementation of infrastructure projects in the next four years, with focus on expediting works on the ground, saving cost and creating jobs. Purvanchal Expressway: Express development for East UP: The Purvanchal Expressway has opened new horizons for the development of eastern Uttar Pradesh which has immense possibilities with its abundant natural resources, extensive agriculture, a huge repository of human resources, a big market, and unique products in all districts. The foundation stone laying ceremony for the Purvanchal Expressway was held in Azamgarh in July 2018 by PM Narendra Modi. This greenfield expressway has its starting point at Chand Sarai village, located near the existing Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH- 731) in Lucknow. Its end point is near village Haidaria on NH-31 in Ghazipur. Its total length is 340.82 km and the districts falling along the expressway include Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur. Districts near the Purvanchal Expressways have immense industrial potential. A wide range of products from Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ayodhya, Gorakhpur, Ambedkarnagar and Ballia will get access to huge market. Major gains are expected in getting a big market for ODOP (one district, one product) items from these districts. The total project financial outlay of the expressway was Rs 22,497 crore, of which, land acquisition accounted for Rs 7,380 crore. Gorakhpur Link Expressway: Boost to the east: For large parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Gorakhpur is the hub of activity in education, medical & health facilities, trading, tourism, sugar mills, border trade with Nepal, and also holds cultural and religious significance dating back to centuries. The city is named after the revered saint Gorakshanath. The Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur is the seat of the Nath sect. With the futuristic era of expressways now covering the entire state, Gorakhpur will soon be linked to Purvanchal Expressway with a Link Expressway. The Gorakhpur Link Expressway project is a 91-km long, fully access controlled four-lane expressway with the starting point at Jaitpur in Gorakhpur, on the NH-27 bypass. It will end at Salarpur village in Azamgarh, joining the Purvanchal Expressway which ends at Haidaria village in Ghazipur. The stipulated date for completion of the project is December 2023. Ganga Expressway: Express road link across UP : The Ganga is synonymous with the spirit and essence of India. Now, an expressway coming up along the holy river will transform road connectivity in the state. The Ganga Expressway will be a 594-km long, fully access-controlled expressway proposed to start from Bijauli village on Meerut-Bulandshahr road (NH-334) in Meerut, and ending at Judapur Dando village near bypass on NH-19 in Prayagraj. It is slated to be completed by 2025. Bundelkhand Expressway: Towards rapid transformation: Bundelkhand is a historic region in central India straddling across UP and MP. Now, a modern expressway will transform this relatively inaccessible region into a hotbed of development activities. The CM launched the Bundelkhand Expressway project in April 2017. After the completion of this project, the ambitious Defence Industrial Corridor Project will get tremendous boost. The proposed expressway will link Bundelkhand with Delhi through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The PM laid its foundation stone on February 29, 2020. Its total length is 296.07 km, beginning from Chitrakoot on Jhansi-Prayagraj NH-35/76 near Bharatkoop, and ending at Agra-Lucknow Expressway, near Kudrail village of Takha tehsil on Agra-Lucknow Expressway in Etawah. Till November 2021, more than 75% work on the expressway has been completed and at this pace, it is likely to be completed by the stipulated time of March 2022.

Justice Sophy Thomas made the observation on a petition filed by Salim Kumar of Kollam through advocate IV Pramod. The petitioner, a village assistant, had challenged a case registered by Badiadka police under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act. As per Section 118(a), any person found in a public place in an intoxicated manner or riotous condition or incapable of looking after himself can be booked for causing grave violation of public order or danger. The petitioner had said he was called to the police station at 7 pm to identify an accused and a false case was registered as he couldn’t identify the accused as required by police as the accused was a stranger to him. The HC said, “Consuming liquor in a private place without causing nuisance or annoyance to anybody will not attract any offence. Mere smell of alcohol also can’t be construed to mean that the person was intoxicated or was under the influence of any liquor.” Even if the petitioner had consumed alcohol, the available facts and materials in the case are not sufficient to suggest that he was not able to control himself or he committed rioting inside the police station, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/booze-smell-alone-not-proof-of-intoxication-kerala-hc/articleshow/87726755.cms||---

Congress is likely to re-field incumbent MLC KC Kondaiah. The saffron party has submitted five names to the core committee, including Channabasanagouda, the defeated candidate in the previous MLC election. Meanwhile, KC Kondaiah has already completed one round of campaigning by meeting with elected officials in local governments. Y Satish, Gonal Rajashekhar, Channabasanagoudra, Dharmendra Singh, and Dammuru Shekhar are BJP's MLC candidates. Tourism minister Anand Singh, transport minister B Sriramulu, MLA Somashekhar Reddy, Janardan Reddy, and other BJP leaders need to work hard to retain the constituency, but they seem to have lost enthusiasm for the MLC elections for a variety of reasons, including the separation of Vijayanagara district from Ballari. “We should not underestimate Congress candidate Kondaiah in this election because he won the previous MLC poll by a large margin. However, if leaders and workers work together in the election, the BJP will have better chances. I hope the party will consider me as a candidate, but the final decision will be made by the party,” said Y Satish. Mrutyunjaya Jinaga represented this constituency during the Reddy brothers' tenure, but in the previous election, BJP candidate Channabasanagoudru (who got only 1,500 votes) was defeated by KC Kondaiah by a huge margin (secured 3,098 votes). This time, 4,663 people are eligible to vote in the constituency, which includes MPs, MLCs, and MLAs from 11 taluks in both districts. In Congress, Kondaiah may be the undisputed candidate, but some party leaders have been demanding ticket for a Dalit candidate. " There is no strong Dalit voice in in the council from the Kalyana Karnataka region. If the Congress gives a ticket to a Dalit leader in the Ballari local body MLC election, it will help to raise community issues of the backward area," said a Congress leader from the Dalit community in the Ballari district.

---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC slams CBI for ‘unsatisfactory’ probe into Jaunpur custodial death||PRAYAGRAJ: Slamming the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its failure to properly investigate the alleged custodial death of a 24-year-old man from Jaunpur, the Allahabad high court has observed that the affidavit filed by the CBI is totally unsatisfactory as it indicated that no concrete effort had been made by it to arrest the accused persons, who are policemen. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Ajay Kumar Yadav of Jaunpur district, a division bench comprising justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and justice Piyush Agrawal observed, “The averment made by the CBI that efforts are being made, appears to be merely an eyewash in view of the stand taken on the last date of hearing as recorded in the order October 27, 2021 that the CBI arrests accused only after completion of investigation.” In its affidavit, the CBI gave the details of police officers, suspects and accused persons and also stated that efforts are being made by conducting raids/ searches at their known addresses, examining their CDRs/ IPDRs, and deploying sources to get their present locations for the execution of non-bailalble warrants (NBWs). It was also stated that arrest warrants have been issued by local police from the court of chief judicial magistrate, Jaunpur on September 6, 2021. However, the court noted that the accused persons haven’t been arrested even after more than two months. However, in its order dated November 10, the court granted one more opportunity to the CBI to investigate the case properly and execute the arrest warrants without any further delay and to take all consequential action as provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), including the provisions of sections 82 and 83 CrPC, by which the accused are declared as absconders and their properties are attached. Lastly, the court called for an affidavit from CBI on the next date, i.e., November, 29, 2021. The CBI has been asked to clarify its stand on its submission made earlier that CBI arrests the accused only after completion of the investigation. Earlier, at one stage, this court had transferred the probe of the alleged death of a 24-year-old man in police custody in Jaunpur district in February this year to CBI, while observing that “the entire effort of the police is to somehow give clean chit to the accused”. It is alleged by the petitioner that a police team of Baksha police station in Jaunpur district forcibly took away Krishna Yadav alias Pujari, who was about 24 years of age, on February 11, 2021 in an alleged false case and detained him at the police station. When the informant (brother of the deceased) went to the police station, he was not allowed to meet his brother and the next morning (February 12, 2021), he was informed that his brother (Pujari) had died. Thereafter, a case was registered against the accused police officers under Sections 302 (murder) and other sections of Indian Penal Code at Baksa police station. On the other hand, police claimed that the youth was apprehended while he was driving a motorcycle which fell due to which he received injuries and the public beat him up. As per the police version, when he (the detained youth) was sent for first aid along with a sub inspector and two constables, the doctor at the community health centre referred him to district hospital, Jaunpur, and by the time they reached the district hospital, he had died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-slams-cbi-for-unsatisfactory-probe-into-jaunpur-custodial-death/articleshow/87724155.cms||---
---||Allahabad||SRN hospital to provide ‘jumbo pack platelet’ to help dengue patients in Prayagraj||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that the Sangam city has recorded 926 dengue cases (till Sunday) and there has been an enhanced demand for the platelets among the patients suffering from dengue, Swaroop Rani Nehru hospital of the MLN medical college of the city is all set to provide the much-needed relief. As good news for the denizens suffering from dengue, the blood bank at SRN would be providing a ‘Jumbo pack platelet’ for the patient who needs the same. This has become possible after the use of the Apheresis machine, which has been installed in the blood bank of the hospital last year. “This machine has come handy when we needed a large quantity of plasma during the Covid-19 pandemic and now that we have got the rate for the Jumbo pack platelet from the government, we have started providing the same," said associate professor at the department of transfusion medicines at MLN medical college of the district, Dr Ravi Rani. The benefit of the jumbo pack, which is also called single donor Apheresis platelets, is that a single unit of this pack can result in an increase of around 50,000 platelets in a dengue patient, explains the medico. The government has fixed the rate of one unit of jumbo pack platelets at Rs 8,000 and this would be given to patients admitted in the government hospitals. However, it will be completely free for the patients of Thalassemia and those who are covered under 'Janani Shuraksha Yojna' of the central government. Dr Ravi Rani says that the increased platelet count from 50 to 60 thousand in one unit would also mean that it would be of immense help in terms of helping the patients suffering from dengue. There is a shortage of platelets due to high demand and every effort is being made to provide platelets to all the patients in SRN, she added. Another benefit of using the Apheresis machine and segregating the platelets through it is that the donor just has to donate the platelets and the rest of the components of the blood would be transfused back to the donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/srn-hospital-to-provide-jumbo-pack-platelet-to-help-dengue-patients-in-prayagraj/articleshow/87724164.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Cloudy atmosphere leaves paddy farmers in Raichur, Yadgir worried||Kalaburagi: The countdown to harvesting paddy having begun in the earnest in Raichur and Yadgir districts, the gloomy weather prevailing almost across Karnataka, has the farmers understandably perturbed. The overcast sky may result in the colour of the rice in the crop going black, which will subsequently translate to huge losses for the farmers, who will be forced to sell their crop at a throwaway price.On Monday, the farmers in the two districts greeted the Sun with visible delight, for the bright light rent asunder the gloom that had hung over the sky for the past four days. Rice mill owners are unlikely to purchase the blackened crop, and if they do, may not offer an attractive sum to the farmers. There are also fears of a marked reduction in the yield this year.Most of the farmers engaged in the cultivation of paddy in the two districts have leased farmland for the venture. Under the terms of the agreement, the farmer is obliged to pay the landlord once the paddy is harvested. However, with the threat of their crop blackening, the farmers, most of whom borrowed money from private moneylenders to sow their fields, are fretting over honouring their commitment, and settling their debts.Bheemappa Hosamani, a farmer in Kembavi, Shorapur taluk in Yadgir, said that the cloudy atmosphere was likely to result in the rice crop accruing a black hue, which would, in turn, result in their produce fetching very low prices. “We are all quite worried since we have to prepare for the harvest soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cloudy-atmosphere-leaves-paddy-farmers-in-raichur-yadgir-worried/articleshow/87723424.cms||---

Gurkirat, who was the chief guest at Punjab Day function held during the ongoing India International Trade Fair 2021 at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, also urged the central government to re-open Kartarpur corridor which has been closed since March 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic. About industrial growth in the state, the minister said that the Punjab government has brought investment of over Rs 1 lakh crore, which has not only given the much needed boost to the economy but also generated employment. He said a two-day Progressive Punjab Investors’ Summit was organised recently and the government has also set up the Punjab bureau of investment promotion as the single point of contact for facilitation of investors. The new industrial policy with detailed schemes and operational guidelines was implemented with the sole motive of making the state number one destination for investors and business in the country. The new policy covers extensive reforms, focusing on eight key strategic pillars of change, including infrastructure, power, skill, MSMEs, startup and entrepreneurship, ease of doing business, fiscal and non-fiscal incentives and policy. The minister took a round of Punjab Pavilion which has been designed and decorated in consonance with the theme of IITF 2021 i.e. Atmanirbhar Bharat- Self Reliant India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-failed-to-control-delhi-pollution-now-blaming-farmers-punjab-minister/articleshow/87724990.cms||---

The strike however, received a lukewarm response. “Since Covid-19 lockdown, auto rickshaw drivers were struggling to do business. With the drastic surge in CNG prices, rickshaw drivers’ revenues are dented. Our fares were revised after four years which should have been done much earlier,” said Rajvir Upadhyay, president, Jagrut Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union. Members have sought that they be allowed to revise prices independently.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 12-day baby dumped in drain saved by Nirbhaya cops||MUMBAI: She has been named Pari (fairy) and is the cynosure of all eyes at a suburban hospital. But her flickering, 12-day life has been anything but a fairy tale so far. On Sunday, nobody was sure if the waif of a girl would survive after she was rescued from a drain near Ramabai Nagar in Ghatkopar by a woman-led police team. Dressed in nothing but a flimsy T-shirt and soaking in the water and trash in the drain for an hour at least, Pari was lucky she did not drown, choke or freeze to death. Her incessant wails finally alerted residents, who informed the police. The police team acted with common sense and speed. Rushed to a hospital in the nick of time, Pari is now doing well. Pantnagar police have filed an FIR against her unidentified parents for abandoning her and are looking for them. Early on Sunday, the Nirbhaya squad of Pantnagar police station was attending to a distress call at Ramabai Nagar. Around 3.30am, the squad was informed about a baby’s cries from a drain at D B Pawar Chowk. The team wrapped up as quickly as possible and rushed to the drain. A couple of residents were up but nobody had touched the baby for fear of “interfering in police work”. “The two-and-half-foot-high drain had a thin flow of water. The infant had turned sideways when we found her and her cries were growing faint. Cats had started to gather around. We believe she may have been abandoned for an hour at least. Large tiles had been used to cover the drain partially so that she wouldn’t be discovered,” said constable Sheetal Sonawane. When she and assistant sub inspector Vitthal Pardhi lifted the baby out, she was freezing; her arms had turned blue. “We asked for some warm water and cloth to clean the baby,” said Sonawane. She swaddled the infant and tried to arrange for warm milk and a baby bottle, but the child wouldn’t stop crying. So the team rushed her to a public hospital. Getting the baby admitted was an ordeal. The hospital said they had only one infant warmer and it was required for babies born in-house. The paediatric and NICU wards also turned them away. After nearly half an hour of persuasion, a doctor finally put his foot down and said the baby was too frail to be turned away. For two hours, she was kept in a warmer and fed. A saline drip was added later. Sonawane is checking every night on the baby, whom she named Pari. Once she recuperates, she will be handed over to a shelter as the investigation continues. “We have already started receiving phone calls from people enquiring about adoption and have had to clarify that it can’t happen at this point when legal procedures are underway,” said inspector Kishore Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-12-day-baby-dumped-in-drain-saved-by-nirbhaya-cops/articleshow/87724988.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Ahmedabad||Covid deaths ex gratia: Kin made to run around on Day 1||AHMEDABAD: The district collector office near Subhash Bridge saw a steady stream of applicants for the compensation of Rs 50,000 for Covid-19 deceased from 9am to 6 pm on Monday. November 15 was reportedly the first day for application to get the compensation, according to the state government directives. “However, when I reached the spot after driving for 20km with my son, I was informed by the personnel that no form distribution or submission takes place at the collector’s office. Instead, we were directed towards the zonal health department office of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation,” said Jayendra Parmar, a resident of Pirana who had lost his father in May to the pandemic. “Moreover, the current process is only to procure the medical certificate for cause of death (MCCD), we are told. We’ll do the process tomorrow.” Hundreds turned up, hoping to fund the education of kin, support family, or even get a new vehicle from the money, but officials at the collector office said it is a long road to getting Rs 50,000. “The only official notification on the subject is from the state health department on October 29, laying down rules for getting MCCD. The notification clearly mentioned the registrar of birth and death at respective administrative unit – municipal corporation, municipality or gram panchayat – as the issuing authority,” said a senior official. “The notification also mentions forming of Covid Death Ascertaining Committee (CDAC) at various levels. It says nothing about compensation.” “But how would we know all this nitty-gritty? We went by the media reports and even downloaded a form circulated on a social media platform and filled it up to submit with the copy of death certificate issued from the Civil Hospital,” said Usha Mangar, a resident of Vejalpur, who lost her husband to the pandemic in April after a prolonged hospitalization. Senior officials at the Civil Hospital said that there are no applications so far to review the cause of death. The officials added that there’s no Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to review the committee decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-deaths-ex-gratia-kin-made-to-run-around-on-day-1/articleshow/87725013.cms||---

Around 31.3% hid the cord in their homes, the study showed, further highlighting the fact that most moms didn’t apply any dressing to the cord stump. The study, which focused on mothers at the South Goa district hospital, threw light on the considerable importance given to cultural practices related to maternal/newborn care. Of the 80 participants, 22.5% observed a period of postpartum confinement of 40 days at home, with their newborns. Some traditional practices adopted by the new mothers to protect their baby from the evil eye included applying kajal to the baby’s face, as well as the use of bangles, black threads, anklets and chains. The study was conducted by Drs Preksha Vernekar, Jagadish Cacodcar, Minaxi Panandikar and Ira Almeida, and was published in the International Journal of Preventive, Curative and Community Medicine. As far as traditional practices related to the care of newborns goes, a significant number of mothers used new/washed clothes for their babies (83.8%) and 72.5% bathed them five days post-delivery. It was also found that almost half of the study participants — 48.8% — were advised to be confined along with the baby in hospital till day six, post-delivery. The researchers felt that mothers need to be educated about the consequences of applying kajal to a baby’s eyes, as it can not only cause itching or irritation, but can cause infections like blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), conjunctivitis (inflammation/infection of the membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball), or dacryocystitis (infection of the tear sac). Fingernail trauma while applying kajal can cause conjunctival or corneal lacerations, they said. Another practice that is commonly followed was massaging a baby before bath. As many as 98.8% of the respondents said that babies were given massages before bath. Other traditional practices that are still prevalent are exposing a baby to holy smoke (incense/dhoop) after bath, as well as exposing babies to warm sunlight to counteract jaundice. The study noted participants’ positive attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding among a majority of the women; 86.3% initiated breastfeeding within thirty minutes of birth, which was comparable to studies done in India and elsewhere. The researchers felt that health professionals should be aware of traditional practices followed by the community to provide culturally-appropriate and acceptable healthcare. It has recommended that harmless, acceptable or even potentially beneficial practices observed during the postnatal period should be supported and considered a part of the state’s rich culture, while harmful practices should be avoided with health education provided at the time of discharge from hospital and during post-natal visits for health checkup of mother and baby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-study-throws-light-on-goan-moms-belief-in-postpartum-cultural-practices/articleshow/87725789.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Dehradun||Salman Khurshid’s Nainital home shot at, portion set on fire||By Sonali Mishra & Pramod DalakotiNAINITAL/ALMORA: The house of Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid, located in Satkhol area in Ramgarh block of Nainital district, was vandalised on Monday afternoon. Around two dozen people, who onlookers said belonged to right-wing outfit Bajrang Dal, staged a demonstration in front of the house, burnt Khurshid's effigy before setting a portion of the residence on fire. An FIR has been registered against around 20 people, "who are yet to be identified", police said. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book 'Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times'. Soon after the incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?” He further said, “So such is debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides, I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.” Fellow Congress leader Shashi Tharoor took to Twitter to condemn the incident, saying “this is disgraceful”. “The mounting levels of intolerance in our politics should be denounced by those in power,” he tweeted. At the time of the incident, the caretaker of the house, Sundar Ram, and his family were present. Ram said that around 1 pm, a mob converged in front of the house. “We tried to reason with them but they started pouring diesel on the front door and set it on fire. One of them whipped out a pistol and pointed it at my daughter-in-law. They then opened fire at the window and broke the window panes. They must have fired around six to seven rounds,” Ram said. The caretaker added that he recognised two people in the mob, one of whom has been named in the FIR. Police reached the spot after Ram informed them. DIG Kumaon Nilesh Bharane told TOI, “Apart from one accused, identified as Rakesh Kapil, a resident of Mouna village, 20 others, yet to be identified, have been booked. For now, police cover has been provided at the house.” The FIR has been lodged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 456 (punishment for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night),552 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/khurshids-nainital-home-shot-at-portion-set-on-fire/articleshow/87724167.cms||---

It’s seeking an extension of a stage-wise delivery schedule,” said a senior official from the NMC’s transport department. “A senior representative from the manufacturing unit in Hyderabad has sought time to meet municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on November 18. They will be submitting a plan to deliver the buses in a phase-wise manner,” the official said. Under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle), the Central government had sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NMC to procure 40 e-buses. Recently, the NMC had given an ultimatum to the firm to deliver 40 electric buses by November 15 or it will start levying a 0.1% per day fine against its performance guarantee amount. “After the meeting with the civic chief, we will decide our future course of action, whether to give more time or to start deducting a fine from the performance guarantee amount,” the official added. A local representative of the firm told TOI that the pandemic-induced lockdown had a great impact on the production of e-buses. Pre-lockdown, the firm used to manufacture 12 e-buses per day. The figure has now come down to 4. The lockdown had also affected the availability of spare parts required for manufacturing of e-buses. Besides, availability of manpower was another major factor that affected the production of e-buses, said company sources. With the present status, the company can’t deliver the 40 e-buses at one go. Sources said the company is overburdened with orders to deliver 1,400 e-buses across India. With the present status of manufacturing 4 e-buses per day, the company will require 400 days to fulfil its commitments, said sources. The official said that the firm is seeking time to deliver the 40 e-buses between December and May 2022. He, however, pointed out that the NMC can’t grant additional time and further explained that 170 JNNURM buses will have to be scrapped in February due to the end of their lifespan. To a query, the official said though the three red bus operators will have to replace these buses with new fleets, the NMC cannot take any chances. “We are seeking quicker delivery of the 40 e-buses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hyderabad-firm-fails-to-deliver-40-e-buses-to-nmc/articleshow/87724174.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of the Kinnar akhara, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, who reached Prayagraj on Monday, termed Kangana Ranaut’s statement as “wrong”, adding that she should apologize to the country and take back her statement. The head of the Kinnar akhara said that such a statement regarding the independence of the country is an insult to democracy and the constitution. “So many great freedom fighters of the country have shed their blood, participated in satyagraha and sacrificed everything they had in their life so that the country was freed from the slavery of the British. Thus, the statement of film actress Kangana Ranaut is an insult to the freedom fighters of the country,” Tripathi said. Tripathi said that it is not proper to use abusive or insulting words, whether intended or unintended, regarding the freedom of the country and termed Kangana’s statement as “seditious”. No one has the right to make such statements just to “generate publicity”. “Everyone had fought for the freedom struggle together, whether they belonged to the Congress, Left, Sangh, or right-wing ideology. Everyone has an equal contribution in freeing this land from the British Raj,” said Tripathi. Tripathi also said that everyone has the right to exercise the freedom of speech in a democracy and political rhetoric can also be made, but the independence of the country cannot be associated and seen using the lens of a government or any political party formed before or after 2014. The Kinnar akhara head also said that from 2014 onwards, the BJP government in the country has been in Centre and many states which is a positive thing and added that the same can also be said for most of the governments formed since the independence of the country. Meanwhile, the Kinnar akhara has welcomed bringing back the statue of ‘Maa Annapurna’ from Canada after around 108 years. “The statue would be installed near Baba Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi. Tripathi said that the Kinnar akhara welcomes such efforts and the British Museum is full of artefacts associated with our heritage. Likewise, many other idols are kept in foreign museums and the same should also be brought back,” added Tripathi. On this occasion, the Acharya Mahamandaleshwar also led the procession taken out by the Rashtriya Sanatan Sena. She said that the Kinnar Akhara is with all the organisations which are working for the progress of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/kinnar-akhara-head-flays-kanganacomment-on-countrys-freedom/articleshow/87724171.cms||---

---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi to launch Purvanchal Expressway, open doors for east UP’s development||LUCKNOW: The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway, connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, just months ahead of crucial UP assembly elections. It would be the longest operational expressway of India, overtaking Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which is 301-km long. PM Modi is scheduled to arrive in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft that will land on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Kurebhar stretch of the Access Controlled Greenfield expressway in Sultanpur and will dedicate the project to the people almost three years after laying its foundation on July 14, 2018, in Azamgarh. The Purvanchal Expressway project was launched to spur development in the remote east UP region that has lagged in infrastructure and industrialisation. Experts said the expressway could give BJP an advantage over its political rivals in the eastern UP region that also comprises PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and CM Yogi’s political backyard Gorakhpur. Starting from village Chand Sarai on Lucknow-Sultanpur Road (NH-731) in Lucknow, the expressway passes through seven districts — Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh and Mau — before ending at village Haidariya on National Highway No.19 in Ghazipur, just 18 km away from UP-Bihar border. “The expressway has been the dream project of the state government and CM Yogi Adityanath. The project was completed in record time despite severe restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic,” said UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) CEO Awanish Awasthi on the eve of the inauguration. All the preparations for the inauguration by the Prime Minister have been completed, he added. CM Yogi on Monday had an inspection of the site of the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration will also witness the landing of fighter aircraft on the 3.2 km long and 34 mt wide emergency air strip at Sultanpur. Constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 22,496 crore (including the land cost), the expressway has eight packages. UPEIDA officials said the tenders received were around 5.19% less than the estimated cost, resulting in a profit of around Rs 614 crore to the authority. The six-lane expressway (expandable up to eight lanes) has 18 flyovers, seven railway over-bridges (ROBs) and 271 underpasses. According to a UPEIDA document, the work of setting up eight toilet blocks and four petrol pumps is in progress. In the event of an accident, a total of 16 ambulances (two each in every package) will be available for quick assistance and speedy transport of the injured to the nearest hospital. The expressway will provide the much needed connectivity from the east UP region to the state capital and then to Delhi through Lucknow-Agra Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The state government also plans to set up 21 industrial points in the hinterland of the expressway in an area of 9,171 hectares. The state government has identified handloom industry, food processing units, storage plants, mandi and milk-based industries for the purpose. Opportunities will also be available for establishment of Industrial Training Institute, educational and training institutes, medical institutes along the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-launch-purvanchal-e-way-open-doors-for-east-ups-dev/articleshow/87725800.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Ali Zaidi unanimously elected new chief of Shia Waqf Board||Lucknow: Ali Zaidi of Lucknow, who was earlier nominated to the UP Shia Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) by the state government, was unanimously elected as the chairperson of the Board on Monday. Out of eight members, six participated in the election. Former chairperson and current member Waseem Rizvi and another member Syed Faizi boycotted the day’s proceedings which were undertaken after getting the green signal from newly-appointed principal secretary of the minority welfare, Haj and Waqf department, Himanshu Kumar. The members who participated in the election were former Congress MP from Rampur, Noor Bano, advocates Zaryab Jamal Rizvi of Amroha and Syed Shabahat Husain of Sidharthnagar, cleric Maulana Raza Husain of Lucknow and senior consultant at district women’s hospital, Prayagraj, Dr Noorus Hasan Naqvi. After the announcement of election result, state minister for minority welfare, Mohsin Raza, termed Zaidi’s win as the victory of BJP and of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s zero tolerance policy towards corruption. Zaidi is the son-in-law of the cousin of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad and is the youngest person in the Board. Jawwad has been at loggerheads with Rizvi and has been accusing him of indulging in corruption. Jawwad also led several protests during Rizvi’s two terms as the Board’s chairperson. Due to his controversial statements against Islam, the Quran, Prophet Mohammad and madrasas, Rizvi had also drawing the ire of other clerics and organisations. “My priority will be to clean the Board of all corruption, as is the CM’s roadmap. Corrupt persons will not be spared. Shia waqf properties encroached by land mafia and waqf mafia will be taken back and the profit from earnings of these land will be honestly utilised,” said Ali Zaidi. “The Waqf Act is very clear but the Board was not being run according to it. People who benefitted from selfish management of the Board will be stopped. Honest people will be given responsibilities,” he added. Meanwhile, in a press statement, Waseem Rizvi termed the election result would lead “to the hold of Taliban over the Board much as it is in Afghanistan”. “Clerics, in collaboration with the minority department, have usurped the Board. The Waqf Act clearly states that the number of nominated members will not be more than elected ones but this was not the case for the chairperson election. Only three out of the eight board members are elected, while the remaining five members are nominated by the government. Syed Faizi will wait for the high court’s decision on our writ petitions on the subject,” Rizvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ali-zaidi-unanimously-elected-new-chief-of-shia-waqf-board/articleshow/87725804.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Nagpur||Nagpur orange turns sour for Bangladesh traders||NAGPUR: Orange growers in Vidarbha complaining of a poor harvest this year are not alone. Even traders from Bangladesh — the biggest export market for Nagpur oranges — say they have been left bleeding. Over four months ago, the Bangladesh government increased assessment value for oranges by 10 cents per kg. Assessment value is the base price at which customs duty is calculated. Oranges attract over 90% duty. Now, as the value has been hiked, the final duty levied on the fruit goes up too. It is reported to have taken a toll on Indian exports, say trade sources here. But oranges from Bhutan are sold duty-free in Bangladesh. A costlier Nagpur orange has a lower demand these days. Traders in Bangladesh say their purchase price has increased due to the duty hike. However, prices in Bangladesh markets are not enough to recover the cost. This has left each of them in losses. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has been pushing for increasing orange exports to Bangladesh from the region. The minister on Saturday said he had a meeting with the Bangladesh home minister in New Delhi, wherein the latter “assured to take oranges in huge quantum from Vidarbha”. He has also taken up the issue of duty hike with the country’s leadership. The yield of Ambiya crop, whose season begins in October-November, is low and the prices need to be pushed for the farmers to cover up the losses, say trade sources. This can happen with a good export demand. Normally, 25% of the crop goes to Bangladesh. The level may not be reached this year. Manoj Jawanjal, a director in Mahaorange, a state government undertaking, also agreed. TOI talked to traders both in India and Bangladesh to assess the situation. Javed Khan, a trader in Warud which is the major centre for oranges, said that domestic prices have just touched Rs25,000 to Rs30,000 a tonne. “The average price was over Rs15,000 in the beginning. The prices are not enough to cover up losses due to lower yield,” said Khan. From Bangladesh, Shahjahan Mohammed Kabir said that traders are incurring a loss of at least Rs500 a crate. “Many stake their savings in the trade. With the duty clubbed, a crate of Nagpur oranges cost Rs2,500 to Rs2700 and the market price is Rs2,300 to Rs2,200,” he said. A number of delegations have been put up before the government but in vain, said Kabir. Farooq Siddiqui, secretary (foreign affairs) of Bangladesh Fresh Fruit Importers Association, said that the costlier dollar is further adding to the duty. Since the assessment value is dollar designated, it further goes up if the greenback becomes costlier as against the local currency. Siddiqui said that there is a major market of Nagpur oranges in Bangladesh. However, there has been a duty impact on oranges imported from all other countries. “The increase in cost is affecting the trade. Only orange imports from Bhutan are duty free,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-orange-turns-sour-for-bangladesh-traders/articleshow/87724204.cms||Shishir Arya

During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725848.cms||---
---||Delhi||Corporations will get funds to buy more sweeping machines, says Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Delhi government on measures to fight air pollution in the city. The SC’s remarks came as the Delhi government declared that it would sanction “whatever money” the municipal corporations required to augment the fleet of mechanised road-sweeping vehicles to curb dust pollution, a major contributor to toxicity of ambient air pollution. When the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, praised Delhi government's efforts in intensifying water sprinkling and deploying of mechanised road-sweeping machines, a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said the AAP government's affidavit was blaming the farmers by stating that stubble burning was the principal cause for deterioration of air quality in Delhi even when scientific studies showed that dust, industries, vehicular traffic and coal-fired thermal power plants were major contributors. Taking up the pollution caused by dust particles, the bench asked Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehra whether 69 mechanised road-sweeping machines were adequate to minimise the pollution caused by sweeping of nearly 8,500 km of roads in the city. “What steps have you taken to control air pollution due to dust particles?” it asked. “Municipal corporations are the ones which carry out road-sweeping tasks,” responded Mehra. “These are independent autonomous bodies. It is for the corporations and mayors to file an affidavit stating whether the number of machines is adequate.” The CJI said, “There is always some excuse or the other that can be given when the work is not done. You are passing the buck to the municipal corporations.” “This kind of lame excuse will compel us to find out and hold an audit inquiry into the total revenue you are collecting and what you are spending on the popularity slogans instead of looking after the people,” said Justice Kant. Justice Chandrachud asked Mehra what the government could do to augment the number of machines in the next 24 hours. Mehra said that there was a commitment from the top level, including the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government, to do “whatever is required”. Justice Kant reminded the Delhi government that the municipal corporations were before the SC in some other cases and had pleaded that they do not even have money to pay salaries to their staff. After speaking to the officials concerned, Mehra assured the court that “the Delhi government will release funds immediately as and when the municipal corporations inform it about the additional requirement of road-sweeping machines. We are committed to do whatever is possible to ensure clean air for Delhi.” He said they will come out with a figure tomorrow. “Whatever steps the Centre wants the states to take, almost all have been taken by the Delhi government…We will take whatever steps are required in the next 24-48 hours. We have banned all construction activities,” added Mehra. The bench then observed that, “even the SG has said that you are doing your best, but you may need to take more steps. There are other areas also. If construction is taking place in NCR, the states have to take steps. Delhi does not mean the entire NCR.” Mehra then pointed out that the Delhi government wants to have a lockdown and the SC and Centre must consider that for the entire NCR to effectively stop vehicular pollution. “There should be one cohesive effort to reduce air pollution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-will-get-funds-to-buy-moresweeping-machines-says-delhi-govt/articleshow/87725075.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: In 4 days, test positivity rate in Ahmedabad reaches 0.2%||AHMEDABAD: Despite the directives by the state health department to increase Covid testing on Saturday, the overall testing has remained around 45,000 to 55,000 – the same as the average of the last week, albeit an increase from 15,000 to 25,000 during Diwali festivities. Thus, the test positivity rate (TPR) has remained 0.06% — 6 cases found for every 10,000 tests performed. On Sunday, only Vadodara (5,258), Ahmedabad (7,193) and Surat (9,873) recorded over 5,000 daily tests as the three districts accounted for 49% of the daily tests. It’s despite the claims by the state administration that all entry points including airports, railway stations, bus depots and district along with state borders have medical teams deployed for stringent checks of the incoming population. Analysis of the past four days reveal that Ahmedabad reported 37 new cases from 19,236 tests, giving TPR of 0.2% compared to the state average of 0.06% and against Surat’s 0.05% as the district recorded 16 cases from 30,419 tests. Ahmedabad currently has the highest 70 active Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-4-days-tpr-in-abad-reaches-0-2/articleshow/87725035.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After no to food trucks, BMC to distribute mobile libraries||MUMBAI: In the next few months, residents of Byculla and Mazgaon may well spot mobile libraries for students in their localities. With the BMC stopping distribution of food trucks by corporators as freebies, now the Shiv Sena-led corporation intends to distribute mobile library vans free of cost ahead of the civic elections early next year. The BMC’s E Ward, which covers Byculla, Mazgaon and Mumbai Central, has moved a proposal to buy and distribute mobile library vans worth Rs 2 crore. One mobile library will cost the BMC around Rs 45-50 lakh. Last month, in a setback to a chunk of Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC had stayed the distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators. The BMC’s planning department had issued a circular directing all wards to not distribute any food trucks bought from the BMC’s funds, citing lack of a comprehensive policy for food trucks in the city. With the Shiv Sena miffed at the BMC’s circular to stop distribution of food trucks, civic commissioner Iqbal Chahal had called for a meeting to discuss and formulate a food truck policy. The BMC’s E Ward has now asked the planning department to fix guidelines for distribution of mobile libraries after a demand from Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav, who heads the civic standing committee. Jadhav is a corporator from constituency number 209 of Byculla and Mazgaon. Jadhav said the library vans will be run for poor and needy students by social organisations. “This is an educational initiative and I had taken approvals for it and even got fund provisions made officially. This will benefit thousands of students since we will keep books related to competitive exams such as UPSC and school and college curricula. Students can borrow the books and it will be a library at their doorstep. Poor and needy students will benefit. Education shouldn’t be politicised by the opposition,” Jadhav said. However, the opposition corporators have hit out at the BMC on this latest freebie. “Just like the distribution of food trucks, there is no policy for distributing mobile library vans. We don’t know who will run the libraries and who will be the beneficiaries or what kind of books will be kept in these mobile libraries or where they will be parked. The BMC seems to be giving freebies like donations to the ruling party,” said SP corporator Rais Shaikh. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra too opposed it. “This is nothing but a way to give out freebies without any policy. The BMC says the library vans are for unemployed persons. Who are the unemployed persons who will earn money by running libraries? This is loot of public money,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-no-to-food-trucks-bmc-to-distribute-mobile-libraries/articleshow/87725044.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The group aims to cover 8,500 students of the five schools run by the management and an equal number of underprivileged children will be vaccinated at a private hospital, according to a media release. Around 3,000 parents who participated in a survey done by the Udgam Group of Schools, 99% of the parents expressed their willingness for their children’s vaccination. The group has tied up with Ahmedabad based multispecialty hospital chain to execute vaccination program. Both Covaxin and Zydus vaccines will be available for the parents according to their choice, it said. Commenting on this initiative, Manan Choksi, executive director of Udgam Group of Schools said, “With the mass-vaccination drive by the authorities combined with an awareness of the pandemic, most of the citizens have been taken their shots. Children need to get protected from Covid-19 with their vaccine doses.” The school management had conducted a survey among the parents to know their willingness about vaccinating their kids. Around 3,000 parents had participated in the survey and 99% of the parents expressed their readiness to get the vaccine shots for their children. Under this vaccination campaign, the school management is aiming to cover underprivileged children as they have lost a lot of schooling. “Bigger challenge is ensuring vaccination among the underprivileged children,” added Choksi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/udgam-group-to-mass-vaccinate-students-underprivileged/articleshow/87725034.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Tubewells polluted up to 130m in Sangrur village||CHANDIGARH: An experts’ committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has found that most of the tubewells and aquifers up to depth of 130 metre below ground level in village Alorakh of Bhiwanigarh block in Sangrur district are contaminated. The committee had done sampling from tubewells varying between shallow (46 meter below ground level) to very deep (183 meter below ground level). The committee said that it has been observed that the tubewells affected by contamination are having depth of about 130 meter below ground level in the vicinity of a closed industry. “Considering the water levels of about 40 meter below ground level, about 80 meter to 90 meter thick aquifer zone has been contaminated,” reads the report. The NGT was also informed that water from five locations out of total 22 locations in the village was found reddish in colour, indicating contamination. All these five borewells were also found to be having high total organic carbon, further indicating contamination with organic compounds. Two borewells were found to be having significant concentration of chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand whereas three borewells were found having high nitrate concentration. The experts’ committee also submitted to the NGT that the sampling of the soil, agriculture crops and produce to determine the accumulation of contaminants in soil, crops and produce by the joint committee was conducted on October 27 after determining the affected area based on the Central Ground Water Authority report. The samples have been sent to the Punjab Biotechnology Incubator (PBTI) laboratory in Mohali and the results of the analysis are expected by November 25. The committee has sought a time of 15 days from the NGT to submit the final analysis report. It was also submitted that based on the outcome of the analysis of heavy metals in the groundwater, outcome of accumulation and biomagnification studies, the remediation plan and cost estimation will be prepared by the joint committee for taking further remedial measures by the Punjab chief secretary. The joint experts committee, included Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir, experts from the central pollution control board, Punjab pollution control board and Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change. The NGT had constituted the expert’s committee in a petition filed by advocate Hari Chand Arora on the basis of a news report highlighting that tubewells in Sangrur village have polluted water and the people are suffering with this problem for the past 10 years. The Punjab pollution control board had been blaming a factory for this which was shut down around 15 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tubewells-polluted-up-to-130m-in-sangrur-village/articleshow/87725058.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Chandigarh||Finally, GMCH-32 starts radio frequency identification attendance||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The UT health department has started radio frequency identification attendance at GMCH-32 for all its employees. This is the first such tertiary hospital in the city to have such a system of attendance. The system was introduced in 1998 and 2010 but discontinued. Sources said that the Medical Council of India had made it mandatory for the college teaching faculty to have RFID attendance. All government medical colleges were given machines for this but even after installation, they were fixed the wall without being used. When UT health secretary Yashpal Garg conducted a surprise night inspection last month, he found that there was no emergency medical officer available in the hospital. Also, the security guard supervisor was not checking visitors in emergency and was busy surfing the internet on his phone instead. “The system was installed and has been operational since the last one week in all administrative offices and even OPDs but it will not provide any incentive for those going for extra hours beyond their schedule,” said a GMCH-32 employee. He added, “We are also asked to sign on the register besides using the RFID system.” GMSH-16 is already using the attendance system while PGI has it only in the administrative block. “There was a plan to start the same in OPDs. The machines were even bought and are lying unused,” said a PGI official. The purpose of the automated attendance system is to enable punctuality at the work place. However, some of the employees at GMCH-32 have doubts about its feasibility. “This is the third time that the system has been adopted. Still, most workers here have not been able to make it a habit to remain punctual,” said a faculty at GMCH-32.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/finally-gmch-32-starts-radio-frequency-identification-attendance/articleshow/87724196.cms||Shimona Kanwar

A bench led by Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla heard a petition by Ghaziabad resident Prince Singh, who was thrown out of the admission process due to a technical glitch. His petition said he scored an all-India rank of 25,894 and scheduled caste rank of 864 in the JEE (Advanced) 2021 exam. He was allotted a seat at IIT-B for civil engineering (4 years, Bachelor of Technology). The last date for paying fees was October 31. Centre’s advocate Rui Rodrigues said the seat allocation process was completely computerised and non-payment implied rejection of the seat offered. In the November 12 order, the bench said, “The petitioner did not register his grievance with regard to his failure to make payment by online mode before 12 noon but registered it after October 31 after 12 noon ie after the entire activity/process was finally closed/shut.” They said by not availing grievance redressal in time, Prince has entailed the consequence of rejection from the process. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-declines-any-relief-to-student-who-lost-iit-seat/articleshow/87725068.cms||---

NDA offers undergraduate training along with a centre of excellence in military training. It is among the top tri-service academies which train cadets of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Upon successful completion of three years of training, graduating cadets are awarded with BA, BSc and B Tech degrees from Jawaharlal Nehru University. The graduating students proceed to respective training centres for further training before joining the armed forces. Numerous candidates, however, withdraw or fail to fulfil the requirements of the academy and are boarded out for not being able to fully satisfy the required criteria for completion in the areas of academics, outdoor training, standards and protocols due to injuries/medical complications post or prior to the course of the training. Such boarded out candidates face numerous challenges in continuing their academics as a result of multiple reasons thus requiring academic rehabilitation which PU will be offering through this MoU. “PU is one of the very few universities in the country to hold such an agreement with the NDA. It is a matter of great honour and pride for us,” said PU president Dr Devanshu Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pu-signs-mou-with-nda-for-dropout-cadets/articleshow/87725082.cms||---

This is perhaps the first time in the country a QR code made out of bamboo has been developed. A QR code is a scannable barcode encoded with data. TOI had in July reported how rakhis and friendship bands made completely out of bamboo by Walke were in demand abroad. After turning into an entrepreneur by preparing at least 50 types of creative bamboo artifacts, she has designed a bamboo QR code. Earlier, such codes have been developed in China. “For people, it may look a simple thing, but for artists like me, it can be a good alternative to QR codes made out of non-eco-friendly plastic. It also reflects traditional skills and values art,” said Walke. Sharing her experience on making the QR code, Walke said, “Our small-time business of selling bamboo articles took a big hit during Covid-19 and family was reeling under financial crisis when a businessman asked us whether a QR code can be made out of bamboo.” “I accepted the challenge. But two months ago, when I started to work on it, I was sceptical whether the technique would work on bamboo or not. I prepared the first model in two days. The model is 15cm high and 8cm wide with a thickness of 5mm. The QR code is easy to handle and durable,” she said. The bamboo QR code by Walke has caught global attention. Susanne Lucas of the World Bamboo Organization said, “It is an excellent innovation. We should move away from plastics as recycling plastic is very energy-dependent and wastes precious water. I will see how she can be supported.” Walke even won accolades from globally known bamboo artist Ivan Platas. “I liked the idea and its results. We are procuring a laser machine soon and will try to make such QR codes,” he told Walke. Walke provides direct and indirect employment to many women in the slum, known as Bengali Camp, in Chandrapur for making bamboo articles. She was conferred the National Nari Shakti Award-2018 for her start-up venture. In 2019, she was also felicitated by Burad community women, who are traditional bamboo craftsmen, for her contribution. In 2021, on World Women’s Day, the Indo-Canadian Art & Culture Society presented her the ‘Woman Hero Award’ virtually. Looking at her bamboo art, Walke was also approached in 2019 by a global beauty pageant contest organizer, requesting her to make beauty crowns for winners. These bamboo crowns were applauded by one and all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapur-homemaker-develops-first-bamboo-qr-code-in-country/articleshow/87724228.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

NU top brass led by vice chancellor (VC) Subhash Chaudhari defended their decision to award first semester exam work to the Pune-based firm without floating tenders, the members told TOI. During the adjourned meeting on Friday, members were shocked when the VC went to the extent of personally guaranteeing MKCL’s performance. Quoting various newspaper reports, the members led by Manmohan Bajpayee then questioned Chaudhari why the university was going out of the way to rope in a company that was blacklisted by his predecessor SP Kane. They expressed surprise that NU was favouring the company that had miserably failed to provide services as per its agreement in the past, leading to embarrassment for NU. Due to MKCL’s failure in pre and post exam works, results were inordinately delayed, and students suffered a lot. They also pointed out that many universities had already blacklisted the company for poor performance. The members further asked the VC to justify why exam work was awarded to MKCL without floating tender as per rules. Members became aggressive and put the administration in an uncomfortable position, where it could not answer their barrage of queries. Finally, the VC declared a two-member panel of Bajpayee and Vishnu Changde to look into MKCL’s earlier dealings and its performance in various universities. Statutory members told TOI that moves to bring back MKCL started after Chaudhari took over as VC and decided to go out of the way to rope in its services for winter 2021 examination of first semester, despite its poor track record. He was also instrumental in releasing its earlier dues of Rs1.37 crore, which were withheld by Kane as the company failed to provide services as per the agreement. “The VC doesn’t listen to anyone. He works as per his whims and fancies. When Promarc has finally settled down now, and saved the university during Covid-19 pandemic by conducting online exams, he is bent on bringing back the blacklisted company. It’s return would once again push NU to the dark times of delayed results,” they warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/members-force-nu-to-form-panel-to-probe-mkcls-earlier-performance/articleshow/87724233.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Police are trying to establish weather the two shooters were carrying mobile phones so that their locations and routes can be traced. Sources in Police said that the two sharp-shooters followed Vicky Middukhera closely for seven days to study his daily routine. They found that he visited the office of the property dealer every other day and that he was generally alone at the time. On August 7, they struck when Middukhera was coming out of the property dealer’s office alone. Mohali police have learned that the sharp-shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil alias Latth alias ‘Khabbu Shooter’ (left-handed shooter) reached Mohali on July 31, seven days prior to the murder of Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera. A senior police officer with the Mohali police said, “We suspect that the killers were made to stay at Purab Premium Apartments by their handlers. The housing society has already attained the tag of being the hub of gangsters. Otherwise also we have started keeping a watch on the housing society.” Sources added that the police is interrogating the two arrested gangsters, Amit Dagar and Kaushal Chaudhary, pressurising them to force Latth to surrender. Despite efforts, Mohali police have failed to arrest the main shooters, Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and Anil alias Latth alias ‘Khabbu Shooter.’ Apart from Rohit ‘Kartoost’ and Vijiya Malhe, four to five more sharp-shooters are yet to be identified. A senior officer in the Mohali police said, “We are very close to the arrest of the gangsters who killed Vicky Middukhera. Main shooters have been identified and the two mediators are also in the police net.” During the face-to-face interrogation of the two gangsters, police learned that Armenia-based Gaurav Padial alias Lucky Padial, handler of the Bambiha gang, gave the contract for Middukhera’s murder. Recently, Mohali police established that the Hyundai i-20 car used in the Middukhera murder was hired by the sharp-shooters from Gurugram. Kaushal-Dagar told the police that the car owner was Tek Chand. Police raided his premises Gurugram but learned that he had escaped after the murder of Middukhera. While tracing the movement of the Hyundai i-20 car, Mohali police reached Gurugram via Ambala, Nahan, Dehradun to Delhi. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are on right trail of the accused and soon they will be arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukheras-killers-may-have-stayed-at-purab-premium-apartments-cops/articleshow/87724223.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Purandare, an eminent history scholar, died on Monday in a Pune hospital of age-related pneumonia. He was 99. His last rites were performed with state honours. For seven decades, Purandare was a ‘Shivshahir’ or bard of Shivaji Maharaj. He trekked to hundreds of forts the Maratha king had conquered, visited every home that could give him original documents, a weapon or anything connected to Shivaji and meticulously preserved every little piece with great love for posterity. History never seemed dull or dry when Purandare took the podium. His powerful oratory brought to life his idol before the audience who always felt as if they were witnessing the life of Shivaji Maharaj unfold before their eyes. Purandare honed his research skills under the guidance of renowned historians G H Khare and Shankarrao Joshi at Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, a place of eminence in history in Pune. He was a poet, an excellent storyteller and narrator, an author, playwright and novelist. His participation in the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation movement made him a freedom fighter too. He celebrated his 99th birthday three months ago. At a felicitation, Purandare said, “One needs to be obsessed with history if one wants to understand it. I love Shivaji Maharaj, but I am not his pujari (priest) or his gulam (slave). I am enamoured with his intellect, his bravery and his wisdom. But most of all, I am in awe of his idea of nation building,” Purandare had then said. Babasaheb took the life of Shivaji Maharaj to common citizens in easy-to-understand but vivid language and did not lose sight of the fact that historical research was a science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bard-of-chhatrapati-shivaji-bows-out/articleshow/87726766.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Crop residue management gathers steam in Kaithal, tea vendor turns entrepreneur||CHANDIGARH: From tea vendor to a CRM (crop residue management) leader, Ram Kumar, a 40-year-old landless farmer from Kaithal’s Rewar Jagir village near Guhla Cheeka, has made an incredible transformation to earn 12 balers, 300 employees, and a season’s income of Rs 45 to 50 lakh. Asked how it started, Ram Kumar said: "I come from a joint family that tilled panchayat land or worked for the big landlords. In 2000, I had a village tea stall. Slowly, I learnt to drive a tractor and, in 2010, bought a second-hand model for packing crop residue into bales and selling it to Jaalkheri village for fuel. When I first saw a baler, I tried to understand its functioning." His first second-hand baler cost him Rs 6 lakh but running it made him some money. Gradually, he was able to buy more balers and other equipment used for the management of crop residue, to turn it into fodder, fuel cakes, and crushed raw material for paper and cardboard industry. Kaithal’s deputy director agriculture Karam Chand, who observed Ram Kumar’s success, said: "He is a pioneer of crop residue management in this district." Chand explained how Ram had started without bailers, rotters, croppers, and all other heavy equipment but built a fleet of those. The officer said: "Ram’s success will inspire the other farmers. We have a team of 14 small farmers who turned CRM entrepreneurs." Noni of Kaithal district, who adopted CRM after watching Ram, described how he was able to make good money out of Happy seeder and other equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crop-residue-management-gathers-steam-in-kaithal-tea-vendor-turns-entrepreneur/articleshow/87725073.cms||Manvir Saini

In both new and existing conditions, knee joints and spine problems were noted. Also, there are no home-based solutions/kits developed for the geriatric population, which could have helped them during lockdown, when OPD services were shut and there was no access to medical services. The study has been published in an international journal and is part of the GoI’s project on bone health of the elderly. Under the study, 105 participants above the age of 60 were sureveyed telephonically. In response, 63.8% said that they were involved in some kind of exercise or fitness-related activity before lockdown. However, this number decreased to 44.8% during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, walking/jogging was the most common form of exercise performed by 53.3% of the survey respondents and during lockdown, this figure decreased to 48.9%. Yoga/meditation was performed by 13.4% of the survey respondents before the lockdown, which increased to 25.5% during the lockdown. The number of participants indulging in other forms of exercise such as cycling and low-impact aerobic exercises, stretching, and strengthening also increased from 37.3% before the lockdown to 46.8% during the lockdown. “Those elders whose medical services were affected during lockdown had significantly worse scores. This highlights the importance of continued access to medical services for the elderly during periods of confinement. We are trying to work on such home-based tools for them,” said Dr Siddhartha Sharma, corresponding author, department of orthopedics, PGI. The study, “Impact of the Covid-19 lockdown and confinement measures on the musculoskeletal health of the urban geriatric population,” has been published in the journal, “Cureus” from the departments of orthopaedics, community medicine and school for public health and department of biostatistics. Box: Lower limbs suffer Majority of the respondents (48.7%) had lower limb problems before the lockdown, of which knee joint problems were the most prevalent (37.3%). Aggravation of pre-existing problems was most frequently noted in the lower limb (62.2%), followed by the spine (28.8%) and the upper limb (8.8%). New-onset problems during the lockdown were noted most frequently in the lower limb (54.3%), followed by the upper limb (26.3%) and the spine (19.2%)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/elderly-suffered-knee-spine-issues-during-lockdown-study/articleshow/87724236.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The mother had filed a habeas corpus (order to produce a person from illegal detention) petition to produce her children from Jaipur. The HC on Saturday sent the children home with their mother who has lived in Mumbai since September, following her remarriage, and asked them to work out an amicable settlement. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar worked through the weekend. The mother’s counsel Rizwan Merchant with Vinta Dandekar and counsel Rafiq Gori, Karan Mertia with Afin Pathan for the father and his parents got back on Sunday with consent terms. The court accepted the terms. Both sides agreed to an arrangement where the children would stay with the mother in Mumbai and the father, as well as their paternal grandparents can meet, have telephonic contact and visitation rights in their mother’s presence. The mother had also alleged that she had been taken to Rajasthan on October 1 by police along with the children and their passports and other documents, on the pretext of a probe into an FIR registered by her ex-in-laws at Amer police station, Jaipur, against her for jewelry theft. The mother claimed the FIR was false. The settlement terms bring closure to the theft case too by consent. The father also returned the children’s Green cards, permanent resident cards of Hong Kong, passports and re-entry permit to the US. The HC noted though the petition is disposed of, “there are serious allegations made against police officers at Gamdevi police station, Mumbai, as well as Amer police station, Jaipur city (north).” The HC called DCP (Zone 2) of Mumbai who informed he would inquire into the allegations and “take stern actions against the officers , if found guilty.” The DCP said he would inform the HC of steps he takes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petition-over-kids-amicably-settled-on-childrens-day/articleshow/87725087.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Asaduddin Owaisi set to launch AIMIM in Rajasthan, contest 2023 elections||JAIPUR: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday announced that he would launch the Rajasthan unit of the party within two months. During his day-long visit to Jaipur, Owaisi told media persons that his party would contest the assembly polls in the state scheduled in 2023. “My party has decided to officially launch a unit here and to appoint local leaders to work with full force. We hope to receive support from across the state,” said Owaisi. Reaffirming the success of his party, he said that the state was subjected to loot and misgovernance by both the Congress and BJP, which has created a scope for a third front. Raising the issue of mistreatment of Muslims here, he said, “The ruling Congress party has stopped all communication with the Muslims. They have not only betrayed the trust of 30-40% of voters but also pushed them to the wall by delaying the core issues concerning them.” Coming down heavily on Muslim Congress MLAs, he said that while 8-9 Muslims make it to the state assembly when Congress wins an election, they were mere ‘showpieces’. tnn “They open their mouths only when they have to yawn,” the AIMIN chief said. This is Owaisi's second visit to Jaipur in the past 50 days and attempt to carve some space for his party in the largely bipolar politics of the state. Owaisi will be travelling to different parts of the state in the coming days to read the pulse of voters. He refused to share the number of seats his party would contest but hinted that it would cover all major seats which have its potential core voters. The AIMIM is believed to be eyeing 30 seats, including 16 where Congress has fielded Muslim candidates. These include Tonk, Kota North, Hawamahal in Jaipur, Laxmangarh in Sikar. He was received by several Congress leaders along with influential Muslims from the state. The state will have assembly polls to its 200 seats in November-December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-set-to-launch-aimim-in-state-contest-23-elections/articleshow/87725857.cms||---

Two more individuals, including a woman, are wanted in the case. Mohammad Raju, the complainant, ran a shoe store at Virar. One of his customers approached Raju and told him that he was looking to exchange American dollars for Indian currency. “As a sample, the accused first offered a 20 USD note to Raju. He verified that it was authentic. The gang then told him that they wished to exchange 16,000 USD into Indian currency,” said a police officer. In return for the Rs 3.5 lakh, the gang offered him a bag in which he only found bundles of plain paper and no American dollars.

---||Delhi||Mannu Bhandari, writer of film Rajnigandha, no more||Hindi litterateur Mannu Bhandari, who penned wildly popular short stories and novels without sacrificing literary merit and who constructed a new and aware modern woman in her works, passed away in a Gurgaon hospital on Monday. She was 90. “She had suffered a series of strokes over the last few years. She was frail but never bedridden. This time she was hospitalized for an infection which turned fatal” her daughter Rachana Yadav, a kathak dancer, told TOI. Notable Hindi film director Basu Chatterjee, with whom she shared a fond and durable association, transformed Bhandari’s long short story, Yehi Sach Hai, into a feature, Rajnigandha (1974). The film was both a critical and a commercial success. Basu da’s Jeena Yahan (1979) was also based on her work, Ekhane Aakash Neyee. Bhandari also wrote the dialogues for Swami (1977), another box-office winner. Her novel, Aap Ka Bunty was made as Samay Ki Dhara (1986), which veered away from the original story and ran into legal trouble. Mahabhoj, a hard-hitting political novel, was numerously staged as a play. Born in Bhanpur, Madhya Pradesh, Bhandari earned her masters at Banaras Hindu University. She also taught at Delhi University and was married to eminent writer-editor Rajendra Yadav who passed away in 2013. Both were pillars of the Nayee Kahani (New Story) movement. Noted writer Mridula Garg said that along with Krishna Sobti and Usha Priyamvada, Bhandari was regarded as the three best and most-talked about Hindi women writers of the 1960s and 70s. “She wrote with spontaneity and great empathy for her characters. Her style was easy going and direct. People identified with her characters,” Garg said One such character was Bunty, the tormented son of a divorced couple, from the novel, Aap Ka Bunty. Writer Pushya Mitra wrote on Facebook how his mother read the novel during her days of pregnancy and gave him his pet name, Bunty. Others shared similar experiences on social media. As Garg added, “She provided the finest example of literary writing which could be popular with common people.” Satyanand Nirupam, editorial director, Rajkamal Prakashan, recalled how he was deeply disturbed by Bhandari’s short story, Sazaa, the story of a man fighting for justice. “Another story, Do Kalakaar, has taken on a fresh meaning in these intolerant times. And after reading the story, Yehi Sach Hai, I started looking at rajnigandha (tuberose) flowers in a different light,” he said. Bhandari’s women are real, plucked from life. They are characters with agency like Deepa, played by Vidya Sinha in Rajnigandha. The story walks the reader through the corridor of her mind as she struggles to choose between two men. But the final decision is her own. There was a tough side to Bhandari as well. Garg narrates an anecdote. “At a seminar once, a member of the audience asked me a vulgar question about my novel, Chitkobra. Mannu-ji, who was on the stage, turned to the man and said, “Please apologise to her. If you haven’t understood the book, please keep quiet, don’t ask such questions…Writers often don’t stand for each other in such situations. But she did.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mannu-bhandari-writer-of-film-rajnigandha-no-more/articleshow/87725106.cms||Avijit Ghosh

Taking a dig at the opposition, Nitish said majority of the population support liquor ban but few people are defaming the state. “They issue statements against me because they know it will get them publicity,” he said. The CM also said his government would launch a special campaign to make people ‘conscious’ about the deadly effect of consuming illicit liquor. Asked about the rise in the incidents of crime recently, Nitish said the figures did not suggest so. “We take action immediately if any incident of crime occurs. At some places, incidents like the Maoist violence have been reported. It is being investigated. It is a different matter but the incidents of general crime and road accidents have come down, especially after the enforcement of liquor ban. Earlier people used to drive vehicles after drinking,” Nitish said after his weekly ‘janata darbar’ programme. Talking about the proposed high-level review meeting on Tuesday, Nitish said all issues related to prohibition and the shortcomings in its enforcement would be discussed. He said all cabinet ministers, who are in-charge of districts, and all senior officers would be present at the meeting. All district magistrates and the SPs would also be connected to the meeting through videoconferencing. “We will discuss everything related to liquor ban and analyse where we are lacking in its implementation. We will take further decisions accordingly,” he said. “Liquor is a bad thing … We will launch a renewed special propaganda to tell people how the consumption of liquor is dangerous for them,” he said. Earlier, the CM heard the grievances of altogether 121 people at his janata darbar and issued necessary instructions to the officials of the departments concerned for earlier resolution of their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/crime-road-accidents-down-after-liquor-prohibition-cm/articleshow/87724255.cms||Madan Kumar

While the transport department has received close to 20,000 applications, it wants more women drivers to come forward to fill the 33 per cent reserved slots. The online scheme was launched in October for the registration of 4,261 e-autos, out of which 1,406 are reserved for women. The initial last date was November 1, which was extended to November 15. Out of the 19,885 applicants, 19,187 are men and 698 women. “We thought of filling the slots with general category applications, but noticed in the past one month that more and more women were applying and coming forward with enquiries,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. “Unless we stick to our mandate, we will always end up making excuses to not let women be active participants.” More than 1,400 women driving autos will mean lakhs of women feeling safer, he said. “We are also in talks with NGOs to train more women.” Women with a valid driving licence for light motor vehicles or three-seater autos can apply if they have an Aadhaar card with Delhi address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-time-to-women-drivers-for-e-auto-registration/articleshow/87725120.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds lower court’s order in Vashi hotel owner’s son case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday upheld a magistrate’s court order directing Rohan Abbott, 32, to surrender in 10 days before it, as police invoked a graver offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder after his release on bail in a case where two sons of a police officer were killed in crash in Vashi on February 7. The accused, allegedly driving at high speed, crashed into a motorbike near a hotel at Palm Beach road, dragging the motorist and flinging the pillion rider. He fled the spot, surrendering himself later next day when he was granted bail. Justice Sandeep Shinde said the magistrate’s order of March 26 requires no interference. The HC continued a stay on it for three more weeks since April 5, to enable Abbot to appeal before the Supreme Court. The accused through his lawyers Aniesh Jadhav and Veerdhawal Deshmukh said the FIR was for bailable offence of death due to rash driving under section 304 (A) of the IPC and other offences and also under Motor Vehicles Act. He was released on bail on February 8, on a bail bond of Rs 15,000. The magistrate had also declined a police plea for cancellation of bail after it had on February 13, invoked the non-bailable offence of culpable homicide, which stipulates up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The magistrate’s court had also declined a police custody plea but directed Abbot to surrender before it and apply for bail for the newly added offences. Failure to surrender would entitle investigating officer to seek his arrest, the magistrate had ordered. Aggrieved, he approached the HC, saying the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain the police plea once he was out on bail. Prosecutor Sharmila Deshmukh and counsel Abha Singh for the brother of victims Akshay Gamare (29) and Sanket (24), opposed his plea. Singh cited an SC ruling to argue that the magistrate was empowered to order his surrender and apply for bail after a new non-bailable offence is added to a case, without cancelling the earlier bail. The HC agreed with the submission and said “petition is dismissed and disposed of”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-upholds-lower-courts-order-in-vashi-hotel-owners-son-case/articleshow/87725125.cms||Swati Deshpande

It is an emotional moment for me personally,” Modi said in his virtual address after inaugurating the museum. Politics was not far away as Modi also said the museum was a befitting tribute to late former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who set up the Union ministry of tribal affairs. “It was due to his determination that Jharkhand came into existence.” While BJP functionaries chanted “Modi, Modi” from the audience, their Jharkhand Mukti Morcha counterparts matched the decibels by chanting “Shibu Soren Zindabad” and “Hemant Soren Zindabad”. The museum has been built in a restored 200-year-old Ranchi Central Jail where Birsa died in British captivity in 1900. A sum of Rs 25 crore was given by the Centre for construction of the museum while the state government made the rest of expenses for restoration of the old jail, construction of boundary wall, landscaping and park. Besides Birsa, the museum showcases the life and works of other prominent tribal freedom fighters from the state. “In every phase of India’s freedom struggle, tribal revolutionaries have risen up in rebellion against the British for their rights. The Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas, which will be celebrated every year from now on, is a tribute to those brave men and women,” Modi said. The PM also compared Birsa with Mahatma Gandhi. Hailing the museum as a place of pilgrimage, Modi spoke richly about other tribal revolutionaries from Jharkhand such as Sidho-Kanho, Poto Ho, Jatra Tana Bhagat, Telanga Khariya and their contribution to the freedom struggle. “While Ranchi is the first museum, nine upcoming museums in Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Mizoram and Goa will preserve the tale of the heroics of the country’s tribal revolutionaries for future generations,” he added. Modi spoke Mundari in between his speech and hailed Munda as “Bhagwan”, terming him as a source of inspiration behind India’s efforts towards environment conservation and the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. While Modi inaugurated the program virtually, chief minister Hemant Soren, governor Ramesh Bais, Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda, Union tourism and culture minister G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state Annapurna Devi, state tribal affairs minister Champai Soren, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Ranchi MLA CP Singh and Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra attended the function at the Memorial Park complex. Soren termed the day as historic. “We are standing in a hallowed ground as this is the place where Dharti Aba (Birsa) breathed his last. This project came together with the collaboration of the Centre and the state government,” he said. Emphasizing that Jharkhand’s history deserves special mention, he said: “Long before the country started dreaming of Independence, the tribal people here crossed blades with the British to win their rights and preserve their Jal, Jangal and Zameen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/modi-dedicates-birsa-munda-museum-to-the-nation-terms-it-an-emotional-moment/articleshow/87724305.cms||Dhritiman Ray
