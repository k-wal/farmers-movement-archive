---||World||UN, UK vow to push youth climate demands at COP26 summit||GLASGOW: Young people took centre-stage at the COP26 UN climate talks on Friday, presenting their demands for a greener, fairer world to the UN climate chief and senior UK politicians who promised to recommend their proposals to governments at the summit. Outside the formal talks, thousands of banner-hefting climate activists, including large numbers of schoolchildren, streamed through the streets of Glasgow in the biggest public protest since the start of the negotiations. "Leaders aren't listening. If they were they'd actually do something instead of just talking," said 10-year-old Eve Learmonth, a south Glasgow primary school student who toted a sign reading, "The dinosaurs thought they had time too". Around her, classmates chanted, "We're not going to school, we want to keep our planet cool!" At a lively event on "Youth Day" inside the talks, members of the formal UN youth grouping outlined policies crafted by more than 40,000 young climate leaders from across the world. Those sought a future based on clean energy, protection of nature and support for those hit hardest by climate change impacts. "Our overarching demand ... is that the youth should be actively and meaningfully included in all decision-making processes concerning climate change governance and implementation," said a "Global Youth Statement" endorsed at a conference in Glasgow last week. Marie-Claire Graf, 25, a leader of the youth constituency of the UN climate secretariat and a formal member of Switzerland’s negotiating team at the last COP meeting in 2019, said more young people were winning negotiating roles. Panama’s delegation at COP26, for instance, has an average age of 27 – and more than half of the negotiators are women, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "We’re getting there, breaking down some mistrust," Graf said. “We see more and more delegations including young people.” But climate change impacts are also accelerating, she added, creating worry that policy shifts are coming "not fast enough". Jan Kairel Guillermo of the Philippines, who said he had survived the world's strongest typhoon eight years ago, described the 78-page youth statement as more than "just demands". "It is the effort and earnest attempt made by young adults to use their voice as a force for good," he told the event, adding thousands of young people had come together to produce it, aligning their ideas with scientific guidance. The asks outlined in the document included clean energy for all, more climate finance for vulnerable countries, new ways to tackle the "loss and damage" caused by extreme weather and rising seas, access to safe water and a carbon labelling standard for consumer products. Clara von Glasow of Germany told politicians in the room that "we still trust you... because we need to". "You have the power to make youth and our demands the priority," she said, calling for "real commitments" at COP26. "If you don't take this seriously and step up your game, you’re not only failing us, you’re also failing yourselves and your children and grandchildren," she added. In response, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa pledged to "make sure that your proposals, your demands are considered" by negotiators in Glasgow. "We need you more than you need us," she added. "The transformation that we need to see cannot happen if we do not work all together." Britain's COP26 president, Alok Sharma, and its chief negotiator Archie Young vowed to work with young people at the talks to persuade ministers to take stronger climate action and incorporate youth proposals in the final Glasgow outcome. Empty comprisesOutside the talks, a huge march organised by Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement ended in central Glasgow's George Square with young people saying they were counting on action as well as pledges to emerge from the talks. "It's scary that it's got to the point that we have to do this," said Scarlet Kinnear-McMahon, 16, who carried a sign sporting an oversize purple thistle – a national emblem of Scotland - and the words, "Thistle be the end if we don't act now." The Glasgow high school student said the arrival of world leaders to the climate talks in private jets and cars didn't give her much faith they were prepared to act on climate change besides talking about it. "I want to see real changes in our society rather than a lot of empty promises, which is what it feels like right now," she said. Luna Leuven, 14, who had made a 17-hour trip by bus and train to the talks from Belgium with 200 other young activists, said she was marching on behalf of the world's poorest, who were already suffering the worst effects of a shifting climate. "What hurts me and motivates me is the people who don't hurt the climate, yet suffer the biggest impacts," she said, wearing a red shirt with "Change is coming" emblazoned on it. Ruth Ewan, 40, a parent of one of the primary school students protesting, said many of them "get quite anxious" hearing about the risks from a heating planet, with some "feeling they're doomed". But Ewan said she was encouraged that, among older children, "a whole generation has been moved and politicized by this" growing worry about climate change. "I have confidence in people power and democracy" to drive change, she said, as her dog Dora - sporting a cardboard sign reading, "Paws climate change 4 good" - nosed for scraps nearby. After reaching George Square, a lineup of young marchers, many indigenous or from developing countries, gave speeches as a large contingent of police, on foot and on horseback, kept watch and a helicopter circled overhead. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, praised the youth activists protesting in the streets. "It's definitely not blah blah blah outside," she said, contrasting the urgency of the activists with slow progress at COP26. Youth protests are having an impact on the talks, she added, with activist Greta Thunberg storming out of a meeting Wednesday on how companies can invest in planting trees and other measures to offset industrial emissions, calling it "greenwashing". Morgan said corporate leaders at the event were visibly uncomfortable at her departure. In a nod toward youth demands, more than 23 countries - including South Korea, Albania, Sierra Leone and Britain - put forward national pledges on greening education on Friday. Those ranged from decarbonising schools to putting climate change at the heart of their curriculums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/un-uk-vow-to-push-youth-climate-demands-at-cop26-summit/articleshow/87544820.cms||---

"Despite progress in worldwide vaccination, we are not where we need to be," Blinken said in a statement announcing the meeting on Nov. 10. It follows a virtual summit of world leaders President Joe Biden convened on September 22, when he pledged to buy 500 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses to donate to other countries. The United States, where people are being offered booster vaccine shots ahead of winter, has been under pressure to share more of its vaccine supply with the rest of the world. "We will discuss efforts to accelerate toward vaccine equity and impact," Blinken said of the foreign ministers' summit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-convene-foreign-ministers-on-covid-19-next-week-pledges-to-talk-vaccine-equity/articleshow/87545229.cms||---
---||India||New China law has made LAC negotiations tougher: Shyam Saran||NEW DELHI: With 62 clauses in seven chapters, China’s new boundary law passed on October 23 has raised concerns in India and could make it very difficult to conduct boundary negotiations, former foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said. “The room for coming to an understanding and resolving the border issue will become somewhat more complicated than it already is,” he told TOI. He said the law is a formalisation of the Chinese government policy in managing its borders for the last several years. “It gives a sort of legal basis on which things to do like setting up of border villages, which some people have called “dual-use” villages, but you may have seen reports that actually fairly substantial villages have been set up in territory which is claimed by Nepal, or Bhutan and even in the eastern sector in India.” Read AlsoPentagon report: China trying to push territorial claim with IndiaWASHINGTON: China has continued "taking incremental and tactical actions" to press its claims at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and has unsuccessfully sought to prevent New Delhi from deepening its relationship with the United States, the Pentagon has said in a report. “The PRCThe law underlines, “The PRC’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and inviolable and the state shall take measures to safeguard them.” Saran says “when you pose the issue in those terms, it diminishes the space for compromise. If you consider your claim as actually part of your sovereign territory, then it becomes much more difficult to find a compromise. We saw this with respect to Galwan. When differences arose, they said Galwan is Chinese sovereign territory, which means that there is no room for compromise”. One of the more concerning issues in the boundary law is the “permission” to these border villages to use all methods of defence, including combat, essentially turning them into militia groups, somewhat like the Chinese fishing fleets. Saran said, “See the Chinese Coast Guard, which is a more of a paramilitary force… If you see the recent Coast Guard law, you will see they have been given the authority to use lethal force to safeguard Chinese interests, essentially making the Coast Guard an arm of the PLA.” According to the new law, he said, the “border guarding forces”, the PLA and the people’s armed police, will be expected to work with the village and provincial authorities for defence activities. “That means it’s almost like a whole of society approach to safeguarding your borders. So, I think the fact that you have this law, we should expect more activism on the India-China border.” Read AlsoChina taking incremental, tactical actions to press claims along frontier with India: PentagonNEW DELHI: The US says China has been undertaking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” along the frontier with India, with its military also gaining “valuable real-world operational and tactical experience” due to the “acute tensions and clashes” in eastern Ladakh since May last“There has been a diplomatic response by the ministry of external affairs. So, that puts the record straight. As far as the situation on the ground is concerned, currently, there is no option but to hold the line — we simply do not have the capability of actually going about violently seeking the vacation of territory, which is ours and has been infringed upon by them. The only thing that you can do is to make certain that further ingress is not possible,” said Saran. But in the longer term, India can think of pushing the envelope, he suggests, as it did in south Pangong Tso. “There are large parts of the border where we are in a better position. Is it possible that whenever there is some provocation like this, we have the ability to instantly create an ingress on the other side, so that you have something to bargain with? It requires restructuring of some of your border forces capability to be almost commando-like.” Otherwise, this situation, he believes, is likely to continue because it is very low risk for Beijing and keeps India stretched, off-balance and spending a lot more on defence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-china-law-has-made-lac-negotiations-tougher-shyam-saran/articleshow/87545417.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||India||22 states, UTs have lowered VAT on fuel, says oil ministry||NEW DELHI: As politics over fuel prices bubbles and boils, the oil ministry on Friday said that 22 states and UTs have lowered VAT on petrol and diesel after the Centre slashed excise duty on Wednesday. The Centre noted that 14 states, including major opposition-ruled ones like Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, are among those that are yet to lower their levies. Government data showed that since the Centre reduced excise duty, Leh had seen the sharpest reduction in petrol (Rs 13.43 a litre) and diesel (Rs 19.61 a litre) prices. Among the bigger cities, Bangalore topped the list with petrol and diesel prices falling by Rs 13.35 and Rs 19.49 a litre. The government statement came as several opposition-ruled states ruled out an immediate cut, while Odisha decided to lower VAT by Rs 3 a litre from Friday midnight. Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday announced a 4% cut in VAT and slashed cess too. The cuts brought down petrol price to Rs 107.21 per litre and diesel to Rs 90.86 in Bhopal. Faced with BJP charging that they were refusing to do what they had wanted the Centre to do, Kerala was the most upfront in ruling out a reduction. “There is no logic behind the demand that Kerala should forgo the tax share. The Centre collects more tax per litre of fuel than the state. It’s wrong to say there was no additional price reduction in Kerala. When the Centre slashed diesel and petrol prices by Rs 10 and Rs 5, the effective reduction in Kerala is Rs 12.30 and Rs 6.56 respectively. The additional reduction is the Kerala’s contribution,” Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal said. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party is part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, suggested that the Centre should release GST compensation to states to enable them to reduce VAT. His comments came after the state indicated that it was not going for a reduction immediately. Chattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel demanded UPA-era levies on fuel and sought copies of the notification from BJP states, when asked about the state’s plan to lower VAT. Congress, which is in the opposition in Delhi and Kerala, demanded reduction in VAT by the AAP and Left Front governments. In any case, after the Centre reduced the Union excise duty, BJP leaders have been pushing opposition ruled states to cut VAT. “If the Centre and BJP states can give relief to people, why not the Congress states,” BJP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/22-states-uts-have-lowered-vat-on-fuel-says-oil-ministry/articleshow/87545581.cms||---

He scored, set up goals and won the award for the highest number of assists. Unlike the other foreigners at FC Goa, Noguera did not have a regular spot in the team, yet his presence did not pollute the dressing room atmosphere. Even when he was left out of the AFC Champions League squad, the Spanish attacking midfielder accepted coach Juan Ferrando’s decision. This season, Noguera wanted to do better with Goa, not just on the field, but beyond too. He cut short his holiday – too long, he said – kept himself fit, and more importantly, brushed up on his English skills for effective communication. “I took lessons and tried to improve,” Noguera told TOI, speaking in English, unlike last season when he used an interpreter and spoke in Spanish. “It’s true I cannot express and say all that I want in English, but I wanted to do better. I want to speak with my teammates and all the guys here (at FC Goa). I want to spend more time speaking with Indians, and for that, I had to improve my language skills.” Noguera, 32, was the first foreign player to land here for pre-season. While Ferrando started preparations early to have a closer look at the younger players in the squad, the experienced Spaniard couldn’t stay away. “I wanted to train with the team and be with my teammates. I had taken the vaccine and enjoyed my holidays, so when training started, I asked coach if I could join. He was happy. I am not used to such a long holiday,” said Noguera, who made his senior team debut for Atletico Madrid in 2012. During the unusually long break – Indian Super League (ISL) ended in middle of March – Noguera spent time with his friends and family. Then he tried his hand at golf. But without football, and his teammates around him, he was soon bored. “I tried to disconnect but couldn’t stay away for too long,” he said. Once he landed here, it was time to prepare for the season, starting with the Durand Cup in Kolkata which Goa, as expected, won. “The Durand Cup was good for us. Winning a trophy is always good for the team, the city and, of course, the club. It does the players’ mentality a world of good. We are happy. Our mentality was to prepare well for the season and the trophy now helps push ourselves in the ISL,” said Noguera. Noguera had an influential role to play in the team’s Durand Cup triumph and is now looking for something similar in the ISL, which kicks off later this month. “You cannot play every game, and the coach cannot field 20 players. So every time the coach needs me, I’ll be there for him, the team and the club. I think I did well last season. I gave my best in training and was available whenever needed. I don’t want to think too much whether I could have played more (last season). “FC Goa have an unbeaten record to protect in the ISL and we will give 100 percent to do that. Our mentality is to win every game. We are improving a lot. My personal goal is to push myself a little more in every training session, every game,” said Noguera. FC Goa will open their campaign against defending champions Mumbai City on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/whenever-needed-ill-be-there-for-the-coach-team-alberto-noguera/articleshow/87545760.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Lloyd Cardozo (14th minute) and Rohit Totad (26’) gave Sporting Clube a 2-0 lead before strikes from Macarton Nickson (31’), Robin Yadav (34’) and Edwin Rossario (38’) saw Bengaluru claim all the points. Sporting Clube took the lead as Lloyd slotted home after being allowed space outside the box. Looking to respond, Bengaluru pushed forward but met a stubborn Ozen Silva in the Goa goal. Six minutes into the second half, Rohit scored the second goal for Sporting, poking Robin’s header over Baliyan before the Blues’ goalkeeper could get a hand to it. Bengaluru pulled one back just past the hour mark when Bekey’s clipped pass found Macarton, who was able to take a touch and slot home from close range past the goalkeeper to make it 2-1. Moments later, captain Robin dispossessed a Sporting player before slotting home once again to make it 2-2. With just two minutes left to play, Bengaluru pressure paid off as Macarton’s pass to Edwin saw the Blues’ attacker take a touch and slot home for all the points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sporting-clube-lose-after-taking-two-goal-lead-against-bengaluru-fc-in-futsal-club-championship/articleshow/87545789.cms||---
---||Business||Ambanis have no plan to relocate to London: RIL||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday issued a statement clarifying that chairman Mukesh Ambani and his family have “no plans whatsoever to relocate or reside in London or anywhere else in the world”. This followed media reports that Asia’s richest man and his family members were going to divide time between India and the UK. A recent report had suggested that the Ambanis were sprucing up their newly-acquired 300-acre property in Stoke Park, London, complete with a medical facility, and were expected to make it their primary residence. "RIL group company, RIHL, which acquired Stoke Park estate recently, would like to clarify that its acquisition of the heritage property is aimed at enhancing this as a premier golfing and sporting resort, while fully complying with the planning guidelines and local regulations. This acquisition will add to the fast-growing consumer business of the group. Simultaneously, it will also expand the footprint of India’s hospitality industry globally,” RIL, India’s largest company in terms of market value, said in a statement. It added that reports of the Ambani family planning to partly reside in Stoke Park has led to “unwarranted and baseless speculation in social media”. This followed a report that the family would divide time between Antilla, their 27-storied property in South Mumbai, and the estate purchased by a subsidiary of RIL in the UK for 57 million pounds (Rs 592 crore) in April. The newspaper report had said this is the first time the Ambanis were not celebrating Diwali in Mumbai and that the UK estate included a mandir, for which a Rajasthan sculptor had been roped in. Besides, it had said that a state-of-the-art medical facility had been set up, with doctors from Mumbai visiting the 300-acre Stoke Park to put it in place. There have been reports that since the Covid-19 outbreak, Ambani and his family members have spent a large part of their time between Jamnagar, where RIL has a massive refinery and petrochemicals facility, Mumbai and London. Ambani had addressed RIL shareholders during the company’s annual general meeting in June this year from Jamnagar in Gujarat. After RIL bought Stoke Park, the chairman and his family’s London visits have been linked to them making Stoke Park their second abode. RIL, however, did not comment on Ambanis’ reported frequent visits overseas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ambanis-have-no-plan-to-relocate-to-london-ril/articleshow/87545778.cms||---

Sidhu attacked his own party’s “90-day government”, led by Charanjit Singh Channi, over progress made on two key issues — sacrilege and drugs. He also questioned the delay in making public the STF report on drugs. Sidhu had resigned as PPCC chief on September 28, objecting to the Channi government appointing APS Deol as AG and Iqbal Singh Sahota as DGP. Questioning the alleged delay in making the STF’s report public, Sidhu said, “When the CM was replaced, this was a key issue. It’s been 44-50 days, who stops you? What interest has the present government shown in getting justice on the sacrilege issue and making the STF report public? If you don’t have the courage to make the STF report public, give it to me, the party, and I will do it. The high command has no objection, it was a part of AICC’s agenda for Punjab,” he said. Sidhu said that the DGP issue was supposed to have been settled in a week’s time “more than a month ago”. “But two panels later, it is still lingering. It is a government of 90 days and 50 days have passed. What is going on,” Sidhu said. “I have taken back my resignation,” he said, adding, “It was not any personal ego, it was the question of party worker’s honour”. “When the police case of sacrilege in Bargari was registered in 2015, Saini picked his blue-eyed boy, Iqbal Singh Sahota, to head the SIT. Then, sitting with the then deputy CM, Sukhbir Singh Badal, Sahota gave a clean chit. That blue-eyed boy then becomes DGP of Punjab. That is the big question… Are these the only officers you could find,” he said. He added that the lawyer who got blanket bail for Saini and told the courts that there was no faith in the Congress government had been advocate general. Sidhu also sought to remind the present Congress government of its claims on the sacrilege issue over the last four years that they did not have faith that the issues would be addressed under former CM Amarinder’s leadership. “I have been reminding Channi about these issues. Who was the torchbearer in exposing the drugs and sacrilege issue? It was Rahul Gandhi,” he said. “It is not my personal fight. It was the demand of the party. The day these two are removed, every worker will turn into your star campaigner in every street. That is the spirit it will infuse in him. Otherwise, how will we face the voters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-takes-back-resignation-but-with-a-rider/articleshow/87545937.cms||Vibhor Mohan

The man, whose lifeless body was recovered on October 19 on the pavement by police, had apparently fallen to his death from the embassy complex, according to the Spiegel weekly which first reported the case. A German foreign ministry spokesman said the case was "known to the ministry" but would not provide further details. Confirming the death, the Russian embassy called it a "tragic accident". "All the procedures related to repatriating the diplomat's body back to the homeland were promptly settled with responsible German law-enforcement and medical authorities in accordance with current practices," said the embassy in a statement. Russia's mission however said it "considers speculations which have appeared in a number of Western media" over the diplomat's death "to be absolutely incorrect". The diplomat was identified as a 35-year-old second secretary at the embassy by Spiegel. But the magazine said German authorities believe he was also an agent of the Russian secret service FSB. He is also reportedly related to a high-ranking official of the FSB's second directorate -- a unit that Western secret services say was involved in the killing of a Georgian national in central Berlin in 2019. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, the 40-year-old Georgian, was shot twice in the head at close range in Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019, allegedly by a Russian man who was arrested shortly afterwards. The Russian suspect, 55-year-old Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, is on trial over the murder, which German prosecutors say was ordered by Moscow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/russian-diplomat-found-dead-outside-embassy-in-berlin/articleshow/87545981.cms||---
---||Business||Directors can’t be booked just because firm violated law: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked investigating and prosecuting agencies not to proceed mechanically against directors of erring companies merely because of the post held and said such avoidable prosecution leads to humiliation and loss of reputation in the society. Quashing prosecution and summons issued to a director of a company which allegedly failed to pay minimum wages to some workmen, a bench of Justices R S Reddy and Sanjiv Khanna said, “A person cannot be prosecuted and punished merely because of their status or position as a director, manager, secretary or any other officer, in a company unless the offence in question was committed with their consent or connivance or is attributable to any neglect on their part.” The important clarification will offer relief to persons holding these positions. Section 22C of the Minimum Wages Act provided that “if the person committing any offence under this Act is a company, every person who at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly”. It said the exact role of the officer proceeded against must be delineated by the prosecution. The SC said vicarious liability would be attracted only when the offence was committed with the consent, connivance, or is attributable to the neglect on the part of a director, manager, secretary, or other officer of the company and not merely because the person holds a responsible post in the company. Justices Reddy and Khanna said that arresting directors and officers of a company, without them having even any remote role in the perpetration of the alleged violation of law by the company, is fraught with serious consequences and must be avoided at all costs. “Initiation of prosecution and summoning of an accused to stand trial has serious consequences. They extend from monetary loss to humiliation and disrepute in society, sacrifice of time and effort to prepare defence and anxiety of uncertain times. Criminal law should not be set into motion as a matter of course or without adequate and necessary investigation of facts on mere suspicion, or when the violation of law is doubtful,” the bench said. “It is the duty and responsibility of the public officer to proceed responsibly and ascertain the true and correct facts. Execution of law without appropriate acquaintance with legal provisions and comprehensive sense of their application may result in an innocent being prosecuted,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/directors-cant-be-booked-just-because-firm-violated-law-sc/articleshow/87546083.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

While a formal response to India's invite is still awaited from China and Pakistan, official sources said there had been an "overwhelming response" to India's initiative with Russia, Iran and for the first time all central Asian countries, including the ones which don't share a boundary with Afghanistan, confirming participation. Official sources also slammed Pakistan for indicating it won't attend the in-person conference that will be chaired by NSA Ajit Doval and said the recent remarks by Islamabad, including the one by Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf in which he described India as a spoiler, were an unsuccessful attempt to deflect attention from its pernicious role in Afghanistan. Read AlsoPak decision to not attend dialogue on Afghanistan unfortunate but not surprising: SourcesNew Delhi, Pakistan's decision to not attend a regional security dialogue on the Afghan crisis, being hosted by India on November 10, is unfortunate but not surprising and it reflected Islamabad's mindset of viewing Afghanistan as its "protectorate", official sources said on Friday."Pakistan has indicated through the media that it will not attend. Pakistan’s decision is unfortunate, but not surprising. It reflects its mindset of viewing Afghanistan as its protectorate," said a government source on Islamabad's refusal to participate, adding Pakistan had not attended the previous meetings of the format. Russian NSA Nikolay Patrushev's participation is of particular significance for India because of Moscow's leading role in formulating an international response to the situation in Afghanistan. The government sees the "enthusiastic" high-level participation in the conference, which was first reported by TOI on October 16, as a manifestation of the importance attached to India’s role in regional efforts to promote peace and security in Afghanistan. Read AlsoIndia to host NSA-level meeting on Afghanistan on Nov 10India will host the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan in New Delhi on November 10. According to sources, the NSA-level meeting will be chaired by Ajit Doval. Two earlier meetings in this format have been held in Iran in September 2018 and December 2019. The third meeting in India couldChina though has been quiet on the issue it seems unlikely at this stage that it will even join the conference virtually. Pakistan's reluctance to participate in the conference also doesn't bode well for India's proposal to deliver 50,000 MT wheat to Afghanistan through the land route via the Wagah-Attari border. Islamabad is yet to accede to the proposal. "The high-level participation in next week’s meeting hosted by India reflects the widespread and growing concern of regional countries about the situation in Afghanistan and their desire to consult and coordinate with each other. India has an important role to play in this process," said a government source. Two earlier meetings of the NSA-level security dialogue were held in Iran in September, 2018 and December, 2019. As TOI had reported last month, the conference in India was scheduled for May this year but the deadly second Covid-19 wave put paid to the plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-nsa-level-afghanistan-meet-on-nov-10-pak-stance-slammed/articleshow/87546133.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||Patna||Hooch deaths: Opposition, NDA netas in war of words||PATNA: While the opposition parties on Friday slammed the state government over death of 26 people in West Champaran and Gopalganj districts since Wednesday due to alleged hooch consumption, the ruling NDA reiterated the government’s resolve to enforce the prohibition law more effectively in the state. Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav alleged the toll was higher and the bodies were disposed of without postmortem. Tejashwi hit out at CM Nitish Kumar through a series of tweets and alleged the ministers and police had distributed liquor among the voters in the recently concluded byelection. Tejashwi also raised question over the failure of the administration in arresting revenue minister Ram Surat Rai’s brother from whose school liquor bottles were earlier seized. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the hooch deaths once again proved that the government’s prohibition policy was a total failure. “This law needs to be reviewed properly,” he said. Party’s state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said the police were arresting small fish while the liquor mafias were running a parallel economy. The CPI-ML will hold protests across the state on Saturday and Sunday demanding resignation of prohibition, excise and registration department minister Sunil Kumar. Meanwhile, ministers and senior NDA leaders said the opposition was making a fuss only to derive political mileage.

Talking to the media on the sidelines of the third foundation day celebration of his party on Thursday, Sahani said he had campaigned in favour of the JD(U) candidates as the VIP is a part of the NDA in the state, but admitted that he used to talk to RJD chief Lalu Prasad also, off and on. “I couldn’t see him during his recent visit to Patna. But I never hesitate to call him when needed,” he said. He, however, took a jibe at the RJD first family saying, “Yah pariwar ab pravasi ho gaya hai (this family has become non-resident).” In reply to a query, Sahani said, “Even on Diwali, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is being projected as his party’s chief ministerial candidate, remained out of Bihar. What can one expect from such a politician?” Responding to another question, the minister said he wished to become the chief minister after the retirement of Nitish from politics. “A minister always wants to become chief minister. Why not me if given the opportunity?” he asked. He said it would be a matter of pride for the entire fishermen community if he was chosen to serve the coveted post. He reiterated that his party would contest 165 seats in the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. “Around 50,000 statues of former MP Phoolan Devi were being distributed among the members of the fishermen community in UP,” he added. VIP national spokesperson Dev Jyoti said the party’s foundation day was celebrated in a traditional way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/want-to-become-cm-after-nitish-sahani/articleshow/87544612.cms||Ramashankar

The mature behaviour of the electorate of both the constituencies clearly showed that development remained the main agenda of elections till last. This time, the attitude of the electorate from the minority communities also showed a remarkable change, sending a very clear message of far-reaching effect,” the minister told this newspaper. Chaudhary maintained that the electorates remained vigilant right from the beginning and made a sharp distinction between emotional exploiters and real well-wishers. “It has become crystal clear that the electorate would now refrain from negative voting and vote for only parties or candidates interested in peace and development,” the minister added. While Aman Bhushan Hajari of JD(U) defeated RJD’s Ganesh Bharti in Kusheshwar Asthan reserved seat, JD(U)’s Rajeev Kumar Singh defeated RJD’s Arun Kumar in the Tarapur seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-now-vote-for-development-only/articleshow/87544663.cms||B K Mishra

He deposited Rs10,000 fine as directed by the court while pronouncing the sentence. Alam was convicted under Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) IPC, which has a maximum seven years’ imprisonment. Six persons died and 89 were injured in the serial blasts. Besides Ifteqaar, the NIA court had sentenced Haider Ali alias Black Beauty, Numan Ansari, Mujibullah Ansari and Imtiyaz Ansari to capital punishment, Umer Siddique and Azharuddin Qureshi to life imprisonment and Ahmad Hussain and Mohammad Feroz Aslam to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment on November 1. Ifteqaar’s counsel Syed Imran Ghani said he was in judicial custody since June 11, 2014. “He was in jail for more than seven years and one month, which is more than the period of jail term awarded by the court. He paid the fine after which jail authorities set him free,” he said. Ghani said Ifteqaar was a native of Sithiyo in Dhurva, Ranchi, and his father and father-in-law had reached Patna to take him. “Even though he is set free, I have suggested him to challenge his conviction and sentencing before the Patna high court,” he said. Ghani said the two convicts who have been sentenced to ten years’ RI are also expected to be set free in the next two years as they too remained behind bars while facing the trial. A prison authority said Ifteqaar’s counsel cited reason that he doesn’t need to pay the fine as he has also served one additional month imprisonment in addition to seven years’ sentence. “However, the court had put condition that in case of non-payment of fine, the convict will undergo one-month additional imprisonment,” he said. The officer said they cited the amendments to Section 428 of CrPC which makes it mandatory for a convict to serve jail term against fine in case their sentence has been covered by remaining behind bars during trial. “They filed a petition in the NIA court against jail authorities for not releasing him. The court was apprised about the amendments after which it ordered that Ifteqaar will have to pay fine or undergo one month’s imprisonment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gandhi-maidan-serial-blasts-convict-set-free/articleshow/87544681.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Elections to municipalities and Nellore Municipal Corporation would be held on November 15. The counting of votes would be held on November 17. Elections for panchayats, mandal (MPTC) and zilla (ZPTC) parishads, which fell vacant after the recent elections, are also being held on November 16. Among the municipalities, the focus is on Kuppam which is the home constituency of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu. Both the TDP and the YSR Congress have taken this election as a prestige issue with the TDP trying to show its strength and the YSR Congress working to win the civic body. The TDP suffered a resounding defeat in the panchayat and municipal elections, which were held earlier this year. However, alleging poll irregularities by the ruling YSR Congress, the TDP boycotted the mandal and zilla parishad elections. This time, too, while contesting the civic body elections, the TDP alleged the ruling party had resorted to irregularities, including violence. Besides holding elections to these local bodies, the State Election Commission (SEC) is conducting by-elections in 54 divisions in municipalities and 353 wards in municipal corporations. These are spread over seven municipal corporations and 13 municipalities where elections were either not held or the candidates died. Similarly, elections to the wards in gram panchayats and MPTCs and ZPTCs are also being held along with the municipalities. However, polling for these rural local bodies would be held on November 16 and counting of votes on November 18. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu has written to the SEC, alleging that the party’s candidate for the 14th ward in Kuppam municipality, Dr V Venkatesh, was threatened by supporters of the ruling party, who allegedly tore the nomination papers of the TDP candidate. The TDP chief alleged that YSR Congress leader Muniswamy and his supporters prevented Dr Venkatesh from filing his nomination papers. He said the TDP candidate was beaten up in front of the local MFC Junior College, where returning officers were present. The TDP leader appealed to the SEC to provide security to the opposition candidates in the local body elections and ensure free and fair elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nominations-close-for-local-body-elections/articleshow/87544656.cms||Gopi Dara

These blocks have inoculated less than 50% of the beneficiaries with the first dose. The state has so far partially vaccinated 68.4% of its eligible population. At a review meeting, additional chief secretary of health department, Pratyaya Amrit, found 15 blocks lax in Covid vaccination. These blocks are Hasanpura and Goriakothi in Siwan; Dhanarua and Maner in Patna; Aurai, Katra, Motipur, Gaighat and Kurhani in Muzaffarpur; Belaganj, Town and Tekari in Gaya; Adhaura in Kaimur, Jokihat in Araria and Benipatti in Madhubani.

On the other hand, Saharsa was at the top by inoculating 78.4% of beneficiaries with the first dose followed by Patna (77.5%), Purnia (74.3%), Buxar (73.7%) and Gopalganj (72.2%).

---||Vijayawada||No house sites on hillocks, says Andhra Pradesh HC||VIJAYAWADA: Allotting house sites in hillocks is in violation of the Constitution and international treaties to which India is a signatory, said the Andhra Pradesh high court in a recent judgment. Disposing two writ petitions filed challenging the allotment of 10 acres on Yetteramma Gutta, a hillock at Kuntrapakam village under Tirupati rural mandal in Chittoor district, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that the land identified for communal purpose cannot be allotted to others even after its classification is changed. Social activists S Maheswari and Y Vijayalakshmi filed separate petitions challenging the action of the tahsildar allotting 10 acres of hillock land for the purpose of giving house sites under Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu scheme. They argued that allotment of hillock land for house sites is in contravention of government orders in which it is specifically mentioned that land in ecologically sensitive zones should not be considered for the purpose of house sites. They further argued that Yetteramma Gutta has several temples. People perform pujas besides grazing their cattle. As the hillock provides livelihood to locals and is connected with their religious practices it cannot be allotted for house sites. The state government argued that only 10 out of 131 acres are being taken for house sites and no damage to its ecology or biodiversity is taking place with the allotment. Considering arguments on both sides, Justice Satyanarayana Murthy observed that highest priority should be given to preserving and protecting environment. Citing a Supreme Court judgment in which changes to masterplan were quashed as the land earmarked for parks was used for other purposes, he said that if so much importance is being given to manmade structures with regard to green zones, highest priority should be given for gifts given by the nature. Justice Satyanarayana Murthy said it is the constitutional obligation of governments to protect biodiversity. The right to life and right to safe environment are constitutional rights guaranteed under articles 48-A and 51-A.  He directed the tahsildar not allot the hillock land not only for the purpose of house sites but also for any other purpose even after the classification of the said land is changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-house-sites-on-hillocks-says-hc/articleshow/87544319.cms||Srikanth Aluri

In Vijayawada, the AQI level on November 4 stood at 106 this year, which is 140% lower compared to Diwali in 2020. According to experts, there has been a substantial decrease in cracker pollution since 2019. In 2019, the AQI stood at 450 and came down to 255 in 2020. As far as PM10 is concerned, November 4 saw the figure touch 56 micrograms per cubic metre. PM2.5 stood at 38 micrograms per cubic metre. Track the pollution level in your cityThe air quality index (AQI) in Visakhapatnam had peaked to 118 on Diwali on November 14, 2020, while it was limited to 107 this year. The overall AQI is calculated by summing up different pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) 2.5, PM10, etc. But interestingly, the AQI level remained over the 120 range in Visakhapatnam on Friday, as had happened on the post-Diwali day in 2020. The AQI reached the 127 mark by 4 pm on Friday. It had peaked to 129 post-Diwali day in 2020. As per CPCB, an AQI value between 0 and 50 represents good air quality, while the 51-100 range is termed ‘satisfactory’. An AQI in the range of 101 to 200 is considered moderate. Beyond that, the air quality is deemed to be poor (201-300), very poor (301-400) and severe (401-500). The maximum PM2.5 level reached eight times the permissible daily limit on Thursday night, peaking to 485 at 10 pm against the permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The PM10 level soared four times above the normal range – touching the 420 mark against the permissible limit of 100. Pollution levels between 8 pm and 11 pm were the worst in the day, reaching peak levels in this time. A thick blanket of haze covered several parts of the city on Thursday night, decreasing air quality. The haze continued even on Friday in Visakhapatnam. Speaking to TOI, APPCB environmental engineer M Pramod Kumar Reddy said the volume of firecrackers burst seems to have decreased this year. “It is a quieter Diwali compared to earlier years. Awareness drives on green crackers have also helped as the public took the route of green crackers,” said Pramod Kumar. Junior scientific officer at APPCB Dr B V Prasad explained that the since the duration of bursting crackers has reduced across the state, there has been a significant improvement in air quality when compared to previous years. “It is common that pollution levels rises during night period when residents burst crackers. Comparative analysis with previous Diwalis shows a substantial improvement indicating that the duration of bursting firecrackers has reduced,” Prasad told TOI. Compared to other days, pollution levels did see a spike in Vijayawada as PM10 values stood at 20 micrograms per cubic metre, two days prior to Diwali. APPCB data shows a spike in PM10 values between 7 pm to 8 pm at Velagapudi. However, there has been a slight reduction in pollution compared to 2020 in 2021 as the highest PM10 stood at 228 at 7 pm, which is 16% less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fewer-crackers-light-up-this-year-but-give-andhra-a-cleaner-diwali/articleshow/87544278.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Visakhapatnam||AP: ‘Parivartan’ to help Agency tribals move away from ganja cultivation||RAJAHMUNDRY: Police have stepped up efforts to curb the cultivation and smuggling of ganja in the Agency areas of the state and along the Andhra-Odisha border (AOB) areas. While earlier the main focus was on checking the ganja trade, the cops are now targeting the cultivation of ganja. Police have launched a programme, ‘Parivartan’, to dissuade villagers in the Agency and AOB areas from taking up ganja cultivation and also seek their cooperation to stop and check the contraband’s trade and smuggling in the Godavari districts. Police are also taking the assistance of technology, like satellite pictures and drone cameras, to track areas where ganja is cultivated, which is estimated to be about 4,000 acres in the Agency. On October 3, a police team led by East Godavari SP Ravindranath Babu destroyed ganja crop in about 10 acres near a village under Mothugudem panchayat of Chinturu mandal. He said smugglers from outside are using local tribal youths in Maoist-infested areas for both cultivation and transport of ganja. “The government is mulling financial assistance for them to dissuade them from ganja cultivation. The ‘Parivartan’ programme is meant to help them towards that end. Our target is to eliminate ganja menace at the ground level,” he said. RV Ratnam, a local tribal leader, told TOI 11 tribal sects in East Godavari have no caste certificates. “As their education stops after school, these tribal youths fail to get gainful employment. Ganja smugglers target these youths and motivate them to cultivate ganja and also use them in the drug’s transportation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/parivartan-to-help-agency-tribals-move-away-from-ganja-cultivation/articleshow/87544586.cms||Samson Raj

At least 26 persons have died in hooch tragedies in the two districts this week. “Identify those who are trying to weaken the existing prohibition law and take tough action against them,” Nitish said at a high-level meeting with state’s prohibition, excise and registration minister Sunil Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, DGP S K Singhal, additional chief secretary (home-cum-prohibition) Chaitanya Prasad and the CM’s principal secretary Chanchal Kumar to review the status of liquor ban in the state. “Top officers will ensure that no person involved in the wrongdoings are saved. Strict actions must be taken against the guilty persons in the hooch death cases recently,” Nitish told the officers. The CM also ordered the prohibition & excise department and the police headquarters to hold a meeting on every alternate day to review the status of enforcement of prohibition laws. Nitish also said he would hold a ‘detailed review meeting’ over enforcement of prohibition on November 16 after Chhath. “There is a need for an extensive mass awareness campaign to make people aware about the dangers of liquor consumption,” the CM said and asked the officials to prepare an outline for starting such campaign at the division level. He also suggested propaganda through wall painting on all government offices and the government residential buildings. “All government and semi-government officers and employees would once again have to take a pledge in favour of the total prohibition,” Nitish said. Prohibition, excise and registration department minister Sunil Kumar told TOI that the search operation has been launched to crack down on liquor smuggling. Kumar said additional chief secretary (home) and the DGP also held a review meeting with all divisional commissioners, IGs, DIGs, DM, SSPs and SPs posted in the field to take stock of the situation hours before CM Nitish Kumar chaired a meeting on the matter on Friday. A senior home department officer said Prasad reviewed the old hooch incidents and directed authorities to intensify drive against liquor smuggling. A home department source said as per the government records, around 70 persons have died from hooch poisoning this year so far. “We count only those deaths due to hooch that have been reported in the FIRs and proved in the postmortem examinations,” he said. The officer said media reports about hooch deaths may be higher as even those deaths are counted where claims of liquor consumption are made by the family members of the deceased but the bodies had been disposed of. “No hooch death had taken place in 2019 and 2020 in the state,” the officer said. More than four lakh litres of smuggled liquor and above 60,000 vehicles have been seized and above 3 lakh people have been arrested so far since complete prohibition was enforced in Bihar on April 5, 2016. At least 300 police, excise department or other government officers have been dismissed from service for connivance or violation of the prohibition law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-orders-massive-crackdown-on-liquor-mafias/articleshow/87544555.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Covid safety norms will be prominently displayed at all the approach roads and ghats, including those being spruced up near ponds and other water bodies, divisional commissioner of Patna Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said. “A large number of people from other states and abroad are likely to reach the state capital for participating in Chhath festivities. Many among them could still be unvaccinated and it would be a risk to others. Hence, instructions have been issued to set up temporary Covid test and vaccination centres at Chhath ghats,” Agrawal added. He said boat ambulance service would also be available to help the devotees and others in case of any emergency. “The district administration has appealed to the senior citizens and children to avoid visiting the ghats in the larger interest of their health. Levelling of ghats, lighting, cleanliness and repair of damaged drains are in progress at all places. National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force personnel will patrol the river stretch from Danapur to Patna City,” the divisional commissioner added. Patna DM Dr Chandrashekhar Singh said apart from deployment of static medical teams at all the ghats, the three major hospitals of the city – Patna Medical College and Hospital, Nalanda Medical College and Hospital and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences – have been put on alert. “These hospitals will keep their emergency units and operation theatres ready. Other district hospitals and primary health centres have also been asked to make necessary arrangements to meet any eventuality,” the DM added. The DM on Friday inspected different ghats along the Ganga in Danapur like Nasriganj Ghat, Nariyal Ghat, Peepapul Ghat, SDO Ghat, Sherpur Ghat and Haldi Chapra Ghat to review preparations. He directed the magistrates and other officials to undertake required works on a mission mode and create parking spaces. Finding the river current still high at Haldi Chapra Ghat, the DM asked the officials of the water resources department and the circle officer of Maner to consult members of the local puja committee and present the real status of the ghat so that the administration could demarcate safe and dangerous zones there. The dangerous zone would be demarcated with red curtain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chhath-hospitals-put-on-alert-for-any-exigency/articleshow/87544675.cms||VK Tripathi

The air-conditioned buses will start arriving next year. “Congrats Delhi! Cabinet today, under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cleared the proposal for induction of 190 Low floor AC CNG buses fitted with CCTV, GPS, Panic buttons and differently-abled friendly,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot tweeted after the cabinet meeting. The Delhi government said in a statement that the lowest bidder for a tender floated earlier would provide these buses under the gross cost model of contracting. The buses will operate from the Ghumanhera depot near Najafgarh in southwest Delhi under the ‘16B CLF cluster’. In response to the tender floated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Ltd on March 5 this year, a total of eight bids were received by the transport department and the lowest bidder found by the financial evaluation committee would now provide the buses. The buses will be BS-VI emission standards-compliant and equipped with facilities like real-time passenger information system, CCTVs, panic buttons, GPS and other facilities, besides being differently abled-friendly. The transport department will incur an estimated amount of Rs 1,259 crore on the viability gap funding for 10 years on the prevailing fare structure on the engagement of these buses.

However, decibel levels spiked in comparison to the usual daily average and, apart from Wazirpur, no other area met the standards. According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the range reached the maximum at 77.4dB(A) as against an average of 69dB(A), depicting that the firework did make an impact on denizens’ ears. “Real-time noise monitoring was undertaken at 31 locations in Delhi. The range was observed varying from 54.2dB(A) in Wazirpur to 77.4dB(A) in Karol Bagh on Diwali. On a normal day, the range varies from 46.4 to 69.5dB(A),” stated DPCC. Karol Bagh turned out to be the loudest this Diwali, recording the sonic disturbance at 77.4dB as against 78dB last Diwali. In Jahagirpuri, the noise level reached 76dB as against 81.5dB last year. At 73.4dB, Lajpat Nagar became the third-most noisy and louder than last Diwali (71.2dB). Meanwhile, Wazirpur, at 54.2dB, was the quietest, followed by Nazafgarh at 55.2dB and Alipur at 58.4dB.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Strike by KSRTC unions paralyses public transport||T’PURAM/PALAKKAD: The strike called by the various unions in KSRTC, including pro-CPM, badly hit services such that the people mainly in the southern districts were totally stranded. However, the state government has made it clear that it would not accept the strike. The strike which began on Thursday midnight will continue for 48 hours. The pro-CPM, CPI, Congress and BJP unions are taking part in the strike demanding pay revision. The corporation has not revised wages in the last nine years. The strike paralysed the operations of all long-distance buses across the state. However, the government has declared the strike dies non. But it has not deterred the striking unions. Transport minister Antony Raju has warned that the state government is considering to maintain seamless service to the public by invoking the Kerala Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1994. He said the strike is not justifiable at all and hence the government would deal with such a strike sternly. The government had sought time to discuss with the finance department on the pay revision. Since it incurs a huge financial liability, the government needs time to finalise it. But the unions were not ready to provide the time, which is not acceptable, Raju said. “It has to be noted that even though not even a single service was operated for months during the pandemic period, the salaries and pensions of all employees and pensioners were given by the government. This was done despite not having any revenue from KSRTC. The government is shelling out Rs 80 crore every month for the salaries,” said the minister. “The unions should rethink their strike. The government is taking all efforts to overcome the crisis faced by KSRTC. At this juncture such a strike paralysing the services was not acceptable. The government will have to seriously think of taking strict actions, including necessary legislation to save the ailing corporation,” he added. Ministerial-level talks held on Wednesday could not reach a settlement over the strike announced earlier by the KSRTC trade unions. Subsequently, the employees began the strike from Thursday midnight, derailing public transport across the state. Strike total in Palakkad The strike by KSRTC employees was total on Friday as not even one of the 148 services operated in Palakkad, causing inconvenience to long-distance travellers. All 73 services of Palakkad depot, 21 in Mannarkkad, 26 in Vadakkencherry and 28 in Chittur did not operate due to the strike. The striking employees took out a protest march to KSRTC Palakkad depot. KSRTC state transport employees sangh secretary K Rajesh said that 2,500 buses are being kept idle in the name of ‘parking’ while the government is trying to take private buses on lease. This is an attempt to destroy KSRTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strike-by-ksrtc-unions-paralyses-public-transport/articleshow/87544845.cms||---

The murder took place in Tirunelveli district in 2012. The court passed the order while dismissing the appeal preferred by Krishna alias David (appellant) challenging the Tirunelveli I additional district and sessions court order which had convicted and awarded life imprisonment to him for offence under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. According to the prosecution, there were minor issues between David and his wife as the latter was showing more affection towards the child and started neglecting him. On December 1, 2012, he murdered his son using a billhook near a temple in the village. Based on the wife’s complaint, the Pappakudi police had registered a case and arrested the appellant the same day. The trial court, after considering the evidence, convicted the appellant in 2015. Challenging the trial court order, David filed the present appeal in 2018. The counsel for David submitted that he was suffering from mental illness and was incapable of knowing the act that was done. Hence, the act of the accused will fall under Section 84 (act of a person of unsound mind) of IPC. He further submitted that while two of the eyewitnesses turned hostile, the trial court had convicted the appellant based on his wife’s testimony. A division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and R Pongiappan took note of the fact that the murder took place in 2012 and only in the year 2014, he was subjected to medical examination by a government doctor. As per the medical records, he was suffering from seizure disorder with epileptics. The judges observed that the appellant had committed the offence out of extreme anger and not as a result of unsound mind. He cannot claim benefit under Section 84 of the IPC by relying on the medical records, since there is no material on record to show that the appellant was suffering from mental illness at the time of occurrence in 2012. The judges observed that the wife is the only witness in this case. Law is now settled that the court can convict the accused based on the testimony of a single eyewitness without any corroboration, provided that the testimony is reliable, trustworthy and free from any suspicion. The judges observed that the testimony of the appellant’s wife is reliable and trustworthy, and they find no reason to disbelieve her evidence. There is no strong reason for the woman to falsely implicate her husband. Hence, the judges dismissed the appeal and confirmed the life sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-life-sentence-of-man-who-murdered-son-4/articleshow/87545366.cms||Kaushik Kannan

In fact, celebrations commenced around Wednesday midnight and in a few parts of the city, crackers were burst till Friday evening. P Narayanan, a senior citizen from Gomathipuram, said excessive bursting of crackers caused noise pollution to a big extent. “I and my wife have age-related ailments and were not able to sleep peacefully. It caused severe headache for us,” he said. M Dinesh, a resident of Narimedu, said travelling on two-wheeler with his family proved risky as people were bursting crackers on the road. Several youths were seen dangerously handling crackers and throwing lighted ones in the air unsettling motorists. Only 233 cases were registered by police in the southern districts including 12 by Madurai rural police for bursting crackers violating the SC orders. That apart, 26 cases were registered by city police. The ban imposed by the state government on joint crackers did not stop people from bursting small ones ranging from 100 to 500 walas in the city. However, traders said that it was only on September 29 that the Supreme Court imposed complete ban on joint crackers while the state government announced it the next day. By then, small joint crackers were sold though immediately after the ban was imposed, they stopped sale of even small joint crackers as instructed by officials who carried out periodical inspections. Flouting of time restrictions in the city also had an adverse impact on animals. Due to the noise, stray dogs and stray cattle panicked and ran helter skelter on the streets. Mayur Hassija, an animal activist, said Diwali is the toughest season for animals. Bursting of crackers induces anxiety among dogs. “I received six calls on stray dogs sustaining injuries on Thursday after being hit by motor vehicles. Of the six I attended, two dogs including a pregnant one died. I took the remaining four to the veterinary clinic at Tallakulam for treatment,” he said. Hassija said people should be sensitized to celebrate festivals in a responsible manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cracker-bursting-rules-go-for-a-toss/articleshow/87545372.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The report filed by the special investigation team (SIT) reiterated the agency’s earlier finding that the murder was committed by a gang led by M K Sunil Kumar alias Kodi Suni, the convict in the murder case of RMP leader T P Chandrasekharan, at the direction of CPM leaders. The CBI also reiterated that the murder was the execution of a conspiracy hatched by CPM leaders Karayi Rajan, who was then CPM Thalassery area secretary, and Karayi Chandrashekharan, then CPM Thiruvangady local secretary. The CBI requested the court to uphold the chargesheet submitted by the agency earlier and initiate further actions. Fasal, who was a newspaper distributor, was murdered on October 22 in 2006 near the Saidar Mosque in Thalassery. There were allegations that Fasal, who was a CPM activist, was murdered in retaliation of him leaving the party and joining the National Development Front (NDF). However, RSS worker ‘Kuppi’ Subheesh, a native of Chembra in Mahe, had stated that four RSS workers, including him, hacked Fasal to death and the CPM was not involved in the case. The CPM, which had denied the allegations against them, also alleged that RSS workers murdered Fasal. But Fasal’s family had denied CPM’s stand. Later, the high court ordered a CBI probe considering the plea by Fasal’s brother Abdul Sathaar. The CBI submitted that their probe had found Subheesh was forced to take the responsibility of the murder and forced to confess by the police. Subheesh also confessed to the alleged torture he faced as part of the coercion. Following the HC order, Rajan and Chandrashekharan surrendered before the Ernakulam district court in June 2012. The CBI had arrested eight people, Rajan and Chandrashekharan, while Kodi Suni was named the first accused in the case. Though Rajan and Chandrasekharan were released after one-and-a-half years in jail, the two were not allowed to enter Kannur district as per the stringent bail conditions until Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fasal-murder-was-handiwork-of-cpm-reiterates-cbi/articleshow/87544853.cms||---

It is modern untouchability against Hindus and Tamils,” he said. Murugan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a historic gift to the people by reducing VAT on fuel on Diwali eve. “He reduced petrol price by Rs 5 a litre and of diesel by Rs 10 a litre. It is a big announcement that will facilitate development and reduce the cost of transportation. The states where BJP is in power have also reduced VAT on fuel,” he said. He added that the Puducherry government has cut tax by Rs 19 a litre and the Tamil Nadu government should also reduce VAT on the fuels. He later interacted with fishermen and boat owners of Rameswaram. Stating that more than 600 fishermen were shot dead by Sri Lankan Army (Navy) till 2014, Murugan said there has not been an instance of Lankan Navy firing at Indian fishermen since the BJP came to power. However, fishermen later pointed to firing incidents that left their mates dead and injured in recent years. Murugan said that feasibility study is under way for the establishment of the sea weed park in the district as announced in the Budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cm-must-apologise-for-no-diwali-wishes/articleshow/87545374.cms||---

This time the rain has made it worse for the corporation workers who painstakingly started removing them since Friday morning across streets. It is now commonplace to see residents cleaning their homes ahead of a festival, but many dump the garbage on the roads without disposing of them properly. They are thrown near the garbage bins and in vacant plots. Maggots could be seen forming in the dumps at many places in the city where decomposing old household materials like mattresses mix with wet food waste. Diwali being a day when sanitary workers also do not work, the stink of rotting garbage persists at many places. K Kavitha, a homemaker in K K Nagar, said she had seen maggots crawling on the road near the dumper bin in front of Raj Mahal marriage hall. “The civic body needs to disinfect the garbage dumps regularly since mixed garbage is piling up and the stink is unbearable and very dirty,’’ she said. Muthu, a sanitary worker, said they had cleared garbage on the main roads, but cleaning the inner roads, where garbage had got soaked in the rain and buried in the mud, was tough. “We do not have equipment to dig out wet garbage and the brooms do not help much,’’ he said. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said they had collected 321 tonnes of garbage in just six hours from 6 am and the cleaning continued throughout the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sanitary-workers-struggle-to-clear-cracker-waste-slush-mix/articleshow/87545378.cms||---

Stating that the incident is in clear violation of section 8(10) (b) of the Goa Children’s Act, 2003 and Rules, 2004, the commission has requested the North Goa superintendent of police to initiate action against the guesthouse and submit a compliance report at the earliest. “The Goa Children’s Act, 2003 and Rules, 2004, has set out a preventive strategy for such incidents and the recent incident is in clear violation of Section 8(10) (b): No child shall be allowed to enter any room of any hotel or establishment which provides boarding or lodging, or any similar facility unless the child is registered as staying in that room with family, relatives or a person related by blood,” the commission stated. “In some cases, the owners of such facilities are found to be indifferent and do not care about tourists travelling with children. Travel and tourism actors such as accommodation-providers often become, inadvertently or not, intermediaries in the commission of these offences and should play a proactive role in preventing and combating such incidents, especially sexual exploitation of children,” chairperson of the commission Peter Borges stated in his communication to the tourism director. Pointing out that most travellers and tourists to Goa prefer to stay in rented premises, making it difficult for the authorities to keep a check on those travelling with children not related to them and exploiting them, the commission has requested the director of tourism to “direct all guesthouses to report such incidents to the child protection system or to law enforcement agencies and also establish a system to prevent such incidents in the future”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/guesthouses-should-report-minors-trying-to-check-in/articleshow/87545380.cms||---

He was speaking after inspecting the Mullaperiyar dam in Idukki district of Kerala on Friday along with his cabinet colleagues I Periyasamy, P Moorthy, A Sakkarapani and officials. Three trees near the baby dam site were causing hindrance to the strengthening of the dam. “When we ask the Kerala government, they say we have to ask the forest department which in turn says it is reserve forest. I will take action to remove the trees and the dam will be strengthened. The water storage will be increased to 152 feet after that as per the Supreme Court ruling,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mullaperiyar-dam-water-level-will-be-raised-to-152-ft-min/articleshow/87545383.cms||---

The lights were dedicated on the eve of Diwali, making it a real celebration of lights for the nearly 230 people in the locality that includes nearly 140 men, women and adolescents and 80 school going children. “Now our children are studying in our homes and we are able to charge our mobile phones without going to adjoining Kaithari Nagar,” said M Chandru, 43, of J J Nagar who with his wife, four children and a daughter-in-law live in a single room hut. Like Chandru, most huts in the locality hardly have a wall. Some huts are completely made of bamboo. The roof is mostly an old tin or asbestos sheet, making one wonder if they are really homes. They pay Rs 5 to charge a basic model mobile phone and Rs 10 for a smartphone for a couple of hours at a shop in Kaithari Nagar. “We were given free government televisions when Karunanidhi was CM and free mixers and grinders when Jayalalithaa was the CM. But what use are they without electricity? We sold them for a paltry Rs 500 apiece,” said M R Murugan, president of the community in J J Nagar. They were among the 50 families that settled at Thenperankundram foothills on the other side of Thiruparankundram in 1952. “We enjoyed electricity connection there till we were forced to leave in 2004 as it was temple land,” Murugan said. He added that 46 families relocated to 38 houses in J J Nagar and lived without electricity since then. Timely intervention of Wish to Help got them two solar street lights in July. Their plight got the attention of finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan. He along with revenue minister P Moorthy, the district collector and corporation commissioner and officials from the revenue and Tangedco departments visited the place last month and provided patta and electricity connections to the houses in the city limits. The rest could not be given one as they are on railway land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/solar-power-lights-up-28-kattu-nayakar-huts-in-madurai/articleshow/87545381.cms||M K Ananth

Former mayors Surendra Furtado and Uday Madkaikar alleged CCP is trying to sell the National Theatre which belongs to the CCP. Mayor Rohit Monserrate said the issue has been pending in court for 13 years and could go on for another five to 10 years. “CCP is in desperate need of funding. The outstanding has been Rs 37 crore. Now even if we want to plan any initiatives, we cannot as we don’t have funding. We are hoping to settle the National Theatre issue for an alternative means of income,” he said, adding, “They’re accusing us of trying to sell the property, but that is stupidity. We have approached the government for Rs 15 crore special grant next year, and we want to utilise that money for development of the National Theatre.” Commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said it is a very practical approach that CCP is taking as hearings will take a very long time. Madkaikar accused the corporation for compromising the issue prematurely even before the corporation holds hearings with the lease owner. The cash-strapped corporation is also unlikely to recover crores of rupees due to it from the Panaji municipal market. Despite being unable to recover a single rupee on the first two phases of the Panaji municipal market complex, and getting no rent from shop owners for decades, CCP has plans to go ahead with the third phase of the market. Rent arrears are reportedly around Rs 20 crore. When asked if CCP will ensure that the money from the first phases is collected before going on to the next phase, Fernandes said CCP is doing it simultaneously. Monserrate, however, said CCP will keep the third phase on hold till the market issue is settled, adding that it is a “long-pending and very difficult issue”. CCP has spent Rs 3.5 crore on the maintenance alone of the market complex. Only one shop owner has signed a lease agreement with the corporation, Monserrate said. “Now, we have another five to six ready to sign,” he said. Fernandes said that 10 more are ready to sign. The commissioner said others who are stubborn will be issued eviction notices. Regarding a timeframe, Fernandes said, “We haven’t worked it out. We will talk to our legal cell.” A community organiser on contract basis with CCP and GSUDA said that he and other contract staff and daily wage workers hadn’t received their salaries and questioned the mismanagement at CCP. “When the first phase and second phase of the market is not cleared yet and money is not coming, why do they want the third phase?” Gregory Jacques said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-meet-heats-up-over-devpt-of-national-theatre/articleshow/87545392.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi picks its poison as ban goes up in smoke||NEW DELHI: It was audibly clear that the ban on firecrackers had found scant respect in the city on Diwali, so it wasn’t surprising that the PM2.5 aerosols hit a spike and reached levels matching those of 2020 both on the day of the festival and a day later on Friday. CPCB data put the average PM2.5 level in Delhi on Thursday midnight at 309 microgram per cubic metre against the safe standard of 60 microgram. This rose to 432.6 microgram per cubic metre by 4pm on Friday. At Dilshad Garden — one of the predetermined 13 pollution hotspots in the capital — the PM2.5 level went up from 306.65 micrograms per cubic metre midnight to 997 by 1am on Friday. Last year on Diwali, the concentration was measured as rising from 332 microgram per cubic metre to 874.2 in the same timeframe. RK Puram, another hotspot, similarly suffered an adverse spike of PM2.5 from 220.7 micrograms per cubic metre at midnight to 926.5 an hour later. At Indira Gandhi International Airport, the respirable micropollutant level at 1am on Friday was 837.9 microgram per cubic metre against 466.4 last Diwali. At Shadipur, it was 913.7 compared with 330.3 last year, and at Pusa, the PM2.5 reading, at 924.7 micrograms per cubic metre, was much higher than 718.6 last year. At Punjabi Bagh too, the PM2.5 level was higher this year, 775 microgram per cubic metre against 545 at midnight on Diwali last year. The data showed a few exceptions. At midnight on Thursday, the PM2.5 count at Chandni Chowk 141.9 microgram per cubic metre and it had reached 364.7 at 1am on Friday. In 2020, these readings were 239.8 micrograms per cubic metre and 815.6. At Mathura Road too, the PM2.5 at 1am was 965.7 microgram per cubic metre against 984.4 last year. Almost all the active air quality monitoring stations in the city recorded PM2.5 levels at well above 550 micrograms per cubic metre this year. A Delhi Pollution Control Committee report said, “A gradual increase in the concentration of particulate matter was observed on the day of Diwali and the highest value was observed at midnight before it slowly started decreasing.” According to DPCC, the top five polluted areas in the city, ranked on the highest PM2.5 levels at Diwali midnight were Okhla Phase 2 (1,984 micrograms per cubic metre), Ashok Vihar (1,957), Anand Vihar (1,714), Vivek Vihar (1,604) and Mandir Marg (1,600). Shambhavi Shukla, deputy programme manager (air pollution), Centre for Science and Environment, observed, “The particle pollutants this year were almost as bad as last year. In some places, their levels were either close to or worse than last year despite Diwali in 2020 being in the second week of November. PM2.5 pollutants consist of harmful aerosols that are inhaled and mix in the bloodstream, affecting the cardiovascular system. They are most dangerous for children, elderly and pregnant women.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-picks-its-poison-as-ban-goes-up-in-smoke/articleshow/87545406.cms||---

The duo, who reached the district on the day when the CBI reaffirmed its earlier finding about the role of the two in the conspiracy behind the Fasal murder, was welcomed by CPM district secretary M V Jayarajan. After the reception meeting at Thalassery, Rajan was taken in a procession to Kathiroor and Chandrasekharan to Thiruvangad. Speaking at a reception meeting held at Thalassery, Jayarajan said that the party would take legal recourse to prove the innocence of Karayis and other six people who were wrongly arraigned as accused in the case. “The relaxation in the bail provision by the court is a victory in the fight for justice,” Jayarajan said. Rajan and Chandrasekharan said that the support extended by the party and public helped in overcoming the challenges faced by them during the last eight years. The Karayis had surrendered before the court in 2012 after they were named as accused in the case for conspiracy in the murder of Fasal in 2006. Though the court had later granted them bail in 2013, they were not allowed to enter Kannur and the two were staying in Ernakulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/rousing-reception-for-karayis-in-kannur/articleshow/87544871.cms||---
---||Goa||Violator on turtle-nesting beach at Agonda fined Rs 1L by coastal body||Panaji: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has ordered the removal of a temporary swimming pool on Agonda beach, which is one of the Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites in Goa. The authority has also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the violator. Despite previous orders, the violator, who operated cottages illegally from the beach, failed to remove the illegal swimming pool. “The authority after perusing the records and inspection report of the expert members and considering persistent non-adherence to directions, decided to order for the removal of the temporary swimming pool through the Agonda panchayat, and decided to impose a penalty of Rs 1 lakh,” GCZMA’s decision states. The violation came to the notice of GCZMA after Goa Paryavaran Savrakshan Sangharsh Samitee filed an application before National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2017. The organisation had sought enforcement of the tribunal’s earlier order calling for protection of the turtle nesting beaches of Morjim, Mandrem, Galgibaga and Agonda in Goa. Accordingly, the tribunal directed GCZMA to take action against temporary structures constructed in No Development Zone (NDZ) of these beaches without specific permission from GCZMA. The tribunal also directed that compensation be recovered by GCZMA from those violating the norms laid down by NGT for the turtle nesting beaches of Goa. Thereafter, while acting on these directives, GCZMA noticed that the violator at Agonda was operating a resort or cottages by erecting structures in the NDZ area without any NOC. The authority after hearing the arguments decided to carry out an inspection of the premises because the respondent (cottage owner) was not figuring in the list of offenders that was prepared by the three-member committee. After the inspection, the offender was asked to remove the temporary swimming pool, but failed to do so and file compliance as required. NGT’s order on Goa’s turtle nesting beaches had noted that the authorities should keep the nesting areas fenced and undisturbed during turtle nesting season, which lasts from November to April. “There should not be any litter on the beaches, which would attract unwanted predators. If disturbed, the turtles withdraw from nesting,” NGT said. The tribunal said it should be ensured that no artificial lights are put up in such stretches either, as it disturbs the turtles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/violator-on-turtle-nesting-beach-at-agonda-fined-rs-1l-by-coastal-body/articleshow/87545411.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why ban on crackers is all sound and fury||NEW DELHI: Dismayed by the utter disregard for the ban on fireworks in Delhi on Diwali, experts said the authorities should educate the public about the ill-effects of firecrackers on the health and so bring about a behavioural change in the society. Sachchida N Tripathi of the civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur and a member of the steering committee, National Clean Air Programme, said, “The bursting of firecrackers causes a spike in the metal concentration in the air though it vanishes very fast and does not remain in the air for more than two days.”  He felt a ban could only be enforced only if people become a part of the act. Anju Goel, fellow, earth science and climate change, at The Energy and Resources Institute, pointed out though there was a ban on firecrackers, the items were easily available in the market at affordable prices. “To ensure that crackers are not burst, the source and the availability of crackers must be eliminated,” she said. “Besides, residents’ welfare associations or some people should be given the responsibility of ensuring the proper enforcement of the ban in their respective localities.” Also advocating behavioural change was Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends. She noted that the prohibition came into effect much before Diwali this year, but people were able to procure them from nearby states. “We have to make people aware that firecrackers are not good for their health,” said Khosla. “The violators should be penalised and people who make unscientific and ill-informed statements that crackers do not contribute to pollution have to be called out.” A ban can be successful only if the citizens participate in it, remarked professor Sagnik Dey, coordinator, Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air, IIT Delhi. “The focus must be on strengthening the message on why fireworks are banned,” he said. “We have to constantly run awareness campaigns till people become superconscious about air pollution.” At the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, said, "Accountability should be fixed both at the top and the bottom ranks. Eventually, the onus is on us, the residents of Delhi. We need to realise that our city is particularly vulnerable to high pollution, given its geography and the adverse impact of meteorology on its air quality. We must refrain from indulging in activities that worsen the capital’s air quality and put the wellbeing of our families and neighbours at risk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-ban-on-crackers-is-all-sound-and-fury/articleshow/87544883.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Goa’s fertility rate drops to 1.3 children per woman||PANAJI: Goa’s total fertility rate (TFR) has decreased by 0.4 children per woman in the last five years, as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) 2019-20. The TFR stood at 1.3 children per woman as against the earlier 1.7. Gynaecologist Dr Govind Kamat told TOI that the “fertility rate has decreased not only in Goa, but across the world as people are increasingly going in for planned pregnancies and choosing to have one or two children.” For the same reasons, people are not opting for early pregnancies, he said. “Because of this (delayed pregnancy) they then get complications, which also leads to reduced fertility,” Dr Kamat added. The survey, which collected information from 1,856 households, 2,030 women in the 15-49 age group and 313 men aged 15-54, also stated that Goa’s fertility rate is well below the “replacement level of fertility”. The replacement level is the number of children needed to replace the parents, after accounting for fatalities, skewed sex ratio, infant mortality, etc. Below this level, population starts falling. As per the NFHS-4 2015-16, Goa’s total fertility rate was 1.7 children per woman, well below the replacement level of fertility of 2.1 children. “The greatest differentials in fertility are by religion and caste/tribe. At current fertility rates, Muslim women will have an average of 0.3 children less than Hindu women (A TFR of 1.2, compared with 1.5) and 0.2 children more than Christian women,” the NFHS-5 survey stated. In Goa, the NFHS-5 field survey was conducted in both districts from August 30, 2019, to November 26, 2019, through a private entity. Eighty-five percent of the pregnancies in the five years preceding the survey ended in live births and the remaining 15% were terminated in foetal wastage (abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth). Miscarriage is the most commonly reported type of foetal wastage, accounting for 11% of all pregnancies, abortions accounted for 5%, NFHS-5 said. As per the latest survey, the median age at first marriage is 24.2 years among women in the age group of 25-49 years, with 10% in the age group 20-24 years having married before the legal minimum age of 18. This figure is down slightly from 12% in the earlier survey. Eight percent of the men in the age group 25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21, up slightly from 7% in the earlier survey, the NFHS-5 stated. The survey also revealed that the median interval between births in the five years before the survey in Goa is 39.3 months, two months shorter than in the earlier survey. Seven per cent of births take place within 18 months of the last birth and 20% occur within 24 months. Almost half (45%) of births occur within three years of the previous birth. “Research shows that waiting at least three years between children reduces the risk of infant mortality,” the survey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-fertility-rate-drops-to-1-3-children-per-woman/articleshow/87545424.cms||Murari Shetye

Vellayil police submitted the chargesheet before Kozhikode judicial first class magistrate court. Police have, however, excluded MSF Malappuram district secretary V Abdul Wahab, against whom the Haritha leaders had raised allegations, from the chargesheet. Police charged Navas under IPC sections 354-A(1)(iv) (making sexually-coloured remarks) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). Wahab has been omitted from the chargesheet for want of evidence. There are 18 witnesses in the chargesheet. In their complaint, Haritha leaders said Navas had —during the MSF state committee meeting held in Kozhikode on June 22— asked a Haritha leader to state their opinion about an organizational matter with a remark, ‘even a prostitute would have a justification, you say’. Ten leaders of Haritha had lodged a complaint with the women’s commission against Navas and Wahab which was forwarded to the police. IUML had disbanded Haritha state committee citing alleged violation of party discipline after they refused to withdraw the complaint against MSF leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/chargesheet-filed-against-navas/articleshow/87544895.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi cops on toes with 1,200 calls this Diwali||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police was kept on its toes on Diwali with around 1,200 calls about violations of the ban on firecrackers. The cops have so far registered 210 cases for disregarding the court-directed prohibition on the bursting of crackers and arrested 143 people between September 29 and November 4. Apart from this, police have also registered 125 cases and arrested 138 people for violating the ban on the sale and supply of firecrackers in the same period. The maximum number of cases against bursting of crackers was registered in Rohini. A police officer disclosed that a substantial number of violations were reported in Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi, Burari in north Delhi, Paschim Vihar in west Delhi and Shahdara in east Delhi. “People had procured firecrackers in huge quantities at lower prices from the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana,” the officer said. In an effort to ensure the ban was successful, Delhi Police had contacted 699 schools to spread awareness and educate the students on the ill effects of bursting firecrackers on the air and people’s health. A total of 706 teams had been constituted to enforce the ban directives. In the last one and a half months, the cops seized a massive volume of illegal firecrackers in the city. Data shared by police showed that between September 29 and November 4 this year, 19,702.5 kg of firecrackers were seized. On September 28, Delhi Pollution Control Committee ordered a complete ban on the sale, purchase and bursting of firecrackers in the capital till January 1, 2022. Last year, on Diwali, Delhi Police received more than 2,000 calls in its control room from people reporting violation of the ban on firecrackers. On Diwali day alone, the cops had arrested 850 people last year and confiscated 1,314.4 kg of firecrackers. Police data showed that the maximum cases of the ban violation last year were registered in Outer-North police district (165), followed by North (146), North-West (127) and Outer district (99).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-on-toes-with-1200-calls-this-diwali/articleshow/87544893.cms||---

The shooters — identified as Neeraj Pandit, Sachin and Ankit — were given a contract of Rs 10 lakh for two murders in Roorkee, said police. The arrests, according to police, were made based on electronic surveillance of gangster Narendra Valmik and his associates who hired the shooters to gun down two persons, including a woman, in Roorkee. The police also found out that Narendra, who is currently lodged at Pauri district jail, had been using mobile phones with SIM cards purchased on fake IDs to contact his shooters. Narendra’s associates were arrested at Asharodi Chowk. Police also recovered country-made pistols along with live cartridges from their possession. After their arrest, the shooters told police that they were contacted by a man named Pankaj who works for Narendra. Pankaj had asked them to stay in the Chandrabani area of Dehradun. They were to be called to Roorkee for executing the killings in a few days. It has been learnt that Narendra Valmik has an old enmity with the two persons and thus, he awarded a contract of Rs 10 lakh to shooters to get them killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stf-doon-police-nab-contract-killers-from-uttar-pradesh-and-haryana/articleshow/87544254.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Goa||Goa’s 1st gas-insulated substation likely to come up in Davorlim||PANAJI: Power minister Nilesh Cabral said on Friday that the state government would commission Goa’s first gas insulated substation (GIS) at Davorlim this month, at a cost of Rs 32 crore. He said consumers connected to this substation will have not power issues for the next 40 years. He also said that the GIS, a “most modern concept”, will serve consumers residing in Davorilm, Navelim and some parts of Margao and Curtorim, among others. “Navelim constituency will be benefited at large,” he said. Cabral said that GIS will eventually be implemented throughout the state. Cabral said that GIS is a technology-driven concept, with little human intervention. “This would be a benchmark for other substations in future,” he said, adding that an office would be set up within the GIS, and maintenace would also be less. Cabral said that as the electricity department was not able to expand the substation below the Konkan Railway (KR) bridge, KR wanted it to move that substation, which was on their land, and that’s why the work of the new GIS was taken up. “Once we commission the new GIS, the substation on Konkan Railway land will be removed,” he said. He also said that chief minister Pramod Sawant will inaugurate the project. Cabral said that work of underground cabling in the state is on, but due to the high price, contractors are not coming forward to bid for tenders. “Our priority is to take 11KV and 33KV (lines) underground,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-1st-gas-insulated-substation-likely-to-come-up-in-davorlim/articleshow/87545455.cms||---

DFS got 152 distress calls on Thursday, 25% less than 2020, said senior officials. Fire-related calls usually go up on Diwali. DFS data shows that 117 calls out of the 152 reported fire incidents, including four related to crackers, while others reported fire due to short-circuit and fire in the garbage. Officials said that there were at least 10 calls for animal rescue, 12 for bird rescue, one related to house collapse, seven other rescue-related operations and two others reporting road accidents requiring assistance. Atul Garg, DFS director, said that the new low in the number of distress calls is a positive sign. "I believe that the low number of calls this year is because we have managed to raise awareness among the people. There were fewer calls reporting incidents related to fire-crackers bursting, which is indicative that people behaved responsibly and followed all the safety precautions as suggested," Garg said. The director said no major fire incident was reported on Diwali, and no casualty was reported due to fire. DFS had made elaborate arrangements ahead of Diwali to ensure a quick response to any untoward incident. While fire tenders were deployed at 22 locations across the national capital, for narrow lanes and congested areas like Chandni Chowk, Sabji Mandi, Ghanta Ghar and Paharganj, motorcycles fitted with fire-fighting equipment were deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-of-fire-distress-calls-lowest-in-15-yrs/articleshow/87544896.cms||---

The respondents in the case, who are her parents, sister, brother-in-law and two CPM workers, did not appear for the hearing. Instead, they sent a letter to the commission stating that they were unable to attend the procedure as another case is already going on before a court. Though the commission had directed the state council for child welfare and police to submit reports on Anupama’s petition, both agencies are yet to comply. Anupama said she was waiting for the child welfare committee’s response to their application seeking a DNA test. The committee is expected to hold a hearing on Monday in this regard.

The roads leading to the village remain damaged, piped water supply has stopped and the sanitation facilities remain in shambles. “Even two weeks after the rain spell, our condition has remained the same. Our houses have suffered damage, the national highway that connects our village to the rest of the state has submerged in Kosi and there is no potable water,” said Pushpa Devi, a local. Several families are forced to live along Kosi. Not only do they wash their utensils and clothes in the river, but the locals also drink Kosi water. This has made the populace vulnerable to a host of water-borne diseases. Kannu Goswami, head of Chada village, told TOI, “More than 50 villages were affected due to the rainfall. The devastating rainfall also destroyed standing crops in the region. The cumulative losses run into crores and yet villagers were only given a compensation of Rs 1,01,900.” He added that no minister or administrative officer, other than the SDM, came to the village after the rainfall devastation. Meanwhile, district magistrate Dheeraj Garbiyal told TOI that sanitation issues will be resolved shortly. The SDM, who is in-charge of the village, is looking after the matter, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-weeks-on-nainital-villages-continue-to-reel-under-rainfall-damage/articleshow/87544263.cms||---

Operations will be handled by MinarTravels (India). “We have got confirmation for one charter a week from Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the first arrival is scheduled for December 9. We are also trying for charters from Ukraine," Abida Kumar, vice-president, operations, Minar Travels (India), told TOI. Besides Russia, over the past decade, Goa has regularly received charters from the two CIS (commonwealth of independent states) countries. With Russia still reeling under the impact of the pandemic, Goa will have to wait for a while, and may see charters from Russian destinations from January, operators feel. More than half of the charter tourists that visit Goa are Russians, while the UK is also an important market. The first charter from the UK will land in Goa on December 13. Operators are seeing healthy bookings from the UK since India started issuing visas mid-last month, even as the ban on international travel will remain in force till the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-dec-goa-to-receive-one-charter/week-from-kazakh/articleshow/87545461.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Steam inhalation: GMC sees rise in burns cases among children||PANAJI: With an increasing number of people opting for regular steam inhalation to stave off the coronavirus, incidents of burns have also risen, particularly among children. GMC’s plastic surgery and burns department has reported an increase in male paediatric patients who have sustained burns during inhalation. Head of the department, Dr Yuri Amborcar, said the change was noticed because male burn patients were earlier fewer than female patients with similar conditions. “Over the past year, we saw more males in the paediatric category sustaining burns caused by accidental spillage of hot water on the body while inhaling steam,” he said. While such instances were also seen in the adult population, cases of scalds were higher in the paediatric category and the patients were mostly under five years of age. “Steam inhalation for children was done either when they had coughs and colds, or as a preventive measure when family members had Covid-19,” he said. Steam inhalation is proven to relieve chest congestion, but the jury’s still out on whether it is an effective remedy against Covid-19. Amborcar said the only explanation for more male paediatric cases with complaints of injuries caused during steam inhalation could be that boys are generally more frisky, and as such, more susceptible to accidents. He, however, said it was difficult to say if the children who had ended up sustaining burns during steam inhalation were doing it without parental supervision. Annually, the GMC’s plastic surgery and burns department sees 150-180 burn cases, and patients comprise adults, children and a few factory-related accidents. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic — from April 2020 to March 2021 — it has recorded 41 male and 25 female cases in the paediatric age group. “An increase in male paediatric cases was reflected in the overall male cases. Burn cases involving men and women were almost equal for the said period,” Amborcar said, and added that while more burn cases were reported among the female population nationally, the trend is Goa was the reverse owing to the high volume of male paediatric cases. Fortunately, there were no mortalities, and the children were cured within 10-15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/steam-inhalation-gmc-sees-rise-in-burns-cases-among-children/articleshow/87545458.cms||Bindiya Chari

The concentration of PM 2.5 stood at 327 on November 4, with the AQI recorded around Clock Tower being the highest (at 348). According to official figures released by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB), the AQI in Haridwar was recorded at 321, Kashipur 267, Rudrapur 263 and Rishikesh 257 among others. As per official figures, Dehradun recorded an average AQI varying between 118.5 and 156.5 from October 28 to November 2. But the pollution levels shot up twice the given figures on Diwali. “We have been monitoring the state’s air quality. The AQI in hilly areas is not as alarming as in plains where the situation is expected to improve in the next couple of days,” said SP Subudhi, secretary, UPCB. Though there is no official data on the air quality for Friday morning, it is being expected to be worse. According to a report released by Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (EPIC), in September, Uttarakhand has one of the highest concentrations of PM 2.5 among the Himalayan states.

Early this week, AAP national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had promised Goans free pilgrimages to Ayodhya, Shirdi, Velankanni and Ajmer Sharif if the party forms the government in the state. Sawant said that most Goans have not visited the temples of Goa. “We have many temples in the state and people from outside the state come to Goa and visit these temples. We are celebrating the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation, and I thought that it is important that people from Goa above 60 should do Goa darshan, and the social welfare department will launch the scheme for temple visit from December 1,” Sawant said. The chief minister said that the scheme would be implemented through the deputy collector, and senior citizens should register their names before the deputy collector and board the Kadamba bus. Sawant said that senior citizens should submit their Aadhaar card and voter ID to avail the scheme. “If you board the bus in Mapusa, you will be taken up to Canacona and after visiting different temples the entire day, the social welfare department will make arrangements to drop you at your door step in the evening,” he said. Sawant also said that Goa is blessed with beautiful temples, and the surroundings are also pristine. He said that people should get an opportunity to experience Goa culture by visiting Ravindra Bhavan among other places. Meanwhile, the chief minister said that the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation will float a tender inviting bidders to prepare a master plan for Mapusa. “Before the code of conduct comes into force, we will take up the work of the master plan to carry out systemic development of Mapusa,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-aap-pilgrimage-vow-cm-launches-temple-run-for-seniors/articleshow/87545465.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi hospitals see rush of patients with respiratory problems||NEW DELHI: Anshuman Gupta (name changed), who suffers from asthma, was doing fine until Thursday on regular medications. However, the spike in pollution levels over the last 24 hours led to acute exacerbation of symptoms and the south Delhi resident had to be rushed to the emergency room of a private hospital in the middle of the night, even as his family wrapped up Diwali celebrations. “We had to administer steroids as well as oxygen therapy to stabilise the symptoms. The patient is doing better now,” Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary and critical care, at Apollo hospital, said. Like Gupta, many people with a history of respiratory health issues are finding it difficult to breathe the polluted air and, in a few cases, are landing in hospitals with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, constant cough and dizziness, among others. “We are seeing an increase in the number of OPD visits as well as admissions on account of respiratory problems. Patients who have asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — a chronic inflammatory lung disease — are coming to the hospital with acute attacks and are getting admitted even in ICUs. Also, many of our patients require escalation of treatment these days,” Dr Neetu Jain, senior consultant, pulmonology at PSRI hospital, said. With winter conditions setting in, the dust and particulate material from vehicular pollution and smoke from crackers have caused smog-like conditions, says Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. “The dangerous mix of pollutants can cause short-term damages, which we can see now in terms of exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. But long-term damage can be even more catastrophic, especially in children who grow up in such a polluted environment,” he added. Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant and head of the department of pulmonology at Paras hospital, said people who have a history of respiratory disease such as asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, should strictly adhere to their regular medications and see their doctors if they notice that the symptoms have started deteriorating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hosps-see-rush-of-patients-with-respiratory-problems/articleshow/87544906.cms||---

Among them, 16 people from Dakshini Telua village and surrounding hamlets under Nautan police station area of West Champaran died after reportedly consuming illicit liquor on Diwali-eve on Thursday while the death toll at Mohammadpur in Gopalganj district mounted to 10 till Friday. However, the official death toll was 23. But, sources said the death toll could be as high as 35 as the family members of several deceased reportedly cremated the bodies fearing police action. Twenty-two people have been arrested in connection with the twin hooch tragedies. So far, 92 people have lost their lives in 15 separate incidents in the state in hooch tragedies since January this year. CM Nitish Kumar on Friday held a high-level meeting with senior home and police departments and ordered the officials to launch a crackdown on those involved in manufacturing and smuggling liquor, which is banned in Bihar since April 2016. The SHO of Nautan and Mohammadpur police stations besides the chowkidars of the two villages have been suspended as the additional chief secretary (home) and the DGP held a separate meeting to review the situation following the twin tragedies. Prohibition and excise minister Sunil Kumar said the CM has also directed the officials to launch awareness campaign against liquor consumption in the state once again. In Gopalganj, 4 had died on Wednesday and six more succumbed during treatment thereafter. Among the deceased were Santosh Sah, Chote Lal Prasad, Mukesh Ram, Suraj Ram, Balram Ram, Chandrama Ram, Indrajit Ram, Rajesh Ram (from Mohammadpur), Durga Sharma of Balra in Sidhhwalia in Gopalganj and one Chote Lal Soni of Rasauli in Mashrakh, Saran. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar told TOI that 18 persons had been arrested. "Three of them are directly linked with the Mohammadpur hooch deaths," Anand said. In West Champaran, the deceased included Maharaj Yadav (55), Bacha Yadav (40), Jawahir Sahni (40), Hanumat Singh (62), Mukesh Paswan ( 24), Mangni Ram (28), Sikander Ram (40), Dhanilal Ram (35), Madan Ram (50), Bikau Ram (22), Ram Prakash Ram (55), Uma Shankar Ram (55), Thug Paswan (60), Md Hashim Khan (70), Ramesh Sahni (40) and Jhakkar Paswan, who succumbed at the GMCH, Bettiah, on Friday evening. Many of them fell ill with nausea, vomit and stomach-aches. Family members rushed the sick to a private hospital in Jagdishpur. “My father (Jawahir Sahni) died within ten minutes at Jagdishpur,” 16-year-old Happy Raj told this reporter on Friday. Mourners accompanying him at the Pokhara chowk cremation ground said as the death toll began to mount on Thursday and dead bodies were brought back for cremation to the village, the police arrived and took custody of the dead for autopsy. “By then, two of the deceased -- Hanumat and Uma Shankar -- had already been cremated," Baidyanath Singh, a village elder said. West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar said at least four persons were arrested till Friday morning. Bettiah SDPO Mukul Parimal Pandey said at least 12 persons are still under treatment in different hospitals. "At least two of the accused who had prepared the hooch, are among the deceased persons as they had also consumed the hooch," he said. Police also rushed to the private Taj hospital at Jagdishpur and transferred the ailing victims to the GMCH. Five patients were taken to another private hospital at Bettiah. " Of the 13 patients were admitted on Thursday, two were brought dead while another four succumbed by night," GMCH superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said, adding that by Friday afternoon, 12 autopsies had been conducted. "One body was taken home for the last rites without autopsy," he said. Khanderu Sah, one of the so far surviving victims, has lost his eyesight, thereby reviving memories of another hooch tragedy in the district in July when 16 had died and four others lost their vision. “I was awestruck by the mishap as it has occurred within months of July’s liquor tragedy that claimed 16 lives and rendered four victims blind under the Lauriya and Ramnagar police station areas,” Champaran Range DIG Pranav Kumar Praveen told TOI after returning from the affected village. “People always speak after an incident. I learnt that the victims had consumed alcohol in the village itself and that the illicit liquor business had been brewing locally," Praveen said, adding the Nautan SHO has been suspended along with the local chowkidar and dafadar. "I’ve asked the SP to thoroughly probe the allegations of their complicity. No guilty shall be spared," the DIG said. When contacted, the West Champaran DM said nine died on Thursday and three more on Friday morning. "Some were referred to the PMCH but died on the way," the DM said. He said at least three medical teams with ambulances have been deployed in the affected village. "An SDM rank officer has been deployed at GMCH where ill persons are undergoing treatment," he said. The DM said none of the ill persons turned blind due to the side-effects of poisonous hooch consumption.

Sunil Rawat, a Dehradun resident, told TOI, “Though a temporary relief, it is a very important decision. We were paying more than Rs 100 for fuel earlier. The decision was long awaited. We hope that the prices will be reduced further in the coming days.” Meanwhile, petrol pump owners reported losses due to the price drop. “Expecting a surge in sales during the festival, we had stocked around 9,000 litres of petrol and 6,600 litres of diesel. Now, till the stocks of several thousand litres of fuel are exhausted, we will have to incur losses on every litre sold,” said Laxman Khatri manager of a petrol pump in Dehradun. Notably, the Uttarakhand government had also reduced the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre after the Centre cut the price of petrol by Rs 5 and that of diesel by Rs 10 across India on the eve of Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-residents-welcome-fall-in-petrol-diesel-prices/articleshow/87544325.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

The applications for financial relief are to be submitted at www.relief.kerala.gov.in. Along with the application, the applicant should submit the death certificate (issued by the ICMR and the death declaration document), a copy of the ration card, Aadhar card and bank passbook of the applicant, and the heirship certificate if available. The applications are to be submitted by a close relative of the person who has died due to Covid-19. The respective village officer will examine the application and the documents submitted along with it and pass it on to the district disaster management authority (DDMA), which will then examine and give final clearance to the application. The relatives of the deceased will be granted Rs 50,000, and those BPL families who are dependents of the dead will be provided Rs 5,000 per month for 36 months, to their bank account, before the fifth day of every month.

When the income of such families is calculated, the income of the deceased will be excluded. Those applications that are received in physical format in village offices will be verified and handed over through the portal to the DDMA by the village officer. In those cases where there is a need for re-examination, the DDMA will hand over the applications to the respective tahasildar through the portal for further inquiry.

---||Patna||Bihar: Migrants come home in festival to brew of death||DAKSHINI TELUA (WEST CHAMPARAN): The smoke billowing from the two cremation grounds drown the early morning fog over the sugarcane fields in a 2km arc in-between. The smoke from the pyres also turn the cow-dung laden village air of Govardhan Puja rituals into a putrid smell that defines the grief enveloping the local community since Diwali morning. Among the 16 dead are migrants with cross-India footprints that returned home this festive season only to raise a glass or two of brew that spelt death. From the sombre hush-hush tones at the cremation grounds to wails of women in the mahadalit hamlet, liquor spills a tale of migration, hard labour, harder-earned money and an acquired lifestyle where a peg or ‘paua’ (quarter) of liquor after a back-breaking day’s work has become almost intrinsic with the migrants from ‘dry Bihar’. At Pokhara grounds, his head shaven, Happy Raj (16) sat quietly amongst his relatives after lighting the pyre of his father Jawahir Sahni (40). “He’d come home after drinking and began vomiting. We took him to Jagdispur where he died within ten minutes of reaching the hospital,” the bereaved teenager, eldest of three siblings, told this reporter. “He had returned home from Chandigarh for Diwali and Chhath,” Happy narrated his father’s tragic homecoming. Tilak Choudhary, a grieving relative, said: “Earlier I, too, worked in Chandigarh. Liquor is easily available at government approved shops. A lot of Bihari labour go to the sarkari theka for evening quota. It is safe and legal. Once home, people returning are now dependent on local peddlers. We are now grieving.” A little away, Nagina Sah — running his ‘chai and nashta’ shop — questions Bihar’s Prohibition policy. “Nitish Kumar is responsible for these deaths,” he sits in judgment. Two kms away, on the banks of the Chandrawat river, mourners await the inflow of more bodies after autopsy at the GMCH in Bettiah. A couple of pyres have died down, Tulsi plants planted atop. A rather broad and big pyre is ablaze. Mukesh Paswan (24) and Thug Paswan (60) are being cremated together. “Mukesh had come home from Meghalaya just two days ago,” Ramlal Paswan said. Adds Rakesh Paswan, the deceased’s younger brother: “He had come home after drinking in the evening and soon began vomiting. He died soon after reaching the hospital.” Villagers admitted rather matter-of-fact that migrants like Mukesh become used to alcohol while working in migration. In the mahadalit tola, Dhanilal Ram(35), a mason, had also recently returned from Kerala. “He used to go out for months every year for work, sometimes to Punjab. This time, he’d gone to Kerala,” cousin Vikram Ram, who lost another brother Madan Ram (50), said, adding: “Madan, too, had returned home for Diwali and Chhath just a week ago from Varanasi.” Clearly, relatives in grief are discerning the fault lines of a drink in wet, working states and their dry home state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/migrants-come-home-in-festival-to-brew-of-death/articleshow/87544941.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

---||Noida||Noida: Man shot at during argument over bursting crackers||NOIDA: A 26-year-old youth was shot at after an argument between two groups over bursting of crackers in Sector 121 turned violent. He is being treated at a private hospital. Around 10pm on Thursday, three youths — Sunil, Anil and Gopal — were bursting crackers in front of Rajveer’s provision store in Gadhi Chaukhandi village. When Rajveer objected to the same, an argument broke out between him and the youths, police said. The youths allegedly told Rajveer that they would burst crackers there itself and asked him if the area belonged to his father. However, the three youths soon left the spot only to return with some more supporters. “The three returned to the spot with Sunil and Gopal’s friend Rajkumar and the latter’s father Shripal. They got together and started to burst crackers outside Rajveer’s house,” Phase III SHO Vivek Trivedi said. Rajveer soon came out of his house and confronted the accused. The youths again hurled abuses at him. This agitated Rajveer’s family members, and his nephew Vineet and brother Lokpal too joined him outside the house. Vineet and Lokpal attacked Sunil, Gopal, Anil, Rajkumar and Shripal with sticks. “All, including Rajkumar’s father, were badly beaten up. This infuriated Rajkumar who brought his licensed pistol to the spot and resorted to firing. While one gunshot was fired in the air, the second one hit Vineet in the lower abdomen,” Trivedi said. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said that the fight started over bursting of crackers and snowballed into a violent tussle. “The injured youth was rushed to a private hospital, where he is recuperating. Rajkumar and Gopal have been arrested. Shripal, Anil and Sunil, however, remain absconding,” he said. Vineet’s cousin Atul told TOI that he continues to be in a critical condition. An FIR has been lodged in the case against Rajkumar, Shripal, Anil and Gopal under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-shot-at-during-argument-over-bursting-crackers/articleshow/87545854.cms||---

The amount will be given from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). As many as 461 people have died of Covid in Ghaziabad since last year. Officials said a committee would be formed soon to prepare a list of the relief recipients.District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said: “A letter issued by the state government said that Rs 50,000 will have to be given to each family that has lost a member to Covid. For this, we will need to look at death certificates. If Covid is not mentioned in the document, then the committee will decide on the eligibility based on an individual’s treatment records.”He added that the panel would be formed under the district magistrate and it will have officials from the administration and the health department, along with an expert. It will recommend the grant to the families, which will have to apply for it.Last month, the Supreme Court had directed all states to ensure that no affected family is denied ex-gratia compensation of Rs 50,000 solely on the ground that a person’s death certificate does not mention Covid as the cause of death. The highest court in the country had asked states to disburse the amount within 30 days of a family submitting its application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/rs-50000-relief-to-families-of-covid-victims/articleshow/87545855.cms||Aditya Dev

Though the district collector had served her notice to appear in the collector’s chamber for talks to find a solution on the issue, Deepa could not make it due to bad health. Speaking to TOI, she said that she did not have the energy to travel to the collector’s office for the talks. She is sticking to her demand for the ouster of the nano science department director Nandakumar Kalarickal, she added. Meanwhile, district collector PK Jayasree said that neither she nor the government can interfere on the student’s demand as the university functions according to university statutes. She had served the notice on Deepa through the village officer for the talks. However, Deepa informed the officer orally that she could not attend the meeting due to her bad health, said the collector. University registrar was present for the talks and the collector said that the university is ready to extend all support to her to continue her research studies, including her re-registration and research extension. Jayasree said that whenever the student is ready, she is open for talks, and will be soon filing a report to the government on the issue. It is not practical to go to the agitation venue and hold talks, she added. Earlier in the day, Congress MLA Shafi Parambil visited Deepa at the agitation venue. He alleged that CPM and the government are treating MG University as a local committee of CPM. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mgu-researcher-skips-talks-with-collector-due-to-ill-health/articleshow/87544963.cms||---
---||Meerut||Diwali pollution: Taj Mahal ‘disappears’ in thick veil of smog||AGRA/MEERUT: The air quality index (AQI) touched the “severe” mark in Delhi-NCR, Agra and many places in western Uttar Pradesh on Friday, a day after Diwali. The pollution levels were such that the Taj Mahal was covered in a blanket of thick smog, making it barely visible, even from a distance of 100m. The AQI in Agra was recorded as “severe”, with the index, monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) touching 419 at 10am and 432 at 2 pm on Friday. Last year, the AQI on the day after Diwali in Agra was recorded at 347 (very poor). Agra has been witnessing “very poor” and “poor” air quality since the beginning of November. AQI levels have been 327 (November 1), 300 (Nov 2), 289 (Nov 3) and 280 (Nov 4). On Friday, the AQI was recorded about 150 notches higher than the previous day, mainly due to the bursting of firecrackers. Heavy smog descended on the NCR region as well with AQI ranging between 400 and 500 – marked as ‘severe’ -- in Baghpat (437), Bulandshahr (444), Ghaziabad (470), Meerut (435), Hapur (439), Vrindavan (448) and Noida (475). This comes despite the UP government’s decision to ban firecrackers in cities with poor air quality as well as restrictions on use of green crackers.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. Meanwhile, severe smog on Friday morning led to a pile up of vehicles on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway near Dasna in Ghaziabad. Around 40 vehicles collided with each other on both sides of the expressway due to almost zero visibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/diwali-pollution-taj-mahal-disappears-in-thick-veil-of-smog/articleshow/87544394.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Alone at Tallah home on Kali Puja night, 73-year-old woman attacked, robbed||KOLKATA: A 73-year-old woman, who was alone at her Tallah home on Kali Puja night as her daughter and son-in-law had gone out to offer puja, was attacked by unidentified men, who hit her on the head with a heavy object and made away with gold jewellery. Padma Mondal has been living at the Khelatbabu Lane house with her daughter, Nivedita, son-in-law, Sunil Shau, and grandson ever since the pandemic struck. The couple and their child had gone to Shau’s ancestral home at Ultadanga for Kali Puja and they returned around 8am on Friday, when they found the home ransacked and Mondal lying bleeding. They admitted her to RG Kar Hospital in a critical condition.' The local police, along with the anti-robbery unit of the detective department, have begun a probe. Loot seems to be the motive, but police are not ruling out a planned attack. “The couple left home for Ultadanga around 11pm on Thursday and Mondal retired to bed soon after,” police said. “Mondal’s daughter had locked the main door from outside as they were not qutie sure when they would return and did not want to wake the elderly woman up,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “The unidentified accused broke the lock and entered the house. They assaulted Mondal. Some gold ornaments are missing. Investigations are on.” DCP (North) Joyeeta Bose said they had collected CCTV footage. “The house was completely ransacked, indicating the accused were there to lay their hands on something or simply to loot,” she said. Lalbazar is especially concerned, given that the incident took place on Diwali night, when streets have greater presence of cops than usual. “From what we have gathered by talking to locals and checking CCTV footage, the incident seems to have taken place between 12.45 am and 1.45am. The accused might have been looking to target an empty house and as this one was locked from outside, they broke in, only to find someone at home. The victim might have tried to resist the accused, who attacked her. We are waiting for Mondal to recover a bit and recall the incident to us. It is also possible that the assailants were aware she was alone at home and so, the attack,” said an investigating officer. Police plan to draw a sketch of the accused, based on what Mondal can recall. This is the fourth major crime against senior citizens in the city in the past one month. While two senior citizens were murdered for gain on Kankulia Road in mid-October, a 91-year-old woman was killed at her Shakespeare Sarani apartment, also for gain. Another senior citizen was injured in a snatching attempt in Sinthee recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alone-at-tallah-home-on-kali-puja-night-73-year-old-woman-attacked-robbed/articleshow/87544965.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

However, the air quality index (AQI) in Patna was still better than Delhi. Track the pollution level in your cityChairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) Dr A K Ghosh said the AQI recorded in Delhi on Diwali night was 416, while it was 223 in Patna. Muzaffarpur and Gaya recorded AQI levels of 278 and 86, respectively, on Diwali night. Ghosh said the maximum level of PM (particulate matter) 10 at Patna was recorded at 1134 micrograms/cubic meter (mcm) near Taramandal. This alarming level of PM10 was found between 11pm and 6am. The level of PM10 at S K Memorial Hall and Gandhi Maidan during the same time period was recorded at 924 mcm and 976 mcm, respectively. The standard limit of PM10 for industrial, residential and rural areas was 100 mcm. “Another parameter in air quality is the PM2.5 level. The BSPCB team found that its concentration too jumped to 668 mcm near Eco Park, 642 mcm at Government High School in Patna City and 552 mcm at S K memorial Hall against the standard limit of 60 mcm,” said Birendra Kumar, public relations officer of the BSPCB. There was a normal rise in sulphur dioxide level. The maximum noise level of 120.5 decibel was recorded near Boring Road crossing on Diwali night. Kumar said both air quality and sound levels showed fast deterioration, mostly due to bursting of firecrackers. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-aqi-turns-poor-on-diwali-night/articleshow/87544968.cms||VK Tripathi

Speaking to the media in Kochi on Friday, Surendran said that the finance minister was deceiving people. The FM said that they had not collected taxes for five and a half years but also admitted that the state also received a large portion of the tax. Surendran said that there is public discontent against the inhumane attitude of the state government. The Left government should reduce taxes and not worry about whether this act will benefit the BJP as is being alleged. He said that the BJP will intensify its agitation against this anti-people stand of the Pinarayi government which has not reduced taxes. “The finance minister says that there is an economic crisis in Kerala. The financial crisis was caused by this government’s policies. The situation in Kerala is that the Centre is giving money to solve the revenue deficit of the state government. This is a government that must borrow even to pay salaries and pensions. Even the financial crisis caused by the state is being resolved only because of help from the Centre,” said Surendran. District president S Jayakrishnan was also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-to-intensify-protest-against-state-on-fuel-tax/articleshow/87544969.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bags with Diwali gifts miss flight from B’luru, reach after festival||Kolkata: A majority of passengers who flew to Kolkata from Bengaluru on an IndiGo flight five days ago did not get their bags on landing in the city due to a snag in the conveyor belt at Bengaluru airport. Though it was an irritant, the flyers left for home with the assurance that the luggage would be delivered to their residence the next day. But the bags did not reach even four days later, and many of the flyers, who were carrying Diwali gifts and goodies in their registered luggage, were incensed over the unusual delay of over 100 hours. The bags, along with the gifts inside, did not arrive before the festival. “I repeatedly told the airline staff I needed the bag delivered before Diwali as I was carrying gifts for my children. But they called me on Friday, a day after Diwali, to inform the bags would arrive by night,” said Entally resident Bharat Sharma, one of the several passengers whose bags did not get loaded due to a snag in the conveyor belt at Bengaluru airport. His luggage arrived on Friday evening. Deepak Joshi, who lives 2km from the airport, was also told the bags would be delivered to him the next day, November 1. In the past four days, Joshi has been to the airport three times and each time, he was told the bags were out for delivery. The airline’s helpline for lost luggage reportedly remained unavailable and a phone number given to him at the airport stayed switched off. On Thursday, Joshi got a call from the airline that a vendor would deliver the bag by Friday evening. The bags reached on Friday late afternoon. “It was sad the Diwali gifts didn’t arrive on time. I was also worried about important documents in the bag,” said Joshi. Snags at the check-in baggage belt at the Bengaluru airport on Sunday, October 31, had led to multiple delays in departure of IndiGo flights. The problem continued till Monday morning with IndiGo. Among those who Tweeted about it was author Amish Tripathi, whose two colleagues found their bags misplaced. IndiGo replied it was sorry for the inconvenience. “There are bags that are left behind and our team is working on priority to get them delivered at the earliest,” it said. Kempegowda International Airport issued a statement. “On October 31, 2021, the baggage system at BLR Airport failed for a short while but stabilized in a few minutes. The baggage system failure which lasted for about 15 minutes seems to have had a cascading effect with IndiGo trying their best to cope,” a spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bags-with-diwali-gifts-miss-flight-from-bluru-reach-after-festival/articleshow/87544971.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Both the state and central governments should end the tax exploitation on fuel. UDF will be forced to protest against the government if it is not willing to accept the popular demand, he said. When the Centre reduced the tax many state governments have come forward to reduce their share also to help the people. However, the state government here is taking an adamant stand against the wish of the people, which is not justifiable, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-flays-govt-for-not-cutting-tax-on-fuel/articleshow/87544974.cms||---

Even as Bhai Phonta or Bhai Dooj is celebrated two days after Diwali, Gokhale Road Bandhan, a support group for transpersons and LGBTQ community, organized their event a day earlier to send out the message of flexibility and inclusiveness, with both cisgenders and transgenders participating in it. The Union ministry of social justice and empowerment has tied up with Gokhale Road Bandhan to set up the city’s first such safe home at EM Bypass. Instead of sisters travelling to their brothers’ houses to pray for their long life and prosperity, performing artists like Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee applied sandal paste “phonta” or “tilaks” on the foreheads of the residents of Garima Griha. “We decided to have the event a day ahead of the Bhai Phonta to send out the message, breaking free from norms while taking part in tradition. Today, gender rules were broken and we were fellow humans as one applied the ‘phonta’ on the other,” said Ranjita Sinha (born ‘Ranjit’), secretary of both Gokhale Road Bandhan and Association of Transgender/Hijra in Bengal (ATHB).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trans-persons-soak-in-phonta-spirit/articleshow/87544973.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

According to Mani Sudarsanam, range officer, the female leopard aged around 3 years had attacked several dogs and other domestic animals in the village. The area comes under the Kochukoyickal forest station. The forest authorities laid the trap in the compound of a house in the village. The leopard was released in the forests after medical examination and found to be healthy. Since the village borders the forest there are lots of stray dogs.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Diesel price cut not enough to reduce freight, say truckers||NAGPUR: The excise duty cut by the Centre has made petrol and diesel cheaper by Rs 5.82 and Rs 12.18 a litre, respectively, in the city. On Friday, petrol was Rs 109.71 a litre and diesel Rs 92.53 a litre. At far off centres like Sironcha in Gadchiroli, petrol and diesel were being sold at Rs112.11 and Rs94.85, respectively. If commuters may have got a small respite from the rise in petrol prices rushing towards Rs120 a litre, truckers say the reduction in diesel price is not enough for a rollback in freight. As diesel is now within the Rs100 a litre mark, compressed natural gas (CNG), a green fuel, has now become costlier. CNG in the city was at Rs99.99 a litre. Vehicles that use CNG have a slightly higher mileage than those running on diesel. A further reduction in petrol and diesel prices could have been possible had the state government too announced a cut in VAT. Currently, VAT is charged at 15.96% on the value arrived after adding freight, excise and dealers’ commission on the base rate. The sudden cut has left dealers in losses, say the retail outlet owners. The fuel was purchased at a higher rate but now sold cheaper. Kukku Marwah of the Nagpur Truckers Unity said, “Prices of petrol and diesel have gone up by Rs28 and Rs35 a litre, respectively, in over a year. The current reduction is just for namesake. The transporters can afford reduction in freight only if diesel become cheaper by Rs20 a litre.” Petrol had crossed the Rs100 mark on May 29 touching Rs100.07. At that time diesel was already above Rs90, at Rs 90.67 a litre. By November, both the fuels became costlier by Rs15 and around Rs14, respectively. Now, even after the duty cut both petrol and diesel are costlier than the level in May. Marwah said that at present rate freight from Nagpur to Mumbai is Rs2,500 a tonne, Rs2,800 for Chennai and Rs4,000 for Kolkata and Rs3,500 for Delhi. “Ideally, diesel should be at Rs70 a litre. In that case the freight should come down by over Rs1,000 a tonne for many sectors,” said Marwah. Viren Thakkar of Logistics Parks (India) Private Limited said that the immediate impact of the reduction would only be seen next week. “However, the reduction in fuel prices is not enough to bring the desirable effect on the freight,” he said. Nitin Khara, chairman of Confidence Petroleum, a company in a Nagpur, said that the government should extend the tax benefit to green fuels like CNG also. Confidence Petroleum has CNG filling stations in Bengaluru and those for Auto LPG in Nagpur. The green fuel prices need to be competitive to incentivize it use. CNG is costlier by over Rs40 in Nagpur as compared to major cities because there is no city gas distributor (CGD) here. A CGD is the main supplier for a given area. A CGG can do forward booking from companies to ensure cheaper supply. At present, outlets have to buy at current prices from the marketing companies which makes CNG costly here. A round for CGD bidding is scheduled next month by the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PGNRB). On the other hand, auto LPG was at Rs76 a litre. LNG, another alternate fuel, is at Rs67 a litre. Pranav Sharma of Baidyanath Group, the lone suppler in Nagpur, said that they could manage to keep the price down by hedging the rates. A further reduction is expected as production increases. Autorickshaw driver Moreshwar Hulke said that reducing petrol prices to Rs109 only brings an additional saving of Rs20 more from a day’s earnings. Earlier, he used to be left with a margin of Rs150 to Rs200 after spending Rs500 on fuel. “Now, it may be just a little more,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diesel-price-cut-not-enough-to-reduce-freight-say-truckers/articleshow/87544977.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Delhi||Nearly 900 cases against minors closed, HC told||New Delhi: Delhi government has informed the high court that 898 cases of alleged petty offences against minors, which were pending and remained inconclusive for over one year, have been closed before the Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) The government said 800 cases of alleged petty offences, which were pending for over one year, were closed across six JJBs, and as per the data, there are only 34 instances where the enquiry was pending for more than six months but less than one year. Petty offences include those crimes for which the maximum punishment under the IPC or any other law for the time being in force is imprisonment up to three years. Taking note of the government’s stand, a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and A J Bhambhani, which had earlier pulled up the Delhi government for not complying with its direction to pull-the-plug on such cases, emphasised that closure of proceedings is not a “mere formality” and the rehabilitation and care of children in conflict with the law was at the core of the entire exercise. “This is not a mere formality. The idea is to not close but ensure that nobody in need of care and protection is overlooked,” the bench said. The government lawyer then told the high court that the government has the power to grant compensation to such children following a recommendation by the JJB and there even existed probation officers and a “Juvenile Justice Fund.” “We want to know the amount allocated to the JJ Fund in the last couple of years and how much is disbursed,” the bench noted, seeking the timeframe within which more JJBs would be set up in eleven city districts. During the hearing, the authorities informed the court that upon an analysis of the number of minors produced before several JJBs, around 1,000 minors could not be traced and assured that “once the process comes into force, no child would go missing.” The court remained sceptical and pointed out that “children don’t have time...You are hoping that there have gone back with their parents. What if they haven’t?” It also emphasised that as a first step in the system, if a juvenile is in conflict with the law, police must ensure their production before the concerned juvenile justice board (JJB) within 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nearly-900-cases-against-minors-closed-hc-told/articleshow/87545521.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The man was arrested reportedly on November 17 last year and later sent to jail after an "encounter" between him and the police, sources said. He had also sustained bullet injury in his leg while a police constable received gunshot wounds in his arm. A case was then registered by sub-inspector Sandeep Kumar posted in Shahpur police station against the accused under various IPC sections, including 307. In the FIR, Kumar said that during a routine checking drive the police tried to stop two suspects on a bike and the latter fired at them. A constable sustained bullet injury, while one of the suspects got injured after the police retaliated. The suspect was then arrested and admitted to a local hospital for treatment. An illegal country-made pistol and a stolen bike were found. A year later, on October 30, the court of the additional district judge acquitted the man for lack of evidence after hearing the arguments in detail. Defence lawyer, Yunus Chaudhry, said the encounter was shown to have occurred on November 17, however, medical records revealed it took place a day earlier. Besides, the sub-inspector also failed to recall the suspect's name and the place of the encounter before the court, Chaudhry added. On Friday, Neeraj Kant Malik, additional district government counsel, said," Several criminal cases against the accused Shadab are already under trial.

A bench of C Viswanath and Ram Surat Ram Maurya directed a Bengaluru-based real estate company to refund the entire amount of around Rs 3.5 crore with interest to a buyer who refused to take possession of a villa without completion certificate and filed a complaint against the builder. The panel passed the order after noting that there was delay of more than two years in construction and still the flat was not fully constructed and was not livable. “When the complainant went for taking possession, the builder insisted them to sign the paper, in which, it was written that they were receiving possession of the villa in fully ready condition, in the garb of alleged rule of the builder that if they wanted to take key of the villa, they had to sign it. This was an unfair trade practice. Offering possession with incomplete construction and without obtaining Completion Certificate does not justify the act of the builder,” it said. In this case, the buyer— Suman Kumar Jha and Pratibha Jha— had booked in 2013 a 3,900 sqft luxurious villa in the project launched by Mantri Technology Constellation Private Limited in Chennai. The builder had promised to complete the construction and hand over possession of the villa by May 2015. The couple had paid all instalments as per the construction-linked plan to the builder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/builder-cant-force-buyer-to-take-possession-of-incomplete-flat-ncdrc/articleshow/87546263.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The murder of the 28-year-old Noida-based advocate was the fallout of a property dispute, police said. A case was registered on the complaint of Nishant’s father, Prem Singh, against unknown persons and during preliminary investigation, it was found that Nishant had a dispute with some people over a chunk of land. According to the STF, Sandeep, who was planning to go into hiding to evade arrest, was nabbed from near Meerut bus stand, officials said. “During interrogation, Sandeep Pilwan confessed to have killed his cousin over a property dispute. On being threatened by Nishant that he would take the legal route, the accused got infuriated and shot him at his house on October 25,” states the STF press release. Nishant was rushed to a hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cousin-held-for-murder-of-noida-based-lawyer/articleshow/87544450.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||Retirement age row: Telangana HC dismisses pleas||HYDERABAD: Stating that promises made by chief ministers and governors do not become law of the land till they are officially converted into laws, the Telangana high court on Friday dismissed a batch of writ petitions that questioned the fixation of March 30, 2021, as cut-off date for implementing the GO that enhanced the retirement age from 58 to 61 in the state. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy pronounced its judgment to this effect after hearing elaborately the contentions raised by state government employees who retired a few days or weeks before the cut-off date. They contended that they were hopeful of reaping the benefits of this ‘enhancement’ because the chief minister had assured employees in various public meetings in the run-up to the December 2018 assembly elections followed by an assurance by the state governor in her Republic Day speech on January 26, 2021. Moreover, they said, the first Pay Revision Commission of the state submitted its report on December 31, 2020, duly recommending the enhancement of the age of superannuation for those who were serving the state. At least, the petitioners argued, that this report date should have been taken as the cut-off date. Even the bill passed by the assembly — Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Act, 2021 — for the purpose did not prescribe any timeframe from which it would come into operation, they said. But the state issued an order (GO No. 45 dated March 30, 2021), fixing this date as the cut-off date for availing the enhanced age benefit, the petitioners said and contended that this date had no relevance to the events that shaped the decision like the PRC report or the CM’s assurance made as early as December 2018. They urged the court to declare the Act and the GO illegal. The bench, however, said the dates of assurances or recommendations have no relevance. “It is the date fixed by the state after amending the Act through the legislature that is relevant,” the bench said, while refusing to interfere in the decision of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/retirement-age-row-hc-dismisses-pleas/articleshow/87544985.cms||---

The major grouse is SCB delay in updation of new house numbers in the general land record (GLR) data which would allow them to apply for bank loans and build super structures on the lines of SCB civil areas. According to SCB records, these 16 bazar areas came up during British-era to accommodate civilians to serve military troops and were allotted properties on lease under ‘Cantonment Land Administration Rules-1937’. Classified as ‘B-3’ land, GLRs were prepared and kept under custody of SCB and Defence Estates Office. Any alteration in GLR needs permission of Union ministry of defence (MoD). Residents complain that banks are refusing loans as new house numbers do not tally with the old ones in GLR. “The banks want an NoC from SCB,” said D Ramana, a resident of Bolarum Bazar, said. Shankar Goud, a resident of Picket Bazar, added: “If we want to build G+2 structure on the same premise by demolishing the century-old structures, we can’t do it unless SCB gives permission.” Recently, Picket Residents Welfare Society general secretary Jetty Umeshwar Rao urged defence secretary to issue orders to SCB to make alterations in GLRs. SCB deputy CEO Vijayakumar Balan Nair said, “To make alterations in GLRs of bazar areas it is MoD which takes a final decision.” An SCB official said new house numbering project was aimed at integrating key wings and authenticating property papers.

The blaze spread to the first floor of a building, where the family of the tent house owner, Pankaj Kumar, resides. It caused the LPG cylinder in the kitchen to explode. The woman, Alka, Pankaj's wife, died on the spot while his elder brother, Hemant, is battling for life in hospital. It took fire tenders nearly six hours to douse the flames. Three firemen were also injured. Police suspect that a spark from a firecracker may have set off the blaze.

When GHMC initiated GIS mapping of properties and synced it with the digital house numbering project, Secunderabad Cantonment Board officials, who were impressed with the neighbouring civic body’s idea, also decided to take up a similar exercise and proposed it five years ago. As the work was in progress, they suddenly halted it due to unknown reasons. GHMC has completed GIS mapping of over 90% properties. SCB has not even done 40%. “It would help us create an accurate database for attributes of all commercial and residential properties,” a GHMC official said.

Police said Sandhya Sardar might have been killed as there were strangulation marks on her. Police said they received a call around 7am on Friday that a woman was lying unconscious in a small ditch beside the pavement of Santosh Roy Road. She was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where she was declared brought dead. Her husband Shyamaprasad Sardar was then informed about the incident. Police said both Sandhya and her husband suffered from mental illness, as a result of which their two children lived with their maternal uncle. “Someone known to the couple seems be involved and the death took place at night. As both of them suffered from mental illness, they had no suitable source of income,” said an officer. “Preliminary opinion suggests death is due to strangulation. A case has been started,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. CCTV footage of Sakherbazar and Silpara areas are being scanned. DC (Behala) Swati Bhangalia said they were recording statements of those known to Sandhya and inquiring whether she had gone out on Kali Puja night.

---||Delhi||DUTA polls to see ad hoc teachers in fray this year||NEW DELHI: Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) elections, scheduled to be held on November 26, will also see ad hoc teachers contesting the polls this year. They said that the decision to contest teachers’ body polls was taken in a bid to make their voices heard. Shabana Azmi, who teaches political science at Zakir Hussain College, will be representing the ad hoc teachers and contest for the post of DUTA president. Stating that immediate absorption was one of the primary demands, Azmi, who has been working as an ad hoc for nearly a decade, said that thousands of teachers waiting for permanent positions in the varsity had not “received their dues.” “Ad hoc teachers at the university are suffering a lot. We have been teaching here for so many years and the workload is also immense. We are the backbone of the university, and yet nobody is paying attention. So this year, we thought of making our voices heard by contesting the elections,” Azmi said. The university currently has around 4,500 ad hoc teachers, many of whom have been serving for a long time. . “In the past, there have been instances where teachers who have worked for two decades got displaced. Even though our basic pay scale is similar to our permanent counterparts, we do not even receive increments or benefits like maternity leaves and so on. This happens despite the fact that we have the same educational qualifications,” she said. Reiterating that the December 5 Record of Discussions with the Centre in 2019 — where it was stated that all ad hoc and temporary teachers would be eligible for interviews — had to be implemented, Azmi said, “If we win, I would like to ensure that this letter is implemented immediately. We have been teaching for so many years and our experience should be counted. Currently, the future looks very bleak for the well-trained and experienced teachers at the university.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/duta-polls-to-see-ad-hoc-teachers-in-fray-this-year/articleshow/87545542.cms||---

All the bodies were found on the Noida-Agra route. The woman’s body bore several injury marks, just like those found on the bodies of the children, who were dumped within a 5-km stretch near milestones 74 and 79 in the Naujheel and Surir area in Mathura on Tuesday morning. Police said it appeared that the woman’s body had been thrown there two or three days ago. Shirish Chandra, superintendent of police (rural), said the deceased seemed to be about 35 years old, had a tattoo of “Om” (in Hindi) on her right hand and appeared to be married. The description of the woman and details of her identification marks have been circulated to neighbouring districts and states in a bid to identify her, he further said. Chandra added that so far, no one had come forward to claim the two children’s bodies either. Their post-mortem has been conducted and the report is awaited, he said. The SP also told TOI that plans are afoot to step up policing on the expressway and more CCTV cameras will be installed on the route to monitor the movement of vehicles. “We are working in this direction and will take help from other stakeholders if required,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/third-body-dumped-on-yamuna-e-way-in-3-days/articleshow/87544486.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||Covid unlikely to affect lungs among vaccinated: Expert||NAGPUR: Covid-19 may remain a mucosal (throat) illness rather than a parenchymal (lung) disease for fully vaccinated people now, said pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who is also a member of the district Covid Task Force. Dr Sarnaik said this trend has been seen now that a good number of people have been vaccinated, and even if cases rise or a third wave strikes, the virus may affect only surface lining of the windpipe and not the lungs. “The biggest advantage from vaccination being seen across the world is that the virus won’t be able to affect the lungs with severe disease. Covid-19 is now being divided into two types — parenchymal (involvement of lungs) and mucosal (surface or windpipe),” he said. Dr Sarnaik added the fear, without vaccine, seen during same period last year, has subsided. “Patients are not as keen on a test as they were during the second wave. This is the effect of vaccination. One may test positive too, but the disease is unlikely to spread further inside the lung, weaken it and affect gas exchange (oxygen level). This has nearly disappeared,” he said. Anecdotal references regarding negligible admissions and no requirement of oxygenated beds among those recently testing positive across the world have formed the basis for Dr Sarnaik’s claim. A consolidated data on mucosal and parenchymal patients can give a holistic picture, said pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat. “We had four Covid patients admitted recently. One of them had parenchymal lung involvement. Even among vaccinated, there can be both types of Covid patients,” said Dr Arbat. Yet, Dr Arbat agreed that the new Covid patients have less lung involvement. “Mucosal mean RT-PCR positive but lung not involved. Parenchymal means RT-PCR positive with lung involvement. A CT scan is needed to ascertain lung involvement. In the coming days, patients may have lung infected but it will be minimal. This is because people have antibodies and are vaccinated,” said Dr Arbat. He added the outbreak of H1N1 in 2014 was virulent but comparatively not many were affected. “As days pass, the virus loses its virulence. It’s a natural process. Similarly, the future Covid-19 outbreaks will be mild but they may have mucosal and some parenchymal involvement. But patients will recover,” he said. Dr Arbat added that there are also patients with bilateral pneumonia but are RT-PCR negative. “One such patient came to our hospital. He was critical but is recovering now. Such cases show people are getting affected but also recovering and maximum have very less involvement,” he said. Dr Sarnaik said it will also depend on new variants of Delta, if they come up, and how it affects vaccinated people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-unlikely-to-affect-lungs-among-vaccinated-city-pulmonologist/articleshow/87545017.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Air Quality Index (AQI) was 292 on Friday. However, it was better than previous years.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) media bulletin, the AQI in Ludhiana at 4pm Thursday was 209, which fell under poor category with possible health impacts as “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure”. The hourly data from 4pm Thursday till Friday morning showed pollution levels started rising from Thursday evening.The AQI was 208 by 5pm Thursday. It increased from 212 to 225 between 8pm and 10pm, when bursting of green crackers was allowed. The AQI was 242 by 12am Friday and 258 by 2am. It rose to 300 at 10am Friday and decreased to 296 by Friday noon. At 4pm Friday, it was 292.The previous year, the AQI on Diwali evening (at 4pm on November 14) was 300, which was in poor category. It increased to 307 by 5pm, which came under very poor category. Between 8pm and 10 pm, when green crackers were allowed, it rose from 321 to 332. A day after Diwali, the index was 345 at 4pm. In 2019, the AQI on Diwali was 239 at 4pm October 27. A day after the festival, it was recorded at 353.A Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) official said, “Many people burst crackers even after the deadline. Fall in AQI on Diwali and the day after this year is a good sign, as it shows decrease in pollution levels as compared with the previous years.”Residents said the authorities failed to enforce the rules.“Most of the people started bursting crackers 9.30pm to post-12am. It being an election year, the authorities did not crackdown on those flouting the 8pm-10pm time period. A positive aspect was that fewer children burst crackers. Previous years, police vehicles would use hooters after the deadline, which restrained people from bursting crackers. But this time, nothing was done. Elderly and children suffer because of rise in pollution,” said green activist Dr Amandeep Bains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-gasps-for-breath-as-air-deteriorates-to-worst-in-yr/articleshow/87543773.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Housefull! 1st since Covid struck, cinema halls full||NAGPUR: It seems that cinema halls will indeed end up with a ‘happy’ Diwali weekend as Friday set the cash registers ringing again, thanks to the release of multi-starrer movie — Sooryavanshi. For the first time since Covid-19 struck, cinema halls witnessed the ‘housefull’ phenomenon with at least six local theatres fully sold out. Manohar Wadhwani, a national level movie distributor said, “This is fantastic news for everyone because across the country cinema halls are witnessing footfalls. In Nagpur alone we had multiple housefull shows on Friday, which is a great sign for the sector.” In an earlier report of TOI, Wadhwani had mentioned that November 5 weekend will be a ‘blockbuster’ because of new releases. Wadhwani said, “People come for content. When we reopened earlier, there was no new content to show the masses hence the response was poor.” Cinema halls had been closed for months and got permission to reopen after relentless lobbying by associations. The reopening came with such strict protocols that many feared it may kill the buzz of movie watching experience. A cinema hall owner said, “No food or drinks allowed inside halls, is almost like taking away 50% of the fun. Second rule is of alternate seating, something which no other business follows. Do you have this in trains, bus, flights, restaurants etc? Still it is the public which has finally spoken out. They want to be back in cinema halls and were only waiting for a super hit movie.” Movie theatres across Nagpur witnessed heavy bookings for their afternoon slots, which may now emerge as the preferred time slot. Another theatre owner told TOI that government must now step in and ease the curbs. “New movie releases are lined up and till Christmas our schedule is packed. But we are operating with only 50% capacity, which in the most simple terms means that our potential revenue will continue to be half. The state government must understand that livelihoods of so many people are connected with this business,” said the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aa-rahi-hai-public-for-the-first-time-since-covid-19-struck-cinema-halls-sold-out/articleshow/87545038.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Police have recovered Rs 85,000, her Aadhaar card, some jewellery and her bank passbook from her handbag, lying nearby. Police suspect that she could either be a victim of honour killing or was murdered by the person with whom she was going to elope. Preliminary probe suggests that she was strangled to death. The girl’s father told police that his daughter went missing soon after Diwali prayers on Thursday night. She took some cash and her documents with her. He did not inform anyone that she was missing fearing social stigma. But he tried to find her on his own. OP Singh, Budaun SSP, who visited the spot, said, “The girl’s father suspects that his daughter was killed by a local man but is yet to lodge a complaint. He has sought time to consult his lawyer. We are scanning the call details of the girl and awaiting her post-mortem report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/21-yr-old-goes-missing-found-dead-with-rs-85k-near-body/articleshow/87544516.cms||---
---||Delhi||CBSE to conduct offline exams from November 16 for Classes X & XII||NEW DELHI: Even as parents and students have been campaigning against exams at institutional centres, the Central Board of Secondary Education issued detailed guidelines for Term 1 examinations for Class XII beginning from November 16 and for Class X from November 17. Offline exams will be conducted in nine subjects in Class X and in 19 in Class XII. The remaining subject exams will be held in groups to minimise learning loss. According to the guideline, the schools will have to print the optical mark reader (OMR) answer sheets provided by the board. Friday’s circular said, “CBSE will supply customised OMR online to the examination centres having details of the students permitted to appear in the examination. For printing of OMR, A4 size photocopy paper of good quality would be required. Schools will be allowed to download the OMRs for both Class X and XII as provided to them shortly.” The Delhi government school principals’ association had recently apprised the board of its inability to print such a large number of OMR sheets. AK Jha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, said, “It will be difficult for us to print the papers. The principals’ association had requested CBSE to provide us the question and answer sheets like earlier.” Tania Joshi, principal, The India School, said, “The board had enquired about our printing capacity. So, I guess it will send us encrypted question papers.” Each school will be provided samples of the OMR for practice. The questions will be of objective type in the Term 1 exams, which will be for 90 minutes with 30 minutes of additional time. Given the winter schedules, the exams will begin at 11.30am rather than the usual 10.30am. With 26,000 schools in India affiliated to CBSE and 26 abroad, the education board will fix exams centres in such a manner that neither students nor schools will face problems. “As the examination would be conducted in almost all the schools, hence, to maintain the sanctity and safety of the examination, there is a need to appoint an observer at each and every examination centre,” the circular noted. “The scale for appointment of observers will be one observer for up to 500 students and two for more than 500 examinees. City coordinators will be responsible for appointing observers at all examination centres and will ensure availability of observers on each day of the examination as per decided scale.” Meanwhile, parents and students are demanding they be given the option between online and offline exams. Yuvraj Sharma, a Class XII student, said, “Given the pandemic, the Delta variants of the coronavirus and the threat of a third wave for unvaccinated minors, no education board should force students to sit for offline examinations. There is neither a guarantee of safety on the board’s part or from the school. It’s a matter of our lives and health. Therefore, we request the board to hold examinations in both modes and leave the choice to us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-to-conduct-offline-exams-from-nov-16-for-classes-x-xii/articleshow/87545548.cms||Shradha Chettri

Police said the accident took place at 4am when the driver of an empty private bus on its way to Noida dozed off and the vehicle collided with a car coming from the opposite direction. Of the five occupants in the car, four died on the spot while one was critically injured and admitted to a local hospital in Mathura, and then moved to Agra. Superintendent of police (rural) Shireesh Chandra said the deceased’s bodies have been sent for post-mortem and further investigations are underway. The deceased have been identified as Shiv Sagar Yadav (27), his mother Premlala (55), cousin brother Gaurav (29) and younger brother Mohinesh’s friend Aaryan Chaudhary (22), who belonged to Ghaziabad and bus driver Balwant Singh, a resident of Punjab’s Pathankot. Mohinesh is in the ICU of a private hospital in Agra. Shiv Sagar’s sister Sandhya, told TOI that her brothers and mother had left Ghaziabad around 1:30am and were heading towards Etawah to meet their relatives. “All of us had celebrated Diwali together and after that, my brother asked my mother to accompany him to meet relatives in Etawah.

The banned bull fight in which the animals (male buffaloes) lock horns is a yearly event in the city held by the milkmen community on the occasion of Bali Pratipada.

Besides decorating the bulls with colourful paintings, the owners also administer the animals liquor to charge them up. The sport is being held for nearly last five decades in the name of religious tradition in the city. Betters eye it as a big opportunity to make quick bucks. Two bulls charge at each other during the bloody fight that lasts until one of the animals limps away in defeat. On Friday, hundreds of spectators witnessed seven bull fights.

---||Hyderabad||Spotlight back on BC vote-bank after Eatala Rajender's Huzurabad victory||HYDERABAD: The victory of Eatala Rajender in Huzurabad bypoll has put the spotlight back on BC vote-bank in the state. Apart from Eatala, even BJP state president Bandi Sanjay is from the BC community which gives enough ammunition to the saffron party to woo the BC electorate. The BCs comprise over 52 per cent population in Telangana but their vote share is divided among various political parties. The ruling TRS enjoyed a majority chunk of the BC vote until its juggernaut was stopped not once but twice by the BJP — once in Dubbak and more recently in Huzurabad. Both times, the TRS lost the race as a large number of BC votes and those of other sections, which was traditionally a Congress vote-bank, have shifted to the BJP. Little wonder, senior Congress leaders advised the party leadership to focus on taking up BC community-related issues as the saffron party may go big by using Eatala as its ‘BC trump card’ in the run-up to the 2023 assembly elections. Political anlaysts said Eatala cut into the BC vote-bank of TRS in Huzurabad, cashing in on the heart burn among BC voters that CM KCR did not dole out ‘BC Bandhu’ on the lines of Dalit Bandhu before the bypoll. However, Sanjay said it was the victory of BJP as Eatala and BJP cannot be seen as separate factors. While Congress will be taking up BC-related issues, even the ruling TRS is under pressure to win back its BC voters. Analysts said the TRS, BJP and Congress will now target the BC voters, who have emerged crucial after the announcement of Dalit Bandhu and the result of Huzurabad bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spotlight-back-on-bc-vote-bank-after-eatala-huzurabad-victory/articleshow/87545088.cms||Roushan Ali

Large heaps of waste, especially that of firecrackers, could be seen on the city streets on Friday. Since the civic body worked with a slim workforce on the festive day, regular waste had also accumulated on the streets. City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said the garbage collection vehicles would make additional trips to clear the waste. He said they had instructed sanitary workers to collect cracker paper and polythene waste separately to make it easier for disposal. Pointing out that they hadn’t deployed additional workforce to clear garbage, the officer said the existing workers would work for longer hours. “A section of them had worked on the festive day as well. They will be given compensatory off later. It had taken a week to collect the garbage that was generated during the Ayudha Puja. Diwali waste will be cleared sooner,” Kumar said. Another corporation official said the city had generated 600-800 tonnes more waste during the Diwali. “We collect anywhere between 800-850 tonnes garbage on a normal day. Now that the festival has left behind a large quantity of waste, we are planning to collect around 1,000 tonnes waste a day so that the entire garbage could be cleared from the streets in three to four days.” P Prema, a resident of Saibaba Colony, said she had cleared the waste accumulated on the road in front of her house and kept the same on the roadside to make it easier for the conservancy workers to clear the same. “Sanitary workers did not clear it on Friday. If it isn’t cleared soon, the waste will again spread out to the road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-speeds-up-work-to-clear-festival-waste/articleshow/87545082.cms||---

---||Trichy||BJP to besiege Theni collectorate on Nov 8||Trichy: BJP state president K Annamalai has said his party will lay siege to the Theni district collector’s office on November 8 morning over the Mullaperiyar dam issue. “Three days ago, shutter gates of the dam were opened by revenue and water resource ministers of Kerala when the water level was at 136 feet. It will affect the farmers in five districts of Tamil Nadu,” Annamalai said. Stating that the dam is under the control of the Tamil Nadu government, Annamalai alleged that the Theni district collector and one of the state ministers usually participate in the dam opening event, but the recent incident had happened without their presence.“Without any prior information, Kerala opened the shutters. Tamil Nadu government is silent, there is no strong reprisal to retrieve the state’s rights,” Annamalai said. He also claimed that DMK and its communist allies have deceived farmers in the five southern districts for their political benefits. “Not sure whether Kerala had unilaterally opened the dam or it had informed Tamil Nadu government. But, on many occasions in the past, the water level in Mullaperiyar has reached 142 feet in 2014, 2015 and 2018,” Annamalai said. Only when the water level reaches 142 feet, farmers in southern districts will get 10tmc of water, he added. “In 2024, chief minister M K Stalin is dreaming for deputy prime minister post with the help of communist parties in Kerala. To gain the support of the Kerala MPs, it appears that the state government has given up the rights of the state,” Annamalai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bjp-to-besiege-theni-collectorate-on-nov-8/articleshow/87545599.cms||---

These train services were existing in the same section before gauge conversion. The MP said people in his constituency were planning for an agitation against the step-motherly treatment meted out to Kinathukadavu and Pollachi railway stations which are part of Palakkad division. Citing the increasing demand to merge these two stations with either Madurai or Salem railway divisions in Tamil Nadu, the MP sought adequate steps to resume train services. He also raised objection on the alleged attempts by the railway authorities to close the Kinathukadavu station by redeploying staff to other stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pollachi-mp-seeks-resumption-of-train-services-writes-to-drm/articleshow/87545094.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Industry bodies ask state govt also to cut fuel prices further||COIMBATORE: Welcoming the Union government’s move to slash prices of petrol and diesel by reducing excise duty, industry representatives have urged the state government to take steps to bring down the prices further. The cut in fuel prices will offer relief to consumers and spur economic growth, president of the local chapter of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry C Balasubramanian said. “This will help farmers cultivating rabi crops, ease inflation and boost consumption. States like Gujarat, Assam, Tripura and Goa also promised price cut and Karnataka announced petrol price cut by Rs 12 and diesel by Rs 17, besides Uttar Pradesh, which has announced a tax cut of Rs 7 per litre on petrol and Rs 2 per litre on diesel. The Tamil Nadu government should also come forward to reduce the prices,” he said. Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (Teama) president M P Muthurathinam said fuel price rise impacts the cost in every stage of production, besides transportation. “Most of the export units are operating with generators during power cuts, which add up to their fuel costs. The state government should look in to the possibility of bringing down fuel prices further as it did a few weeks ago. Bangladesh remains competitive to Indian textiles in the international market and fuel price rise has been making it difficult to keep the cost under control,” he said. Besides the cost of fuel, the Centre should also take steps to regulate the uncertain nature of the cost of raw materials, said president, Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association M V Ramesh Babu. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industry-bodies-ask-state-govt-also-to-cut-fuel-prices-further/articleshow/87545090.cms||---

Restrictions in usage of harmful chemicals in the crackers has kept the air quality satisfactory. We will conduct a study a similar air quality level study for a week post Diwali,” a senior TNPCB official told TOI.

Being the first person from the tribal hamlet on the outskirts of the city to complete schooling, Sangavi had cleared NEET this year. The minister, who visited her at her residence on the day along with collector G S Sameeran and other officials, assured to offer all support to her and her hamlet. “It is the result of her two-year long struggle to realize her dream of getting an MBBS seat. She is now a role model for her community and many children will be motivated to go to schools. Parents will also be motivated to encourage their wards to pursue higher education,” Kayalvizhi said. The minister said she personally wanted to meet Sangavi and congratulate her for her achievement. Pointing out that tribal people were still remaining backward compared to the scheduled caste people, she said lack of education was the major barrier. “If they get educated, the tribals can come up in life.” The minister interacted with the families in the hamlet to learn about their needs and promised appropriate steps to fulfil them.

If the situation continues, the farmers fear they will not be able recover their investments. Ulhas Velip, a farmer from Gaondongrim, said that standing crop has been damaged owing to the precipitation. Canacona zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naik Gaunkar said that the unseasonal rainfall will adversely affect farmers. Gaunkar said that besides Gulem, farmers from Gaondongrim and Loliem Polem had commenced harvesting their crops. “Mechanised farming had helped bring some tracts of fallow land under cultivation in some patches of Canacona where paddy fields are situated on level ground, but the unseasonal rain has put paid to our efforts,” said a group of farmers from Cotigao. Another farmer from Devbhag said that after harvesting his field, he had planned to provide hay to some shack owners, and had even accepted advance payment.

A senior DPCC official said, “All the C&D sites, which have been closed down on Friday, are over 500 square metre. They include sites of both government and private agencies.” Another official said, “On the day subsequent to Diwali, AQI deteriorated to ‘severe’ category.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Till schools reopen for all, teacher hiring to be on hold||NAGPUR: Many school teachers who either lost their jobs or did not get the annual contract renewed due to the Covid-19 induced financial crisis, may have to wait till 2022-23 academic session to be back on pay rolls. School owners tell TOI that unless state government allows reopening of physical classrooms from nursery onwards, it will be “financially difficult” for them to reinstate teachers. A multi-branch school trustee said, “It’s very important for every school to get its students back on campus. Without this there won’t be any need for sports teachers, music teachers and the contractual staff which was used as a back-up. Right now we are in a condition where even the staff on payroll itself is not being utilized to their full potential. So, new hiring for the current academic session is out of the question for almost all the schools unless full reopening happens.” A few days ago, CBSE school teachers too were complaining about being called to school even though there was no work. Deepali Dably, founder-president of CBSE Schools Staff Welfare Association (CSSWA), said, “After online classes get over around noon or so, many teachers are made to stay back till 4pm even though there is no work. Those who conduct classes from home have to report to school after that.” TOI tried to speak with a few school trustees on record, but they did not wish to be identified. “Again it will start the whole fee thing. Because of online classes many parents have not paid fees,” said a trustee. According to the trustee, the most common practice among defaulters is to pay up to 70% of the dues and move on the next session. “Then they deposit 25% or so of the current year’s fee and if asked for previous dues, they go and complain. And we are well aware that fees won’t come once we spot this pattern in parents,” the trustee said. Another trustee said that fee recovery will jump if physical classes start. “With that cash inflow, schools can look to hire more staff and increase salaries of teachers who faced cuts,” he said and added, “All in all, hiring of teachers is completely dependent on physical classes resuming for all and the eventual increased fee recovery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/till-schools-reopen-for-all-teacher-hiring-to-be-on-hold/articleshow/87544639.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Around 600 bulls and a large number of bull tamers took part in the sport which was organised in connection with Diwali. Revenue and police officials stopped the event halfway through, stating that the sport was organized without getting prior permission and booked cases against 10 villagers. According to sources, it is usual for manjuvirattu to be organized every year in view of Diwali festival in the village. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event was not held in the last two years. Although the state government had announced various relaxations following the corona cases coming down in recent days, the government did not state anything about conduct of jallikattu or majuvirattu, sources added. Around 600 bulls from Pudukottai, Theni, Trichy, Madurai, Dindigul and Sivagangai participated in the event. A large number of people converged on the ground from across several districts in and around Pudukottai and attempted to tame the bulls. Unlike the conventional jallikattu event where the bulls are running inside the confined area, bulls run in a haphazard manner among the crowd in manjuvirattu. During the event, G Karuppaiah 52, of Parali in Pudukottai district succumbed to grievous injuries after a bull which was let loose in the ground gored him, police said. On information that the event had been conducted without getting prior approval, village administrative officer Palaniyappan lodged a complaint with the police. Thirumayam tahsildar Pravina Mary rushed to the spot and ordered to stop the event abruptly. Based on the official’s complaint, Panayapatti police registered cases against the organisers under various sections of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-gored-to-death-in-manjuvirattu-held-in-pudukottai/articleshow/87545603.cms||---

Apart from the wet weather, awareness drives taken out by the fire department also helped keep the districts safe. Among southern districts, only three minor fire calls were received - two in Virudhunagar district and one call in Ramanathapuram district. There were no fire calls in Theni, Sivaganga, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts. While Madurai district received nine fire calls due to crackers during Diwali festival last year, zero calls were reported in the district this year. For two days before Diwali, substantial rain had lashed Trichy district. “Wet conditions in the thatched huts and flammable materials, reduced our workload,” Melchio Raja, station officer, Cantonment fire station told TOI The deputy director of fire and rescue services, southern region, N Vijayakumar said rainfall was reported in most of the districts a few days before the festival which resulted in minimal fire calls this year. Another reason was the fire and rescue services personnel having conducting 387 awareness programs in nine districts. Official sources said that only eight cases of minor injuries while bursting crackers were reported in Madurai city this year during Diwali. Officials in Trichy said that the change in bursting time of crackers also restricted aerial fireworks between 6 pm and 9 pm. Increased awareness was another reason for the fall in number of fire accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/a-diwali-sans-fire-accidents-in-trichy-and-madurai-dists/articleshow/87545601.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Nagpur||Consumer forum slaps Rs26k cost on MSEDCL for severing supply||Nagpur: In a landmark order, the Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum here slapped Rs 26,000 cost on the MSEDCL for disconnecting power supply of a poor farmer woman. A bench comprising president Vasudeo Patil and members Smita Chandekar and Avinash Prabhune observed that this case was filed due to respondents’ indifference towards the customer and disregard for legal provisions. The commission stated it is of the clear view that error in service of respondents is indisputably proved. “The complainant had to endure a lot of mental, physical and emotional hardship due to defect in the service of the opposing party and had to file a complaint,” the judges said. The judges clarified that financial and other losses incurred by MSEDCL should be investigated by competent authority and Rs26,000 fine should be recovered from guilty employees while the report should be sent within three months. They ordered a judgment copy to be sent to the chief engineer to prevent recurrence of such lapses. The original complaint was filed by Mirabai Shiwankar, a resident of Kalmeshwar in Nagpur district. After her death, her two sons Dhyaneshwar and Moreshwar were named in the case. According to the complainants, MSEDCL issued them a bill of Rs1,900 in September 2018. After their protests, the bill was adjusted to Rs990 which they paid. In the next month, they again received a bill for Rs 1,720, which was then adjusted to Rs600 after negotiations between both the parties. In December, they received a Rs1,500 bill carrying earlier arrears, which the Shiwankar family paid in full, as per the complainants. However, on January 24, 2019, MSEDCL disconnected their power supply. The complainants then approached the forum contending that they were not issued any prior notice for disconnection. Praying for restoration of the power supply, they argued that MSEDCL issued inflated bills based on faulty meters and ignored the fact that their consumption was low. Opposing their contentions, the respondents including MSEDCL’s chief, deputy and junior engineers, pointed out that there was irregularity in the bill payments by the complainants and they had issued a notice on November 9, 2018, under the Electricity Act, before snapping the power supply. While conducting a recovery drive in January 2019, it was found out that the complainants had illegally reconnected power connection, thus indulging in its theft, said the respondents and added that even a police complaint was lodged against them at Sadar police station. The judges made it clear that complainants paid less amount in every bill, but wondered how MSEDCL had granted them exemption and under which authority. “The respondents did not submit any admissible office document or evidence. If it had indeed cut off the power supply, then on what basis the electricity bill was paid showing the consumption of 114 units in that period. The notice issued by MSEDCL is erroneous and illegal and does not apply to the complainant. Therefore, even the snapping of the power supply is illegal.” According to them, the law enforcement agencies need to take special care while providing services to the customers and if they themselves violate it and abuse their rights, the abuse needs to be taken more seriously and punished. “If the MSEDCL senior officers had intervened in time, it would have been possible to resolve the complaint easily. It seems that the officers concerned do not have adequate supervision and control over employees. The respondents had to bear financial loss due to the defect in their service and, therefore, the financial burden would fall indirectly on other power consumers in the state,” the judges said. # What Forum Said * Case filed due to MSEDCL’s indifference towards customer and disregard for legal provisions * Error in service of respondents is indisputably proved * If MSEDCL cut off power supply, on what basis electricity bill was paid * Complainant had to endure a lot of mental, physical and emotional hardships due to defective service * Competent authority to probe lapses and recover Rs26,000 fine from guilty employees * Law enforcement agencies need to take special care while providing services to customers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/consumer-forum-slaps-rs26k-cost-on-msedcl-for-severing-supply/articleshow/87544644.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

While the number of eye injury cases have been on a decline over the last few years, figures were slightly higher than last year. In 2020, 53 people suffered eye injuries as against 76 this year. Several cases were reported among onlookers and people passing by on roads when a stray cracker hit them in the eye. Venugopal (30), who was rushed to Sarojini Devi Eye hospital on Friday, said he was passing by when sparks from a firecracker caught him. “I was very careful while crossing the road, but it happened suddenly,” he said. The 76 cases reported this year were from just two major tertiary care centres in the city, Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital and LV Prasad Eye Institute. Among the injured were some toddlers also. Of the 42 cases recorded at the Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, six were serious in nature, requiring surgical intervention. “The six patients, who suffered serious injuries, were taken for surgery. In one of the cases, the cornea was affected,” said duty resident medical officer, Nafisa Begum. The LV Prasad Eye Institute figures showed that 34 cases were reported between November 3 and November 5. “These are the cracker injury patients. Four of them were serious injuries and advised surgery, and one patient was advised examination under anaesthesia, but no threat to sight was reported and none of them lost the eyesight,” read a statement from the LV Prasad Eye Institute. Several cases were also reported at private hospitals, although consolidated numbers were not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/higher-eye-injuries-this-diwali-76-land-in-hospitals/articleshow/87545134.cms||---

Besides firecracker waste, the roads outside several shops were littered with used flowers, banana leaves and branches. For instance, most road corners in Monda Market, RP Road and SP Road in Secunderabad, areas in Trimulgherry, Karkhana, Bowenpally and Picket in Secunderabad Cantonment, Ameerpet, SR Nagar, Yousufguda, Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills, Khairatabad and Kukatpally and other parts of the city had piles of festival waste. As per the norms, the civic body takes up a mass cleaning drive a day after Diwali, however, this time around, the roads were left uncleared. “The belief that flowers that have been used for special pujas by shopkeepers on the occasion of Diwali must not be removed on a Friday and the fact that it is a labour holiday could be the reasons behind the mess remaining on the roads,” a senior GHMC official told TOI. Meanwhile, in certain areas in SR Nagar, Kalyan Nagar and Vengalrao Nagar in Ameerpet, a few outsourced sanitation workers cleaned the bylanes in residential localities and lifted the waste. B Srinivas Reddy, zonal commissioner, Secunderabad, said, “The exact quantity of trash that has been lifted will be known on Saturday only.” He added that no special cleaning drive will be taken up and the sanitation workers will attend to their duties as per the routine. Meanwhile, no case was registered against those selling illegal firecrackers. As per Supreme Court orders, the GHMC had banned illegal crackers and clarified that only green firecrackers would be allowed. When contacted, in-charge of GHMC anti-encroachments cell, Shyam Kumar, said, “There were no instructions regarding booking of cases against violators from the GHMC commissioner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cracker-waste-layers-roads-sanitation-staff-absent/articleshow/87545138.cms||Sunil Mungara

The accused, who smashed them with a boulder either to steal money or over minor tiff, was out on bail in a similar murder case of 2019. The accused, Mohd Qadeer from Borabanda, was picked up by cops on November 1 for killing two men near Nampally on October 31. During questioning, Qadeer, who is a labourer, also revealed that he had killed another man with a boulder on October 15. Prior to this, he was arrested by Nampally police in December 2019 for killing a beggar in a similar manner. Hyderabad commissioner Anjani Kumar dubbed him a ‘psychopathic killer’. “We will initiate steps to detain him under the PD Act and try to get a conviction when he is in judicial remand,” joint CP AR Srinivas said. On November 1, a tiffin centre worker from Bazarghat alerted police about a man lying in a pool of blood in front of his shop. Another man was found dead near Nampally railway station in a similar fashion. Police zeroed in on Qadeer after checking CCTV footage. The accused, who sleeps on a footpath near Ek Minar Mosque in Nampally, confessed that he bludgeoned the first victim with the boulder and stole Rs 150 and a liquor bottle. From there he went to Nampally railway station at 3.30am where he found a labourer, Khaja, sleeping in auto trolley. “Qadeer asked Khaja to give him some space to sleep and when Khaja refused, he picked up a boulder and killed him,” Anjani Kumar said. About two weeks before these murders, on October 15, the accused had bludgeoned a 45-year-old beggar at Murgi Market in Nampally when the victim refused to give him money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/serial-killer-labourer-held-for-3-murders-in-2-weeks-in-city/articleshow/87545137.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ocugen seeks USFDA nod for Covaxin for children||HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech’s US and Canada partner Ocugen Inc has filed an emergency use authorisation (EUA) request with the US drug regulator for using Covaxin on children aged 2 to 18 years. The World Health Organisation (WHO) granted emergency use listing to the Indigenous Indian vaccine only on November 3 for people aged 18 years and above, with the exception of pregnant women. Ocugen’s submission to the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) seeking EUA for paediatric use comes even as its developer, Bharat Biotech, has submitted data from the children’s trial to the Drugs Controller General of India and is awaiting an EUA. The paediatric EUA submission is based on the results of the immuno-bridging clinical trial that on 526 children aged 2 to 18 years and demonstrated comparable neutralising antibody response as seen in a large adult Phase-3 clinical trial conducted in India, Ocugen said in a regulatory filing on Friday. Covaxin was evaluated in three age groups — 2 to 6 years, 6 to 12 years and 12 to 18 years — with all participants receiving two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine 28 days apart. Giving details of the results of the children’s trials conducted in India from May 2021 to July 2021, Ocugen said more than 90% of the seroconversion rates were observed for antibody titers against S1, RBD, N proteins and wild-type neutralising antibodies, which suggests similar protection in children as that demonstrated in adults older than 18 years. Ocugen pointed out that “no serious adverse events or hospitalizations were observed in the Phase 2/3 pediatric study of Covaxin, including no events of special interest such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome, anaphylactic reactions, myocarditis, pericarditis, and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia”. These adverse effects were also not observed in the surveillance data collected in India either following the administration of over 59 million doses of Covaxin in adults, it added. Ocugen said all other adverse events were mild or moderate in nature and were generally resolved within 24 hours. Dr Shankar Musunuri said: “Our research suggests that people are seeking more choices when selecting a vaccine, especially for their children… if authorized, we hope to offer another vaccine option to protect children as young as 2 years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ocugen-seeks-usfda-nod-for-covaxin-for-children/articleshow/87545132.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Sources in Rajbhavan confirmed that the file of Kaushik was still with the governor and she could not `study’ the file as she was busy. “If the governor sent back the file and the government insists, she has no option but to accept the nomination of the government unless it is against the prescribed norms. There is no time limit or deadline for the governor to approve or reject the nomination on any file,” an official in the CMO said. A month ago, the governor said she was studying the government’s recommendation on Kaushik as an MLC. Under the governor’s quota, only distinguished persons should be recommended. It was three months ago, the TRS government had recommended the name of Kaushik to the legislative council under the governor’s quota. TRS president and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is yet to respond on governor not clearing the file regarding Kaushik’s nomination. There are rumours in the council that Kaushik’s name will be dropped for the MLC seat under the governor’s quota and that he may be fielded as one of the candidates under the MLA quota. Sources said KCR cannot go back on his promise or accommodate him in another nominated post as the party cannot blame Kaushik alone for the party candidate’s defeat in Huzurabad. The TRS had poached Kaushik from Congress in the midst of Huzurabad by-poll as the party thought his hold over the assembly constituency could come in handy for its win. Kaushik had secured 61,000 votes against Eatala Rajender, who was then in the TRS, in the 2018 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kaushiks-fate-as-mlc-still-uncertain/articleshow/87545140.cms||Koride Mahesh

Police identified the accused as M Nagarajan alias Kallanai Guna. Complainant C Senthilkumar of Renga Nagar said Sivakumar, a friend and contract worker at a government hospital, had asked him to arrange a government job for his relative Nagamani, a BE graduate, with the help of Nagarajan whom he already knew. The three of them approached Nagarajan in 2017 when he asked for Rs 25 lakh to get an assistant executive engineer post in the electricity board. They settled for Rs 20 lakh, and subsequently, Nagamani and his father Mamnundi handed over a cheque for Rs 5 lakh as token amount to Nagarajan in the presence of Sivakumar and Senthilkumar. Thereafter, they gave him Rs 7 lakh in cash, police said. However, Nagarajan did not arrange any job. When asked about it, he threatened Senthilkumar with dire consequences. Senthilkumar lodged a complaint with city crime branch police which registered a case and booked Nagarajan under sections 417 and 420 IPC. He was arrested and remanded at Musiri sub-jail after being produced in court. A few more cheating cases were pending against Nagarajan, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/one-held-for-cheating-job-aspirant-of-rs-12l/articleshow/87545604.cms||---

The team has been formed in tune with Special Olympics Bharat (SOB), said its director and secretory Prasanna Balaji. SOB is accredited by the ministry of youth affairs and sports as a national federation in the priority category for the development of sports for people with intellectual disabilities.  “A total of 300 students are studying in BSc physical education and sports science in our college. Of them, there are 14 students with learning disability. These students are given training along with other regular students and a unified football team has also been formed. The coaches at NCT taking care of the special handball team will help the teammates develop their skills with in-depth knowledge and training. Meanwhile, the coaches will also help to facilitate the interaction between the athletes and the partners of the unified team to promote inclusion and meaningful involvement of all teammates,” Balaji said. Training will be given to them to develop their physical fitness, demonstrate courage and experience joy , he added. Recently, the state school education minister, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, inaugurated a chapter for Tamil Nadu Special Olympics Bharat at the college and congratulated the authorities for taking the effort to impart training to the special team, which consists of the 14 students. Special Olympics is separate from Paralympics. Special Olympics athletes are people of all skill levels with learning disability, cognitive delay or development disability, whereas Paralympics athletes are people from 10 categories of physical impairment, college authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/college-forms-handball-team-for-those-with-learning-disabilities/articleshow/87545605.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana may not cut VAT on fuel anytime soon||HYDERABAD: The state government may not slash the Value Added Tax (VAT) on diesel and petrol any time soon despite a clamour for reduction following a cut in duty on both fuels by Centre a day ahead of Diwali. According to highly placed government sources, the state believes that its VAT was not extremely high when compared to many other states that impose an extra cess too. Telangana does not have a cess. The state charges 35% VAT on petrol and 27% VAT on diesel. Also, the government has to implement several welfare initiatives, such as Dalit Bandhu, which require a significant amount of the state’s own revenue. The state earns nearly Rs 8,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore from annual petrol and diesel sales, which form a big portion of the state’s own income after liquor. Following the Centre’s duty cut, fuel prices have come down in the city too. Diesel prices have dropped to Rs 94 from the earlier Rs 107. Petrol, though still above the 100-mark, is now at Rs 108 from the earlier price of Rs 114. The high fuel prices were also a hot topic during the just-concluded Huzurabad bypoll which was won by BJP’s Eatala Rajender. During the campaign, there were heated exchanges in the media between Eatala and finance minister T Harish Rao over the prices and tax charged by state and central government. On Friday, the state BJP unit demanded that TRS government too follow the BJP-ruled state governments and decrease VAT on fuel. The price cuts, however, haven’t enthused the general public, with the common refrain being that they were still way high. “First of all, the prices were already astronomical and not in tune with international prices. What is the point in dropping them now, I will be happy only when the prices constantly fall,” K Sekhar Gupta, an IT professional, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-may-not-cut-vat-on-fuel-anytime-soon/articleshow/87545142.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Immigration firm told to refund Rs 1.1 lakh||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here directed Kansas Overseas Careers to pay a total of about Rs 1.1 lakh to a consumer for failing to refund the amount paid for immigration service after he had decided not to avail their services. Liyaqath Baig, the complainant, submitted that he had paid Rs 69, 620 to Kansas Overseas Careers towards Canada immigration services on July 26, 2017. Owing to his health issues, he said that he had decided to drop his plans to immigrate and added that as he could not avail any services of the firm since the time of registration, he asked the firm to refund the amount paid. Claiming that the firm failed to refund the amount to date, he filed the complaint seeking compensation. The opposite party, meanwhile, denied the allegations made in the complaint and expressed its willingness and readiness to provide the services to the complainant as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. It claimed that once the agreement is signed by the complainant he cannot change his mind and decide to withdraw from the process. The firm stated that it gave an introduction call after initiating the process for the purpose of educating the complainant on the basic level of client service before commencing the actual process. The opposite party further said it had initiated the process and imparted knowledge about the company policies and procedures in providing assistance to the complainant and sent emails on process orientation, checklist, and others. During the trial, from the documents submitted, the bench inferred that the terms and conditions of the said agreement were not explained nor was the complainant allowed to go through the same and was forced to sign on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/immigration-firm-told-to-refund-rs-1-1l/articleshow/87545149.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: In absence of clear info, free second Covid-19 dose hard to get for many||HYDERABAD: While on the one hand the state has been urging all to come forward and take the free second dose, many people, especially from the low-income group and the old, have been struggling to get it in absence of clear information on government-run camps, mobile vans or availability at designated centre. The paid ones, however, are easily available in private hospitals. Camps, mobile vans and even local health centres have been providing vaccination in the state, but many have missed the dates either due to lack of awareness on where and when it was being provided or inability to go on the specified date. The problem is acute for daily wagers and house helps while struggling to earn their daily bread. For them, it has become a difficult task to chase the second dose on app or even physically. The elderly living without family support are also in a similar situation. Sushila Jadhav, a daily wager, said she ultimately had to opt for the paid dose fed up with running around government camps and mobile vans for the free dose. “My entire family missed the second dose when the camp was held in our area as we didn’t know. Later, we visited the vaccine centre twice, but could not get it. Recently, a mobile van was set up near our place, but it was late by the time we came to know about it,” Sushila said. In some cases, people have had to make the rounds of hospitals and designated centres over a dozen times for the free second dose. “I stay in Malkajgiri. I have gone to the area hospital Malkajgiri and other centres more than a dozen times. One day, I was in queue for the second dose when a politician came with his men and all of us waiting for hours were driven away,” said PR Kumar, who finally managed to get a free dose a week back. Health authorities said that the mobile van was meant to help people unable to go to designated centres and it has helped in improving the second dose drive. “There are still many missing the second dose. We will soon identify them and send messages to ensure that they take their doses on time. Delaying the second dose reduces the overall efficacy,” said an official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-absence-of-clear-info-free-2nd-covid-19-dose-hard-to-get-for-many/articleshow/87545156.cms||---

Better start moving||HYDERABAD: The joints are breaking down early, if the rising cases of arthritis among those aged below 40 in the past decade is any indication, with 3 out of 10 patients falling in the category. At an estimated 1 million cases, India is at number two on the arthritis world map. Exercise, according to experts, is the best weapon even if there is some pain. Walking, swimming and cycling is recommended, while jogging, jumping, running and skipping are best avoided. Earlier, it was either among those over 60-70 years due to wear and tear of joints (degenerative arthritis) or among a handful of younger population due to genetic causes (rheumatoid arthritis). “But nowadays we are seeing young patients more frequently. It is primarily due to obesity. Also, lack of exercise leads to loss of muscle tone, which adds to pressure on the joints,” said Dr Sunil Dachepalli, senior consultant orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon, Yashoda Hospital, adding that every patient should walk, cycle or swim. The extent of exercise depends after how much time the pain is felt and resting time required for it to subside. If the pain lasts over over 30 minutes, it’s a cue that patient needs to do less. Irrespective of this, being active was important, experts said. “Early diagnosis is key, but arthritis often receives delayed or no diagnosis. It is important to know the symptoms. If not treated appropriately, daily activities get affected, reducing quality of life,” said Dr C Kamaraj, senior arthroscopic surgeon, Kamineni Hospitals, adding that ‘movement is life’ in case of arthritis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/want-to-check-arthritis-better-start-moving/articleshow/87545148.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||‘Non-designation of appellate authority defeats RTI Act’||HYDERABAD: Chief secretary Somesh Kumar’s order asking public information officers (PIOs) not to part with information without the approval of the head of the department and principal secretaries is giving rise to several questions and adding new dimensions to the issues surrounding the Right to Information Act. Though the high court had stayed the CS memo following two PILs that challenged the validity of his order, the state was asked to file its counter explaining the rationale behind Somesh Kumar’s action. When the HC grew serious about the language employed in the memo, the state tried to defend the action citing section 5(4) of the Act that allows PIOs to take the assistance of the officials in the relevant department. According to Mohammad Shafiquzzaman, former special chief secretary, section 5(v) of the RTI Act provides that if a PIO takes the assistance of any officer, that officer too would become a PIO in that particular case and would carry the accountabilities of a PIO. “That means if the head of the department is to be consulted for information then he would become the PIO. If that is the case, then he would cease to be an appellate authority in this case,” he said. He said the state will have to notify someone who is above him as the appellate authority. “No department will have a higher authority other than the head of the department. This may lead to a situation where the chief secretary would become the appellate authority in scores of cases. In each such case, the state has to notify the change in appellate authority and it should be mentioned and conveyed to the people,” Shafiquzzaman said. Non-designation of appellate authority would defeat the very purpose of the RTI Act, he said, underlining the fact that the CS memo was totally silent on these issues. Commenting on the state of affairs, former central information commissioner M Sridhar Acharyulu said that such a situation would overburden the department heads. “If any PIO says that his higher authority did not permit him to furnish the information, then that higher authority would become liable for penal action because the information commissioners can impose a penalty on him. The CS memo would make higher officials liable for penalties,” he said. Instead, the state should have trained its PIOs properly, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/non-designation-of-appellate-authority-defeats-rti-act/articleshow/87545154.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Health teams in villages to administer jab to hesitant||HYDERABAD: It looks like one cannot escape the long arm of the health staff — at least in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district — if he or she has not taken the Covid-19 vaccine yet. The health teams are out on the roads — literally — to locate those who have not taken the jab. The teams are placing themselves at vantage points to confront people and check if they got vaccinated or not. Those who have not been inoculated are given ‘on-the-spot gyan’ and later, the much-needed booster (jab) as well. In Kotamarthi village of Addagudur mandal, a team of officials were on the job along with the village committee members. They identified four women, who refused to take the vaccine. After much persuasion and cajoling, the women relented. The health staffers administered the vaccination bang on the road near their houses. Another man was found sitting on his two-wheeler. He too had not taken the vaccine. They cleared his doubts about the vaccine and gave him the jab on the road itself. At the auto stand, the health staff found some more villagers and counselled them on the advantages of taking the vaccine and cleared their doubts. Three auto drivers were given vaccination at the spot. In Bommalaramaram mandal, labourers from Odisha working in brick kilns in Laxmi thanda, Bhukya thanda and Devuni thanda were given the shots. In eight brick kilns, 20 workers were counselled by the team of auxiliary nurse midwife Jayasri and 33 workers were given counselling by the team of ANM Nagamani. There were some workers in a poultry farm. A total of 53 workers were given the vaccination. “There are people who still have doubts about the vaccine and are not getting vaccinated due to stigma. They should not be adamant and should understand that it is for their own good we are giving the vaccinations and to protect them against the virus,” an official said. In Vikarabad district, collector K Nikhila asked the health staff to at least administer vaccines for 100 people everyday by identifying those who have not taken it. The teams have been asked to do house-to-house search.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-health-teams-in-villages-to-administer-jab-to-hesitant/articleshow/87545160.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The notification has been issued for the auctions and the last date for registrations is November 30. Authorities chose Uppal Bhagat layout as it is a safe bet for the government on various counts. There are also no legal hitches on the land and it received good response from the bidders in the two phases of land auctions that were held in 2019. “The advantage is that the layout is located in the middle of both Hyderabad and Secunderabad within 10 km distance. The prices are affordable compared with the western part of the city,” a senior official of the HMDA told TOI. In the two phases, the HMDA had sold 155 plots that fetched Rs 1,050 crore to the metropolitan authority. For some plots, the highest bid amount was Rs 79,000 per sq yard. Official sources said nearly 1,35,000 sq yards will be put up for auction. While some plots are small of 150 to 200 sq yards, a few are bigger plots ranging from 2,500, 5,000 sq yards and even above 10,000 sq yards. The government is hoping to get nearly Rs 1,000 crore revenue by selling these open plots. The authority had conducted e-auctions for its Neopolis layout at Kokapet and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) and sold its land at Khanamet a couple of months ago. But some people approached the court against the layout claiming the land comes under GO 111 (bio-conservation zone). The case is still pending in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hmda-to-conduct-e-auctions-for-44-open-plots-near-nagole/articleshow/87545165.cms||Koride Mahesh

Last week, another stingray look-alike caught by a Pernem fisherman added to the buzz. The honeycomb stingray (Himantura Uarnak) is often netted by fishermen in areas of Baina bay and Kharewada, Vasco. But the fish caught near Arambol coast by Bhushan Pednekar, a fisherman from Keri in North Goa, is yet to be properly identified. “I had never seen or caught this fish as far as I can remember,” Pednekar said. As he is not sure if it is edible, he has stored it in the refrigerator at home. The flat and round fish measured three feet from its mouth to tail tip and two feet across. “It could possibly be the first record of Porcupine whipray (Urogymnus asperrimus), as it has brambles like a porcupine. We will be checking the specimen physically,” G B Sreekanth, fisheries scientist, Indian council of agricultural research, Old Goa said. The other catch of more than a metre diametre at Baina beach recently drew much attention, as it is feared for its painful sting. “It is highly prized for its meat. It is cut, salted, dried and stocked for the monsoon or used to make ‘para’ – a delicacy when fish is scarce,” Silvestro D’Souza, a chef said. The dry fish is expensive and is sought after at feast fairs during summer. The stringray’s liver is even sold separately, as its oil is believed to be rich in omega-3 fatty acid. “This outsized specimen will yield at least four to five litres of oil, which is good for medicinal purpose,” D’Souza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/outsized-stingray-look-alike-in-north-goa-create-buzz/articleshow/87545183.cms||---
---||Dehradun||In next 10 years, Uttarakhand will record more tourist footfall than it did in last 100 years: PM Modi||DEHRADUN: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Kedarnath on Friday, praised the “fast-paced development” in Uttarakhand and said that it will “pave the way for the bright future of the people of the state.”  “The third decade of the 21st century belongs to Uttarakhand and its people. In the next 10 years, Uttarakhand will record more tourist footfall than what it had in the last 100 years. Can you imagine the economic growth this high tourist turnout will bring to the state?” Modi said in his address at the shrine town. The PM further pointed out that the number of Char Dham pilgrims has gone up considerably in the last few years. “If not for the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourist numbers would have gone up even further. I would like to congratulate chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and his team on the overall infrastructural development in the state. The positive impact is already visible. Uttarakhand is situated at a great height and it will achieve heights even greater than its altitude,” said Modi. Talking about the key projects that are underway in the state, the PM said, “The Char Dham towns are being connected under the all-weather road project. Works are underway to provide cable car connectivity to Char Dham shrines. Also, plans are afoot to build a ropeway to Hemkund Sahib.” He added, “The Karnprayag-Rishikesh rail line will make Char Dhams accessible via railways. A number of children living in the hills have not seen rails but the project will bring railway connectivity to the hills. This will boost the economic growth in the region. Similarly, the Delhi-Dehradun highway project will cut down travelling time between the two cities.” The PM also appreciated the Uttarakhand government’s efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have spent a long time in this region and am well aware of the challenges here. Therefore, I know how difficult it is to reach out to far-flung areas and get everyone vaccinated. Despite the tough terrain, Uttarakhand has achieved cent percent single-dose vaccination. This needs to be appreciated,” said Modi. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, in his speech, spoke about the works undertaken at Kedarnath. “The works under phase one have been completed and the projects, worth Rs 184 crore, under phase two have already been started. The third phase of the project is expected to commence from April next year,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-next-10-yrs-uttarakhand-will-record-more-tourist-footfall-than-it-did-in-last-100-years-pm-modi/articleshow/87543917.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||AP mining dept violated norms in sand mining: NGT panel||HYDERABAD: A National Green Tribunal (NGT) joint committee found that AP mining department has violated environmental rules while doing sand mining in Araniar river. The APMDC levied a fine of Rs 1 lakh on contractor PMR Infra India Private Ltd for violating the terms of the contract. The joint committee said the APMDC carried out sand excavation in river Araniar at Sururupalli in Chittoor district to extract sand for local needs. As per the guidelines of the ministry of environment and forest, clearance has to be obtained from the district Environmental Impact Assessment Authority for mining in areas less than or equal to five hectares. “The APMDC has carried out sand mining without obtaining clearence and consent for operation from APPCB. The Pollution Control Board may impose environment compensation on defaulting departments like mines and geology,” said the joint committee. The NGT issued orders on September 21, appointing the joint committee and to inspect the area and file a report after Dasu Manikantaiah filed a petition in NGT southern bench. The petitioner alleged that sand mining was done in Chittoor district without environmental clearences. Chittoor district officials said: “As per the new sand policy of AP government, environment clearance is required for four and above order streams but not for one to three order streams. It is only for local consumption needs and not for commercial mining.” The irrigation department has classified Araniyar river, which flows through Sururupalli, as a third-order stream. “Environment clearance and consent for establishment are not warranted for sand excavation in the Sururupalli sand reach,” the officials said. NGT panel said the APMDC carried out sand excavation river Araniar at Sururupalli in Chittoor district to extract sand for local needs. The APMDC levied a fine of Rs 1 lakh on contractor for violating the terms of the contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-mining-dept-violated-norms-in-sand-mining-ngt-panel/articleshow/87545186.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Over 700 booked on Kali Puja night for post-8pm revelry||KOLKATA: It was a tale of two cities before and after 8pm on Thursday. As the clock ticked past 8pm, residents of several neighbourhoods started complaining of a spurt in bursting of illegal firecrackers. The deluge of complaints lodged with Kolkata Police, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) and NGO Sabuj Mancha indicated a section of revellers used the two-hour window to actually burst banned firecrackers. The city witnessed a total of 286 complaints, barely 98 of them had been lodged before 8pm and the rest after that. The prosecutions and arrests jumped almost eight times — from 88 at 8pm to 797 past midnight. This was more than the 2020 Kali Puja and Diwali arrest figures of 708. Kolkata Police received 168 complaints on its special line and Sabuj Mancha received 74 complaints. WBPCB received another 44 complaints. Environmentalists who were on the ground on Thursday reported better compliance of pollution norms. "A lot of people just refused any fireworks. Those who violated the norms were a miniscule minority," said Naba Dutta, secretary of Sabuj Mancha. For the second year running, the maximum complaints and arrests came from the added areas of Kolkata and its immediate surroundings — Kasba, Anandapur, New Ballygunge, Topsia, Mukundapur, Dhakuria, Naktala, north Behala (Behala proper and part of New Alipore) along with Cossipore, Baranagar. Howrah yet again reported the maximum violations. However, it was areas like Sreebhumi, Lake Town, Bangur and Baguihati which emerged as the largest violation hotspots. "We stayed there for hours. It sounded like a battlefield. The violations were rampant and the action on the ground was too little," said Dutta. Central Kolkata spots of Burrabazar-Posta reported a high number of violations. The decibel demon roared in several pockets like Burrabazar, Posta, Kalakar Street, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Pathuriaghata in central Kolkata. Despite the presence of cops in several places, many locals burnt firecrackers throughout the night. But there was good news too. Several traditionally challenging areas — Haridevpur, South Behala, Tollygunge, Hastings, Hatibagan and Shyambazar — recorded lesser violations. Cops also came under criticism for failing to act in certain pockets like Kasba, New Ballygunge and Naktala despite repeated calls from citizens even close to midnight-.Till night, 720 persons were arrested. The Bidhannagar police arrested another 77. On Thursday, Kolkata Police seized 1,684kg of firecrackers, one of the biggest hauls since 2018 when firecracker regulations were tightened. The Bidhannagar police seized another 335kg from the Salt Lake-Lake town-Baguati belt. Together, Kolkata and Bidhannagar cops seized 2,019kg on a single day. While a few of those arrested by the police were granted bail from the police station after a long detention, several of them will now see specific cases being drawn up under the Explosives Act and West Bengal Fire Services Act. Though cops earned praise for ensuring that Covid hospitals mostly remained silent zones, there were certain exceptions. Sabuj Manha noticed gross violation near B C Roy Child Hospital, a notified silence zone. "We wondered why it could not be controlled here. But the administration achieved a remarkable feat by turning M R Bangur Hospital into a silence zone, which used to be a hot spot earlier," said one of them. The cops admitted receiving complaints from the area adjoining a private hospital at Dhakuria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-8pm-revelry-takes-arrest-count-to-797-on-kali-puja-night/articleshow/87544674.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Self-curbs lead to 30% less violations at high-rises||Kolkata: High-rises and gated communities that were one of the biggest concern areas for violation of firecracker rules showed restraint this year and complied to the guidelines, senior police officers said after analysing the reports of violations. The calls of violations received from high-rises were at least “less than by 30%” compared to previous years, according to cops. Many residents’ welfare committee had planned in advance to prevent any violations. While most of them locked the terrace, others restricted access to open areas on the ground floor. “In the past, some residents have defied the guidelines and gone ahead and used banned firecrackers. This year, we decided to submit an application and sent the copy to all residents so that they know that they will be hauled for violations,” said Sudehsna Ghosh, joint secretary of Krishna Jyoti Apartments in New Town. Rameshwaram Apartment kept roof out of bounds on festive days. At Ruchira Residency, the residents have ruled out any firework display, even after the SC nod for green crackers, and kept the terraces locked. At Genexx valley in Behala, residents made a giant Rangoli which kept everybody engaged. Police sources said that burstingof crackers were confined to lanes, bylanes and alleys. At the local level, cops put in their men in civil dress across multiple high-rises that have had a history of encouraging sound crackers. The Jadavpur police cited the example of South City off Prince Anwar Shah road. “We plan to make it an example of how condos can actively cooperate with us to tackle pollution demons,” said a senior officer at Jadavpur division. In several complexes, many activities — like laser shows, chat counters and rangoli competition — were planned to engage all the residents. Many residents also arranged house parties and stayed indoors.

---||Kolkata||Loudspeakers, DJs make festival noisy||Kolkata: Loudspeakers and illegal DJ consoles added to the noise woes on Thursday night. Till 10pm, the Lalbazar control room received 12 complaints related to loudspeakers and DJs, as against 62 complaints on bursting of illegal and sound-emitting crackers. By midnight, the complaint count had gone up further, prompting Lalbazar to ask local cops to seize DJ consoles and threatening to take further legal action against Kali Puja organizers using them during immersions. “A bulk of these complaints were made from city suburbs and a few pockets,” said an officer at the control room. Police claimed that they had attended to each call and restricted the use of loud music, especially at night. “At a pandal in south suburban Kolkata, we had to ask the organizers to stop playing loud music twice around 11.20pm. The second time that we intervened, we initiated a case against the organizers,” said an officer. Residents in north Behala and Cossipore, for example, said they made repeated calls to the control room only to be told that local cops would be sent to look into the complaints. “However, when I contacted local police, they said the area fell in the Bengal police area and their hands were tied,” said Chandan Yadav, a resident of KoPT Colony. The top brass has now asked their men on the ground to be more vigilant till the end of Jagatdhatri Puja. According to police sources, puja organizers have been made to sign an undertaking of not playing DJ music during immersions. “All the orders are in compliance with the orders passed from time to time by the courts and the government. This has been clearly mentioned in the government order that immersion processions cannot be arranged. Hence, the use of DJs has been ruled out,” said a joint commissioner. Special orders have been given to restrict DJ music even during Chhath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/loudspeakers-djs-make-festival-noisy/articleshow/87544683.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wind to help flush out pollutants||NEW DELHI: Even as the city was engulfed in a blanket of smog a day after Diwali, the weather conditions seemed to be in its favour with winds gaining speed, which would likely flush out the pollutants over the next two days.  Track the pollution level in your cityWeather analysts said on Diwali night and on Friday there were calm winds with negligible speed, while the humidity oscillated between 69% and 98%. This kept excessive aerosols suspended in the air leading to consistent worsening of the air quality. However, the winds were now expected to turn northwesterly and speedy, which would lead to better ventilation and there would be a slight improvement in the air quality on November 6, 7 and 8. RK Jenamani, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “The air quality is set to improve as the speed of northwesterly winds will be 10-15 kmph on Saturday, which will help ventilate the area. The strong winds will stay for a few days and their speed is likely to reach 25-30 kmph.” “There was an active western disturbance that was not withdrawing. The anti-cyclonic circulation over Haryana will soon fade away. This will pave the way for fresher and stronger winds from Saturday to Monday. Northwesterly winds are dry and cold, which may bring the humidity down and also reduce the temperature,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may improve to “very poor” from “severe” category due to stronger winds, but relief from pollution was expected only by Sunday evening because of stubble burning. “Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to improve to the very poor category by tonight, although the stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same,” added SAFAR. On Friday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 26.3 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal, and a minimum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, the season’s average. “Saturday is likely to see moderate fog in the morning with strong surface winds of 23-25kmph during the day,” said an IMD official. Meanwhile, a combination of pollutants and moisture led to moderate foggy conditions that brought visibility down to 200 metres in the city and at Palam to 350 metres on Friday morning. This was expected to end in the next two days. “Episodic fog often occurs during the last week of October and first week of November. Similar cases occurred in 2004, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020,” said Jenamani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wind-to-help-flush-out-pollutants/articleshow/87545193.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rai trains guns at BJP over bursting crackers||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday claimed that a large population of Delhi did not burst crackers on Diwali night, but BJP people deliberately did it because of which the pollution levels became deadly. Rai, who inspected the anti-smog guns installed near ITO, said 20 such anti-smog guns would be installed at the intersections with higher pollution levels in Delhi. Water sprinkling has begun on Delhi roads with big anti-smog guns, he stated. Rai said, “I would like to congratulate the people who did not burst crackers on Thursday. But some people instigated the bursting of crackers, which has led to an increase in the AQI level.” He further said, “We had expected these two contributors— crackers and stubble—which is why the government had been appealing to the people to not burst crackers, and to the opposition that they must not encourage people to burst crackers just out of political intent or to defame the government. A huge chunk of Delhi’s population did not burst crackers, but some people intentionally burst crackers because of which the pollution levels have increased.” The minister said, “Ever since we announced the ban on crackers, the opposition had been underestimating the effect that crackers have on pollution. The functionaries of BJP have constantly given the rhetoric that this is a matter of religion, of a festival, even when all scientists say that crackers cause pollution.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Rai’s continuous anti-cracker campaign reflects his thought process influenced by Muslim monarch Aurangzeb. “People of Delhi by bursting crackers on Diwali night have given a befitting reply to this Aurangzeb-influenced political thinking. Delhi government has totally failed to control air and water pollution and to evade responsibility, minister Gopal Rai has tried to squarely blame Diwali night crackers for air pollution,” he alleged. “People of Delhi will never forgive Rai for running a malafide campaign against Hindu festivities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-trains-guns-at-bjp-over-bursting-crackers/articleshow/87545200.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||After a yr’s break, plans set for big Bhai Phonta reunion||Kolkata: City households geared up to celebrate Bhai Phonta, Bhai Dooj (for Punjabis) and Bhai Beej (for Gujaratis) on Saturday after last year’s muted celebrations and virtual get-togethers. A small section of Bengali households, however, organised the ritual on Friday itself, on the first day after amavasya. Pinaki Ranjan Sinha, a senior marketing executive of Tata Metallics, drove down to his ancestral place at Dantan where a gala celebration was organised by his sisters. Last year, he had Covid and the family’s traditional get-together could not be held. “This time we started planning in advance. My parents have also invited their siblings,” he said. For Souvik Das, accepting “phonta” on screen last year was an unnatural affair. He was brought up by his sister Soumi, who had Covid last year and a virtual phonta was the only option. “For me, Rakhi and Bhai Phonta are the two most important celebrations of the year and we could not meet for either. We will make up for it this year,” Das said. “The screen phonta was always meant for those who live in other cities, but we were helpless last year,” said Dipanwita Saha, a businesswoman who lives in Urbana. Anmol Kapoor, whose brother Adarsh is a PG student in Canada and was home last year, said, “I got to celebrate Bhai Dooj at home. But this year, he has gone back to campus and I will have to see him on a video call,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-a-yrs-break-plans-set-for-big-bhai-phonta-reunion/articleshow/87544687.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||Over-a-decade-old CWG street furniture to get its lustre back||NEW DELHI: Before Delhi hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, sleek street infrastructure was installed near all sports venues and the roads that led to them. Over the past decade, the information panels, benches, toilets, kiosks, etc, not only faced the elements, but also vandalism. Now, Delhi government is working to bring their lustre back and add more facilities. Initially, the area around Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, which was the venue for wrestling, cycling and gymnastics events during CWG, and the stretch up to Moolchand in south Delhi would be taken up for maintenance of existing infrastructure, replacing missing facilities and installing new street furniture. Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation Limited (DTTDC) has floated a tender for maintenance, operation and installation of street furniture, primarily benches and dustbins, on Public Works Department (PWD) roads leading to and in the vicinity of Commonwealth Games venues on build-operate-transfer basis. The bid document states that during the Games, PWD had taken up a drive for beautification of roads by way of streetscaping, resurfacing of roads, streetlighting, among other things. PWD had entrusted the responsibility to DTTDC for entering into an agreement for developing temporary or semi-permanent street furniture, including traffic or police booths, vending kiosks, public toilets, tree guards, dustbins, information panels, benches, free standing panels and autorickshaw prepaid booths. One of the clusters developed during this period was the area around IGI Stadium and a section of Ring Road from Rajghat to Moolchand flyover, Bhairon Marg and IP Marg. The agreement stated that the concessionaire could earn revenue through advertising on the street furniture. In January, however, this cluster was taken over from the existing concessionaire. The new concessionaire would have to install the missing street furniture and repair damaged items according to the existing design and colour. However, specifications and design of benches and dustbins could be modified after approval. Toilets and vending kiosks would have to be kept open for use by the public during operational hours and their maintenance would be taken up when permitted by the authorities. While public toilets, vending kiosks and information panels would only be maintained and replaced in case they were missing, 17 new benches and 217 new dustbins would be installed, apart from two new autorickshaw booths and four new police booths. The number of information panels and flagpoles would also go up from the existing 69 to 134. The street furniture would be prefabricated and ideally with a modular design so that not only is there minimal on-site work involved, but they are easy to assemble and shift. It would also be made vandalism-proof and steel benches would have wooden cladding to save users from heated or cold surfaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-a-decade-old-cwg-street-furniture-to-get-its-lustre-back/articleshow/87545223.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Need-based changes relief in CHB flats unlikely before MC polls||CHANDIGARH: Even as Chandigarh MC elections are scheduled to be held in December this year, relief in terms of need-based changes in Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) dwelling units on the Delhi pattern is unlikely before the elections. The board had formed a committee to regularise building violations in CHB dwelling units on the Delhi pattern of one-time settlement on September 8. The decision was taken in the CHB board of directors meeting under the chairmanship of UT adviser Dharam Pal, who is also chairman of CHB. The committee was formed under the chairmanship of the CHB secretary, with members of the departments concerned of the UT administration. It was decided that during the process, the committee may consult nominated members of the board, RWAs and other stakeholders for innovative solutions. The report of the committee was to be placed before the board for consideration and appropriate decision. Recently, nominated members of the board were also included in the panel as special invitees. Nearly two months have passed. The committee holds several internal meetings but only one meeting of the committee was held on October 29, in which all three nominated members were officially invited. Sources said that in the days to come, the committee will take the opinions of RWA members and other stakeholders before submitting a final report before the board. The process however, will take some time and the MC elections will be held by then. It is also unclear whether UT will allow one-time relaxation to CHB on the Delhi pattern or not even if the CHB panel recommends the same. On January 29, former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore directed CHB to examine residents’ demand for one-time regularisation of additional construction on the Delhi pattern. CHB allottees claim that relaxation based on the Delhi pattern is a complete solution to the complicated need-based changes done by them and it was implemented in 1999 in Delhi. Recently, CHB had also extended deadline for regularisation of need-based changes till December 31. The board also has the same penal charges as last year. According to the order, CHB has fixed penal charges at Rs 50 per square ft per annum for EWS category flats. For LIG category flats, penalty charges were fixed at Rs 60 per square ft per annum. For MIG category flats, penalty charges were fixed at Rs 80 per square ft per annum. Penal charges for HIG category flats were kept at Rs 90 per square ft per annum. The board of directors also approved the extension of deadline in its meeting on March 8. As per order, temporary exemption from immediate demolition, subject to payment of penalty charges, has now been extended to December 31. Recently, CHB proposed to extend the deadline for regularisation of changes to December 31, 2021, after it expired on December 31, 2020. The proposal went to the UT administration for approval, but the authority asked CHB to decide. CHB officials then placed the agenda in the board of directors meeting, which was later approved. The CHB has already ruled that the changes carried out in the flats by allottees, which does not meet the criteria fixed by the UT administration in their notification of need-based changes, will be termed as violations. The board had asked allottees to apply for regularisation of need-based changes after paying some charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/need-based-changes-relief-in-chb-flats-unlikely-before-mc-polls/articleshow/87544729.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

While the initial reasons for trouble were trivial, it turned serious with questions being raised about implementing the court order, not allowing access to the pandals and stopping illegal parking. At least four vehicles were damaged. A home guard from Regent Park traffic guard and a senior organizer of a Kali Puja lodged contrasting complaints and claimed injuries at the hands of the other.According to DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan, cops are probing both incidents, looking at CCTV footage and speaking to locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clashes-over-parking-near-pandals/articleshow/87544738.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Heightened vigilance make Diwali fire-safe||Times News Network Chandigarh: The fire and emergency services department of the Chandigarh MC received 10 fire-related calls on Diwali. The calls were for minor situations and no serious untoward incident or injury related to fire was reported in the city. Some of the fire calls came from a house in Sector 18, a shop in Palsora village, dividing road of sectors 26/31, house in Sector 15, open area in Sector 47, open area near SD college in Sector 32, a park in Sector 49, a house in Badheri and open area in Manimajra. All incidents, except for the one reported in Sector 18, were controlled in a few minutes. “Since all fire vehicles had trained firemen and we had all kinds of infrastructure, water and related machinery, the calls were attended perfectly and our firemen showed full commitment. Thus, the city remained completely safe in terms of fire on the day of Diwali,” a senior MC official said. The MC fire department had deployed around 200 employees across the city. Since the department had also set up temporary fire stations in all key market and commercial areas, each point was under the surveillance of firemen. Patrolling parties on motorcycles also played a vital role in controlling the situation in congested market areas and streets. Senior officers had constituted special teams along with fire tenders and in-charges of teams also remained on the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/heightened-vigilance-make-diwali-fire-safe/articleshow/87544739.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: AQI moderate to poor in 1 hour, poor to moderate in 17||KOLKATA: It took an hour of reckless revelry to drive the city’s ambient air quality from moderate (AQI 101-200) to poor (AQI 201-300). The scars left by the bursting of crackers on Kali Puja-Diwali took much longer to heal. The air quality inched back to moderate again nearly 17 hours later on Friday. Across the multiple continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CMAAQMS) installed in Kolkata, the air quality plummeted to the poor mark around Thursday night. The air quality at RBU, for the first time this season, plunged to 'very poor' (AQI 301-400) category with fireworks hot spots in the city reverting to their notoriety after a year's break due to Covid. As a result of the pollution generated on Diwali night, people were forced to breathe in poor air in the morning and early afternoon in most places in the city. Track the pollution level in your cityLong exposure to the polluted air causes breathing discomfort to normal people. For those with respiratory illness, the consequence is far worse, particularly so for those undergoing Covid treatment. The cleansing of ambient or dispersal of pollutants takes much longer. Ballygunge CAAQMS, for instance, took only an hour (from 11pm to midnight) to turn from yellow (moderate, AQI: 101-200) to dark orange (poor, AQI 201-300). But it swung back to yellow at 5pm on Friday, 17 hours later. Similarly, Fort William CAAQMS plunged to poor around 11pm, and the healing of its ambient air took 16 hours despite it being in the Maidan, one of the greenest and cleanest parts of the city. Rabindra Bharati University CAAQMS also plunged into the very poor category (AQI: 301-400) at 11pm on the night of Diwali, it again swung back to the poor category at 3pm on Friday, taking nearly 16 hours. With thermal inversion slowly setting in, the healing of air will take longer time. Before the dispersal of the pollutants of Day 1, the pollutants of Day 2 will pile up, plunging the air quality into a further worse category from where the recovery is an arduous task unless there are some meteorological changes like rainfall, said PCB scientist. “If there is a fresh onslaught on the ambient air on Friday itself, the recovery will take even longer. For the last few years, the bursting of crackers continued for the second consecutive day after Diwali. The finer particulate matters of heavy metals cause severe damage to lung,” said Debasish Basu, a preventive health care specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aqi-moderate-to-poor-in-1-hr-poor-to-moderate-in-17/articleshow/87544736.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The arrested man has been identified as Atheeq Ahmad. The police had started an investigation after receiving a complaint from a businessman based in East of Kailash of southeast Delhi. In his complaint, the victim alleged that a gang of 22 people, including Ahmad, had cheated him of Rs 10.6 crore between March 2016 and September 2018 in order to facilitate procurement and sale of the radioactive article. “The victim was induced to invest for facilitation of this deal on the assurance of profit of Rs 500 crore. The cheated amount was taken by accused people through bank transfer, cheques and cash in several tranches,” additional CP RK Singh said. After a preliminary inquiry, an FIR was registered and a team formed to investigate. Based on further probe, a team led by DCP Mohammad Ali arrested Ahmad from Bengaluru. Investigation to nab other co-accused of the case is in progress, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bizman-loses-rs-10cr-as-bid-to-buy-radioactive-plate-goes-awry/articleshow/87545231.cms||---
---||Kolkata||High demand sets Kolkata markets on fire despite fuel price dip||KOLKATA: The retail market on Friday, a day before Bhai Phonta, was on fire, with prices of most of perishable commodities staying high. The fuel cost reduction seemed to have hardly any impact on the retail prices, with all vegetables except cabbage and pumpkin selling for over Rs 50 a kg. Coriander leaves sold at Rs 200 a kg, green peas at Rs 180 a kg, flat beans at Rs150 a kg, eggplant at Rs 80 and tomato at Rs 80. “We thought the prices would go down significantly with the reduction in diesel price. But perishables continued to burn a big hole in our pocket,” said Sourav De, a film-maker and resident of Tollygunge. “The vendors have always blamed the diesel price behind the abnormal rise in vegetable prices. But when the diesel price has actually dipped, there is no change in vegetable prices. I think it is high time the government took a look at the issue,” said Niladri Nag, a buyer. Even fish prices have risen significantly. Bhetki was sold at Rs 600 a kg, pomfret at Rs 700, and the starting price of hilsa was Rs 1,800 a kg. “The kitchen budget has gone haywire and cutting corners hardly helps,” said Tanima Bhattacharya, a Tagore researcher. However, Kamal Dey, president of Bengal Vendors Association and member of the market task force, said, “The prices are all set to fall. There is a bumper winter crop waiting to hit the market. The wholesale prices have already started falling. The retail prices are expected to dip after Bhai Phonta.” Amar Das, a fish trader at Lake Market said, “In the last few days, prices of some varieties rose mainly because of supply shortage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-demand-sets-mkts-on-fire-despite-fuel-price-dip/articleshow/87544741.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Members plan to court arrest on November 23 in front of the residence of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Morinda. They have accused the Punjab government of remaining silent on the issue of implementation of UGC pay scales and withdrawal of the decision to delink teachers’ grades from UGC pay scales.

On the top floor, the team found a big pool table surrounded by men and women holding cash, tokens and playing cards. “As soon as police entered, they threw their cash on the table and started running here and there. However, the team managed to overpower all of them. Their details were obtained and verified,” the DCP added.

---||Delhi||After prompt action saves flyer’s life on Delhi-Doha flight, crew honours doctor||NEW DELHI: An hour into Vistara’s Delhi-Doha flight this Tuesday, Dr Nadeem Jilani got alerted when an announcement was made to check if there was a doctor on board. A passenger had fallen unconscious in the lavatory and he lay on the floor near it frothing at the mouth, prompting the call from the crew. Dr Jilani, who was returning home in Qatar after attending his elder brother’s funeral in Aligarh, immediately identified himself and gave basic life support that saved the passenger. Grateful crew members thanked the paediatrician in a unique way — by first upgrading him to the business class and then lining up on either sides of the aisle to give a “standing ovation” when he was disembarking at Doha. “An airhostess escorted me to the front section. An unconscious and unresponsive passenger was on the ground, with half of his body still inside the toilet. He was not breathing, there was some froth at the side of his mouth. I promptly started CPR and he become responsive after about 30 seconds with a moan and then opened his eyes,” Dr Jilani told TOI. The doctor, who is originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, asked the crew to raise his legs to increase blood supply to the brain and the heart. “Gradually he started coming around. We gave him a sugary drink. I always have a stethoscope and a BP recorder in my handbag. His BP, unrecordable initially, normalised in 15-20 minutes. He started talking and identified himself as Santosh from Hyderabad and currently working in Doha,” the doctor said. “I kept monitoring him and was happy that he could walk by the time the flight landed. It was such a satisfying feeling.” A Vistara spokesperson said the passenger “fell unconscious while attempting to use the lavatory. One of the passengers immediately came forward and provided basic life support. The passenger in need was well looked after by the cabin crew and provided whatever the doctor advised. The passenger was able to safely disembark upon landing in Doha. We are immensely grateful to the doctor”. Aishwarya, an airhostess on the flight that took off from Delhi at 8pm, thanked the doctor for “being on duty even while travelling”. Dr Jilani said, “They asked me to leave first when they started deplaning. A kind of standing ovation was given with flight attendants standing on both sides at the exit gate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-prompt-action-saves-flyers-life-crew-honours-doctor/articleshow/87545265.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Chandigarh||After breaching Rs 100 mark, Chandigarh, Panchkula tame fuel prices further; Mohali lags||MOHALI/CHANDIGARH/ PANCHKULA: A day after the Center announced a bonanza for residents by reducing excise duty by 5% on petrol and 10% on diesel, UT administration and Haryana government further reduced Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel, describing it as a festival gift for residents. In Chandigarh, petrol price has been reduced by Rs 11.76/litre and diesel by Rs 17.26/litre as the UT has relaxed VAT by 9.21% on petrol and 7.36% on diesel. In Panchkula, VAT on petrol has been reduced by 7% and by 0.4% on diesel. With this, the price of petrol in Chandigarh has come down from Rs 105.94/litre to Rs 94.23/litre and that of diesel has come down from Rs 98.16/litre to Rs 80.90/litre. In Panchkula, the price of petrol has come down from Rs 107.36/litre to Rs 95.67/litre and that of diesel from Rs 99/litre to Rs 86.88/litre. The UT had slashed VAT to bring down the fuel prices in the city on October 5, 2018. As for Mohali, UT and Haryana’s reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel after the reduction in excise duty by the Centre widens the price gap and enhances losses. Petrol and diesel prices in Mohali have been reduced only after the Center’s reduction of excise duty and the Punjab government is yet to announce any reduction in VAT. In Chandigarh, petrol now costs Rs 94.23 while it is priced at Rs 106.07 in Mohali. The price gap, which stood at Rs 6.02 four days ago has increased by Rs 11.84. Diesel is priced at Rs 80.90 in Chandigarh and Rs 89.71 in Mohali. The price gap, which was Rs 3.38 per litre has increased by Rs 8.81. Diesel price sears Mohali:Once lowest in Mohali, diesel price here has now become the highest in the Tricity at Rs 89.71/lt. Petrol pumo dealers have been urging the Punjab government to reduce VAT saying that their pumps are on the verge of closure. In 2014, diesel price was the lowest in Mohali, but Punjab raised VAT while Chandigarh and Haryana reduced it, sending diesel price skyrocketing in Mohali. Ashwinder Singh Mongia, president, Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, Mohali said that the price of diesel was cheapest in Punjab as compared to neighbouring regions till November 2014 and sale in terms of liters was the highest. That changed after the Chandigarh administration scaled down VAT on diesel in November 2014, resulting in a shift of trade to Chandigarh. “In 2017, BJP-ruled states led by Chandigarh made a downward revision of VAT on diesel, followed by another downward revision in 2018. Punjab, on the other hand, made further upward revisions in VAT on diesel in the form of cess, additional cess and infrastructure development cess, resulting in gross disparity in diesel rates,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-breaching-rs-100-mark-ut-pkl-tame-fuel-prices-further/articleshow/87544759.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Dehradun||PM Modi unveils Adi Guru Shankaracharya statue at Kedarnath||DEHRADUN: Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 12-foot high statue of Adi Shankaracharya at Kedarnath on Friday and also spent time meditating in front of the statue. Made of chlorite schist, the Shankaracharya statue, weighing 35 tonnes, has been built at the seer’s samadhi sthal that has been redeveloped after it suffered heavy damage during the 2013 deluge. “Adi Shankaracharya’s principles and teachings hold immense importance in the present era. His life was extraordinary as it was devoted to the welfare of the common man,” the PM said, adding that “the seer’s devotees are present here in spirit”, referring to the simultaneous streaming of the event at the jyotirlingas and maths established by the ancient seer. Among the development projects, said to be worth around Rs 225 crore, that the PM inaugurated at Kedarnath were the Saraswati river retaining wall, aastha path and ghats, tirth purohit houses, Mandakini retaining wall and aastha path, and Garud Chatti bridge on Mandakini. Further, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for several projects worth Rs 180 crore. These projects included the redevelopment of the Sangam Ghat, first-aid and tourist facilitation centre, administration office and hospital, two guest houses, police station, command and control centre, Mandakini aasthapath queue management and rain-shelter and Saraswati civic amenity building. The PM in his address spoke emotionally about his connect with Kedarnath. “Whenever I come here, I feel connected with every bit of the place. I feel privileged that I was able to have a darshan at the temple on the auspicious occasion fo Govardhan Pooja. There are no words to describe the experience of sitting before Adi Guru Shankaracharya's statue at his rebuilt samadhi.” He also appreciated the CM and the state government for carrying out development works at Kedarnath, in particular lauding the contribution of all workers, who carried out the work despite adverse conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pm-modi-unveils-adi-guru-shankaracharya-statue-at-kedarnath/articleshow/87543367.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Gurgaon||Farmers confine BJP ex-minister Manish Grover, others in Rohtak temple||ROHTAK: After nearly seven hours of high drama on Friday, several Haryana BJP leaders who were held hostage at Rohtak’s Kiloi village temple by protesting farmers and villagers, were let off on the condition that they would not hold any public event as long as the ‘Kisan Andolan’ is on. Those held “hostage” included former Haryana co-operative minister Manish Grover. Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws have been opposing programmes of leaders of Haryana’s ruling BJP-JJP alliance. Grover had reached the village temple around 10am with several party leaders to watch the live telecast of PM Narendra Modi’s Kedarnath visit. As news spread about their visit, the farmers protesting at toll plazas started assembling near the temple. Manish Grover had come to watch the live telecast of PM’s Kedarnath visitSeveral residents of Kiloi and nearby areas also gathered at the spot and demanded an apology from the ex-minister for visiting the village temple despite the call by farmer groups. Seeing the swelling protest against BJP leaders who were not permitted to come outside from the shrine, a heavy police force was deployed and SPs from Rohtak, Jhajjar and Sonipat also reached there. Cops made a human wall around the temple gate to prevent any protester from entering to ward off any trouble. Preet Singh, All India Kisan Sabha district president said farmer groups had warned BJP leaders against holding public events. Grover and his party men never visit the local grain market where farmers have been struggling to sell their paddy crop but find time to visit temples for the sake of their politics, he said. Another protester said no invitation was extended to BJP leaders, and they came against the wish of the temple committee in the wake of farmers’ call to boycott ruling party leaders. “We prevented their exit from the temple till they came out with an apology with folded hands and undertaking that they shall not make any visit in Rohtak district to disrespect the boycott call,” he added. Outside the temple, youngsters hooted against the BJP government and insisted on Grover apologising in public. Around 2pm, deputy commissioner Capt Manoj Kumar also reached to assuage the public anger. The matter was resolved after 5pm, when BJP leaders, including Grover, made an appearance on the parapet of the temple’s first floor with folded hands, a gesture seen as an apology by the protesters. However, minutes after Grover emerged, he told the media that he had not sought any apology, and just folded hands to say ‘Ram Ram’ to the protesters. “If needed, I will not hesitate in visiting the Kiloi Shiv temple again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmers-confine-bjp-ex-min-others-in-rohtak-temple-let-them-go-after-apology/articleshow/87545287.cms||Sat Singh

He also unveiled a 12-foot-high statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya, who started the akhara system in the eighth century AD, at his samadhi sthal that has been reconstructed after its destruction in the 2013 Kedarnath flash floods. In his address at the shrine town, the PM made a strong pitch for Hindutva, saying, “Cultural heritage centres of faith are being viewed with deserved and valid pride today, as they should be viewed. Ayodhya is getting its glory back after centuries. A grand temple of Lord Ram is coming up there. Two days back, the entire world witnessed grand Deepotsav celebrations and we can imagine how our ancient culture and traditions must have been.” He urged people to “visit places related to our glorious freedom struggle and pious places of pilgrimage and get acquainted with the spirit of India.” Modi added that the places associated with Lord Ram would be developed as part of a circuit for devotees. He also highlighted the ongoing projects at Kashi (Varanasi). “Work on Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi is also progressing rapidly,” said the PM, adding that efforts are underway to develop a Buddha Circuit as well. “Now, the country aims high and also sets a time limit to achieve these aims. I hear the voices of 130 crore Indians and an inner voice within me says that getting tied down under the constraint of time-span is no longer acceptable to the country. Today, India doesn't accept being timid about deadlines and goals,” said the PM. Earlier, after reaching Kedarnath in the morning, the Prime Minister offered prayers at the shrine. During the visit, prayers were offered at 12 Jyotirlingas and all the four dhams and Shiva temples all over the country in a coordinated event by the BJP. Later, the PM inaugurated several projects, including the Saraswati retaining wall and ghats, Mandakini retaining wall, teerth purohit houses and Garud Chatti bridge on river Mandakini. He also laid the foundation stone for multiple projects, said to be worth over Rs 180 crore. These include redevelopment of Sangam Ghat and a first-aid and tourist facilitation centre. The PM was also shown a short documentary on the works carried out at Kedarnath in the last few years.

---||Dehradun||Modi’s visit to Kedarnath a political marketing strategy, PM more interested in giving his own darshan to people: Harish Rawat||DEHRADUN: Soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Kedarnath, former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat raised questions on how live-streaming of the PM’s darshan inside the sanctum sanctorum could be live-streamed, terming it a violation of the traditions of the centuries-old temple. “A number of former PMs and prominent personalities have offered prayers in the sanctum sanctorum of the Kedarnath temple but no one dared to take photos of their darshan or have it telecast live,” Rawat said, adding that “the tradition of the revered shrine has been broken.” “The visit was a political marketing strategy and had nothing to do with the state or its welfare. Rather than Kedarnath darshan, PM Modi was more interested in giving his own darshan to people through live coverage,” he further said. “Former PM Indira Gandhi, a number of chief ministers, President Ram Nath Kovind and several other dignitaries have visited the Kedarnath shrine. Each one of them respected the guidelines set by priests. No photographs were taken inside the sanctum sanctorum. However, the PM’s darshan was telecast live on TV. It was also streamed in real-time on social media. Every leader has tried to avoid politics at the revered shrine but the PM with his speech broke that tradition as well,” the former CM said. Rawat also slammed the PM for not announcing any new project or relief fund for disaster-hit areas of Kumaon which recently suffered damage due to devastating rain spells on October 18 and 19. Meanwhile, in separate events, Congress members offered prayers in different Shiva temples of the Himalayan state during the PM’s visit. While Harish Rawat performed prayers in a temple at Haridwar, Pritam Singh, the leader of opposition, offered worship at the Prithvi Nath Mahadev temple in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modis-visit-to-kedarnath-a-political-marketing-strategy-pm-more-interested-in-giving-his-own-darshan-to-people-harish-rawat/articleshow/87543370.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Chandigarh||Farm protest: MP’s car damaged in Narnaund||Hisar: Clashes broke out between farmers and police on Friday during a protest against Rajya Sabha member Ramchandra Jangra, who reached Narnaund in the morning to lay the foundation stone of Jangra Sabha’s chaupal. The windshield of the MP’s car was also broken in it. A farmer was injured and two others were taken into custody by police, but were released later. The police have registered a criminal case against three persons and 60 others unidentified. The protesters then started an indefinite sit-in at Narnaund police station against registering of the case and demanded an FIR against the MP’s PA and gunman “for injuring farmers”. BKU Charuni chief Gurnam Singh Charuni also reached the spot by the evening. As the news spread, protesters blocked the Ramayana toll and nearby routes. Jangra had come to attend a function of Jangra Samaj when farm activists heard about it and reached there to protest with black flags. Heavy police force was already deployed at the spot but the protesters broke barricades and broke the front windshield and left window of the MP’s car. They reached close to the venue and raised slogans against the MP and showed him black flags. In response, the MP’s supporters started raising slogans in his favour. Sensing further trouble, the police asked the MP to end the event early and leave. A case has been registered on the complaint of ASI Ramesh Chandra against Moth Rangdan village resident Harshdeep Gill, Umran resident Kailash, Singhwa Khas village resident Sudhir and 50-60 unidentified persons under sections 147 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 148 (rioting), 149 (common object of unlawful assembly), 341 (wrongful restraint), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The protesters alleged that the MP’s PA and the gunman attacked and injured a farmer, Kuldeep, a resident of Satror village. So a should be registered against both. Hansi superintendent of police Nitika Gehlot said that during the MP’s event, farmers in Narnaund had become violent and damaged his car. After this, two farmers were taken into custody, who were released after questioning, SP said. “The man, who has been alleged by the farmers of being injured by the police stick, was already suffering from epilepsy and collapsed on the ground due to the heat in the afternoon. He did not suffer any injuries, but had fainted due to a brain vein rupture and has been admitted to a hospital in Hisar,” SP said. Jangra Mahasabha president Ram Kumar Jangra said that the MP was called to inaugurate a dharamsala. It was also discussed with the farmers that they would protest peacefully but they tried to attack and it was condemnable. Soon, the Jangra Mahasabha would take a concrete decision by holding a panchayat, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-protest-mps-car-damaged-in-narnaund/articleshow/87545314.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rs 1,544 crore fund to boost Delhi’s Covid-19 fight||NEW DELHI: A budget of Rs 1,544 crore was approved on Friday under Emergency Covid Response Package for 2021-22 to make Delhi’s fight against the pandemic stronger. The budget, okayed in a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, will be spent on various measures, including further enhancing testing and labs, procuring supplies, mobilising additional human resources, increasing health facilities in hospitals, and managing Covid care centres. Kejriwal said that as a responsible government, the Delhi government was taking all steps necessary in the fight against Covid. “In the wake of the possibility of a third Covid wave, the Delhi government is trying its best to strengthen its health system and preparedness at every level,” he said. During the meeting at Delhi Secretariat, the cabinet agreed that the novelcorona virus infection wasn’t over yet. “Thus, in this fight against Covid-19, there should not be any hesitation with respect to the control and prevention of the spread of Covid-19,” the government said in a statement. Stressing on the need for the state’s own package to combat Covid, health minister Satyendar Jain said the Kejriwal government was going “head to head against Covid to protect the people of Delhi. This package will further enhance the management of resources in Delhi and prove to be crucial in the advent of any future wave”. Under the package, the government allows expenditure on all short- and long-term activities to manage Covid. Of the total budget, Rs 415 crore will be used to strengthen testing and labs and Rs 445 crore for procurement of supplies. A budget of Rs 280 crore will help bolster health facilities and hospitals and Rs 125 crore will aid the management of Covid care centres. Experts are anticipating a third wave of Covid cases in India. The Delhi government has constituted a state-level task force under a state nodal officer and several task-based sub-committees to prepare for the management of the probable third wave. The government is also strengthening health infrastructure to make high-quality treatment accessible to all. A total of 6,836 ICU beds will be added in seven hospitals in Delhi, taking the total capacity in the city to 17,000. The new beds will be set up at Sarita Vihar, Shalimar Bagh, Sultanpuri, Kirari, Raghubir Nagar, GTB and Chacha Nehru Children’s hospitals. The government said its hospitals were being made self-sufficient in the matter of oxygen. PSA oxygen plants are being set up in government hospitals to reduce their dependence on outside facilities and let other hospitals refill oxygen cylinders during emergencies. During the last wave, the demand for oxygen in Delhi increased and many hospitals had to deal with severe shortage. To ensure that such a situation does not arise in future, the Kejriwal government is installing 73 PSA plants with a capacity of 77.80 MT in government hospitals. All plants will be commissioned by the end of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-1544cr-fund-to-boost-citys-covid-19-fight/articleshow/87545326.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Hyderabad||After two years, air pollution in Hyderabad rises again this Diwali||HYDERABAD: The pollution this Diwali compared to one in 2019 prior to the Covid-19 pandemic was a notch more in the city. While last year Diwali was under Covid-19 shadow and subdued, this year the festival of lights was celebrated enthusiastically. Consequently, on Thursday the superfine particulate matter PM 2.5 level rose to 81 ug/m3, a high for two years, according to Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) data from its ambient air quality monitoring stations. The PM 2.5 level in 2019 and 2020 was 72 ug/m3 and 64 ug/m3 respectively. The annual average value of PM 2.5 should be 40 ug/m3 and should not exceed 60 ug/m3 for two consecutive days, according to national ambient air quality standards. Even short-term exposure to PM 2.5 has been associated with increased health risks, experts say. “Unlike PM10, exposure to microscopic PM 2.5 is dangerous as it can affect lungs. A PM 2.5 value of more than 80 ug/m3 is unquestionably high,” said Dr Babu Rao Kalapala, a senior scientist. “People with allergies and asthma should be cautious and wear masks while going out for the next three days because the matter remains in the atmosphere,” cautioned Dr Rao. The PM 10 level this year was at 118 ug/m3, which was lower than both 2020 (128 ug/m3) and 2019 (163.4 ug/m3). The normal range for PM 10 should not be more than 100 ug/m3 for two consecutive days and average annual value should not be more than 60 ug/m3. The noise levels too were higher this year compared to 2019. This year, for sensitive regions it was 68 dB (day) and 64 dB (night) against a normal value of 50 dB and 40 dB respectively. In commercial areas it was 65 dB (day) and 63 dB (night) against a normal of 65 dB and 55 dB respectively. The figure for 2019 was 59 dB (day) and 55 dB (night) for sensitive zones, while it was 72 dB (day) and 70 dB (night) for commercial areas. With air and noise pollutions not going over the top this year, officials said that it could be a sign that people were becoming more aware of environmental concerns. Plus, the Supreme Court too had banned polluting crackers, making green ones a must. Though TSPCB figures indicate that it was a quieter Diwali compared to earlier years, many netizens took to social media to complain about the noise. Officials, however, said that they had not received any complaint as yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-two-years-air-pollution-in-city-rises-again-this-diwali/articleshow/87545997.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The council also said that the present structure of the municipality will be retained and preserved as a heritage site. At the bi-monthly general meeting held on Friday, the council discussed utilisation of revenue expected from the government to commemorate the diamond jubilee celebration of Goa Liberation. “We will get a diamond jubilee fund of Rs one crore from state government and the remaining Rs 50 lakh will be adjusted from un-utilised revenue granted under the 14th finance plan. We have already got the design prepared from a local architect who has estimated the cost of the project at Rs 1.5 crore,” council chairperson Shantaram Kolvenkar said. The council is presently functioning from an old structure that was constructed in 1960s. The Ponda municipality was formed in 1971. With the increase in work load, the amenities and number of staff has drastically gone up leading to a space crunch at the premises. With the construction of the new building, some sections will be shifted to the new premise to make the working area spacious, Kolvenkar said, adding that a tender will be floated soon for the project. “The project will also have stilt parking for vehicles and offices on first and second floors”, Kolvenkar added. While one councilor Pradip Naik was absent, the remaining 14 members including chairperson Kolvenkar, vice chairperson Virendra Dhavlikar, councilors Archana Dangui, Yatish Sawkar, Vishwanath Dalvi, Ritesh Naik, Anand Naik, William Aguiar, Chandrakala Naik, Venkatesh Naik, Seema Fernandes, Jaya Sawant, Amina Naik and Geetali Talaulikar, and municipal engineer Uday S N Dessai were present for the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-civic-body-to-get-new-bldg/articleshow/87545331.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Chandigarh||Paddy purchase stopped for 4 days in Hry||Jind: The Haryana government has stopped purchase of paddy (PR variety) from November 4 to 7 in Haryana, revealed a letter sent to all DCs and DFSCs by Anurag Rastogi, additional chief secretary (ACS) in food, supplies and consumer affairs department on November 3. The decision has triggered resentment among farmers who had been waiting to sell their crop in grain markets for the past several days. The letter mentions that paddy procurement progress was discussed with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala over the phone, and keeping in view the fact that approximately 51.56 lakh tonnes of paddy stands procured as per the e-kharid portal, which shows that the arrival of paddy has become negligible in large number of districts, therefore no purchase will take place following Diwali till November 7. Moreover, DCs are requested to make an assessment regarding paddy left in the field and adjudge the pace of expected paddy arrival. The districts which are having very little paddy left in the field are expected to close down at least 50% of their procurement, the letter further read. Jind DFSC Varinder Kumar confirmed the development. A farmer from Mirchpur village, who had been waiting to sell his paddy of PR variety for the past around 20 days in Jind’s new grain market, said, “Nobody was there to listen farmers as I brought my paddy crop grown in 6.5 acres in grain market around 20 days back. Now, the Haryana government has closed purchasing for the next four days. Should I take care of paddy lying in the Jind grain market or prepare to sow the next crop?” Farmers alleged the officials would offer less rates later rather than MSP of Rs 1,960 fixed by the government and the farmers would be forced to sell their crop on lesser prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paddy-purchase-stopped-for-4-days-in-hry/articleshow/87545334.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Karnataka border Hyderabad shooters’ favourite hunting ground||HYDERABAD: The recent killing of a wild boar and a blackbuck by two hunters in Kalaburagi is only a tip of the iceberg as Telangana-Karnataka border has become a favourite hunting ground of wild animals for shooters from Hyderabad. Places like Bidar and Kalaburagi in Karnataka and Tandur and Vikarabad, which are close to Karnataka border, have emerged as top hunting spots for Hyderabad shooters. Confirming this, Chittapur forest range officer Vijay Kumar said: “The hunters come from Hyderabad and indulge in poaching of wild animals in Karnataka. That is why we have opposed bail for the two shooters in the recent case of poaching of blackbuck.” Wasif Hassan and Ali Hussain, two shooters from Hyderabad, who were members of the Telangana Rifle Association, along with their driver Peer Ahmed and two local guides were arrested in Sedam taluka of Kalaburagi district on October 27 for hunting a blackbuck. Forest officials claimed the accused drove all the way from Hyderabad to Karnataka border to hunt. In the last three years, several cases of poaching have been reported and foresters have even chanced upon foreign-made sporting rifles which are often used for hunting. Expressing worry over the increasing trend of hunting for fun, Mirza Karim Baig of Forests and Wildlife Protection Society said: “Most of these professional hunters are well educated and come from well-to-do families. All of them possess arms licences. They don’t hunt to make money, but they are trigger-happy and want to eat wild animal meat.” He said the government must take stringent action against these shooters by cancelling their weapon licences and seizing their arms. “The state should also revoke their membership in various sports shooting range associations,” he said. Telangana State Wildlife Board member and wildlife consultant Rajeev Mathew said killing any animal would amount to poaching. “All animals are placed in schedules from 1 (highest protection) to 5 (vermin where the animals can be killed). Most animals are listed in schedules 1 to 4. Schedule 5 is reserved for rats, mice, house crows and fruit bats. Since hunting is banned in India, it is indulged in night which can be dangerous,” Mathew explained. He further said even the killing of wild boar (termed culling) in Telangana and a few other states was allowed only with written permission of the forest authorities and the carcasses should be destroyed by burning or burying and they cannot be consumed. “Those who want to hunt should visit countries in Africa, especially southern Africa, Europe and the Americas and enjoy the sport. Hunting is controlled and legal, so there is no problem there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktaka-border-hyd-shooters-favourite-hunting-ground/articleshow/87546014.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||3 flee with Rs 2.5 crore after tying up 2 women, teen inside west Delhi house||NEW DELHI: Three men tied up a woman, her sister-in-law and 14-year-old son inside their house in Paschim Vihar (East) and stole Rs 2 crore in cash and jewellery worth around Rs 50 lakh. Two women domestic workers, who were hired by the family just two months ago from a south Delhi-based placement agency, helped the robbers enter the house. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the five suspects. No police verification of the helpers was done by the family. The crime took place on November 2. Police received a call from Shubham Enclave wherein the complainant told police that three men had committed robbery at her house. “The complainant told a police team that her husband and brother-in-law had a door fitting business and ran a factory in Mundka Industrial Area. In the evening on November 2, her sister-in-law, she and her 14-year-old son were in the house. Her sister-in-law and son were on the first floor, while she was on the ground floor,” said a senior police officer. Around 4pm, one of the domestic helpers, who had been provided accommodation on the ground floor, allowed three unknown men to enter the house. “One of them threatened the complainant with a screwdriver and tied her up, while the two others moved to the first floor. The duo ransacked the almirahs and stole Rs 2 crore in cash and jewellery. They also took away an iPhone. They then locked the women and boy in the house and fled,” the officer added. DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh said an FIR of robbery was registered on the woman’s complaint and investigation was started. “We are checking CCTV footage from the area to identify the suspects. We are also questioning the owner of the placement agency to help us identify and trace them. Their call records are also being tracked,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-flee-with-rs-2-5cr-after-tying-up-2-women-teen-inside-west-delhi-house/articleshow/87545338.cms||---

On one hand, multiple teams of Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) have already started cleaning up the ghats on a war-footing while on the other, a district team, led by Ranchi SDO Deepak Kumar Dubey and city SP Ranchi Saurabh, visited a few ghats to take stock of the situation and gave necessary directions for deployment of police as well as NDRF teams. The teams also discussed route plans and restrictions on traffic movement which will be put in place ahead of the festival. “We visited Dhurwa Dam and Bada Talaab today and directed the local police stations’ in-charges to ensure adequate security arrangements are made at the two water bodies. Apart from that, we have also directed the officials concerned to deploy a sufficient number of NDRF teams and police officials in civilian clothes at the ghats,” SP Saurabh said. He added that traffic restrictions will be put in place in and around the Chhath ghats and they have briefed the traffic in-charge concerned regarding putting up barricades wherever necessary. Meanwhile, the RMC teams have divided the city into four zones for a hassle-free sanitation drive. “We have doubled the number of tractors as well as labourers to clean the ghats in and around the city. The zonal supervisors, city managers and a senior official have been tagged in each of the four zones and they will review the cleanliness drive and divert manpower to other areas, if required,” deputy municipal commissioner Rajnish Kumar said. Meanwhile, a section of the devotees have said that they will exercise caution and perform arghya, which includes offering prayers to the sun god, among other things, within the confines of their homes. For instance, Harmu housing colony resident Kavita Devi, said that she finds it difficult to perform arghya in a pond amid fears of contracting Covid-19 because of overcrowding at the ghats. “I used to go to a ghat for performing arghya every year but ever since the pandemic broke out, I am sceptical of going to a ghat. We have lost our near and dear ones in the last two years due to Covid and so I have decided to celebrate Chhath in a pool which was built in our terrace a few months ago,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chhath-arrangements-on-war-footing/articleshow/87544795.cms||Gaurav Pandey

On Wednesday, state health minister Banna Gupta was present at the review meeting where Modi urged Jharkhand, besides other states, to push up its vaccination coverage as it is performing poorly. Later that day, the Prime Minister launched the month-long ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign for special house-to-house vaccination focussed on those whose second dose is overdue to accelerate the inoculation drive. “In order to further accelerate the vaccination drive, we have advised the district authorities to link Tika Vahans with Har Ghar Dastak. The decision was taken as the state has set a target of achieving 90% inoculation of the first dose beneficiaries on a priority basis,” state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said. ‘Tika Vahan’, which was introduced over a month ago to improve the vaccination drive in Jharkhand, has, so far, been of little help as only 16% of the campaign’s target has been achieved. A total of 60 vaccine vans were launched by chief minister Hemant Soren on September 27 and each of the vans was supposed to vaccinate 250 beneficiaries per day. According to the state health department’s data, a total of 97,984 beneficiaries were vaccinated till November 1. “According to simple calculations, at the rate of 250 people being vaccinated everyday by one van, as many as 5.85 lakh people should have been vaccinated by November 1. But the actual figure is 97,000 which is 16% of that targeted figure,” a health department official said. Dr Karn said that they have taken cognizance of the matter and a direction has been provided to all the deputy commissioners in this regard. “The DCs have been asked to hold a review meeting on the Tika express with all the stakeholders and similar meetings have to be conducted at the block levels, too, for the campaign’s proper utilization,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tika-vahans-to-be-linked-with-har-ghar-dastak-for-vax-drive/articleshow/87544755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Currently, an ITBP battalion has its headquarters in the Sukurhuttu area of Ranchi district. Though the unit is primarily engaged in carrying out anti-extremist operations at Rajnandgoan in Chhattisgarh, its personnel are also involved in law and order duties, including anti-Naxal operations in Jharkhand as and when required. Deputy commandant of the battalion, Amit Burman, said, “The terrain of our area of operation is difficult and covered with foliages and forests. Coupled with the adverse weather conditions, our jawans invariably face the situation of getting afflicted by malaria, typhoid and dengue. The life of our personnel is always at threat and risk.” He said once the personnel are covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PMJAY), they along with their dependents could get treatment in hospitals free of cost for various diseases. He added that the distribution of PMJAY cards has already begun by Union home minister Amit Shah. Shah handed over the cards to some members of the National Security Guards (NSG) in New Delhi on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/itbp-unit-welcomes-pmjay-scheme-for-capf/articleshow/87544808.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Ranchi||Fulfil promise on fuel price reduction: Jharkhand BJP chief whip to state||BOKARA: State’s BJP’s chief whip and Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan on Friday urged the Hemant Soren government to fulfil its promise of slashing the value added tax (VAT) which is being levied by the state on petrol and diesel prices. Narayan demanded that the state government should reduce the VAT on the two fuels by at least Rs 10 after the Centre slashed its excise duty on Diwali eve. “The reduction in VAT will further reduce the price of petrol and diesel to provide financial relief to the people,” the MLA said. He added, “I want to remind the chief minister of his promise that the state will reduce the taxes on petrol and diesel if the Union government reduces the central taxes. While the Centre has done its work, the state government is still asleep when its turn comes.” On November 3, the Centre had slashed excise duties on petrol and diesel. Following the reduction, a litre of petrol is now cheaper by Rs 5.68 while diesel is cheaper by Rs 12.27 in Bokaro. On November 2, petrol cost Rs 104.46 per litre and the price of diesel was Rs 104.08 per litre. Narayan’s demands have been supported by Ajsu Party’s Gomia legislator Lamodar Mahto. The transporters here have also demanded a slash in VAT. Rajesh Kumar Singh, the owner of city-based Janta Transport, said, “The state government should take a cue from its counterpart in Assam and reduce the VAT by at least Rs 10. Transporters here have to pay several taxes and a reduction in VAT will be a big relief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fulfil-promise-on-fuel-price-reduction-bjp-chief-whip-to-state/articleshow/87544826.cms||Divy Khare

---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Power failure for hours as tower collapses on live transmission line||RANCHI: An abandoned transmission tower, erected by Abhijeet Group between 2006 and 2012, collapsed on the live transmission lines in the early hours of Thursday, causing widespread outages at Lohardaga and parts of adjoining Ranchi district. Power supplies have since been restored. Power officials pointed out that the transmission towers and overhead power lines, erected by Abhijeet Group to evacuate power from their upcoming thermal power plant at Chandwa in Latehar district, were lying in an abandoned state over the past several years and thieves have been enjoying a virtual field day. They had cut away vital support members of the towers, which finally led to the collapse of the tower on Thursday night. They added that the abandoned transmission towers and lines that stretch from Tandwa in Chatra district to Namkum in Ranchi district continue to pose a public threat. “As the tower collapsed, a heavy 400KV conductor fell on the live transmission line of Jharkhand Urja Sancharan Nigam Ltd. (JUSNL), at a crossover point of the Abhijeet Group and JUSNL lines, causing power supply lines to snap. JUSNL patrolling parties located the accident site and restoration work was taken up soon after,” Mukesh Kumar Singh, general manager of transmission zone 1 of the state-owned JUSNL, told TOI. The location of the accident site is around 60km away from Lohardaga town and 5km to 6km from Itki in Ranchi district. Power supplies to the railway lines that connect Ranchi and Tori were being fed through alternate source from Gumla to ensure normal rail operations. “JUSNL does not have the requisite authority to ensure security of transmission towers and power lines that do not belong to us. Our power systems are fully automated that enable us to identify faults and initiate swift corrective actions,” K K Verma, JUSNL’s managing director, told TOI. Sources revealed that the now defunct Abhijeet Group had begun work on setting up a 1080MW thermal power plant at Chandwa in Latehar district in 2006 after the company signed an MoU with Jharkhand government. All the four units, each of 270MW capacity, were to have been commissioned in 2013. However, after the Coalgate scam erupted in 2012, the Chittarpur coal block in Jharkhand, which was allocated to the Abhijeet Group, was delisted, stalling work completely on the Chandwa power plant project. Officials said that since then, the transmission towers and power lines erected by the company for evacuation of power from the proposed Chandwa power plant have been lying in an abandoned state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/power-failure-for-hrs-as-tower-collapses-on-live-transmission-line/articleshow/87544806.cms||Tapas Biswas
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand AQI ‘moderate’ on Diwali night||RANCHI: At a time when the national capital is struggling with firecracker-induced pollution during Diwali, two cities in Jharkhand breathed easy recording moderate air quality post festivities. Jharkhand state Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) monitored the air quality index (AQI) of two cities — Ranchi and Dhanbad — through continuous ambient air quality monitors — both showing results in the moderate range of 100 and 200. Pollution board officials said apart from the continuous monitors, there are 18 manual monitors to record ambient air quality in the state, data from which is collected and analysed manually. Dhanbad has three and Ranchi two additional manual monitors as well. AQI reports from the manual monitors, including four in Bokaro, two in Jamshedpur, two in Dumka, three in Deoghar and two in Hazaribag are likely to collected and analysed by Saturday. The measurements were carried out for cumulative air comprising PM2.5, PM10, sox and nox together. A research associate at the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) Tushar Kumar said meteorological conditions in cities in Jharkhand are different from Delhi and neighbouring cities that face a lot of accumulation of pollutants during winter months, particularly post Diwali. “We do not observe the usual Diwali spike (in pollution) here because of wind circulation that drives away the pollutants,” he said while agreeing that there was still lack of awareness in the region. “On one hand people do not take the warnings seriously and on the other, the data collected by pollution control board is not available in the public domain,” he said. Member, Steering Committee of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Dr SN Tripathy, believes that readily available data helps in deciding policies and chalking out mitigation plans. “We carried out a fair measurement of various metals and pollutants in the ambient air in Delhi during 2019 Diwali and found that there was a substantial but temporary spike in the pollutants,” he said, adding that various steps have been taken thereafter. Commenting on lack of conteneous data in Jharkhand, he said a sensor-based network can help the state identify pollution hotspots or pollution spikes for better and effective management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-aqi-moderate-on-diwali-night/articleshow/87544785.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The US Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) on Friday night (India time) issued a statement saying that from November 8, 2021, “all non-US citizens, non-US immigrants must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 prior to traveling to the US. These travellers are also required to show proof (of) Covid-19 vaccination and a negative test no more than three days prior to the flight’s departure. Limited exceptions apply.” Importantly, the statement adds that “those who recently recovered from Covid-19 may travel with documentation of recovery and a letter from a licensed healthcare provider or public health official indicating the patient is cleared for travel.” People intending to travel to the US should go through the entire list of requirements and ensure what rules are valid when they actually intend to take the flight, as during pandemic rules keep changing frequently. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from November 8 all air passengers two years of age or older traveling internationally, regardless of vaccination status, must provide a negative test to the airline before boarding the flight. “Passengers fully vaccinated must provide a negative test no more than three days before the flight’s departure from a foreign country, in addition to showing proof of vaccination. Passengers over two years of age not fully vaccinated must provide a negative test no more than one day before the flight’s departure. Except in the limited circumstances allowed by CDC, unvaccinated travellers will be US citizens and legal permanent residents,” it adds. For being allowed entry into the US, the proof of vaccination must have “personal identifiers (at a minimum, full name and date of birth) that match the personal identifiers on the passenger’s passport or other travel documents; name of official source issuing the record and vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination. The last dose must have been given a full 14 days before the day boarding a flight to the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/recently-recovered-from-covid-among-those-conditionally-allowed-to-enter-us-from-nov-8/articleshow/87546424.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Speaking to the media in Ludhiana on Friday, state finance minister Manpreet Badal said the government was keen to cut prices but the final decision would be taken in the cabinet meeting on Sunday. He said the Union government should have reduced the excise duty further on petrol and diesel. Following the cut in excise duty by the Centre, various states like Haryana and UT Chandigarh have reduced the VAT on fuel. Earlier, SAD president Sukhbir Badal had urged the Congress government to reduce VAT rate on petrol and diesel to provide relief to the consumers. “The chief minister was on record having said that the treasury was full. In that case, he should not have any problem in affecting an immediate reduction in state VAT on fuel as done by the Centre and various other state governments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-to-take-decision-on-vat-cut-tomorrow/articleshow/87546435.cms||---

His turban had been taken off and he had been repeatedly beaten up. The petitioner and other accused had videographed him without the turban when he was bleeding and the same had been uploaded on Facebook. The turban is an essential religious symbol and photographing of an elderly person in an injured condition without the turban and uploading it for public viewing on a social platform would prima facie amount to hurting the religious feelings,” the HC has held. Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal of the the high court has passed these orders while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea filed by Gurpreet Singh from Tarn Taran district in Punjab. The petitioner had sought anticipatory bail in relation to an FIR No.10 dated February 19, 2021, registered at Jhabal police station of Taran Taran district in Punjab under IPC sections. The counsel for the petitioner contended that the sections slapped in the FIR are bailable and case under Section 295-A (hurting the religious sentiments) would not be made out as the DSP has stated that the allegations of hurting the religious feelings of the complainant are not made out. It was also argued that there was delay of one year and five months in the registration of the FIR. Strongly objecting to the bail plea, the counsel for the complainant argued that earlier he had filed a petition before the HC with an audio CD of the incident, to seek registration of FIR against the petitioner. The police registered the FIR only after the petition. Complainant had also argued that he had earlier made several representations and complaints to the police but no action was taken thereon. The CD of the incident was also placed on record before the HC. After hearing both the parties and considering the “serious allegations” in the matter, Justice Grewal dismissed the plea for anticipatory bail, observing that the court does not agree with the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that a prima facie case under Section 295-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is not made out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/posting-injured-turbanless-mans-photo-is-hurting-religious-sentiments-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court/articleshow/87546471.cms||Ajay Sura

The total number of doses administered now stands at 2,06,35,836 and the number of fully vaccinated people has reached 75,24,737, according to the CoWin dashboard. The approximate number of eligible beneficiaries is 1.5 crore, 50.2% of whom have received both doses. Also, with 1,31,11,099 first doses being administered till date, 87.4% of the eligible population has now received at least one dose of the vaccine. Interestingly, while the northwest district, which is the most populous among the 11 revenue districts, has administered more than 24.5 lakh cumulative doses, it's behind southwest (23.8 lakh) when it comes to fully vaccinated beneficiaries. The northwest district has administered nearly 16 lakh first doses and southwest around 15 lakh. South West district leads the chart of fully vaccinated people in Delhi  However, southwest is slightly ahead with 8,80,949 fully vaccinated people compared with northwest district's 8,59,440. Even the west district has administered 8,34,214 second doses. These three districts account for over one-third (34.2%) of fully vaccinated beneficiaries in the capital. On the other hand, the northeast district has 4,02,133 fully vaccinated people out of 13,15,048 total doses administered. The two other districts where less than six lakh second doses have been administered are Shahdara (5,33,293) and north (5,70,835). While around two lakh vaccine doses were being administered each day till about a month ago, the number has now dipped to around 75,000 on an average daily of late. With a large number of the eligible population having received their first dose, the number of second doses being administered now is higher. The vaccination drive, which started on January 16, reached a high of nearly 11 lakh doses being administered in a week between June 26 and July 2. It reached an all-time high of 11.6 lakh between September 18 and 24. More than two lakh people got vaccinated in a day on September 25 and 27, but the numbers have not crossed the two-lakh mark ever since. While 64.4% (1,33,00,994) of the two crore doses have been administered to those in the 18-44 years age category, those aged 45-59 years have got 48,92,152 (23.7%) doses. Those aged 60 years and above have received 24,42,694 doses, which is nearly 12% of the total number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/every-2nd-delhi-adult-now-fully-vaccinated-against-covid/articleshow/87546514.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: In pre-Diwali week, contact tracing fell to 6.35 per case in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: With Punjab breathing easy due to lesser Covid-19 cases than a few months back, the state appears to be going lax on contact tracing -- a key public health measure to infectious disease outbreaks -- and tracking of positive cases, especially in the high-risk festival season. This, despite the central government warning against any laxity in adhering to Covid protocols during the festival season as it could lead to resurgence of novel coronavirus cases. After maintaining a decent ratio of tracing over 22 contacts per case for the most part of October, the tracking rate fell below 10 and touched as low as 6.35 per case -- 997 contacts traced in 157 cases-- by the end of the month, which is over four times less than the target of 30 set by the state government. Contact tracing — the process of identifying the source of infection and tracking people the patients had met before testing positive — is considered key for interrupting chains of transmission. During the assessment period, fresh cases were reported in 18 districts of which 10 districts even failed to match the state's tracing average. Bathinda featured at the bottom of the list with a tracing record of 0.8 contacts per case, 1.4 contacts per case were traced in Pathankot, 1.6 in Ferozepur, 1.7 in Hoshiarpur, 3.9 in Ropar, 4.6 in Mohali, 5 each in Nawanshahr and Faridkot, 5.5 in Moga and 6 in Fatehgarh Sahib. Fazilka, Jalandhar, Muktsar Patiala, Ludhiana-,Sangrur and Amritsar traced contacts in the range of 13 to 6.9 per case. The state health department’s data reveals that the percentage of contacts getting infected from positive cases stands at 36.8%. District-wise analysis of the status of contacts tested shows that 33.3% of close contacts in Faridkot were found positive, 18.2% in Ludhiana, 18% in Amritsar, 17.6% in Fazilka, 17.3% in Jalandhar and 12.5 % in Bathinda. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar attributed the drop in tracing ratio to the festive season and field staff not being able to update the data on the online portal due to technical issues. He further said that instructions have been issued to staff to ensure that up to date data is uploaded online and districts lagging have been asked to increase tracing of cases. DROP IN CONTAINMENT ZONES:Only five micro-containment zones, which refers to areas having 5 to 14 cases, have been left in Punjab. At present, the state has no large outbreak areas, which have 15 or more cases. The trend points to new cases not coming in clusters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-in-pre-diwali-week-contact-tracing-fell-to-6-35-per-case/articleshow/87546515.cms||Vinod Kumar

Track the pollution level in your cityDelhi's overall Air Quality Index was 462 on Friday, deep in the severe zone. This was the worst AQI the city has seen the day after Diwali since monitoring began in 2015. Delhi also recorded the sharpest deterioration in AQI since 2015, from the day before Diwali (AQI 314 ) to the day after. The widespread flouting of the Supreme Court order banning firecrackers added to other factors, creating a "perfect storm" of dirty air over the region. The wind direction and low wind speeds facilitated the transport of farm fire pollutants from neighbouring states. The share of pollution from stubble-burning in Delhi's AQI rose from 25% on Thursday to 36% on Friday, the highest so far this season. Delhi also recorded moderate fog on Friday morning as visibility dropped to 200 metre in Safdarjung and 350 metre at Palam, conditions that made the air worse. Finally, low temperatures - with the minimum at 15 degrees Celsius - trapped pollutants close to the land surface, experts said. On Thursday, the AQI went from "very poor" at 4pm to "severe" (414) by 10 pm. SAFAR, a pollution monitoring body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, "Firework emissions on the night of Diwali degraded the air quality from 'very poor' to 'severe' category." Calm after Diwali storm to blame for 'severe' air  In terms of AQI, this was the worst post-Diwali day since the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started measuring AQI. Before this, the highest AQI on post-Diwali day was recorded at 445 in 2016. The AQI on Diwali day this year was better than in 2020 but worse than the 2019 level. Last year too, a complete ban on firecracker was flouted, with the AQI deteriorating from 330 (very poor) on pre-Diwali day to 414 (severe) on the day of the festival. The AQI on Diwali day in 2019 was 337 (very poor). The CPCB central control room data showed that Delhi-NCR's average 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were both in the "severe" category of Graded Response Action Plan as these crossed 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 14 and 20 hours, respectively. The 24-hour average PM10 was 545.3 micrograms per cubic metre and the PM2.5 was 425.5 micrograms per cubic metre. The standard PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. "The sudden deterioration this year is attributed to extremely calm conditions, change of wind direction, low ventilation coefficient and use of firecrackers. Though the increase in trend in the concentration of pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 was observed since the evening of November 3, the major changes were observed after 8pm on Diwali, when the fireworks started. Ambient Air Quality in Delhi was already in the 'very poor' category due to the accumulation of pollutants in the air shed," said Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, "The season's first severe smog episode was observed when all factors - unfavourable weather conditions, increased share of biomass burning and use of firecrackers -came into play." However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted strong winds at the speed of 25-35kmph during the day on Saturday and Sunday, the air quality is likely to improve. SAFAR said on Friday, "Local winds have picked up since morning and now the fast dispersion is expected. Without any more firecracker emissions, AQI is likely to improve to 'very poor' category by tonight although the stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same as today. Relief is expected only from the evening of November 7 but AQI will fluctuate within the "very poor" range."

---||Business||From next year, new packaging norms for products will declare their prices in units||NEW DELHI: In its bid to empower consumers to make informed decisions before buying any packaged item, the government will implement new packaging norms from next April. The manufacturers will have to make additional declarations to MRP by mentioning the price of the commodity per unit -- per kg or litre for items weighing more than a kg or litre; and per gram or millilitre (ml) for items of less than one kg or a litre. There will be similar norms for items that can be measured in metres and centimetres. The amended Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules also removes the “specified quantities” norms for packaging for 19 types of items including milk, tea, biscuits, edible oil, atta, soft drink and drinking water, baby food, pulses and cereals, cement bag, bread and detergents. So, there will be no such government mandated specifications on quantities and with this the manufacturers will have full freedom to decide the quantities of all packaged items they sell in the market. Another major change is mandatory declaration of “month and year of manufacture” on imported packaged items instead of the current regime where the importer or seller has the option of mentioning either month and date of import or pre-packing. “The quality of any product is linked to the manufacturing date,” said a consumer affairs ministry official. The consumer affairs ministry has notified the changes in the rules. On the first of the two major amendments with regard to quantity and unit price, the official said changes have been made simultaneously to provide more options to consumers and also for ease of business for the manufacturers of such items as well. “Once packaged items are made available in all quantities, consumers can choose what meets their requirements and they won’t be compelled to buy bigger quantities. Similarly, manufacturers can also bring more options. But to ensure consumers rights are protected, the provision has been made to declare prices in units such as kg, gram, litre, millilitre, metre and centimetre. That brings parity while doing any comparison,” the official added. Once the prices are displayed in uniform units, it will be much easier for consumers to compare, different options or brands of the same product.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/from-april-food-items-to-carry-not-just-mrp-but-price/unit-too/articleshow/87546542.cms||Dipak K Dash

Lobo wants to contest from Calangute (which he currently represents), while Delilah has started work in Siolim constituency. “We will both contest on the same party ticket,” he said, adding that they “cannot contest elections” on different tickets. “We will both contest on BJP, AAP, Congress or as independent candidates, but we will contest on the same ticket,” he said. Lobo said that he has not asked for a ticket for his wife, and that it is up to the party to take a decision. “We are both winnable candidates and Delilah has been working in Siolim constituency,” Lobo said. He said that his wife has been in active politics since 2007 as a panch, and has been sarpanch of Parra for the past ten years. He also said that Delilah would address issues of water shortages once she gets elected, and that she is now coordinating with engineers for immediate relief. A political observer said that Lobo is trying to keep BJP guessing about his future strategy. Lobo had said that Congress and AAP had approached him. Recently, Lobo got into an argument with former Siolim MLA Dayanand Mandrekar over providing paddy harvesters to farmers in that constituency. On Tuesday, Lobo said that he is ready to leave BJP if the party does not want him, and that he would win six out of seven seats in Bardez. Lobo was speaking after meeting Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wife-and-i-will-contest-on-same-partys-ticket-lobo/articleshow/87545180.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM's Diwali gift: 4% vat slash, lower cess on diesel & petrol||BHOPAL: A day after the Union government, followed by several BJP-ruled states slashed excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a 4% cut in VAT on Diwali, and slashed cess too. Cess on petrol has been slashed by Rs 2 and Rs 1.50 per litre on diesel. Now, petrol cess stands at Rs 2.50 and diesel Rs 1.50. The earlier rates for VAT were 33% on petrol and 23% on diesel. The cuts brought down petrol price to Rs 107.21 per litre and diesel to Rs 90.86 in Bhopal on Friday. Following the reduction in excise duty, the prices of petrol and diesel had come down to Rs 112.54 and Rs 95.39 per litre on Diwali. The relief will cost the state government Rs 1,948 crore for the remaining months of the fiscal, a government release said. "This is a big relief for the public. It will impact the MP government's finances, but we took this decision in the interest of the people," CM Chouhan said on Thursday. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh feels the excise cut announced by the Centre isn't enough. "If Modiji really wants to reduce prices of petrol and diesel and give relief to the people, then he should make the central excise the same as it was during Congress rule in 2014. Petrol and diesel prices will drop by Rs 18 each," Digvijaya tweeted on Friday, adding: "Maybe, if the UP elections are lost, then Modiji will bring down prices to the 2014 level." Fuel prices on November 2, before the cuts, were Rs 118.81 per litre for petrol and Rs 107.88 diesel. Petrol prices had gone up by Rs 8 in October, and diesel crossed the Rs 100-mark on October 5. 'Further drop in fuel prices possible'  Citizens feel a bit relieved following the cuts, but say fuel prices are still too high for their comfort. "It's a welcome step but fuel is still too expensive. You can withdraw subsidy only when peoples' incomes rise considerably. Incomes have risen in the country but not uniformly. The government should charge more from people who earn more, but not everyone," suggested Pramod Singh, who was getting petrol for his bike in Shivaji Nagar. Ajay Singh of MP Petrol Pump Owners' Association said a further drop in prices is possible. "After November, crude prices in the international market usually come down. Besides, there is pressure on OPEC countries to boost crude production. If crude prices fall, we can see a further decline in petrol and diesel rates here," he said. Crude price in the international market on Friday was $83.6 per barrel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cms-diwali-gift-4-vat-slash-lower-cess-on-diesel-petrol/articleshow/87546594.cms||---

He said the project has recently received clearance from the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA). “I’ve been told the file is now with the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA), and once it is approved by them, the work will be tendered,” he said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who had spent a year practising as an Ayurvedic doctor at the Candolim PHC around 17 years ago, had laid the foundation stone of the new wing in February 2020. The work was delayed because of the pandemic. “Once the new building is ready it will become a community health centre of international standards with emergency treatment facilities,” health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was also present for the foundation stone laying ceremony then, had said.  Ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said the state government has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the new wing. The new wing is being built by the Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation (GIDC). The existing PHC building, built around 50 years ago, will also continue to function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-on-new-candolim-health-centre-wing-soon/articleshow/87545192.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

And now, those with lung ailments and heart diseases, perhaps made worse by Covid, will suffer. The NGT had clearly said that crackers can be burst only in areas with moderate air quality for two hours in the evening. The morning-after haze showed that the rule hadn't been followed or adequately enforced. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Friday, air quality in major MP cities turned from moderate to poor. Gwalior had the worst AQI at 260 but pollution in Bhopal and Jabalpur was worse than last year's. An AQI of 'poor' means most people will face breathing discomfort - add post-Covid lung troubles and it's a deadly mix. Indore recorded the lowest pollution levels this Diwali, though there too the air quality was closer to the 'poor' category mark. Compared to the past three years, air pollution has increased considerably in most parts of the state. Green crackers could have made a difference, but it's clear there weren't many green crackers exploding on Thursday. Green crackers are estimated to be 30% less polluting, but there isn't enough production yet to meet the demand, and few are willing to spend more for it. AQI above 200 in Bhopal, Gwalior  The district administrations' orders on sale and use of crackers, issued under section 144 CrPC before Diwali, said that only green crackers and reduced emission improved crackers could be sold and used this Diwali, but the pollution levels present a different story altogether. Air quality takes into account the levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Bhopal, Jabalpur and Gwalior were in this zone the day after Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lungs-cough-out-diwali-truth-cracker-ban-went-up-in-smoke-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/87546596.cms||Ankur Sirothia

People should consider him one from among themselves and a common-man’s CM, he added. The CM was here to pay obeisance at Vishavkaram temple. He later addressed the gathering. Vishavkarma temple at Phagwara attracts thousands of pilgrims on this day. Terming his government as the government of common man, for the common man and by the common man, Channi claimed that from Day 1, his major thrust was only ensuring transparent, responsive and citizencentric administration. He made these remarks when Punjab Congress leaders have been making inaccessibility of Captain Amarinder Singh as the CM an issue and also sharpening their attacks after his resignation from the Congress and his attacks on Gandhis. The chief minister claimed that the state would soon be transformed into ‘Golden Sparrow of India’. He said that Lord Vishwakarma was the founder of the engineering, architecture and technology on the earth. “The industrial and infrastructure growth across the globe that we observe today was only due to the blessings of Lord Vishwakarma, who had created mechanical skills,” he said. On the occasion, the hief minister announced grant of Rs 2 crore for the Vishwakarma temple, adding that a hitech ambulance will be provided to charitable hospital being run by organisation. Union minister also announced ambulanceWhile chief minister Channi announced donating a hitech ambulance for the hospital attached with Vishavkarma temple, Union minister of state and local MP Som Parkash, after paying obeisance at the Vishavkarma temple, also announced that he would release grant for an ambulance for the hospital.

Punjab had detected 3,032 cases on Diwali. It was the third time that over 3,000 straw burning events have been recorded in a day, with the earlier one being on November 2 at 3,001. Against 5,327 cases recorded on November 5 this year, 6,668 cases were recorded on this day in 2019 and 5,036 in 2020. Against 28,792 burning cases in the ongoing year, 38,053 cases had been recorded till November 5 in 2019 and 49,122 cases in 2020. All 23 districts in the state have recorded such cases, with Pathankot having the lowest figures of only three and Tarn Taran the highest at 2,817. Ferozepur is second at 2,329, Patiala next at 1,671, Sangrur at 1,661 and Ludhiana at 1,607. In all, 12 districts have recorded events more than 1,000. Together with the pollution spread by firecrackers on the Diwali night, the ambient air quality worsened in the state and was recorded as poor with AQI over 200 at most of the places on early Friday morning. Stubble burning is recorded in Punjab till November 30, though the cases start receding after November 20. Going by the late start of harvesting this year due to late rains, the residue burning is expected to continue till the end of the ongoing month. 18% drop in air pollution Punjab witnessed 18.3% reduction in air pollution on Diwali day as compared to the festival day last year, but its air quality fell from poor to very poor category. The pollution level has been measured by six CAAQMS installed by Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Patiala to monitor the ambient air quality on a real-time basis. The comparative level of AQI value during Diwali this year showed less pollution with an average AQI level of 268 whereas last year the average AQI was 328 on Diwali day. In Amritsar, the average AQI was recorded at 303 against 386 last year. Similarly, Jalandhar recorded 327 AQI against 328 last year, Ludhiana 289 against 376 last year whereas Khanna witnessed 227 AQI this year against 281 last year. In Mandi Gobindgarh, the AQI this year remained at 220 against 262 last year whereas Patiala recorded AQI of 241 against 334 in 2020. According to PPCB, Patiala recorded maximum reduction in air pollution with 27.8% this year whereas Jalandhar recorded only 0.3% fall in pollution than last year. PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said, “The two-hour window on Diwali helped a lot in keeping pollution level low. Even, stubble burning cases have been less than last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stubble-burning-cases-hit-peak-in-punjab/articleshow/87545972.cms||Neel Kamal

He will contest the 2022 assembly election against chief minister Pramod Sawant from the Sakhali constituency. Gaonkar said that, if AAP forms the government in Goa, mining will resume in the state within six months . “I will join AAP on Sunday when Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will arrive in Goa,” Gaonkar said. He appealed to all political parties to support him in the upcoming assembly election to defeat Sawant. Gaonkar said that he joined AAP on the condition that he will contest against Sawant. He said that in the past 10 years with BJP at the helm of the government, the state had gone back 20 years in terms of development. “Unemployment is on the rise and people are committing suicide.” He said that he had held a meeting with Trinamool Congress (TMC). “To save Goa I have decided to join politics. On October 24, I met with Kejriwal. We have decided to approach the Supreme Court for an early hearing in the 1988 petition to restart mining,” he said. Gaonkar said that his supporters have told him to join AAP. “Those who think that mining should resume in the state will support me, and I have confidence in them. I have been in the mining sector for the last 40 years and people will support me,” he said. Gaonkar said that mining technically stopped in Goa since 2012 and that this was done by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. “If BJP government has not started mining in the last 10 years, do you think that they will start now? They have vested interests,” he said. Gaonkar questioned why when there was a BJP government both in the state and Centre they have not been able to restart mining. He also said that AAP’s legal team has already started studying how to restart mining and that he has provided them with the documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-fronts-puti-gaonkar-to-join-aap-contest-against-cm/articleshow/87545232.cms||---

After this decision, the price of a litre of petrol has come down from Rs 106.94 to Rs 95.27 in the state, and of diesel to Rs 86.51 from Rs 98.60. According to a official spokesperson, petrol and diesel prices are still higher in other states as compared to Haryana. In Punjab, petrol is Rs 105.02, in Delhi, it is Rs 103.97, in Himachal is Rs 96.06 and in Rajasthan. Rs 111.10. Similarly, per litre diesel price in Punjab is Rs.88.76, Delhi Rs.86.67 and Rajasthan Rs 95.71. On the occasion of Diwali, the Centre had announced a dip in prices of petrol and diesel. Subsequently, Haryana also announced to reduce VAT in petrol and diesel. The move triggered a fresh round of allegations against the ruling BJP-JJP alliance by the opposition parties in Haryana. HPCC president Selja and AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala accused the Manohar Lal Khattarled government of “manipulation”. “The current rates are purely the result of what the central government has done. Had the state government made any contribution, the rates would have been much lower, as they are today. This government has slashed the rates of petrol and increased those of diesel. All this manipulation has been done in the state,” claimed Surjewala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/petrol-diesel-cheaper-in-haryana-as-compared-to-other-states/articleshow/87545976.cms||---

On behalf of the teachers, Anupa Bhagat and Pratik Surlakar have handed over a list of demands to the chief minister and have threatened to protest at Azad Maidan, Panaji, if the government fails to fulfil them. Surlakar said their demands include Rs 25,000 salary per month and job security and that these teachers be given preference as early as possible and whenever there is a vacancy for permanent post. He said they are well qualified and fit to be considered for a full-time job. Surlakar told TOI that they are paid Rs 150 per lecture since the last many years with no security of job or fixed nature of lectures per day. This, he said, makes their income unstable. “There are more than 25 LBTs who have been working for 15 or more years and some are over 40 years of age and nearing the cut off of 45 years to be considered for government jobs. Yet no care has been taken by the government for their job security,” he said. There are a few schools where all classes are conducted by only the LBTs. “Even though we are termed as lecture basis teachers, we are working full-time like regular teachers,” Bhagat said, adding, “Along with regular classes, we take up projects of students, follow up with circulars of different events, office work and all that which a regular teacher does.” Surlakar said that the state government has assured them that their services will be regularised and that they will be given preferential treatment for appointments as and when vacancies arise in the department of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lecture-basis-teachers-seek-regularisation-of-services/articleshow/87545235.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana records 48% decline in stubble burning cases during this paddy season, credits vigil||AMBALA: Haryana recorded 48.28% dip in crop stubble burning cases during this paddy season. The state’s paddy bowl districts — Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Sirsa and Yamunanagar — recorded a marginal decline in the number of cases. Haryana reported 3,038 cases reported between September 15 to November 1, 2021n as against 5,875 cases during the corresponding period in 2020. According to district officials, the decline has been due to their continuous vigil and awareness programmes. Identifying red and yellow zone villages and areas, where there have been most cases of stubble burning in the past and present, also helped, they added. On November 3, additional chief secretary Sumita Mishra of Haryana agriculture and farmers welfare department-cum-commission for air quality management had held a meeting with district administrative officials of Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Jind, Kaithal and Fatehabad to discuss stubble burning and air quality issues. Agriculture department director general Hardeep Singh was also present in the meeting, which reviewed the record of active fire locations (AFLs) and work done by district-level officials and the ground-level employees. Ambala deputy commissioner Vikram Singh said, “There has been improvement in the air quality index (AQI) as compared to last year. In October 2020, the AQI recorded was 226 (poor category) while in October 2021, the AQI was recorded is 133 (moderate category).” Ambala recorded 75% less cases — 86 in 2021 against 746 in 2020. Similarly, Kurukshetra recorded a dip of 43% (459 in 2021 against 811 in 2020), Yamunanagar also recorded a dip of about 71% (113 cases in 2021 against 399 in 2020), Kaithal recoded 29% dip (775 cases against 1,096 in 2020), Karnal recorded 22.02% dip (740 against 949 in 2020).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hry-records-48-dip-in-stubble-burning-cases/articleshow/87545977.cms||JK Singh

Among those dead is a 13-year-old girl. Four passengers were badly injured. There were 28 people in the bus, from five to six families who knew each other. They had hired the bus from Indore to go to Mathura, 700km away, for Govardhan Puja. The accident happened 250km into the journey. The bus driver crashed into a parked truck on NH-46 near Barkheda, around 40km from Guna district headquarters, around 5am. The bus was engulfed by fire within seconds. It's a miracle that 25 passengers escaped from the inferno. Indoreans opt for 'boardings' for pets to keep them happy on Diwali Indore: Pet boardings and pet cares have received a lot of bookings this Diwali. While some Indoreans are opting to leave the pet for a day or two owing to trips, other want to keep their dogs away from harrowing experiences caused by sound of firecrackers. "This year, we are expecting too many guests. Our Milo will get anxious around them, so, we have decided to leave her at a boarding home which is on the outskirts as she will be safe under care of a professional," a pet owner Sneha Dubey told TOI. Pet hostels are charging between Rs 500 and Rs 1000 per day depending on the size of a pet, food intake, activities and care among others. Pets are served two meals and treats twice a day. Pets are also taken for morning and evening walks followed by play time and some activities for an hour. City-based pet hostel owner Akshay Shelar said that his hostel was almost full. "We have a capacity of 40 dogs and our hostel is on outskirts. It makes it an ideal place for the pets especially when firecrackers are bursting," he said. The hostel has four employees, including a veterinarian, who are present 24 hours to make sure that the emergency gets attended. "We have also been making use of lavender oils and other diffusers to keep dogs calm, besides playing soothing music to ensure that they sleep peacefully," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bus-catches-fire-after-accident-13-year-old-among-3-killed/articleshow/87546630.cms||---

Among those who attended the event were representatives of local outfits or local units of national organisations like VHP, some of whom gave provocative speeches. One of them, Surendra Kumar Jain of VHP, said Muslims should go to Pakistan if they want to offer namaz in open areas. Puja at namaz site: Cops say no complaint received yet  Surendra Kumar Jain of VHP said the protests against namaz in public places would spread from Gurugram to other parts of the country. The outfit that organised the puja, Samyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, had last month submitted a memorandum to the government demanding a stop to namaz congregations in public places. The same outfit had organised similar protests against namaz in 2018 after which sites for Friday prayers were designated. There was police deployment at the spot, but the numbers were lower than last week when 25 people were arrested for trying to disrupt namaz. A senior police officer told TOI, "Namaz was called off at the site in advance to avoid confrontation. So, there was no law-and-order situation," said a senior police officer. Asked about if the speeches were being examined, the officer added, "We have not received any complaint till now against the speeches." After protests every Friday over the past few weeks, the Gurugram administration recently withdrew permission for namaz from eight of the 37 designated sites. This Friday, though, other than those eight sites, namaz did not happen at three more places, including Sector 12, because of opposition. Delhi BJP's Kapil Mishra said roads were not for religious activity, adding if the same was done for pujas, roads would be blocked forever as there is some puja every day. A senior district administration official said a committee formed to designate namaz spots had begun work on finding a resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/govardhan-puja-at-designated-namaz-site-in-gurugram/articleshow/87546632.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Chandigarh||Big boost needed in climate adaptation: UNEP on releasing Adaptation Gap Report||Bathinda: The UNEP report was launched at the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow, where world leaders met to make a collective push to limit global warming, in line with the Paris Agreement. The adaptation gap report 2021 calls for ramping up funding and action to address the growing impacts of climate change. “As the world looks to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, efforts are still not anywhere strong enough. It must also dramatically up its game to adapt to climate change,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen, upon release of the report on Thursday. She said even if countries turn the tap off on emissions today, climate impacts would remain for decades to come.“We need a change in adaptation ambition for funding and implementation to reduce damages and losses from climate change,” said Andersen. Countries are currently on track to witnessing a 2.7-degree rise by the end of the century. As outlined in the 2015 accord, even if warming is kept at 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees, climate risk remains.UNEP said greater ambition towards adaptation, particularly for financing and implementation, is also critical to keep existing gaps from widening. The report found the costs of adaptation are likely to be at the higher end of an estimated $140 billion to $300 billion a year by the end of this decade, and $280 billion to $500 billion annually by 2050. Furthermore, the cost in developing countries is estimated to be between five to 10 times greater than current public adaptation finance flows. In 2019, these nations received $76.9 billion in climate finance for mitigation and adaptation planning and implementation. The report also revealed how countries are missing the opportunity to use fiscal recovery from the COVID19 pandemic to prioritize green economic growth that also supports adapting to climate impacts such as droughts, wildfires, and floods. Just a portion of the $16.7 trillion in stimulus funding globally has gone to adaptation. As of June, fewer than one-third of 66 countries studied had explicitly funded COVID-19 measures to address climate change. Future government spending could also be hampered by the heightened cost of debt servicing, combined with decreased public revenues, particularly in developing countries. The report’s authors also pointed to areas of progress. For example, nearly 80 percent of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, such as a plan, strategy, policy, or law, representing a seven percent increase since 2020. Additionally, the top 10 donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation. During the period between 2010 and 2019, indicating efforts are growing. UNEP said countries need to step up public adaptation finance through direct investment and by overcoming barriers to private sector involvement. They must also consider higher-end climate scenarios, as detailed in the most recent assessment by the UN scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Additionally, governments should use post-pandemic fiscal recovery to prioritize interventions that will bring economic growth and climate change resilience. Authorities should also establish integrated risk management approaches, as well as flexible disaster finance frameworks, the report added, while richer nations should help developing countries to free up fiscal space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/big-boost-needed-in-climate-adaptation-unep-on-releasing-adaptation-gap-report/articleshow/87545987.cms||---

In keeping with the plan, the Tarakeswar Development Authority (TDA) last week floated a tender for “rejuvenation” of Dudhpukur, the holy pond where devotees take a dip before offering prayers. Local MLA and TDA chairman Ramendu Singha Roy said under the project, “the temple complex will receive a makeover, the holy pond will be rejuvenated and approach roads through villages will be revamped”. Dudhpukur, engineers said, would undergo “ozone treatment for oxidation of bacteria and other waterborne pathogens”. In other words, ozone treatment will reduce contaminants in the pond water. There is also a plan to illuminate Dudhpukur like the Amrit Sarovar in front of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Another nearby pond, Shankar Dighi, too will be beautified along with Hanuman Ghat, Roy said. Added amenities are likely to include more tourist accommodations and public toilets. The Tarakeswar temple was built in 1729 by Raja Bharamalla like an atchala (twotier roof with each level having four curved triangular sectors) and boasts a natmandir (dancing hall). There are extended galleries for congregation of devotees. Mythology says Dudhpukur was originally filled with milk for purification of the body, mind and soul. Today, it is holy water for purgation. The residing deity being Lord Shiva, the temple sees a sea of pilgrims during the month-long Srabani Mela in July-August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-80-crore-makeover-on-cards-for-tarakeswar-dudhpukur/articleshow/87545296.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Goa||Goa court directs bus driver to pay Rs 5,000 compensation to Mapusa cop||PANAJI: Holding that it is the duty of every individual to respect police officers, a North Goa court has ordered a 24-year-old bus driver to pay compensation of Rs 5,000 to a police officer for his “disrespectful act” against the public servant in 2017. The court sentenced bus driver Sadam Daddikar to simple imprisonment until the rising of the court and fined him Rs 500 for restraining PSI Ramkrishna Mangueshkar of Mapusa traffic cell when he was trying to issue him a challan for not carrying vehicle documents, unduly delaying the journey and not wearing a uniform. “Nobody can take the law in his hand nor is anybody above law and it is the duty of every individual to respect and abide by the law and the law enforcing agency. The complainant herein is a public servant and a police officer and it is the duty of every individual to respect one police officer,” Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mapusa, Nilima Shrikant Kankonkar, stated. “The accused herein has voluntarily obstructed and restrained the complainant, a police officer and a public servant while discharging his lawful duty and while imposing sentence the object of deterrence is required to be kept in mind, so that the accused does not commit similar offence again,” the court stated. “Since the accused herein is a first time offender a lenient view is taken by this court,” the judge added. It was submitted to the court that, in 2017, when Mangueshkar and a police constable reached Ganeshpuri, they noticed that a bus had stopped on the road. Mangueshkar asked the driver to produce documents and issued him a challan for not wearing a uniform. The constable further deposed that the accused started arguing with the PSI and abused him with filthy words and then left the spot. It was the case of the prosecution that after some time the accused returned on a two-wheeler and blocked the PSI and constable’s way near Mapusa market. Assistant public prosecutor S Talawnekar represented the state and advocates M Nazareth and A Govekar represented the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-directs-bus-driver-to-pay-rs-5k-compensation-to-mapusa-cop/articleshow/87545273.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Sanvordem railway station gets pathway to connect platforms||MARGAO: Following complaints by local train commuters of hardships faced by them in crossing tracks to get to the newly constructed platform at Sanvordem railway station, the South Western Railway (SWR) has now constructed a pathway connecting the new platform to the main station building. Railway officials said that the pathway would ease commuters’ hardships to some extent until better solutions are worked out. TOI, in its edition dated October 22, had pointed out how, in the absence of a ramp for the foot overbridge at the railway station, commuters preferred to cross the tracks to using the foot overbridge, thereby risking their lives. Following the commissioning of the double track on this section, all up trains (travelling towards Hubbali) halt at platform no. 2, which has been newly constructed, while all down trains (travelling towards Vasco) halt at Platform no. 1. However, as there is no direct access to Platform no. 2, commuters having to board/alight from trains arriving on this platform, are required to take the foot overbridge. As there’s no ramp facility for the foot overbridge, persons with disabilities aren’t able to access the facility, with even senior citizens struggling to get across to the other end. TOI had also pointed out to the demand of the commuters to extend the canopy of platform no. 2..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanvordem-railway-station-gets-pathway-to-connect-platforms/articleshow/87545304.cms||---

Punjab DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota said police had arrested two persons for providing shelter and logistical support to the accused, identified as Ranjeet Singh alias Gora, in Jalalabad blast case, which is being investigated by NIA. Besides Gora, the two others arrested in the case have been identified as Jaswant Singh alias Shinda Baba, a resident of Jhugge Nihanga Wale village in Ferozepur, and Balwant Singh of Walipur Khurd village in Ludhiana, he said. ADGP (internal security) R N Dhoke said further investigation in the case is on and more arrests are expected to be made soon. Flagging the threat to security in view of the tiffin bomb seizure, former chief minister Amarinder Singh accused Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of being in “denial mode”. Amarinder tweeted: “Hope Punjab government, HM Punjab in particular, will come out of denial mode and take this threat seriously. With multiple consignments being sent regularly from across the border, extra vigil and a detailed action plan must be formed to combat the challenge.” Capt Amarinder has been raising the issue of national security in his interviews and even referred to it in his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi last week. Earlier on September 15, Amarinder, then chief minister, had ordered a high alert in the state following the arrest of four members of an ISI-backed terrorist module involved in a bid to blow up an oil tanker with an IED tiffin bomb. He had then said the objective behind the tiffin box bomb seizure by police, which was delivered allegedly through a drone was not known. It wasn’t focused on farmers’ protest but the frequency in which weapons were being delivered in the last 1.5 years, he had never seen, he had said. Tiffin bombs have also been seized in Amritsar Rural, Kapurthala, Fazilka and Tarn Taran in the past few months. The Punjab Police had earlier foiled a major terror attack attempt ahead of Independence Day after recovering a tiffin box filled with improvised explosive device along the Indo-Pak border in Amritsar. Police had then said that the bomb could have been delivered on the Indian side through a drone from Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-tiffin-bomb-seized-in-ferozepur-3-arrested/articleshow/87546649.cms||---
---||Goa||In Bicholim, a govt primary school takes on challenge of reviving culinary heritage||Keri: A government primary school at the Tillari rehabilitation colony in Sal, Bicholim, recently took it upon itself to revive some of Goa’s culinary traditions. At the school in Kholpewadi, Sal, a competition was organised to challenge local participants, including students’ parents to prepare food items using local varieties of parboiled rice and millet. “We asked them to prepare food items only from parboiled rice and millet like Pakhad, Nachane and Vari. This is because these are good sources of highly digestible protein, are low in calories, are rich in fibre and also are a good source of iron and possess other nutritional value,” said school headmaster Dhaktu Patil. Making use of different food grains available in Goa, local communities have enriched the Goan cuisine over the years. The state’s culinary heritage offers calories and nutritional value in equal measure for the smooth functioning of the body in the local environment, said a teacher of the government primary school, Sanket Naik. However, in the era of fast foods, preference for traditional food items is fading, he added. “Our people living in tune with nature used to follow an eco-friendly lifestyle and prepared a variety of food items by making judicious use of rice and millet grown in their vicinity,” said Naik. At the end of the competition, the participants displayed 18 food items including ladoos, yellape, godachi bhakar, patalyo, idli, ambil, pole, upit, kapa, conne and cake prepared from the parboiled rice and millet. “We have completely forgotten a wide variety of food grains like Pakhad. Once our forefathers made delicious and nutritious recipes using these grains. The ambil made from finger millet used for breakfast, for instance, provides energy for manual work in agricultural fields,” said Rutuja Gawas. Harshada Manerikar, a parent, said that the competition helped reintroduce locals to lost nutritionally-rich traditional food. “In the past during a fast we used to relish upit prepared from little millet called Vari, which is highly nutritious and an excellent source of dietary fibre. Seeds of most of the millet are processed and then used for preparation of different types of porridge and other delicacies which are consumed during a fast,” said Manerikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-bicholim-a-govt-primary-school-takes-on-challenge-of-reviving-culinary-heritage/articleshow/87545312.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

According to tribal custom, the boy's family had agreed to give the girl's family Rs 1.5 lakh but negotiations got stuck on 1kg of family silver the girl had allegedly taken with her when she eloped. Two persons from each family are dead. The incident took place on Thursday night in Bokadia Gorad Faliya village in the tribal-dominated district, around 200km from Indore. The boy and girl - Madhav and Leela - belong to the same community and had eloped around one and a half years ago, SP Manoj Kumar Singh told TOI, adding that neither family filed a police complaint, and instead took it to the village panchayat. "The panchayat, going by tradition, decided that the boy's family should give Rs 1.5 lakh to the girl's family, but the matter got stuck over silver jewellery that Leela had taken with her," said SP Singh. "The girl's mother was asking for it and had requested to be allowed to meet Leela, but the dispute couldn't be settled despite multiple meetings. During another round of negotiations on Thursday, the families attacked each other with sticks and faliya (a sharp-edged weapon used by tribals)," said the SP. Four men died on the spot. Two arrested with fake notes linked to hawala racket: Cops Police have suspected that the Vadodara persons arrested with Rs 24 lakh fake notes are associated with Hawala racket. Police have seized equipment to make fake notes from their residence. Khargone Superintendent of Police Siddharth Choudhary told in a press conference on Wednesday that there is evidence that arrested Mohammad Salim resident of JP Road Vadodara and his tenant Azhar are associated with Hawala racket. Earlier, Salim had misled that a person based in Ahmedabad had provided the said note, which has not yet been confirmed. On being questioned after taking his police remand, Salim has admitted to going to provide the said amount to a person based in Indore. He has also supplied counterfeit notes in Mumbai in the past. His contacts have also been traced in Delhi and Jaipur too, said SP.  He said that on a search of his house in Vadodara, color printers, cutter machines, paper and some half printed notes used for making fake notes were also recovered.  Nimar Range Deputy Inspector General of Police Tilak Singh told that Mohammad Salim used to work somewhere in Saudi Arabia in the past. A few years back, he came to India and started the business of sewing and apparel. The duo were arrested on October 31 and produced before the court on the next day from where two days of police remand was granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/four-killed-in-clash-between-families-over-elopement-in-mp/articleshow/87546659.cms||---

---||Kolkata||‘I don’t take politics that seriously’||Junior Sheriff was Subrata Mukherjee’s name for me, and all these years later, as one remembers him as state cabinet minister, trade union leader, mayor of Kolkata and a politician from the Naxalite era, what burns brightly is his humour, his mischievous grin. My father being the city’s Sheriff and with whom he only talked about, of all things, archaeology, which he apparently studied at university, I was inevitably Junior Sheriff, but Mukherjee, who passed away last night, had spectacular names for his senior colleagues. Siddhartha Shankar Ray, once the state’s chief minister and then, Governor of Punjab during a difficult time, was “Feudal Lord” because of his burra sahib attitudes. Pranab Mukherjee, later President of India, then working on world trade issues he violently opposed as anti-worker, was “Dunkel Uncle”. About the mercurial ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury, former Union cabinet minister and leader of the rival faction in the state Congress, he had a story. “You know, what Barkatda has said about Bhola Sen (a senior Congressman) in a public meeting? That Bholada does no party work and all he does is sleep! In a meeting, before hundreds of Congress workers!” In the last days of the Naxalite era in Kolkata, the late 60s and early 70s, came to the forefront two young men, both wonderful speakers, Priyaranjan Dasmunsi, later Union cabinet minister, and Mukherjee. He had a story about his oldest friend, Dasmunsi, who had a reputation of pulling fast ones. “Once, I needed a lot of money for party work. I called Priyada and asked him. He said he was busy but could I come to the railway station in the evening? The money would be ready.” He laughed and said: “I thought about it for a moment and that evening I went to the airport. And there he was, waiting for the next flight! He looked quite sheepish, but had a million explanations.” So, did he get the money? “Yes,” he acknowledged, “a bit, but later”. All through the 80s and early 90s, the CPM would get huge majorities in the 294-seat West Bengal legislative assembly, and its allies some more, leaving the Congress with 40-50 seats. The Congress would continually yell about “scientific rigging”, and Mukherjee, who was often called a “tormuj” or watermelon — Congress green on the outside and CPM red inside — meaning he was a closet Left sympathiser, once said with some exasperation: “I am going to ask Jyoti babu (chief minister Basu) before the next assembly polls, how many seats he wants to give us. If he says 40, we’ll fight 40!” He had many journalist friends, and he wasn’t short of a memorable quip. “I don’t see him these days,” he said one afternoon at the Congress office. Hearing that the reporter had just become a father, he asked, a little puzzled. “I went to his wedding. It wasn’t that long ago.” Yes, he was told, the baby was born exactly nine months after the wedding. Then we saw the truly expressive Mukherjee, eyebrows raised, shaking his head, “Oh, oh, really. Then it’s a one-day match. Six balls and seven runs!” The state information minister in 1972, Mukherjee spent decades in the opposition fighting the Left juggernaut and failing. The Congress just didn’t have strength for three decades and it was Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress that unseated the Left in 2011. He was a rumbustious opposition leader, particularly in his youth, often on the streets, loudly and sometimes, violently fighting the government. During one protest rally, he lost his temper. “There was this police officer in the way. I slapped him just once and you should have seen how he bled. I have never seen so much blood. His uniform was wet, thoroughly bloodstained. I hadn’t even hit him that hard. I later heard he had gum disease, pyorrhea.” As he would sometimes say, “I don’t take politics that seriously.” (Srinjoy Chowdhury is the National Affairs Editor, Times Now.)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/i-dont-take-politics-that-seriously/articleshow/87545328.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Party lines blur in final farewell to Subrata Mukherjee||KOLKATA: Politicians across all shades and people from all walks of life poured in at places to pay tribute to veteran politician Subrata Mukherjee on his last journey on Friday. They included BJP leader Dilip Ghosh, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and Congress senior Pradip Bhattacharya, among others. Former Trinamool MP and Mukherjee’s personal friend Moon Moon Sen and footballer Subrata Bhattacharya went to Rabindra Sadan to pay respect to the departed leader. West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar came down from Raj Bhavan to bid farewell to this senior lawmaker at the West Bengal Assembly. Trinamool national secretary Abhishek Banerjee was present at Keoratala crematorium. Subrata Mukherjee was cremated with full state honours on Friday evening. The veteran politician was given the gun salute at Keoratala crematorium For chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Mukherjee’s demise on Diwali night was like a “pall of gloom in the festival of lights.” Mamata couldn’t prepare her to be part of the farewell journey of her political mentor. Mukherjee was like a guardian to most Trinamool seniors. “He was to us the Uttam Kumar of politics. He taught me many things on parliamentary procedures when I joined as an MLA in 2009,” said state transport minister Firhad Hakim. Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee joined Chhatra Parishad when Mukherjee was at the helm. “I didn’t join Chhatra Parishad weighing ideological nitty-gritties. I was deeply influenced by Subratada,” said Chatterjee, also the state parliamentary affairs minister. Education minister Bratya Basu recollected Mukherjee’s wit in the West Bengal Assembly sessions. Ghosh said Mukherjee was a guardian to all lawmakers. “I had the opportunity of coming in close touch with him for five years when I became an MLA. We used to interact often. His demise has left a void in Bengal politics,” he said. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari remembered how Mukherjee as protem Speaker extended the oath-taking by 15 minutes to make him take the oath as an MLA. “The slot fixed for me was 3 pm. But I got caught up in the high court and was getting delayed. Mukherjee told me over phone that he was extending the oath-taking slot by another 15 minutes. He could rise above petty politics. His demise came all of a sudden,” Adhikari said. Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury called Mukherjee a “political star”. “It was a generation in opposition politics. Priyaranjan Dasmunsi, Subrata and Somen Mitra were the three musketeers of opposition politics. Mukherjee was the last member of that brand of politics, different from these days,” Chowdhury said. Mukherjee was also a mentor to former leader of opposition Abdul Mannan. Left Front chairman Biman Basu said: “Subrata Mukherjee belonged to the Congress and later joined Trinamool. But he used to keep in touch with all parties.” Former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya held that Mukherjee ran the Kolkata Municipal Corporation “honestly”. Mishra said the Left Front government after assuming office in 1977 implemented the panchayati raj law drafted by Mukherjee. Footballer Bhattacharya remembered Mukherjee’s long association with the Mohun Bagan Club. “How can I forget that he got me signed for the club?” he said. But Mukherjee’s outreach was beyond the who’s who of Bengal. He was a loving brother to his three sisters who gave him ‘bhai phonta’. “He was supposed to reach home today. We knew that we couldn't make food for him this year. He wanted to have narus. But it is all over now,” said Mukherjee’s sister Bulbul Chatterjee. Had multiple and critical blocks, say doctors:SSKM Hospital medical board members attending to Mukherjee said he had an ischemic heart with multiple critical blocks in his coronary arteries since 2014 and he suffered a cardiac arrest this time. “It is not stent thrombosis. He died of a sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmia that can happen even after angioplasty or bypass surgery,” a doctor clarified. Doctors had alerted the minister and his colleagues about the imminent danger when he went for a check-up at SSKM Hospital after the May assembly poll. “He was a workaholic and could not make time for undergoing the angioplasty that doctors advised him in 2014,” a medical team member said. Mukherjee was also suffering from hypertension, diabetes, chest and kidney ailments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/party-lines-blur-in-final-farewell-to-subrata/articleshow/87545276.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Broadcasters in Kolkata approach SC, seek hike in channel rates||KOLKATA: Television channel broadcasters have moved the Supreme Court against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s decision to cap channel price in bouquets at Rs 12 from December 1. The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Federation (IBDF) — a broadcasters’ body — has placed before the apex court a proposal that involves moving most of their popular channels out of packages and offering them individually at a price that is 30%-50% higher than the existing rates. A verdict is expected later this month. If the IBDF’s proposal is accepted, monthly cable TV subscription price could rise by around 50% over 2019 from next month. Some of the major broadcasters, including Star & Disney India, Sony Pictures Networks India, Zee Entertainment and Viacom 18, have come up with new price lists keeping their flagship channels out of bouquets and pricing them between Rs 15-30. Local cable operators fear such a hike will deal a crippling blow to the cable TV industry. “Two years ago, channel prices went up by around 40% and it led to a dip in subscription in Kolkata. This time, another 25%-30% hike has been proposed which, in effect, will lead to a 50%-60% rise in subscription charges since 2019,” said Tapash Das, joint convenor of All Bengal Cable TV and Broadband Operators’ United Forum. Kolkata has around 30 lakh cable TV homes.1 Two years ago, a ceiling of Rs 19 had been set for individual channels within bouquets. “Unfortunately, it was not mentioned if the price could be hiked if a channel was offered individually,” said Mrinal Chatterjee of Bengal Broadband. He added that a sharp hike would now lead many subscribers to shift to OTT platforms. As per the IBDF proposal, major sports, entertainment, infotainment and movie channels will now be priced between Rs 15-30. While all broadcasters are yet to announce new prices, some like Sony have proposed a price of Rs 30 for entertainment channel SET (HD), Rs 28 for SAB (HD) and Rs 25 each for sports channels TEN 1 and TEN 2. “So far, the highest price of premier channels like Star Movies, Zee TV, Star Plus, SET Max, sports channels of Star and Sony was Rs 19 and these were all available in bouquets. Now, not only will consumers have to pay a higher price for these on a la carte basis, they will have to subscribe to bouquets as well if they want a fair mix of everything. As a result, the monthly subscription will go up by at least 50%,” said Das. An average Kolkata subscriber now pays between Rs 350-400 a month, mostly for channels in packages. “Very few subscribe to channels individually. The average number of channels subscribed by consumers had gone down after the price hike two years ago. It was a sharp hike and many unsubscribed the expensive pay channels. A large section opted out of movie and sports channels. Some have since been subscribing to sports channels temporarily when a big sporting event is on,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/broadcasters-approach-sc-seek-hike-in-channel-rates/articleshow/87545626.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Researchers say this could be due to lifestyle factors and delayed diagnosis rather than a direct effect of the virus. Findings of the study, published recently in ‘Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews’, show more than 50% of patients diagnosed with diabetes after Covid outbreak reported high stress level, whereas less than 13% had high stress level in pre-Covid times. “There is the possibility of an increase in various lifestyle-related diseases, including new-onset diabetes during this pandemic period. The adverse lifestyle changes occurring as a result of lockdown might also lead to acceleration of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes in many individuals,” says the study, conducted by researchers from the National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation, Diabetes Foundation (India), Fortis CDoc and Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre. The study analysed data of all adults diagnosed with new onset of Type two diabetes from two tertiary care hospitals for diabetes in Chennai and Delhi between April and October 2020, when the country was mostly under lockdown. Doctors suggest maintaining a healthy lifestyle, particularly exercises, and a controlled diet can help avoid such disorders. The study also points out at changes in dietary and exercise profiles during the pandemic as a likely reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/diabetics-diagnosed-during-covid-had-severe-conditions/articleshow/87546652.cms||Sushmi Dey

Police said the couple was beaten to death with a heavy object but neighbours in the six-storey building and people bursting crackers didn't hear anything as the ambient noise probably masked noise from the house. Gzb murders: Cops say reason not known yet  Ashok Zaidka (75) and his wife Madhu (73) stayed on the ground floor of the building at Patel Nagar in the Sihani Gate area. Ashok was in the pharmaceuticals business before taking retirement. According to the police, he had been paralysed for about 20 years. The couple have two daughters and they stay in Noida and Pune with their respective families. The murders were discovered after their daughter Shruti called from Noida to wish them for Diwali. The calls were not answered for about two hours. Around midnight, Shruti finally called up Satyaprakash, a local washerman, and asked him to check on the couple, police said. Satyaprakash (Papu) told TOI that around 11.55pm on Thursday, Shruti called him and said she had not been able to contact her parents since 10pm. "She asked me to share some of their neighbours' mobile numbers. But I don't have any number saved on my phone. I got my handset repaired recently and lost all contacts. So I told her I will go and check myself," he said. Satyaprakash reached the house a few minutes later. He said he first rang the bell at the building's main entrance, but no one answered it. "Then I opened the main iron gate and went inside the building. I was about to knock on their house's door but I found it had not been locked properly. I pushed it open and saw the elderly woman lying on the floor. I informed Shruti and the police," he said. SSP Pawan Kumar said the attackers did not take anything from the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/assailants-beat-elderly-couple-to-death-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/87546698.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

An AQI (air quality index) of 465 was recorded at the Sector 25 monitoring station and 409 at the one in Sector 22 on Thursday night. The air quality was satisfactory (AQI below 100) at all the stations during the day, according to Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee officials . After 6pm, it started to worsen. By 10pm, it was in the severe category at Sector 22 and at 11 pm in Sector 25. But there was a silver lining. The 24-hour average AQI was 115 as compared to last year’s 140 (Sector 25 station data) on Diwali day. This, officials explained, was because Diwali in 2020 fell on November 14, when weather and other factors played a role in polluting the air too. Track the pollution level in your cityOut of the five stations, AQI (24-hourly average) was in moderate category in three (sectors 17, 22 and 25) and poor in two (sectors 12 and 39). “It is matter of relief that because of weather conditions AQI again improved to satisfactory after 2am,” officials said. But noise levels too shot up on Diwali. Highest levels of 78.2 dB(A) were found in Sector 39 and lowest of 58.4 dB(A) in Sector 17.

While the sarpanch’s younger son died before he could be wheeled into a hospital, the other succumbed to injuries during treatment. The four, who suffered bullet wounds, are still in hospital. Around 7.40pm on Thursday, Gopal (in his early fifties), the former sarpanch of Kasan village in Manesar, was offering prayers with his family and relatives who had come over to celebrate Diwali when the assailants raided the house. “They started firing indiscriminately. It continued for almost 15 minutes,” said Rajesh, Gopal’s brother-in-law, from his hospital bed. Police said Gopal’s younger son, Vikas (21), had seven bullets pumped into him and succumbed to the injuries on the spot. His elder brother, Sohanpal (35), died in the hospital. Apart from Rajesh, the others who were injured were Gopal’s brother Balram, Parveen, his cousin, Yash, Balram’s eight-year-old son, and Chauhan, a relative. They are undergoing treatment at a Sector 38 hospital. The attack, police said, is the fallout of an old enmity between two families in Kasan village following a murder that dates back to 2007. Balram and Sohanpal had killed one Manoj, a villager, and were handed the life term in connection with the murder. They had come out on bail a few years ago. According to the police, members of Manoj’s family were since looking for an opportunity to avenge his death. Rajesh, who lodged the police complaint, has named Yogender alias Rinku of Kasan village, Deepak from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, Manish Rana of Bhiwani and Amit of Sonipat, among a few others. Following the complaint, a case has been registered against them under sections 302 (murder), 148 (rooting with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder) and 452 (house trespass) of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Arms Act at IMT Manesar police station. No arrest had been made till Friday evening. Yashwant Yadav, station house officer of IMT Manesar police station, confirmed that both the families had been involved in a bitter battle since 2007. “Balram and Sohanpal had come out on bail. The members of the other family were holding a grudge against the former sarpanch and his relatives. They hatched a plan to kill everyone in the family on the night of Diwali,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/shooters-storm-ex-sarpanchs-house-kill-2-sons/articleshow/87545774.cms||Bagish Jha

Perhaps, this is the first time in recent times that a chief minister of AP is meeting Odisha chief minister to resolve long-pending issues, including the dispute over a group of 21 villages. The much-delayed meeting has raised hopes of the people of north coastal Andhra Pradesh as they would get two major irrigation projects benefiting Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, besides the Polavaram project. The proposed meeting between the two chief ministers is set to be a historical one as it is expected to resolve decades long disputes over the inter-state river projects. The two states have been fighting over Vamsadhara and Janjhavati river projects, besides the Polavaram project. Though the projects on Vamsadhara and Janjhavati would benefit both the states, Odisha raised the issues of compensation to the land parcels affected in its territory. CM's visit may resolve pending river projectsThe Neradi barrage on Vamsadhara has finally secured clearance in June this year with the river tribunal clearing the dispute in favour of Andhra Pradesh. The two states have to share the cost of the project as per the irrigated land under the two canals, which is expected to be finalised during the deliberations between the two chief ministers. Similarly, the project on Janjhavati river is pending since 1978. The project, if completed would provide irrigation water to 24,640 acres of land in Vizianagaram district. The chief minister's visit to Bhubaneswar is expected to resolve this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-cm-ys-jagan-mohan-reddy-to-hold-talks-with-naveen-patnaik-on-november-9/articleshow/87546778.cms||Gopi Dara

The accident happened when the trio, in their bid to get a bigger bang from their mix of crackers, buried them, placed stones and then lit the fire. The massive explosion sent stone splinters flying, injuring one and killing two who were hit on the skull. The loud bang led to panic in the area for a short while. The two who died, Jagannath Malik (25) and Vishnupadha Mahato (25), were from West Bengal, while injured Virender Kumar is from Uttar Pradesh. All the three are idol makers. The incident happened around 11pm at their idol-making unit. "The men had made a small pit and buried some joint crackers along with other explosives. The stones on top exploded along with the crackers. Jagannath and Vishnupadha were killed instantly as the splinters fractured their skull," Chatrinaka inspector Syed Abdul Khader Jilani told TOI. There were a few more people at this unit, but they were sitting some distance away and were unhurt, cops said. A CLUES team was called in to check the explosives and find out if the men had added any extra chemical used in making idols to their crackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-two-idol-makers-killed-1-hurt-as-crackers-blow-up-in-face/articleshow/87546885.cms||---

Police said V Kalainesan, a worker in a private firm used to buy country fireworks in bulk quantities from Ariyankuppam during Diwali and used to sell them in retail to shops in Puducherry town and neighbouring Tamil Nadu's Villupuram district. Ariyankuppam, a coastal hamlet in Puducherry, is known for manufacturing high decibel and cheap fireworks.  Kalainesan along with his son K Pradeesh went to his in-law's house in Koonimedu in Villupuram district on a scooter carrying country fireworks in two bags. He was returning to Puducherry with his son after leaving behind a bag of fireworks at his in-law's house and carrying the other bag on his scooter. When he reached Kottakuppam, the fireworks in the bag exploded killing the father-son duo. The explosion was so intense that their body parts were scattered a few metres away from the explosion site.  Two motorists and a pedestrian sustained burn injuries and were taken to the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) in Puducherry. Villupuram DIG M Pandian and Villupuram superintendent of police N Shreenatha visited the explosion site and made preliminary inquiries. A team of forensic experts combed the explosion site and took samples of the remains of the fireworks.  Puducherry assistant divisional fire officer R Rithosh Chandra said the department has not received any analysis on the explosion from any agency so far. "After seeing the video widely shared in social media it seems to be a spontaneous explosion due to pressure exerted on the tightly packed fireworks. It may not be due to heat as the day was not hot and there seems to be less possibility for friction to trigger the explosion. Fireworks are not supposed to be transported in a motorcycle. Transporting fireworks that are not packed properly is dangerous," said Chandra.  Kottakuppam police registered a case against Kalainesan under several sections of the Explosive Substances Act and began investigations.

This would mean that the mop-up will be higher than the record collections of Rs 1.4 lakh crore in April before it slipped to Rs 92,900 crore in June on account of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Collections in October (for sales in September) were pegged at Rs 1.3 lakh crore, the second highest monthly mop-up. “Spending has gone up and the collections for October and November are expected to stay strong, if not better than the numbers we just saw,” said a government source. Officials in the indirect tax wing said that it is time for the government to now initiate the next set of measures to bolster collections, suggesting that the current mechanism has nearly reached full capacity. A group of ministers has already been set up to look at rationalisation of rates, among other things, and officials suggested that some drastic measures, including an increase in rates for some of the items in the 5% bracket was required, if not move the first slab upwards to 6-7%. Besides, they said, there were a whole set of items in the exempted category, which needed to be reviewed as there were several instances where the sellers were misusing the exemptions. Further, officials suggested that it was time for the finance ministers at the Centre and the state level to look at merging the 12% and 18% slabs and may settle for 16-17% as the standard rate. A couple of years ago, the RBI had estimated the weighted average GST rate at 11.6%, against the estimated revenue-neutral rate of 15-15.5%. In the past, state finance ministers have avoided discussing the revamp plan and it is unlikely that any decision will be taken until crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, among other states, are over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-looks-at-rs-1-5l-cr-gst-mop-up-in-coming-months/articleshow/87546804.cms||Sidhartha

A dark store is a store operated by an e-commerce company to fulfill online orders. This is the IPO-bound company’s second attempt at the highly competitive quick commerce business, which is currently dominated by the likes of tech startups such as Dunzo and Swiggy and has witnessed new entrants such as traditional supermarket chain —Big Bazaar. The quick commerce market, where delivery takes less than an hour, is currently pegged at $0.3 billion and is estimated to reach $5 billion in four years, showed data from market research company Redseer. While Ola and its rival Uber unsuccessfully tried to launch similar services five to six years ago, sources close to the development said, Ola’s fresh look at the business will not be limited to groceries alone. “Home care, personal care, pet care, veggies and milk are some of the categories that will be included in the services,” said a source. Ola’s move comes at a time when the domestic cabhailing market is struggling to recover from the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the online grocery space, too, large companies such as Flipkart, Reliance and Amazon have upped the ante, while Tata-owned Big Basket has recently opened its first physical store in Bengaluru. Softbank-backed Ola, in the meanwhile, has diversified into new areas such as manufacturing electric scooters and selling pre-owned cars, a segment that boasts of other new-age players including Cars24 and Droom. Ola’s revenue plunged 65% to Rs 690 crore in FY21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ola-starts-grocery-delivery-service-through-dark-stores/articleshow/87546952.cms||John Sarkar

Instead, they can allow an accompanying person who has not had alcohol, to drive the vehicle. This was stated by Justice K Lakshman of the Telangana high court in his order after hearing a batch of petitions filed by vehicle owners, who challenged the seizures and the prolonged wait to get them back. "If there is no one accompanying the drunk driver, then the police should inform a relative or friends of the intoxicated man to take custody of the vehicle," the order read. The judge added that if no one comes forward to take the vehicle, only then can the police keep the vehicle at the nearest police station or some other safe custody and should release it either to the owner or any authorized person.

While three districts - Mayiladuthurai, Perambalur and Ramanathapuram -- reported no new cases, 28 reported no new deaths and 96% of Covid wards in the state continued to remain empty. At the end of the day, after recording 13 deaths, discharging 1,012 patients, the state had 10,745 people on the active list. After the crowding at shops and malls for Diwali shopping, interstate and intrastate travels, housefull theatres and family gatherings -- though the weekly average positivity rate (percentage number of people tested positive over total number of people tested) was below 1% -- public health experts warn that lack of masking and social distancing and inadequate vaccination could push cases up once again. The statistics with the public health directorate shows that about 10 districts in the state had a positivity rate that was more than 1%. Tiruppur topped the list with 1.5% of the people tested being positive, followed by Chengalpet (1.4%), Namakkal (1.3%), Salem (1.3%) and Coimbatore (1.3%). While the positivity rate was hovering around 1% in Trichy and 0.6% in Chennai, it was 0.4% in Madurai. On Friday just four districts reported a marginal increase in cases compared to their Thursday tally. The sharpest increase was reported by Virudhunagar where the cases went up to nine on Friday from four on Thursday. During the same period, Thirupathur, Tenkasi and Ariyalur also reported an increase. All other 34 districts reported a fall in cases. "With new cases vaccinations have also come down," said health minister Ma Subramanian. On Friday, after inspecting construction work at the cancer hospital in Kancheepuram, he said, the health department had decided to postpone the mega vaccination camp scheduled for Saturday to November 14. "Several health workers wanted to spend the weekend with their families also because there is likely to be fewer people in the clinics during the festive weekend. We also hear there could be heavy rains in several districts," he said. Over the last few weeks, the average daily vaccinations have dipped drastically. While just 2,213 people took the vaccine on Diwali day, 33,733 took the vaccine on Friday. The average daily vaccination in the state has dropped to less than a lakh in November. In September, the state had an average of 4.8 lakh vaccinations a day, which dropped to 3.6 lakh in October. To encourage more people, the state has been offering door-to-door vaccinations, Subramaniam said. Over the weekend, health officials will visit houses in Besant Nagar and surrounding areas for door-to-door vaccinations. "We still have 1.6 crore people who have not taken the first dose of the vaccine. The gap is wider among senior citizens where only 48% of them have taken the first dose," said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. To make matters worse, many people move around without masks and do not follow social distancing norms. Organisations such as the WHO have warned that only Covid appropriate behaviour will determine what lies ahead in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/tamil-nadu-covid-19-cases-dip-vaccinations-low-too/articleshow/87550529.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Kozhikode boy shortlisted for International Children’s Peace Prize||KOZHIKODE: Muhammad Aasim, a 15-year-old disabled boy who had been waging a battle to get his village school at Velimanna upgraded to a high school, has been shortlisted as one of the three finalists for this year’s International Children's Peace Prize awarded by Kids-Rights Foundation, an international children's right organisation based in Amsterdam. The other two finalists are teen brothers from Delhi Vihaan and Nav Agarwal who had been working towards tackling the waste menace in the national capital through their NGO One Step Greener and Christina Adane, an 18-year-old girl born in the Netherlands and now living in the UK, who had led a campaign for free school meal provision to be extended through the holidays. The finalists were announced by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is a patron of the prize. In his message, Tutu said the finalists show, through their values and determination, just what children can achieve in campaigning to improve the rights of others worldwide. The International Children’s Peace Prize is annually awarded to a child who has made a special effort to promote children’s rights and better the situation of vulnerable children. The three finalists were selected from 169 nominations received from 39 countries. Aasim was born without both handsNobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi will award the prize to this year’s winner on November 13 during a hybrid ceremony to be held at The Hague. Aasim, who was born without both hands and has 90% disability, has been spearheading the campaign to upgrade the Government Mappila UP School at Velimanna to a high school. Acting on a letter written by Aasim, then chief minister Oommen Chandy had issued an order to upgrade his school to a UP school in 2014. But after he reached seventh standard in 2018, wheelchairbound Aasim took up the fight to upgrade the school, which is just 250 metres away from his house, to a high school as it was difficult for him to travel to faraway schools. After his repeated pleas and even protests failed to evoke a positive response, Aasim filed a petition in the Kerala high court which directed the education department to upgrade the UP school to a high school. But the state government challenged the order and now his petition is before the consideration of the Supreme Court. “Aasim has been continuing his studies privately at home for the last two years and has not enrolled in any other school. He hopes that his fight to uphold the basic right of education will succeed and will help and inspire all other children,” his father Mohammed Saeed said. Aasim, who writes with his leg, is a recipient of the Ujjwala Balyam award initiated by the state women and child development department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kozhikode-boy-shortlisted-for-international-childrens-peace-prize/articleshow/87546996.cms||---

The deceased, identified as Goldy of Goripur village, Vishal of Nalvi village, Gurmeet of Jainpur village, Ankit and his cousin Brijpal of Basantpur village, all of Kurukshetra district, were in their early 20s. Shahabad SHO inspector Prem Singh said, “The five were travelling in a car which rammed an eucalyptus tree after losing control on Shahabad-Nalvi road near Nalvi village in the night. Other commuters could not notice the accident as the car fell into a 10-foot deep ditch along the road. We received the information at the police station on 112 helpline about 6.30am on Friday and reached the spot immediately.” The SHO said as it was Diwali eve, the road was empty after about 9pm and it appears that nobody saw the accident taking place and the injured persons could not be rescued in time due to which they died of their injuries. “All five were found dead in the morning and their car was completely damaged and their bodies were taken out with the help of a crane,” the SHO added. The bodies were sent for the postmortem at LNJP civil hospital in Kurukshetra and later handed over to family members. Police have not received any complaint in this matter and the proceedings have been conducted under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/5-killed-as-car-rams-tree-in-kurukshetra/articleshow/87545359.cms||---

She was rushed to the government hospital where a bullet was surgically removed from her hand. Later, the injured woman, Punam of Vikas Nagar in Hansi, was admitted to a private hospital in Agroha. The alleged attacker, Deepak, had arrived with his brother on a motorcycle. Hansi city police have registered a case on the complaint of Punam against Deepak and his brother Praveen, both residents of Narnaund, under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and SC/ST Act. In her complaint, Punam said during their friendship days, Deepak used to abuse her mentally. When she stopped meeting him, Deepak started threatening to kill her and her children over the phone and now wanted to forcefully take her to his home, she alleged. When she refused to go with him, he opened fire and sped away on the motorcycle, she claimed. After the incident, her husband and others rushed to the spot and got her admitted to the general hospital for treatment, where doctors referred her to Agroha Medical College.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Doctors give fake life certificates, face misconduct charges||CHENNAI:Two doctors, including a government lady doctor, are facing medical council proceedings for misconduct, as they had issued 'life certificates' to dead persons. A government doctor in Royapettah government hospital in the grade of civil assistant surgeon, who issued life certificate to a dead man, who killed himself by suicide, was summoned by the Tamil Nadu Medical Council, an apex body regulating medical practice in the state. Dr R Shanthini issued the medical certificate on January 10, 2018 to R Krishnakumar, three years after the man ended his life in July 2015. Two days later his life certificates were used to sell properties in his name. In November 2019, Krishnakumar's wife lodged a complaint with the council stating the "fake" certificate by the doctor aided her relatives to illegally sell properties without consultations with the legal heir. In another, complaint dated December 19, 2020, Bangalore-based R Vinod Kumar said that Hosur based Dr KP Badri Prasad conspired with one M Narasimhan to issue false life certificates for two women - Sabitha J and Shylaja Jayasurya - about a year after Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike(BBMP) issued their death certificates. While Sabitha had died on October 16, 2019, her mother Shylaja died on July 18, 2020. Yet, on September 7, 2020, Hosur-based Dr K P Badri Prasad issued them "life certificates for the purpose of registration of documents based on power of attorney". On December 19, 2020, Vinodh Kumar filed a complaint against Dr Badri Prasad. On January 19 the council sent him a memorandum seeking explanations for the complaint. "These complaints come under misconduct and are gross violations of TN Medical Council code of ethics (professional etiquette and ethics)," said Tamil Nadu Medical Council president Dr K Senthil. The following month, Dr Badri Prasad wrote to council stating that he was conned by one Narasimhan who brought two "similar looking" women to his clinic and that he could not see them clearly as they were seated 6 feet away due to the pandemic. Dr Prasad said his face shield and the plastic curtain between them made it difficult for him to see their face clearly. He also urged the council to verify the authenticity of the BBMP certificates. The certificate is also available on the BBMP webpage. While the state council called for disciplinary proceedings against the two doctors, the council is also planning to organise awareness programmes for doctors and members of the public on legal provisions. Over the last two years, the council has been receiving complaints against doctors issuing fake certificates for death and life, he said. "We want our doctors to know that such things can land them in trouble. They may not only lose their licenses, but may also have criminal charges framed against them," Dr Senthil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-doctors-give-fake-life-certificates-face-misconduct-charges/articleshow/87547023.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Gurgaon||Crackers get past ban, put up a show in Gurgaon||Gurgaon: The total ban notwithstanding, firecrackers were an integral part of the city’s Diwali celebrations on Thursday evening. The light and sound show, which in some parts of the city continued till the early hours of Friday, made it evident that the ban had not been able to prevent crackers from reaching consumers even though no licences for sale were issued this time. While some residents argued that banning crackers altogether was not possible because they were a part of the festival, others said lax enforcement and disregard for pollution levels that were already very high on Diwali night had led to further deterioration of air quality on Friday morning when thick smog enveloped the city. Parimal Bardhan, a resident of DLF 1, said, “I called police twice, but they remained indifferent. I even reached out through the emergency number, 112. My calls went unanswered for hours and when I finally connected with someone, a PCR van was sent to patrol the area but the bursting of crackers continued." Ruchika Sethi Takkar, a resident of Deerwood Chase in Sector 50, said some residents in her society and some residents of neighbouring societies and Tigra village disregarded the ban on firecrackers. “From 7pm onwards, I appealed to people to not burst firecrackers because air pollution could affect children and elderly people with asthma. I also called the police thrice but crackers were burst till 10.30pm (on Thursday). Even on Friday, it’s still on in one of the nearby areas,” Takkar said. A resident of Golf Course Road said, “I was awake till early Friday morning since the bursting of crackers continued till 3am on Friday. It’s been a week since I have stopped going for morning walks due to increasing pollution in the city. I am an asthma patient my coughing and wheezing have worsened.” Officials claimed fewer firecrackers were burst this Diwali compared to previous years. “Due to strict enforcement and more awareness among people, we have seen some positive change. If there are any shortcomings, we will learn from our experience and try to do better. We will surely increase our vigilance and create more awareness among people about the harmful effects of bursting crackers,” said deputy commissioner Yash Garg. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, "We prioritised the health of residents and took a proactive decision to impose a complete ban on firecrackers. But we also need to understand that people could not celebrate Diwali last year due to the Covid-19 situation,” he said, adding coordination between law enforcement and other departments helped improve the situation. Responding to allegations that the cops didn’t answer calls, police commissioner KK Rao said, “We directed all police stations to form teams to keep a check on the bursting of crackers and enforce the rules strictly. Whenever we received calls, a team was dispatched from the respective police station. However, by the time we reached the spot, the calls were found to be hoax or people had moved away from the location. We can only take action against the people who are on the spot." He said PCR vans and police riders ensured frequent patrolling in the city. A few FIRs were registered against violators for bursting crackers and illegal sale of crackers, Rao added. According to the fire department, a fire broke out on the fifth floor of a house in Sector 49 but it was quickly doused by a fire tender that was rushed to the spot. A few clothes in the house were burnt but there was no major loss. Some heaps of waste also caught fire due to cracker bursting. The fire department received only around four other calls, down from 28 incidents reported last year. “The celebration was relatively peaceful without any major fire incidents. Our teams were on alert and identified vulnerable points. Additionally, we have been conducting drills and awareness drives among people,” said Gulshan Kalra, assistant divisional fire officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/crackers-get-past-ban-put-up-a-show-in-gurgaon/articleshow/87545770.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Kochi||Condition of many roads, bylanes in Kochi pathetic||KOCHI: The condition of roads in Kochi is getting worse with more potholes being developed and tiles getting dislocated with the passing of each vehicle on the respective stretches. Besides the arterial roads, Chittoor road, Kaloor-Kathrikadavu and Thammanam-Pullepady are the main roads which wait for salvation from its pathetic condition. The order for handing over the Thammanam-Pullepady Road from the custody of Kochi corporation to the public works department (PWD) has not reached the hands of officials concerned. “We have informed the corporation mayor that PWD will take over the road only after the local body fills the potholes. It will take up to six months to start road works after it is handed over. PWD will have to face the wrath of the public until then. Why should we endure it?” asked a PWD official. Motorists are at the receiving end of the ordeal and they complain that problems arise in shock absorbers in their vehicles due to the bad condition of roads. “The authorities did patchwork on the gaping potholes near Mymoon theatre on Chittoor Road, before the local body election. They filled the potholes again a month ago, but the condition of the road is still worse,” says Mahesh, who runs a ‘Thattukada’ near the area. It is the auto drivers, online delivery boys and bus drivers who are having more harrowing experience due to plying on these bad roads. “All byroads of Kochi are in bad condition. The shock absorber of my bike developed complaints due to plying on these roads every day,” says Anoop, an online delivery boy. The tiles laid on Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road are dislocated at many places. “We have to be more careful on these roads otherwise motorists will fall and get injured. How many times do we have to complain to the authorities? Every year this is the situation on one road or the other,” said Rajanandan, an auto driver. Officials of GCDA, which owns the Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road, said that Kerala water authority had dug the road for laying pipeline under the Amrut project. “As water authority had deposited a restoration charge with us, they filled the road without using a granular sub base (GSB). We did patchwork on the potholes using GSB to prevent accidents. Now, GCDA has invited tender for relaying the stretch for around Rs 6 lakh,” said the official. While Kochi corporation officials said they would do patchworks worth around Rs 2 crore on roads owned by it. “Patchworks on many roads are progressing. There was some delay in getting tar to complete the works. We need to give cheque of the amount to BPCL to get tar from them. The corporation has completed repair works in West Kochi. On Chittoor Road, we will do BMBC work from Kacheripady towards Ernakulam South, once the rain is over,” said a corporation official. Engineers admit that patchwork was not a permanent solution to the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/condition-of-many-roads-bylanes-in-kochi-pathetic/articleshow/87547042.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: 11,300 drunk driving cases registered in 90 days||CHENNAI: The traffic police have registered 11,300 drunk driving cases in the past three months after intensifying checks at 12 points across the city. Police said people who were initially reluctant to blow into the breathalyzers had begun to cooperate. Checks have become stringent particularly at road junctions in interior areas that many take after consuming liquor. In the first six months of 2021, more than 800 accident cases were reported in the city, most of them attributed to drunk driving. Since most of the people were hesitant in abiding by Covid-related norms, people driving or riding vehicles were asked to blow into a breathalyzer that comes with a hand-held stand fitted with a disposable plastic straw. After each use, the straw is packed in a polythene cover that the motorist concerned is asked to dispose. The traffic police have also framed a standard operating procedure (SoP) to be followed by field officers. From January 1 to June 30, 2020, there have been 1,000 accidents in the city, most of them due to drunk driving, against 1,229 accidents in the whole of 2019 and 1,268 accidents during the entire 2018. In 2019, most of the 514 accidents caused were due to drunk driving involving bikers. "We are seizing vehicles besides imposing a fine that offenders have to pay in virtual court. After the payment is done through e-challan, we produce the seized vehicle in virtual court. Steps are also taken to suspend licences. They should realise how dangerous it is to drink and drive," said additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pratip Kumar. The traffic police based on the cases registered and also on the number of accidents reported keep changing the check points.  After the Tamil Nadu government announced further relaxations of Covid-19 norms and opened Tasmac outlets in the state, drunk driving cases have surged. Police said that it was imperative to take strong measures to reduce road accidents and drunk driving cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-11300-drunk-driving-cases-registered-in-90-days/articleshow/87547046.cms||---

The cities, including Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad and others, together witnessed a 96% increase in housing sales, 24% more new launches and a 3% decrease in unsold inventory. While the previous third quarter saw 6,810 launches in these cities, the latest quarter saw 8,420 launches. Gurgaon leads the jump in housing sales with a 129% increase, from 1,680 units sold in Q3 2020 to 3,850 units in Q3 2021, followed by Noida which saw a 116% increase, from 670 units to 1,450 units. Noida is followed by Delhi (100%), Ghaziabad (84%) and Greater Noida (58%). As far as new launches are concerned, Noida saw the biggest jump, of 415%, with 1,030 launches this quarter compared to 200 launches during the same period last year. Gurgaon (74%) stood second with 5,510 launches in Q3 2021 against 3,170 launches in the last quarter. Anubhav Jain, CEO, Silverglades Group, said the realty sector is witnessing a significant increase in inquiries as well as transactions. “Location and quality of construction are key factors and we have been able to sell our newly-launched project due to these advantages. Other factors like low interest rates and the need for bigger homes are also driving demand,” he said. Navdeep Sardana, CMD of Elite Land Base, said Gurgaon has dominated the NCR real estate market for long and with the current festival season, its proportion of overall sales is expected to increase significantly. “The luxury segment (above Rs 1 crore) stands out in the city, where demand has surpassed supply. Healthy living projects and projects that bring people closer to the environment are also showing great potential for continued strong sales performance,” he said. Yukti Nagpal, director, Gulshan Homes, said the housing market in Noida is seeing a boost for premium properties. “Premium properties in both ready-to-move and under-construction projects have seen a huge demand in 2021. Among key trends was a big demand for 4BHK or large spaces in the residential sector where consumers opted for quality work with great community-building amenities. Noida Expressway, because of the location, got the best traction in it,” said the developer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-leads-in-housing-sales-noida-in-new-launches-says-report/articleshow/87545808.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to data sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida’s AQI touched the “severe” category for the first time this season on Diwali. On November 3, the city had recorded an AQI of 353 (“very poor”), which increased to 419 (“severe”) on Diwali and 470 (“severe”) on Friday. In Ghaziabad, the AQI was 431 around 6pm on Diwali and rose to 443 at 11pm, when bursting of crackers was at its peak. “What else could be the major reason but crackers? The district-wise cracker ban went up with the smoke and everyone burst crackers openly. The result is for everyone to see,” said Vikrant Sharma, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist. Quoting CPCB data, Sharma said PM10 and PM2.5, the major pollutants, saw a sharp spike on Thursday evening and reached the maximum 500 in Ghaziabad around 11pm. Noida wasn’t any better. Nearly all stations in the city recorded an AQI of 500 after 10pm on Thursday, which hovered around the same level through Friday as well. Five hundred is the maximum that a CPCB monitor can record. So, even if the AQI was worse, there was no measure of it. Around Friday afternoon, the value of some of the pollutants such as carbon monoxide started reducing marginally. However, PM10 and PM 2.5 levels were still high till Friday evening. “So, technically, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels had touched 1,000 in total in Ghaziabad,” Sharma said. The open flout of the cracker ban points to the lack of enforcement by various agencies. In a recent article, TOI had highlighted how firecrackers were being sold in stalls across Noida and Ghaziabad, stashed away among diyas and colourful lights for Diwali. Some dealers also took orders on WhatsApp and delivered crackers to homes or any place the customer chose. An official from the Ghaziabad administration admitted the lack of enforcement of the ban on firecrackers. “Local police stations and even senior administrative officials were deputed to ensure the cracker ban was imposed, but it failed clearly. We have identified societies where crackers were burnt. Action will be taken after we get the reports from the respective police stations,” the official said. Officials in the pollution control board, however, claimed there were reasons other than crackers for the deterioration in air quality. The officials also pointed to several cases of stubble burning in nearby states. Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of UPPCB, also blamed unfavourable meteorological conditions. “There is no doubt that the cracker ban was not properly implemented on Diwali evening, causing the PM10 and PM2.5 levels to see a sharp spark. But it’s not just crackers. Calm winds, a low temperature and a low mixing height also contributed to the prevailing conditions,” he added. The AQI levels in both the cities registered a record of sorts. Noida’s AQI of 470 on the day after Diwali was the worst seen by the city in three years. On Diwali day in Ghaziabad, it’s average AQI of 419 was also the highest on the day in three years. Station-wise, Loni recorded “severe” AQI throughout from 6pm on Thursday to 6am on Friday. Loni’s AQI spiked from 477 at 6pm to 482 in a matter of just two hours. In 2020, however, Ghaziabad’s AQI on the day after Diwali was 448, surprisingly lower than 456 the previous day. Restrictions due to the pandemic and muted celebrations were seen as the reason for this. In Noida, the AQI is the average of the data collected at four monitoring stations located in sectors 1, 62, 116 and 125. The figures recorded at Sector 125 are among the lowest since the area is sparsely populated. Meanwhile, the stations in sectors 1 and 62 usually have higher AQI levels because of the dense population and industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/the-air-says-it-all-aqi-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-spikes-to-alarming-levels/articleshow/87545829.cms||Abhijay Jha

The canal will get 87 heritage electric lamp posts and walker-friendly roads along the sides of the waterbody in a couple of months. “Around 70% of the total renovation works of the 2,170-m long canal has been completed. As the canal has an access to the proposed Water Metro through Vembanad lake, it can act as a crucial link between the royal town and other tourist spots,’’ said MLA K Babu. He said the beautification of the footpaths and removal of water hyacinths from the canal were going on war footing. “This included tiled walkways, boat jetty and strong fencing on the sides to prevent waste dumping from the road,’’ Babu said. Though the development of the canal worth Rs 8 crore was announces, it largely remained on paper. This canal was the lifeline to link Tripunithura market with Kochi and other parts lying close to Vembanad Lake. “Huge country boats carrying tonnes of vegetables, rice and other provisions used this canal to reach the market and also to take goods from Tripunithura market to other places of the state,’’ recalls 83-year-old Vasudevan, a trader at Tripunithura market. Around 63 out of 87 decorative lamp posts were installed along the side of the canal having broad tiled walkway. “This well-lit walkways can be used for morning and evening walk. The proposed kiosks at the walkway will also provide job opportunities, especially for Kudumbashree units,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-lease-of-life-for-andhakara-thodu/articleshow/87547081.cms||Sivadas Varma

---||Kochi||Will raise Mullaperiyar water level to 152ft, says TN minister||THEKKADY (Idukki): Tamil Nadu water resources minister Duraimurugan has said that his government was looking to raise the water level at Mullaperiyar dam to 152ft after strengthening the baby dam there. He was speaking to reporters at Thekkady after inspecting the dam as part of a fourmember ministerial panel. The minister also ruled out Kerala's demand for constructing a new dam, saying the apex court and various agencies have found the present dam safe. “The Supreme Court and experts had supervised the strengthening works already done at the main dam. The supervisory committee had directed strengthening the baby dam when it was approached to raise the water level. We need to fell three trees in the baby dam area to strengthen it. Earlier, when we sought permission to cut the trees, the forest department and the government had opposed it. After strengthening the dam, we will move the apex court to raise the water level to 152ft,” Duraimurugan said. He said he had visited the dam in his official capacity. “The Mullaperiyar dispute has been there for years. We hope it can be resolved amicably now as both TN and Kerala governments are on good terms. The issue can be resolved during the term of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan," he said. Referring to protests in TN against opening the dam's spillway shutters before the water level reached 142ft, he said it was done as per the rule curve. “Former CM Edappadi Palaniswami and deputy CM O Paneerselvam have no moral right to speak on the matter. No minister had visited the dam in the past 10 years... The water level can be raised to 142ft on November 30 as per the rule curve,” he said. The visit of the ministerial panel came in the wake of the AIADMK raising Mullaperiyar situation as a political issue in Tamil Nadu. The party has called a protest on November 9, along with representatives from five districts using Mullaperiyar water, against the “early” opening of the dam shutters. Durai Murukan was accompanied by TN cooperatives minister Periyasamy, commercial taxes minister P Moorthy and food and civil supplies minister R Chakrapani on the visit. Meanwhile, six spillway shutters of the dam are still open, three at 60cm and three at 30cm. The release through shutters is 3,237 cusecs while the tunnel discharge is 2,305 cusecs. The water level at 5pm was 138.65ft. The water level at Idukki reservoir is gradually going up, touching 2,398.46ft at 5pm. As per the new rule curve for the dam, the red alert level is 2,398.79ft and the upper rule level at 2,399.79ft. Maximum power is being generated at the Moolamattom plant and it was 17.35mu on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/will-raise-mullaperiyar-water-level-to-152ft-says-tn-minister/articleshow/87547158.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Police said Kannan was an assistant at one of the government departments in the secretariat complex. Police said Rangasamy of Anaiyur in Madurai met Kannan through a common friend seeking a government job for a friend's son in 2017. Kannan took the candidate's resume and asked for 30 lakh to get him a job. Kannan cited that he needed the money to clear the candidate's file through various levels of officials. Believing his words, Rangasamy gave the money to Kannan in various instalments after meeting Kannan near the Secretariat office complex. As Kannan delayed the process of getting the job done citing various reasons, Rangasamy and his friend demanded that Kannan return the money. After he refused, Rangasamy lodged a formal complaint at the Chennai city police commissioner's office. The complaint was forwarded to the Fort police station and they conducted inquiries. After confirming Kannan's involvement, the police apprehended Kannan and he was remanded in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-secretariat-official-dupes-man-of-rs-30-lakh-on-promise-of-job-held/articleshow/87547170.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||A Smokescape: AQI ‘Severe’ First Time This Year||Gurgaon: Dense smog enveloped the city on Friday morning as the air quality index (AQI) hit the ‘severe’ mark a day (472) for the first time this year. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Gurgaon’s pollution levels on Friday were the worst for the day after Diwali in the past six years. The AQI of all five stations from which the CPCB collates its data in Gurgaon — Vikas Sadan, Gwal Pahari, Teri Gram, Sector 51 and Manesar — were all at ‘severe’ levels. The city’s AQI on Diwali (Thursday) was ‘very poor’ at 395. Even though there was a total ban on sale and use of firecrackers, that was hard to tell on Diwali evening with crackers continuously accompanying celebrations and frequently lighting up the skies. According to data from CPCB, the AQI was at 298 a day after Diwali (October 31) in 2016, while it was at 397 on the corresponding day in 2017 (October 30). In 2018, the AQI was recorded at 389 on the day after Diwali (November 8), while it was 368 in 2019 (October 28). Last year, it was 460 on the corresponding day (November 15). Apart from PM2.5 and PM10, other major pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and ozone also showed a spike post Diwali compared to the last year’s levels, according to data from Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). Dispersion of pollutants is slow this year due to calm winds, an HSPCB official said. “This year, pollutant levels have remained high because of several reasons, such as a dip in temperature and wind speed. As a result, we have a higher AQI post Diwali. Moreover, incidents of cracker bursting were higher this time compared to the last year because there is no lockdown now. As Covid cases have also gone down significantly, movement of people has increased, which contributed to the rise in pollution too,” said HSPCB regional officer for Gurgaon (north) Kuldeep Singh told TOI. Former CPCB head Dr Dipankar Saha said, “Crackers have very little to do with the increase of pollutants. Pre-Diwali AQI is always higher due to a rise in vehicular movement. Moreover, the average for the past 24 hours is reflected in the next day’s overall AQI. The deterioration of meteorological conditions compounds the problem.” Saha, however, added, “It is urgent to have hourly AQI data on all critical days or when firecrackers are likely to be burst. Only ‘moderate’ AQI should be the criteria for permitting bursting of crackers. Regulators may need to revisit the criteria for bursting crackers. If green crackers make the AQI ‘severe’, their effectiveness needs re-evaluation.” A day after Diwali, the PM10 level was recorded at 255.07 µg/m3 in 2019, which dipped to 233.48 µg/m3 on the corresponding day next year. This time, however, it surged to 670.6 µg/m3 on Friday. The PM2.5 level reflected a similar trend — while it was 933.3 µg/m3 on the day after Diwali in 2019, it declined to 633.1 µg/m3 in 2020 and spiked to 838 µg/m3 this year. “We are expecting pollutants to start clearing up from November 7 onwards, as the wind speed will pick up,” HSPCB regional officer for Gurgaon (south) Sandeep Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/a-smokescape-aqi-severe-first-time-this-year/articleshow/87545879.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Manesar sees highest spike in pollutants day after Diwali||Gurgaon: An analysis of data obtained from the city’s five air monitoring stations has revealed that Manesar witnessed the highest spike in the air quality index (AQI) post Diwali at 33.3%. After Manesar, the Gwalpahari station witnessed the highest spike on Friday compared to the previous day (29%), followed by Teri Gram (27.8%), Vikas Sadan (26%) and Sector 51 (8%). At the Manesar station on Friday, the AQI was recorded at 472. It stood at 478 at Teri Gram, 473 at Gwalpahari, 466 at Vikas Sadan and 464 at Sector 51, all ‘severe’. A day ago, it was 354 at Manesar, 374 at Teri Gram, 366 at Gwalpahari and 369 at Vikas Sadan, all ‘very poor’. Sector 51 reported ‘severe’ AQI at 425 on Thursday. While PM2.5 and PM10 were the most prominent contributors to air pollution on Friday, there was a high presence of toxic pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur oxide as well in all five stations. In Teri Gram, the PM2.5 level stood at 477 on Friday, while PM10 was 447. In Sector 51, the PM2.5 was 422 after Diwali and PM10 was 424. The PM2.5 level at Vikas Sadan, which doesn’t monitor PM10, stood at 466. Meanwhile, Gwalpahari saw a PM2.5 level of 475 and PM10 of 424. In Manesar, the PM2.5 level was recorded at 455, while PM10 stood at 359. Experts said there has been a substantial rise in the level of pollutants a day after Diwali. “Micro-climatic conditions like upwards or downwards wind movement and temperature variations are responsible for accumulation of pollutants at one spot. They are responsible for the deterioration of air quality at a hotspot like Manesar,” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at Centre for Science and Environment, told TOI. Speaking about other hotspots like Teri Gram, Gwalpahari and Vikas Sadan, she said: “Factors like firecrackers, waste burning and pollution from stubble burning are creating these hotspots.” Experts also stressed that the bursting of crackers intensified the accumulation of PM2.5 in the lower atmosphere in the night hours, which led to peak values of PM2.5 crossing the 1,000 µg/m3 mark at most locations.Smog was visible in the morning and poor wind conditions are delaying dispersion, allowing particulate matter to stay afloat||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/manesar-sees-highest-spike-in-pollutants-day-after-diwali/articleshow/87545882.cms||Ipsita Pati

Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said the “worst is over” while highlighting the improved availability of edible oil in the country due to measures, including import duty cut and declaration of stocks by the stakeholders. However, mustard oil prices are still a concern. Pandey said even as the branded oil makers have revised the rates for new stock. Officials said the domestic edible oil prices have soared in tandem with the global prices which shot up due to reduced availability of edible oils following diversion for biofuel in Indonesia, Brazil and other countries. They said the prices have started moderating and this trend is likely to continue. On mustard oil, Pandey said, “We have not seen a significant reduction in prices. But the steps taken by the government, including import duty rationalisation, will effect mustard oil prices too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/except-for-mustards-edible-oil-prices-dip-by-rs-5-20/lit/articleshow/87547205.cms||---

More than 1.17 people have booked tickets to travel in these government buses till Monday, according to official data. In addition to this, private bus operators have planned to operate 1,500 omni buses from various parts of the state to the city. Meanwhile, the 12-member commitee which was constituted to look into complaints from passengers regarding charging of excess fares, will continue their inspections. In the last one week, the committee conducted inspections at 1,883 private omni buses and found that 333 among them collected excess fares. Notices were issued to all these operators and a fine of 5.18 lakh collected from them till date, said a senior official from the transport department. Among them, eight vehicles were seized for committing tax violations alongside fleecing passengers. "We hope the strict action this time will act as a deterrent," the official said, requesting anonymity. However, popular online sites show that tickets are sold up for to 2,000 per head from Madurai, Coimbatore and other districts of Tamil Nadu. People can contact toll-free number 18004256151 in order to file complaints in this regard. Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), Chennai said that it will operate at least 300 additional buses from Tambaram, Perungalathur, Poonamalle, Koyambedu and other locations where buses drop off passengers. The Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) have advised those returning to city in private cars or taxis to use Thirukazhukundram or Sriperumbudur route as National Highway 45 (Tambaram-Chengalpattu stretch) is expected to be congested during the weekends. Though private buses were barred from using the Inner Ring Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road and asked to take a detour via Outer Ring Road, traffic was chaotic along the said stretch ahead of the festival this year too. G Kowshik who travelled to Madurai, said, "It was surprising to see vehicles moving freely till Perungalathur. After that, it took almost two hours to cross the Paranur toll plaza".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-govt-to-run-12000-buses-to-aid-return-journey-of-people-who-went-to-native-places-for-diwali/articleshow/87547213.cms||Ram Sundaram

This year, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon, said, “Eight patients with less than 15% burn injuries visited the emergency ward after 11pm and went home after treatment.” On the other hand, there has been a spike in the number of patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (OPD) reporting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory distress on Friday, a day after Diwali. “Throughout the day, we have been receiving patients with breathing difficulties in the emergency ward, primarily due to a rise in pollutants and sudden dip in temperature,” said Yadav. "Restrict outdoor activities; avoid running and exercises outdoors. Avoid cold beverages and also quit smoking,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director, pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/8-patients-with-burn-injuries-treated-at-civil-hospital/articleshow/87545887.cms||Ipsita Pati

A total of 56 types of delicacies were offered to Lord Ram. Mahant Karuna Nidan, Siyaram Fort Jhunki Ghat Ayodhya said, "There is a tradition of preparing 56 dishes on this occasion because Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. At that time, people used to say that the lord must have got only simple food during exile, so they decided to offer him 56 delicacies on his arrival." Vijay Gupta, former chairman of Ayodhya municipality said that a large number of people thronged the fort on the occasion because restrictions were there on the entry of devotees due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the past two years. Meanwhile, Govardhan Puja was also celebrated in Aligarh's Shri Panchayati Gaushala by preparing the shape of Govardhan with 2.5 quintals of cow dung which devotees worshipped. "Form the past 15 years, we prepare different types of figures of Govardhan with cow dung. This year, the figure has been prepared with 2.5 quintal cow dung which has been decorated by our women's team," Krishna Gupta, Shri Panchayati Gaushala President said.

Dismissing a batch of pleas moved against the acquisition, Justice G K Ilanthiraiyan has now held the acquisition is valid, and the land can be put to public use by the state. The issue pertains to a GO passed by the state tourism department dated December 6, 1974 for acquisition of 13.07 acres of land situated at Mamallapuram, ECR. The state government later decided to establish a world class oceanarium (underwater aquarium). The total value of the proposed project to establish the oceanarium amounted to 250 crores. Aggrieved, a group of land owners approached the court contending that the land acquisition has lapsed by operation of section 24(2) of the new Land Acquisition Act. When the pleas came up for hearing on November 1, additional advocate-general Neelakandan, representing the tourism department, relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Indore Development Authority case and submitted that as per Section 24(2) of Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 when the compensation is paid/deposited or the possession is taken, that is sufficient to save the acquisition. "Compensation was already settled to the petitioners and the necessary documents were produced before the court to substantiate the same," he said. Recording the submissions, the court dismissed the batch of petitions challenging the acquisition and held the acquisition proceedings are proper and valid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-hc-decides-oceanarium-land-acquisition-case-in-favour-of-tamil-nadu/articleshow/87547290.cms||---

---||Business||Broadcasters propose hike in channel rates; SC to decide||KOLKATA: Television channel broadcasters have moved the Supreme Court against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s decision to cap channel price in bouquets at Rs 12 from December 1. The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Federation (IBDF) – a broadcasters’ body – has placed before the apex court a proposal that involves moving most of their popular channels out of packages and offering them individually at a price that is 30%-50% higher than the existing rates. A verdict is expected later this month. If the IBDF’s proposal is accepted, the monthly cable TV subscription price could rise by around 50% from next month. Some of the major broadcasters, including Star & Disney India, Sony Pictures Networks India, Zee Entertainment and Viacom 18, have come up with new price lists keeping their flagship channels out of bouquets and pricing them between Rs 15 and Rs 30. Local cable operators fear such a hike will deal a crippling blow to the cable TV industry. “Two years ago, channel prices went up by around 40% and it led to a dip in subscription in Kolkata. This time, another 25%-30% hike has been proposed which, in effect, will lead to a 50%-60% rise in subscription charges since 2019,” said Tapash Das, joint convenor of All Bengal Cable TV and Broadband Operators’ United Forum. As per the proposal, major sports, entertainment, infotainment and movie channels will now be priced between Rs 15 and Rs 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/broadcasters-propose-hike-in-channel-rates-sc-to-decide/articleshow/87547292.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

More of an attempt to reassure the children orphaned by Covid-19 that they are not alone and though there can't be any substitute to their parents, the state government and more precisely their "mama" (chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan) will take care of them as their guardian. And, as Chouhan interacted with the children, and took them around his residence he appeared to be in several roles- host, teacher, councillor, guide and guardian- telling the children through mythological and historical tales that they must pursue their dreams relentlessly to bring glory to their departed parents without having to worry for anything- everything will be taken care of. About 50 such children from Bhopal and adjacent districts were invited to CM House on Diwali for a lunch with the chief minister and his wife while children from rest of the districts listened to him through video conferencing in the company of respective district collectors. After arriving at the auditorium at CM Hall, where the children were seated, Chouhan asked all the children their name and their ambition in life before formally greeting them as host by presenting them roses. Then, he shared with children two tales - one regarding Mahatma Gandhi and his commitment to truth and another about Arjun and his unwavering concentration to achieve his aim. In the first story, he told the children that a woman came to Gandhiji asking him to prevail upon his son to give up eating gur (jaggery) and how Mahatma Gandhi kept asking her to come the next day until the fourth day when he asked the child not to eat gur. The woman in surprise asked Gandhiji if he were to say only this much to her son, why did he take so much time to do it and the Mahatma replied "I, too, was fond of eating jaggery. How could I have asked the child not to do what I was doing myself." The second story was about Arjun piercing eye of the bird hanging on a tree. Chouhan, then, asked children to pursue their aim like Arjun and said if they do well in life, their parents, wherever they are, would also feel happy. "Therefore, don't feel sorry that they are not there, try to do something which brings glory to them. When you study well, go ahead and reach somewhere, they will also feel happy", he said.He then, promised children that they would never be allowed to feel dearth of resources to realise their ambition. "Don't feel sorry. Don't burden your mind. One's parents are the best treasure a child has, nothing can make up for their absence in your life but I promise you, we can't bring them back but we shall do everything to see that you don't feel their loss", said Chouhan. Chouhan and his wife also served small children food and delicacies of their choice to other children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cm-celebrates-diwali-with-covid-orphans/articleshow/87547441.cms||---

The murder of the 28-year-old Noida-based advocate was the fallout of a property dispute, police said. A case was registered on the complaint of Nishant’s father, Prem Singh, against unknown persons and during preliminary investigation, it was found that Nishant had a dispute with some people over a chunk of land. According to the STF, Sandeep, who was planning to go into hiding to evade arrest, was nabbed from near Meerut bus stand, officials said. “During interrogation, Sandeep Pilwan confessed to have killed his cousin over a property dispute. On being threatened by Nishant that he would take the legal route, the accused got infuriated and shot him at his house on October 25,” states the STF press release.

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: More than 14% of vaccinated population in Kolkata took Covaxin, Bengal figure at 11%||KOLKATA: A higher percentage of people in Kolkata have taken Covaxin compared to those in rest of Bengal. In Kolkata, 11.4 lakh people out of the 79.1 lakh, who received their vaccine shots, had taken Covaxin. In Bengal, 87.8 lakh people out of the eight crore people who took their jabs had opted for Covaxin. Compared to 14.5% people, who opted for Covaxin in Kolkata,10.9% had taken Covaxin in Bengal. Across India, 11.2% of the 107.8 crore people who took their Covid vaccine jabs had opted for Covaxin. The CoWin Dashboard which captures the real-time vaccine data in India indicates these trends. On Friday, Bengal had about 14 lakh Covaxin doses. Another 11 lakh doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive. Currently the available stock is being used for administering recipients whose second dose are due. “Once we receive the next consignment of 11 lakh doses we will start administering it to first dose recipients,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Health officials said WHO approving the vaccine for emergency use listing would boost its demand. Many people prefer to take this vaccine due to the short gap of 28 days between two doses compared to 12 to 16 weeks for Covishield. Among the first vaccines which underwent clinical trial in Kolkata’s NICED, Covaxin prices were initially pegged at higher rates than Covishield in the earlier vaccine regime in which state and private hospitals had to procure their vaccines. This, however, didn’t impact for long when the Centre revised its vaccine procurement mandate, providing vaccines to state for free. The price difference, however, remains for private hospitals. The homegrown vaccine faced a bit of hesitancy in the beginning as it was introduced to the inoculation drive on ‘clinical trial mode’. Later with evidence of its efficacy emerging prominent more recipients started accepting it. “Even as the demand for Covaxin doses started rising, the supply became an issue due to lower production of vials. We had to either stop or restrict the number of doses being offered to recipients on certain days to tide over the supply crisis,” said a senior health department official. The Covaxin supply issues hit Bengal in July last week. It also prompted the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to temporarily close its vaccine clinics which were administering Covaxin. Three studies were conducted in Kolkata hospitals on the comparative effectiveness of two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. The studies done in Peerless Hospital, MR Bangur hospital and CMRI all found no significant difference in terms of Covid-19 and inhospital mortality. In other words, the study has found both vaccines equally effective in lowering the mortality as well as disease progression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-than-14-of-vaccinated-population-in-kol-took-covaxin-bengal-figure-at-11/articleshow/87544418.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The Diwali weekend has also registered house-full boards across many properties in the city. The turnout at the iconic Star Theatre with a total capacity of 505 has been impressive. Anil Hela, 30, returned with two friends to watch the evening show. “It’s thrilling to watch a muchawaited movie on the big screen. The atmosphere was electrifying. All health protocols were maintained and life now seems back to normal,” he said. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for Star, said two back-to-back shows at 2.40 pm and 3.45 pm of ‘Sooryavanshi’ have gone house-full on Friday. “With permission for 70% capacity, each show has 358 viewers. This is the highest turnout at Star since the pandemic,” Mukherjee said. New Empire had two houseful shows of ‘Sooryavanshi’ on Friday. “That means 416 viewers for each show,” said Amit Sengupta, manager of Humayan Properties Ltd which runs New Empire. Navina, which screened ‘Eternals’, has registered a steady increase in audience turnout since Friday’s matinee show. Its owner Navin Choukhani said, “In spite of some prominent single screens including Navina not screening ‘Sooryavanshi’, we have managed to pull in the crowd with ‘Eternals’.” Multiplex authorities are equally happy. Footfall is impressive. The advance bookings are picking up well. The food and beverage counters are doing brisk business too. According to regional director at INOX (East) Amitava Guha Thakurta, Diwali has traditionally been a crowded and a busy season as far as cinema exhibition industry is concerned. “Unlike the last two years, we are delighted to witness the same old buzz for which the festival of Diwali has been known for. The occupancy levels have been phenomenal, much similar to the pre-Covid times. The momentum built during this Diwali will mark a major milestone in the industry’s revival,” he said. Though both the Hindi and English releases are doing well, audience is yet to warm up to the Rajnikanth release. After almost two years, Sujit Kumar Bhukta, general manager (east) of Carnival Cinemas, heard whistles when stars made their entry on screen. “This is the first time after the pandemic that we are getting such good figures. People are watching movies with a vengeance. We have four screens at our property where the seating capacity ranges from 116 to 160 where we are screening ‘Sooryavanshi’ and ‘Eternals’. On Friday, we had seven out of 14 shows going houseful,” Bhukta said. Ujjal Biswas, senior executive, programming, PVR Cinemas, is floored by the audience response. “Both the Hindi and English movies have succeeded in bringing the audience back again to cinemas. We are following all Covid-19 rules. The response only proves that big screen magic remains unmatched,” Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housefull-boards-return-to-cinemas-this-diwali-as-city-indulges-in-revenge-viewing/articleshow/87544424.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Tasmac sales at 435 crore this Diwali, Madurai tops||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) netted a revenue of 435 crore during Diwali from liquor sale. This year's overall sale was marginally less compared to last year. In 2020, Tasmac's revenue was 467.69 crore. A Tasmac source said that unlike last year, this year Diwali holiday spreads over five days. So the sale will get equally distributed through this week. The state-run corporation has estimated a revenue of at least 1,000 crore this week. With all 272 Tasmac bars commencing operations from Monday, the sale is expected to go up during the weekend. Madurai region recorded the maximum sale of liquor. Tasmac shops in the southern city sold liquor worth 98.89 crore on Tuesday and Wednesday. Following Madurai, Trichy region clocked a sale revenue of 90.25 crores on these two days. In Salem, the revenue was 87 crore. Chennai region's revenue (second last in Tamil Nadu) was 79.85 crore. Coimbatore recorded the least revenue over these two days. "Usually during festivals, people residing in Chennai leave to their native places in Madurai, Trichy and Salem to celebrate the festival along with their families. That's why these regions clocked more sale of liquor," a source said. This apart, Madurai region has more Tasmac shops than Chennai. Madurai has more than 900 shops compared to 882 Tasmac outlets in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-tasmac-sales-at-435-cr-this-diwali-madurai-tops/articleshow/87547890.cms||---
---||World||China ruling party plenary to further cement Xi's grip on power||BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping, the uncontested leader of the world's most populous nation, heads a pivotal plenary of the ruling party's top figures next week that will set the tone for his bid for long-term rule. From Monday to Thursday, some 400 members of the Communist Party's all-powerful Central Committee gather in Beijing behind closed doors. The only such meeting this year paves the way to its 20th party congress next autumn -- at which Xi is widely expected to be handed a third term in office, cementing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. At next week's plenary, top figures will debate a key resolution celebrating the party's main achievements in its 100 years of existence, according to state news agency Xinhua. Analysts say the resolution, only the third of its kind in the party's history, will help Xi shore up his grip on power by setting in stone his vision for China, ahead of the crucial 2022 party congress. Like all meetings of Beijing's secretive top leadership, the event will be held behind closed doors, and most key decisions are made well in advance. China's political meetings are all highly choreographed and open dissent to the official line is extremely rare. The content has not yet been published in full but the timing of the resolution is key -- as was the case with the previous two resolutions. The first, passed under Mao in 1945, helped him cement his authority over the Communist Party four years before it seized power. The second, adopted under Deng Xiaoping in 1981, saw the regime adopt economic reforms and recognise the "mistakes" of Mao's ways. Unlike the previous two, Xi's resolution will not mark a break with the past, Harvard University's Anthony Saich told AFP. "Rather, it is intended to show that Xi is the natural inheritor of a process since the founding of the party that qualifies him to lead in the 'new era'," said Saich, an expert on Chinese politics. "The purpose is to consolidate Xi as the natural inheritor of the 'glorious history' of the CCP," he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Saich also said the resolution is likely to mark a step back from Deng's text in that it will be less critical of the Mao era from 1949 to 1976. Under Mao's grip, tens of millions of people starved as the regime sought to force the country into communes. In the decade leading up to his death, he unleashed the Cultural Revolution, an era of violence that scarred the national psyche. Under Deng, the party saw a bid to evade a repeat of Mao's personality cult -- if only to ensure continuity of its rule. According to dissident political scholar Wu Qiang, who lost his job as a lecturer at Tsinghua University in Beijing over his research, the resolution's approval would mean "that Xi Jinping's authority is uncontested". Wu also believes the plenum will firm China's path back towards a more "controlled, planned" economy -- as seen in Xi's ongoing drive to regulate the country's mammoth enterprises in sectors from tech to real estate. The question of the democratic island of Taiwan -- which sees itself as sovereign but which Beijing claims as its own territory -- could also be on the meeting agenda. Regardless of next week's meeting, Xi's uncontested authority is not in question, according to Carl Minzner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations. "The core issue is: how much higher might he go?" he told AFP. "The tone and content of the resolution will likely give some suggestion as to how Xi seeks to be portrayed," he said. "As the equal of Mao and Deng? Or merely Mao alone?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-ruling-party-plenary-to-further-cement-xis-grip-on-power/articleshow/87547921.cms||---
---||World||Fear stalks Rohingya refugee camps after murders||KUTUPALONG: Bloodstains still mark the spot where assassins gunned down Mohib Ullah, an activist who was a leading voice for the 850,000 Rohingya living in fear in Bangladeshi refugee camps. In the weeks since the murder, a senior member of the now-shell-shocked volunteer group that Ullah headed has received phone calls telling him he'll be next. And he's not alone. "They can hunt you down the way they have brazenly shot dead our leader and so many people," Noor, too frightened to give his real name or be filmed, told AFP. "They", he believes, are members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), an insurgent group fighting the Myanmar military but also thought to be behind a wave of killings and criminal activity in the camps. ARSA has denied it killed Ullah. Most of the Rohingya have been in the camps since 2017 when they fled a brutal military offensive in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the predominantly Muslim minority are reviled and seen as illegal immigrants. Refusing to go back until they are assured of security and equal rights, the refugees remain stuck in bamboo-and-tarp shacks with no work, poor sanitation and little education for their children. Overflowing latrines fill narrow mud lanes with excrement in monsoon season, and fires can rip through the flimsy homes in minutes during the hot summers. By day the Bangladesh authorities provide some security. But at night the camps become the domain of gangs -- allegedly linked to ARSA -- that traffic millions of dollars worth of methamphetamine from Myanmar. "The scenario is different as soon as the sun sets," Israfil, a Rohingya refugee who goes by one name, told AFP. "The dark time is the long hours when they do whatever they want to do," he added. Working among the chaos and unease in the camps, Ullah and his colleagues quietly documented the crimes that his people suffered at the hands of the Myanmar military, while pressing for better conditions. The former schoolteacher shot to prominence in 2019 when he organised a protest of around 100,000 people in the camps to mark two years since their exodus. That year he met US President Donald Trump in the White House and addressed a UN meeting in Geneva. But his fame appears to have gone down badly with ARSA. They saw Ullah as threatening their place as the sole voice representing the Rohingya -- one who was opposed to their violence, his colleagues and rights activists say. "He became a thorn in ARSA's side," said Nur Khan Liton, a top rights activist in Bangladesh. "ARSA was also frightened by his enormous popularity." Three weeks after Ullah's murder in late September, gunmen and machete-wielding attackers slaughtered seven people in an Islamic seminary that had allegedly refused to pay protection money to ARSA. "The brutal carnage bore all the marks of ARSA. The group previously slaughtered at least two top Islamic clerics because they didn't back ARSA's violent struggle," said a top expatriate Rohingya activist. "ARSA has carried out the murders to establish its full control in the camps. After the latest carnage, everyone seems to be silenced," he added, asking to remain anonymous. After the attack on the seminary, the UN refugee agency urged the Bangladesh authorities "to take immediate measures to improve the security in the refugee camps". A series of turf war killings in 2019 prompted the Bangladesh army to erect barbed-wire fences around the camps. The elite Armed Police Battalion was tasked with patrolling the area. Police have also carried out a series of security operations that have killed dozens of alleged Rohingya drug traffickers. But although they have arrested dozens of people over Ullah's killing, they are in denial about ARSA's activity, blaming instead "rivalries" in the camps. "ARSA has no presence in the camps," Naimul Haque, the commanding officer of the Kutupalong camp, insisted to AFP. Members of Ullah's group are far from reassured, saying that their security concerns fall on deaf ears. Some even mutter that ARSA and the Bangladesh security forces are in cahoots -- something Dhaka vehemently denies. Kyaw Min, a top Rohingya leader, said police assist ARSA to "reign" at night by "conveniently" not being around when they operate. A month before he died Ullah sent a letter, seen by AFP but which could not be independently verified, to the Bangladesh authorities. He named 70 men in the camps he said were ARSA members, and said he and his colleagues feared for their lives. Bangladesh's refugee commissioner Shah Rezwan Hayat and camp-in-charge Atiqul Mamun denied receiving any such letter. Family members of senior Rohingya leaders told AFP that Bangladesh security forces have since relocated at least six families including Ullah's, fearing they will be targeted. "We thought we would be safe in Bangladesh. But now we don't know when the killers will knock on our doors," activist Sa Phyo Thida told AFP. "Just like those genocide days in Myanmar in 2017 when we were living in fear of the military death squad, we now live in extreme fear."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/fear-stalks-rohingya-refugee-camps-after-murders/articleshow/87547974.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: After Diwali, air quality levels turn hazardous||Green fireworks were promoted and time restrictions imposed, but Chennai’s air and noise pollution levels dropped to hazardous levels on Diwali, with the average value of Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging between 342 and 385, shows Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) data. Government standards say an AQI of above 100 can cause breathing discomfort. TNPCB’s report of Ambient Air Quality Survey (AAQ) showed there was a substantial increase in values of Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) at the monitoring stations in Besant Nagar, T Nagar, Nungambakkam, Triplicane and Sowcarpet compared to 2020 when Covid curbs were more. This year, Diwali was celebrated with more fervour. “People were waiting to celebrate it and did so with less fear,” said Priyanka Golecha of Purasawalkam. Police booked 668 cases against people for setting off fireworks beyond the restricted time. “Green crackers are never going to solve the problem as they are only 30% less polluting compared to normal ones. We have never seen the AQI drop to such alarming levels in Chennai. This is definitely going to cause more lung-related diseases and hamper children’s development,” said G Sundarrajan, an environmental activist from Poovulagin Nanbargal. A senior TNPCB official attributed the high pollution levels to lack of air/wind movement due to humidity. Rain on Wednesday night and Thursday morning also forced residents to burst firecrackers in a short time on Diwali evening. Also, more use of rockets and multi-shots at night led to more release of PM, the official said. Given the ban on some varieties, more people opted for such fireworks and even then there was a notable increase in overall sales, say shop owners. On Friday night, however, AIQ began to improve due to winds. “But enough damage has been caused,” said Sundarrajan. There was a drop in the number of fire accidents, deaths, burns and even sale of liquor. A total of 47 suffered minor burns on Thursday. It was almost double the same during Diwali 2020. The fire and rescue services department deployed at least 10 personnel in each of the major control rooms and received 56 such calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-after-diwali-air-quality-levels-turn-hazardous/articleshow/87547994.cms||Ram Sundaram

While Anjan Bose is delighted that the first feature film (‘Kalkokkho’), produced by his Aurora Film Corporation after 45 years, has made the cut, Parambrata and Bratya are happy with the selection of their films that mark their Indian Panorama debut as directors. On being asked about the genesis of this ‘Abhijaan’, Parambrata said that Soumitra Chatterjee had come to know about it through his producers. “I was anxious whether he’d be confident that I’d be able to handle such a huge subject. But he welcomed the idea and was very impressed when I told him about my take on the screenplay. Today I miss him more,” Parambrata said. Bratya, who will try to attend the screening in Goa, said, “This is a big recognition for me and my team. I am glad the jury has appreciated the sensitivity and subtly, which I wanted to communicate through my film. This selection is a huge applause for a leaner of cinema like me.” Producer of ‘Dictionary’ Firdausul Hasan said, “We released the film during the pandemic and got a house full show at Nandan. Currently, there is little financial incentive for us to produce meaningful cinema in India. Doordarshan would earlier buy films selected for the Indian Panorama. That policy was withdrawn about eight years ago. For our collective inspiration, I am appealing to the government to reintroduce the norm of Doordarshan buying these selected movies.” Sanghamitra’s docu-feature is on Sainbari, Marichjhapi and 12 other landmark events that shook Bengal in the past five decades. “I missed the National Awards deadline due to a dilemma of the Central Board of Film Certification. They took six months to get the film censored. The Kolkata office asked me to send it to Mumbai headquarters, where I had to arrange for a special screening. Some deletions were suggested then. Getting that done took a lot of time. Finally, I got the certificate in July but by then it was too late to apply for the National Awards. Indian Panorama’s selection comes as a recognition for my efforts,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8-films-from-bengal-make-it-to-iffis-52nd-edition-in-goa/articleshow/87548146.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||World||Astronauts to return from space station next week: NASA||WASHINGTON: Four astronauts are scheduled to return to Earth from the International Space Station early Monday after spending more than six months in space, NASA announced. The four members of the Crew-2 mission, including a French and a Japanese astronaut, will therefore return to Earth before the arrival of a replacement crew, whose take-off was delayed several times due to unfavorable weather conditions. NASA said in a statement late Friday that Crew-2 members are due to return to Earth "no earlier than 7:14 am EST (1214 GMT) Monday, Nov. 8, with a splashdown off the coast of Florida." "As we're preparing to leave, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, we might never come back to see the ISS, and it's really a magical place," French astronaut Thomas Pesquet said earlier Friday during a press conference from the space station. "I'm very thankful that people dreamt the ISS some time ago and then went ahead and worked hard to make it happen and to build it for the benefit of everyone," Pesquet added. Endeavour, the Crew Dragon spacecraft, is scheduled to undock from the International Space Station at 1805 GMT Sunday to begin the journey home. Once detached from the ISS, the capsule will begin a journey of several hours, the duration of which can vary greatly depending on the trajectory, and will then land off the coast of Florida. A backup undocking and splashdown opportunity is available Monday, if weather conditions are not favorable, NASA said. The two missions are being carried out by NASA in collaboration with SpaceX, which now provides regular launches to the ISS from the United States. Crew-3 is scheduled to take off for the ISS aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where astronauts have been in quarantine for days. US astronaut Megan McArthur was confident that not getting the replacement crew to ISS before the current crew departs was just a temporary setback. "Of course that's not optimal," McArthur told reporters during the Friday press conference. "But we are prepared to manage that. Spaceflight is full of lots of little challenges."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/astronauts-to-return-from-space-station-next-week-nasa/articleshow/87548148.cms||---

Then last week, drug pricing fell out of the bill altogether and it looked as if the drug companies had won again. Now there is a compromise that looks modest but could have real bite. The drug price regulation Congress is considering would achieve three main goals. It would limit the amount that Medicare patients can be asked to pay for drugs out of pocket. It would restrict how much drugmakers can increase their prices each year. And, for the first time, it would allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drugmakers on prices for their medications. The provision on price negotiation was the one most substantially changed in the past week: It would apply to fewer drugs, require smaller discounts, and, most critically, shield new drugs from negotiations. And yet a wide range of health economists and advocates say those compromises may have created a less risky way of balancing innovation with profits. The policy isn’t simply smaller than the original. If enacted, it will save the federal government less money than the legislation passed by the House two years ago. But it is also less likely to hinder the development of new treatments and cures, the experts said. “There is a lot to be said for incremental changes that allow us to learn,” said Benedic Ippolito, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute, who studies the drug market. “Especially when we think there are meaningful trade-offs to consider.” The bill text could, of course, change or fail to become law. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet measured its effects, and House moderates are reluctant to vote on the social spending package without a comprehensive estimate of the bill’s many parts. But the drug provisions were negotiated with key senators, including Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who had suggested she would have voted against the previous version. Policymakers tackling the system of drug prices have always been balancing competing interests. The unregulated U.S. pricing system causes huge expense and poor health care outcomes for people who can’t afford their medicines. But the system also encourages major risky investments in biomedical research that benefit the world. No one has a good model of how the machine works, but nearly everyone who studies the system says taking money out of the prescription drug business is likely to have some negative effect on investment in drug development. “There is a real trade-off we face here between costs today versus treatments tomorrow,” said Craig Garthwaite, a professor of strategy at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern, who studies drug development. Decades ago, most major drugs were developed by the large pharmaceutical companies that sold them. But that system has changed. Today, most drugs originate in small biotech startups. Those firms are often devoted to the development of a single drug, and they are financed by venture capital firms that are willing to make risky bets in the hopes that one will pay off big. In the case of biotech, the payoff usually comes when a promising drug comes along and the company is purchased by a bigger company. Venture firms that invest in biotech now don’t necessarily have to. Their money could just as easily go into other profitable sectors of the economy, such as technology. Early stage drug companies are funded, in part, because high U.S. drug prices mean that a successful drug will be worth a huge jackpot. Since the rest of the world pays less, nearly all of that investment is directed at the U.S. market. The original House proposal to regulate drug prices would have allowed the government to lower the price of up to 250 expensive drugs, no matter how new or how innovative they were. The new approach limits that power: Drugs would be subject to price regulation only after they have been on the market for about a decade. That would mean drug companies could still charge enormous prices for new drugs, but they could do so only for so long. The law would allow price regulation after nine years for most common medications, and 13 years for more complicated drugs known as biologics. Peter Bach, director of the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and the chief medical officer of Delfi Diagnostics, has been a longtime outspoken advocate for drug price reforms. He said a delayed approach would protect the public and the government from what he sees as the industry’s most egregious practices — the endless price hikes and patent shenanigans that often insulate expensive drugs from competition for decades. But he also said it will keep the promises of the country’s intellectual property system by giving the companies a few years to profit off their new inventions. “It all aligns with core premises in our system,” he said. “And reining in distortions that have crept in.” The original legislation was almost guaranteed to discourage the creation of some future drugs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it would lead to 3% fewer drugs in the first decade of its life, and 10% fewer in the decade after, as it affected drugs earlier in the pipeline. Other scholars of the system, including Garthwaite, say the effects could be even larger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/democrats-choosing-less-risky-path-on-drug-prices/articleshow/87548174.cms||---

This striking scene played out on Friday in a village in Durg district, where Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel followed an ancient tradition and got himself whipped with a ‘sota’ made of ‘kush’ — a species of grass used for religious purposes — on Govardhan Puja to remove obstacles in the prosperity of the state and bring good luck. After storming to power in the December 2018 elections, Baghel has been performing this tradition every year, where it is believed that bearing the blow of a ‘sota’ — akin to a whip — brings happiness and prosperity. This year, the CM performed the ‘Sota-Prahar’ ritual in Durg’s Janjgiri village, where a villager Birendra Thakur whipped him. In a video shared by the CM on Twitter, Baghel is seen holding his hand out, fist clenched, as Birendra whips him hard eight times. He doesn’t hold back, and Baghel doesn’t flinch. After the ritual, the CM offers him pranam and hugs him. प्रदेश की मंगल कामना और शुभ हेतु आज जंजगिरी में सोटा प्रहार सहने की परंपरा निभाई।सभी विघ्नों का नाश हो। https://t.co/bHQNFIFzGv— Bhupesh Baghel (@bhupeshbaghel) 1636084624000During his conversation with villagers, Baghel said that earlier, Bharosa Thakur used to do the whipping and now the tradition is being followed by his son, Birendra. “Animal wealth is worshipped in Govardhan Puja. It is a fact that the more prosperous the cattle wealth, the more we will progress,” the CM said. “This is why Govardhan Puja is so popular in rural areas. People wait for it throughout the year as this worship is also a symbol of our gratitude towards the cow and cattle wealth,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhattisgarh-chief-minister-bhupesh-baghel-gets-whipped-for-states-prosperity/articleshow/87548143.cms||---

The residents of street No. 622 in Action Area II of the township raised the matter in a WhatsApp group recently, complaining that the construction materials have been lying on the roadside for a long time. “Several buildings are coming up in the township and the construction materials that are being piled up here and there not only narrow the road space but also put the pedestrians and motorists at the risk of an accident. Besides, these debris and other construction materials are also polluting the air. We have informed the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) officials and the contractors of these underconstruction buildings about the matter repeatedly, but with no results,” said a resident, who did not wish to be named. The residents alleged that the construction materials, which are also choking the drains and gully pits, triggered waterlogging in several pockets of the township during heavy rain before Puja this year. “The dumping of construction materials is a big problem throughout New Town. The matter has been informed to the authorities concerned. Either they have to stop the construction work or take a stern action against those who are causing the problem,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of resident forums in New Town. “This is along pending issue and we had previously brought the matter to the notice of the authorities for a remedy,” said New Town Citizens Welfare Fraternity secretary, Samir Gupta. “The dust particles can affect those having dust allergy. Those, who have asthma or other allergies, should take necessary precautions like wearing mask or covering their nose with handkerchief,” said a consulting physician, Shankha Subhra Chaudhuri. The NKDA authorities said that there is a standing instruction not to scatter construction materials on the roads. “We will send notices to the contractors, asking them to remove the debris or we will impose fine on the offenders,” said a NKDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-building-materials-eat-into-new-town-road-space/articleshow/87548192.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The petitioner, B S Loganathan, is the brother-in-law of K Chandraprakash (of KCP infra), one of those arrayed in the DVAC FIR. Loganathan, in his petition to the special court for trial of cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, said he was a partner in M/S Madras Infra, which takes up services and works contract. And that he had received communication from his bank in Coimbatore in September that his account and fixed deposits were frozen by orders from the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC). The Rs 3.9 crore in his savings account and Rs 65 lakh in fixed deposits were from legitimate sources and he was not involved in the case against the minister, Loganathan said. In response, the DVAC informed the court that it was investigating if the petitioner had acted in connivance with the accused in the case. The DVAC had conducted searches at the residences of Velumani and his associates on August 10 and 11. "We had asked the Income Tax department to furnish returns filed by 80 companies/ individuals/firms believed to be involved and bank accounts of firms and individuals closely associated with the main accused are subject to scrutiny," the DVAC counsel submitted. During 2018 and 2021, there was transaction amounting to Rs 69.67 crore in the bank account of the petitioner's wife -- sister of Chandraprakash. The bank account was opened only in 2017, the DVAC said. "The petitioner had taken work orders from Chennai and Coimbatore corporation without any previous experience in the field. The allotment of work order to the petitioner's firm and another firm for which his wife is the proprietor itself is under investigation," the DVAC told the court. Special Judge J Omprakash dismissed the petition in an interim order. The court noted that since the mode and the way the petitioner's company was allotted tender itself is under investigation, the petitioner's claims cannot be agreed upon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dvac-case-against-velumani-plea-to-defreeze-accounts-rejected/articleshow/87548251.cms||Srikkanth D

In his letter, Chennithala said the government holding a meeting with project consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), that was blacklisted by the government earlier, has left the project shrouded in mystery. The project is being revived with corruption in mind and is being taken forward by bypassing all rules and regulations. The project has been conceived for helping a foreign company out of the way and thereby making monetary benefits, he alleged. Chennithala demanded that the government release the copy of the minutes of the meeting chaired by the chief minister regarding the project held this week. In his letter, he also came up with nine questions to the CM. Chennithala asked about the procedures followed by the government to select HESS AG for e-bus manufacturing. He demanded to know who selected PwC as the project consultant and based on what criteria, how the prices of the 3,000 buses to be manufactured have been decided, how was it decided that the private player will hold 51% of the shares and the government 49% in the joint venture company and why was no global bid was invited for the project. He also pointed out that HESS AG representatives participating in the meeting chaired by the chief secretary for preparing the detailed project report itself is the biggest example of irregularities. The project for the manufacture and purchase of 3,000 electric buses was earlier put on the backburner following allegations of corruption by the opposition towards the end of the tenure of the previous LDF government As part of reviving the project, it was decided to set up a joint venture company with HESS, KSRTC and KAL. A meeting was convened last week by the chief minister to review the progress of the project. Last year, when the project was mooted for the first time, the government wanted to move forward despite the state-level task force on emobility cautioning that there are actually no real models available anywhere in the world for the study and adoption in e-bus segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-chennithala-writes-to-cm-against-e-bus-plan/articleshow/87548280.cms||---

---||India||Pak denies visas to Hindus wishing to travel with Sikh jathas, claim Sikh groups||AMRITSAR: Various Sikh societies in India have alleged that Pakistan High Commission in Delhi often rejects visas of Hindus who apply for pilgrimage to Pakistan along with Sikh jathas, which is unfortunate.  While talking to TOI on Friday, Harpal Singh Bhullar, president of Bhai Mardana Yadgari Kirtan Darbar Society, said a large number of Hindu followers apply for visas to Pakistan for paying obeisance at various Sikh shrines in the neighboring country but are disappointed after being denied the documents.  “This time also I have applied for visas for 16 Hindus who aspire to travel along with a Sikh jatha to Pakistan to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev but I am not sure that they will be given the visas,” said Bhullar.  The leader of another Sikh group who also takes jathas to Pakistan told TOI on condition of anonymity that when they took up the issue with the officials of the Pak High Commission in Delhi, they threatened they “will deny visas to two Sikh applicants for every Hindu applicant”.  Sources said that a total of 3,250 people have applied for visas to Pakistan for the upcoming Guru Nanak jayanti celebrations, however, as per the protocol agreement, a total of 2,500 visas would be issued.  Sources added that Pakistan had always been making attempts to create a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs since "it has lent support to Khalistan movement, which is spearheaded by a handful of Sikh militants". “Denying visas to Hindus who wish to travel along with Sikh jathas is part of Pak ISI’s anti-India plan and they have been successfully executing the same,” said a source. “We have decided to take up the issue with Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Aamir Singh to press the Pakistani government for issuing liberal visas to Hindu followers for pilgrimage along with Sikh jathas,” the source said. Besides Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, small Sikh groups from Amritsar, Chabhal, Dabwali, Jammu, Bathinda etc. also send jathas to Pakistan every year on different religious occasions. Chief secretary of SGPC Harcharan Singh Dhami said that the Pakistan High Commission “had their own criteria for issuing visas, which are not known to us”.  He added that the pilgrims had to get themselves both doses of Covid-19 vaccination, besides they should be carrying negative Covid test report, issued not more than 72 hours before crossing the border.  While expressing ignorance over the issue of visa denial, spokesperson of Pakistan Evacuee Trust Property Board Aamir Hashmi said that they had planned the birthday celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev from November 17 to 27.  “We will receive the Indian Sikh jathas at Wagah international border and depart for Nankana Sahib where the main ceremony will be held on November 19, following which they will travel to Gurdwara Sacha Sauda, Farooqabad; Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasanabdal; Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Lahore; Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, Kartarpur; and Gurdwara Rorri Sahib, Eminabad; before coming back to India on November 27,” Hashmi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-denies-visas-to-hindus-wishing-to-travel-with-sikh-jathas-claim-sikh-groups/articleshow/87548238.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Sharing details, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Reasi, Shailendra Singh, said troops from three police stations — Arnas, Pouni and Ransoo — tracked uphill from different sides while the members of the Village Defence Committees (VDCs) from Fargal, Mujah, Gulzara, Khori, Kotla, Ikhni, Gool, Raskeen and Bharkh also participated in the operation.  “The area-domination exercise culminated at Ikhni Top Ransoo,” he said.  During the said exercise, the SSP reviewed the preparedness of the troops and VDCs to tackle any untoward incident.  Singh expressed concerns about the militancy-related activities in the adjoining district of Rajouri and possibility of its spill over in Reasi and directed the jawans to remain vigilant and proactive on this front.  Officials were also briefed to work with zeal and dedication to curb the menace of bovine smuggling, narcotics and other crimes and take special care about the security of vital installations and religious places.  Local residents, meanwhile, while interacting with SSP Reasi, put forth various issues faced by them on a daily basis.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: I-T department detects Rs 200 crore hidden income on dry fruit groups||LUDHIANA: The recent income tax department raids on multiple premises of the country’s two leading dry fruit companies engaged in the business of processing and trading of dry fruits led to detection of unaccounted income of more than Rs 200 crore. While one company has its main base in Amritsar and Delhi , the other is in Jammu. During the search operations on October 28, the department had found and seized many incriminating documents, including digital evidence, indicating that the assessee group had been inflating purchases of dry fruits exorbitantly over the years. The action also resulted in seizure of unaccounted cash of Rs 63 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 2 crore. The raids concluded on October 31 and were conducted across India — in Amritsar, Jammu, Delhi, Ludhiana, Mumbai and some locations in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Seized evidences also support the fact that unaccounted cash was received by the group directors against payment made for such purchases. According to a statement released by the finance ministry on Friday, there was also evidence that one of the assessees was maintaining a parallel set of book of accounts and there was a huge difference between sales and purchases recorded in both the sets. It further stated: “One of the groups is also indulging in unaccounted purchases and sales of dry fruits. Excess stock to the tune of Rs 40 crore has been found. An analysis of the seized material and evidence collected reveals that one of the groups is also running a benami... concern. In both the groups, the claim of deduction under Section 80IB of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, has been found to be not genuine and is estimated to be around Rs 30 crore. The search action has resulted in seizure of unaccounted cash of Rs 63 lakh and jewellery of Rs 2 crore. Fourteen bank lockers have been placed under restraint. The search action has led to the detection of unaccounted income exceeding Rs 200 crore.” Both these groups are engaged in dry fruit imports and trading and dealing in huge variety of dry fruits like almonds, walnuts, cashewnuts, raisins and pistachio among others. Besides selling dry fruits to distributors and dealers, they also do huge online business of the same under their respective brand names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludhiana-i-t-department-detects-rs-200-crore-hidden-income-on-dry-fruit-groups/articleshow/87548735.cms||Mohit Behl

A short circuit in the wheelhouse is suspected to be the cause for the fire accident. The fishing boat was at a distance of 10 nautical miles from Karwar lighthouse. On receipt of a message by MRSC New Mangalore at 10pm on Friday from coastal security police, Malpe C-155 from Karwar was sailed immediately for search and rescue mission and for an assessment of the incident and evacuation of fishermen. ICGS C-155 reached the spot and immediately swung into action of dousing the fire after ascertaining all seven crew shifted to nearby fishing boat IFB Vajra. The operation to completely douse the fire was completed in about three hours.

Justice Rekha Palli granted time to the Delhi government’s counsel to obtain instructions on assigning staff and providing other facilities to JNU’s Covid-19 centre and listed the case for further hearing to January 13, 2022. The court’s poser came after JNU Teachers’ Association and others, who have filed a petition on the availability of medical facilities on the campus to deal with Covid-19, submitted that though the university administration has earmarked space in Sabarmati Dormitory for setting up a Covid-19 centre, doctors and requisite infrastructure are not available. In May, the court had directed that a Covid-19 care centre be set up at JNU for immediate isolation of residents testing positive for coronavirus as the number of infections on the campus was “quite high.” It issued the order after it was told that a Covid taskforce and a Covid response team were already working inside the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-seeks-govts-stand-on-infra-for-jawaharlal-nehru-university-covid-centre/articleshow/87549090.cms||---

---||India||Cracker bursting and farmers’ protests dent Supreme Court's orders||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's well intended judgments and orders for regulating bursting of crackers and keeping the public roads clear for smooth traffic, the two functions which squarely fall in the legislative and executive domains, got flagrantly violated with people bursting crackers this Diwali with vengeance while agitating farmers continued to block national highways.  The SC had been having a tryst with crackers for decades. Considering harmful effects of fireworks on ambient air and lungs, eyes and ears of people "particularly the ailing and the aged", the SC on November 11, 2016, had directed the Union government to "suspend all such licences as permit sale of fireworks, wholesale and retail, within the territory of NCR; suspension shall remain in force till further orders of SC; and, no such licences shall be granted or renewed till further orders".  On September 12, 2017, it lifted the complete ban and said sale of fireworks by the permanent licensees must conform to the directions given above and must be fully in compliance with the Explosives Rules. On October 23, 2018, it permitted bursting of "green crackers" while banning use of barium salts in the manufacture of fireworks. It had ordered that "on Diwali days or on any other festivals like Gurupurab, etc, it (bursting of crackers) would strictly be from 8 pm till 10 pm. On Christmas eve and New Year's eve, it would be from 11.55 pm till 12.30 am only". Read AlsoGreen crackers allowed if ambient air quality not poor: Supreme CourtResidents of every city in India can burst green crackers on Diwali if the ambient air quality remained better than the “poor” category, the Supreme Court said on Monday as it set aside a Calcutta high court order imposing a blanket ban on bursting of crackers and exceeded the previous SC order On October 29 this year, the SC had made the state governments accountable for enforcing its orders. "Any lapse on the part of the States, UTs and their agencies shall be viewed very seriously. If it is found that any banned firecrackers are manufactured, sold and used in any particular area, the Chief Secretary of the concerned State(s), the Secretary (Home) of the concerned State(s) and the Commissioner of Police of the concerned area, District Superintendent of Police of the concerned area and the SHO/Police Officer in-charge of the concerned police station shall be held personally liable," it had warned. Read AlsoChief secy, CP will be liable if cracker rules flouted: SCNEW DELHI: Noting that its order to ban polluting firecrackers is not being implemented by state governments and the fireworks are still being manufactured and sold, the Supreme Court on Friday said top bureaucrats, including chief secretaries and police commissioners, shall be held personally All these veiled threats of holding the police and state administration could not translate into a quieter Diwali. With just one policeman per 642 persons in India, it was well nigh impossible for the police force to stop people, who appeared to be on a mission to be disobedient this year, from bursting firecrackers. As a result, there was no check whether the crackers were “green" or “hazardous”. There was also no enforcement of the two-hour window for bursting crackers as the fireworks started much before 8 pm and continued well after Diwali midnight.  Bursting of crackers in defiance of SC orders and state governments' decisions was preceded by continued defiance of SC's landmark judgment in the case relating to Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protests, where protesters blocked one of the main arterial roads of Delhi for months.  The SC had, while respecting the citizens' right to protest against any legislation, firmly said, "We have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters. We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest."  "We have, thus, no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions," the SC had said, thus in a way terming the blocking of highways by farmers, who are protesting against three agricultural laws, as illegal actions.  Having held so, the SC is now engaged in an exercise to drive home the farmers’ organisations continuing with their protests on the highways. But, the exercise appears to be one in vain as the agitation spearhead - Samyukta Kishan Union - has refused to appear before the court on this issue.  Should the SC have left these two issues - regulating bursting of firecrackers and removal of protesters from public roads - to the executive and not jumped into the fray? In Mallikarjuna Rao vs State of Andhra Pradesh, the SC in 1990 had said, "It is crystal clear that the court has a very limited role and in exercise of that, it is not open to have (possess powers for) judicial legislation. Neither the court can legislate, nor has it any competence to issue directions to the legislature to enact the law in a particular manner."  Nearly 30 years later in the Ashwani Kumar vs Union of India case, the SC in 2019 had said, "Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate... Power of judicial review has expanded, taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice."  "Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action. Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions," it had said.  "Referring to the phrase "all power is of an encroaching nature", which the judiciary checks while exercising the power of judicial review, it has been observed that the judiciary must be on guard against encroaching beyond its bounds since the only restraint upon it is the self-imposed discipline of self-restraint," it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-defiance-of-sc-orders-diwali-was-loud-farmers-continue-to-occupy-roads/articleshow/87548626.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||World||US Democrats pass $1 trillion infrastructure bill, ending daylong standoff||WASHINGTON: After a daylong standoff, Democrats set aside divisions between progressives and centrists to pass a $1 trillion package of highway, broadband and other infrastructure improvement, sending it on to President Joe Biden to sign into law. The 228-to-206 vote is a substantial triumph for Biden's Democrats, who have bickered for months over the ambitious spending bills that make up the bulk of his domestic agenda. Biden's administration will now oversee the biggest upgrade of America's roads, railways and other transportation infrastructure in a generation, which he has promised will create jobs and boost US competitiveness. Democrats still have much work to do on the second pillar of Biden's domestic program: a sweeping expansion of the social safety net and programs to fight climate change. At a price tag of $1.75 trillion, that package would be the biggest expansion of the US safety net since the 1960s, but the party has struggled to unite behind it. Democratic leaders had hoped to pass both bills out of the House on Friday, but postponed action after centrists demanded a nonpartisan accounting of its costs - a process that could take weeks. After hours of closed-door meetings, a group of centrists promised to vote for the bill by Nov. 20 - as long as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that its costs lined up with White House estimates. The House planned a procedural vote on that package later on Friday. "Welcome to my world. This is the Democratic Party," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier in the day. "We are not a lockstep party." The standoff came just days after Democrats suffered losses in closely watched state elections, raising concerns that they may lose control of Congress next year. Biden called lawmakers to urge them to pass the transportation package, which has already won approval in the Senate. The infrastructure bill passed with the support of 13 Republicans, fulfilling Biden's promise of passing some bipartisan legislation. The phrase "infrastructure week" had become a Washington punchline during his predecessor Donald Trump's four years in the White House, when plans to focus on those investments were repeatedly derailed by scandals. AIM TO MOVE FORWARD The party is eager to show it can move forward on the president's agenda and fend off challenges in the 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans will seek to regain control of both chambers of Congress, which they lost to the Democrats under Trump. Congress also faces looming Dec. 3 deadlines to avert a politically embarrassing government shutdown and an economically catastrophic default on the federal government's debt. With razor-thin majorities in Congress and a united Republican opposition, Democrats need unity to pass legislation. The infrastructure bill, which passed the Senate https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-infrastructure-idTRNIL1N2PH1MA in August with 19 Republican votes, would fund a massive upgrade of America's roads, bridges, airports, seaports and rail systems, while also expanding broadband internet service. The "Build Back Better" package includes provisions on child care and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration. It would bolster the credibility of Biden's pledge to halve US greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 during the UN climate conference taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. Republicans uniformly oppose that legislation, casting it as a dramatic expansion of government that would hurt businesses. "This is potentially a very black day for America," said Republican Representative Glenn Grothman, who characterized the legislation's child-care and preschool provisions as a "Marxist" effort to have the federal government raise children. The nonpartisan US Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the social-spending bill would raise $1.48 trillion in new tax revenue over the next decade, short of its $1.75 trillion cost. Pelosi and other top Democrats have said that fails to account for increased tax enforcement and savings from lower prescription drug prices.

---||World||US court convicts Chinese intelligence agent of economic espionage||WASHINGTON: A Chinese intelligence officer was convicted in US federal court Friday of economic espionage in an alleged state-backed effort to steal technology from US and French aerospace firms, the Justice Department said. Xu Yanjun, an official in the Jiangsu province foreign intelligence office of the Ministry of State Security, was found guilty in the Cincinnati court on two counts of conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage, and three counts related to trade secret theft. The economic espionage charges carry a maximum of 15 years in prison each and a fine of up to $5 million, while the other charges bring up to 10 years in prison each. Xu was one of 11 Chinese nationals, including two intelligence officers, named in October 2018 indictments for involvement in a five-year scheme to steal technology from Cincinnati-based GE Aviation, one of the world's leading aircraft engine manufacturers, and France's Safran Group, which was working with GE on engine development. "Xu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation's exclusive composite aircraft engine fan, which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate, to benefit the Chinese state," the Justice Department said in a statement. Xu, using various aliases, "identified experts who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China," the statement added. He was arrested in April 2018 in Belgium, where he had apparently been lured in a counter-intelligence operation -- he had planned to secretly meet a GE employee on the trip. He was extradited to the United States in October 2018 to face trial. The 2018 indictments named 10 other accomplices in the operation, including the two Jiangsu security officials -- who appear to have worked under Xu -- six hackers, and two employees of the French company. None of the 10 have been arrested. The indictments detailed efforts to use malware and phishing techniques to hack into target computers and remove data on the engines and parts. The Justice Department said at the time that a Chinese state-owned aerospace company had been trying to develop an engine like GE's for use in China-made aircraft. After Xu's arrest, China said the United States was "making something out of thin air."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-court-convicts-chinese-intelligence-agent-of-economic-espionage/articleshow/87549279.cms||---
---||India||Higher wind speed flushes out pollution in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The air quality in the national capital improved slightly on Saturday due to higher wind speed, which is expected to flush out pollutants further over the next two days, weather experts said. According to Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Sameer app, the city's air quality index (AQI) stood at 449 in the "severe" category at 8 am on Saturday. It was 462 on Friday.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  Due to rampant bursting of crackers on Diwali on Thursday despite restrictions in place, the air quality in Delhi was the poorest in five years post the festival with rise in incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states.  The city's AQI slipped to the 'severe' category on Thursday night and continued its upward trend to reach 462 at noon on Friday.  The weather office has predicted strong surface winds that will help clear out pollutants in the city's air on Saturday.  Experts said the air quality degraded to severe in Delhi-NCR due to unfavourable weather conditions - calm winds, low temperature and low mixing height - and a poisonous cocktail of emissions from firecrackers, stubble burning and local sources.  The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency, SAFAR, stated that stubble burning accounted for 36% of Delhi's PM2.5 on Friday, the highest in this season so far.  Delhi witnessed a cold morning on Saturday as the minimum temperature in the city was recorded at 14.7 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the season.  "The city will witness a partly cloudy sky with shallow to moderate fog in the morning and strong surface winds during the day," the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday.  The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 28 degrees Celsius, it said. Humidity at 8.30 am was 78%, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/higher-wind-speed-flushes-out-pollution-in-delhi/articleshow/87549841.cms||---
---||World||China spurs Taiwan anger with criminal liability threat for independence supporters||BEIJING: China will hold those who support "Taiwan independence" criminally liable for life, it said on Friday, provoking anger and ridicule from the democratic island at a time of heightened tension across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.  For the first time China was spelling out the punishment that awaits people deemed to back independence for Taiwan, top officials of the self-ruled island among them, as tension rises over what China regards as a province of its own.  China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control, despite the island's claim that it is an independent country that will defend its freedom and democracy.  The Taiwan Affairs Office named Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang, Parliament Speaker You Si-kun and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu as being "stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence", as it made public for the first time that it had drawn up a list of those falling into the category.  China will enforce punishment for those on the list by not letting them enter the mainland and its Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said in a statement on Friday.  Such blacklisted individuals will not be allowed to cooperate with entities or people from the mainland, nor will their companies, or entities which fund them, be allowed to profit from the mainland, she added.  Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council admonished China, saying Taiwan was a democratic society with rule of law and not ruled by Beijing.  "We do not accept intimidation and threats from an autocratic and authoritarian region," the council said, adding that it would take the "necessary countermeasures to safeguard the safety and well-being of the people". Zhu said the message China wanted to send to supporters of Taiwan independence was: "Those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland and split the country, will never end up well, and will be spurned by the people and judged by history."  In a Twitter post on Saturday, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, wrote, "I've received countless notes of congratulations after being blacklisted and sanctioned, for life, by the #CCP," referring to the Chinese Communist Party.  "Many are jealous for not being recognised; some ask where they can apply for it. To deserve the rare honor, I'll keep fighting for #Taiwan's freedom and democracy."  China believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-spurs-taiwan-anger-with-criminal-liability-threat-for-independence-supporters/articleshow/87549851.cms||---

This has created furore among a section of the leadership, especially the top-rung leaders, and party insiders say that the development could lead to major changes in the ruling establishment. The opposition Congress has stated that it will file an application under RTI on the Bitcoin scandal, according to its state chief D.K. Shivakumar. Sources claim that an anonymous letter contains the explosive details of the state's top BJP leaders allegedly joining hands with main accused in the Bitcoin scandal Srikrishna Ramesh aka Sriki to make money. Considering the seriousness of the issue, the PMO has suggested high level investigation as the scandal involving hacking of international banks has seriously damaged the image of the country. The sources also alleged that the accused had hacked into 'Jan Dhan project' which has 80 lakh accounts and minted money in hundreds of crores. It is also alleged that the main accused Sriki was hacking into various state government e-tender portals, including of the Irrigation Department and Upper Krishna Project, and big contractors had taken his help to bag lucrative contracts, the sources said. Sources also say that the recent IT raids across the state in which hundreds of crores of disproportionate assets were found in the preliminary investigation, is also linked to Bitcoin scandal. However, the investigation agencies have yet to confirm this. Sources also allege that an influential politician's son in state has taken the help of Sriki to transfer huge amounts of money to Mauritius. There is speculation that the party's Central leadership is thinking on major changes in the state unit following this development, and it is said that the complaint and all details are provided by the BJP insiders in Karnataka. Meanwhile, Shivakumar has again urged chief minster Basavaraj Bommai to make public the document referring the Bitcoin scandal to the Enforcement Directorate (ED). "The chief minister himself has stated that he had referred the scandal to the ED. I want him to release documents," he demanded. Sources in Congress say that leader of opposition Siddaramaiah is gathering documents on the scandal and will hold a press conference on Monday to make explosive charges against ruling BJP leaders in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnatakas-bjp-government-rattled-as-bitcoin-allegations-reach-pmo/articleshow/87550009.cms||---

Along with the brother of jailed drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, Aureliano Guzman-Loera, brothers Ruperto Salgueiro-Nevarez, Jose Salgueiro-Nevarez and Heriberto Salgueiro-Nevarez are also wanted by the United States. The four have been "charged in US indictments for violation of US drug laws, to include international conspiracies to distribute marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl," State Department Ned Price said in a statement. The highly dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl is "responsible for more than 63 percent of the 96,779 drug overdose deaths in the United States between March 2020 and 2021," Price added. The four operate under the umbrella of the federation of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's most notorious drug trafficking groups, which "El Chapo" led until his imprisonment. He was extradited in 2017 to the United States where he was sentenced to life in prison two years later in a trial held under high security. The State Department statement comes the same day as a Justice Department announcement of indictments charging the four with violating international trafficking laws. For over a decade, the United States and Mexico have worked together to fight drug trafficking under a program called the Merida Initiative, with the United States providing military firepower, technical support and security training. In October, the neighboring states agreed to overhaul their approach to address the root causes and step up efforts to curb cross-border arms smuggling. Mexico is plagued by cartel-related bloodshed that has seen more than 300,000 people murdered since the government deployed the military in the war on drugs in 2006.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-offers-up-to-5-million-reward-for-tips-to-help-capture-mexican-drug-kingpins/articleshow/87550034.cms||---

According to the state health department, compared to September, there is a slump of 40 per cent in the number of Covid vaccinations in October. The department has identified 4.87 crore beneficiaries of above 18 years of age for the same. Till November 4, as many as 4.26 crore people had got first dose. Since the state is recording lesser number of Covid cases, the people seem to have lost interest in getting themselves inoculated, according to health experts. About 60 lakh people are yet to be jabbed. The state has set a target to achieve 100 per cent vaccination by December which looks tough as the turnout for vaccinations is declining. "People have got into a relaxed mode after the lifting of restrictions undermining the importance of vaccination, they said. In August, as many as 75 lakh people were vaccinated with first dose, which increased to 78 lakh in September. However, October witnessed a drop with the number falling to 32 lakh, throwing a challenge to the health department which aims to achieve 100 per cent vaccination by December. Also, the people who have taken first dose are not getting the second. A total of 70.12 lakh people have got second dose in September in Karnataka, which dropped significantly to 57.4 lakh in October, the data shows. Before the unlock process began, people queued up and protested for non-availability of Covid vaccination. The government has made one dose of Covid vaccination mandatory for people to work in offices. Now, those who have got first jab are not keen on getting second jab,the health authorities said. Until now, 2.32 crore people have got second dose of vaccination and 1.90 crore who have got first dose are yet to take the second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-registers-40-per-cent-drop-in-covid-vaccination/articleshow/87549961.cms||---
---||India||Past hikes in excise & VAT were Modi & Khattar govts' Jizyah tax: Surjewala||CHANDIGARH: Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday dubbed the “rapid and repeated backbreaking increase” in the excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel in past as “Jizyah tax” by the Narendra Modi and M L Khattar governments at the Centre and in Haryana. Surjewala made the assertion amid various non-BJP-ruled states refusing to slash the VAT to further lower the fuel prices in the wake of the Centre lowering its excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively with various BJP-ruled states lowering VAT on them. “The rapid and repeated backbreaking increase in excise duty and State VAT on the two fuels are Jizyah Tax by Modi and Khattar governments,” he said in a statement. “In the first nine months of the year 2021 alone, petrol price was increased by Rs 28 per litre and diesel price by Rs 26 per litre. “Reduction in the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 per litre respectively is being tom-tommed as a Diwali gift. This is a clear deception,” Surjewala said in a statement here. “During the previous Congress government up till October 2014, VAT on diesel in Haryana was 8.8 per cent. “Post-reduction and even on date, VAT in Haryana is 18 per cent and additional VAT in the state is five per cent. This is a clear increase of over 100 per cent. Even after the so-called reduction of VAT on November 4, 2021, the VAT on petrol is 18.20 per cent and additional VAT is 5 per cent,” he added. “Will the duo of Khattar-Dushyant Chautala answer people for this brazen loot by their government?” he asked. The Haryana government had announced a reduction in VAT on the fuels on Thursday, making them cheaper in the BJP-JJP-ruled state by Rs 12 per litre. On Wednesday, the central government had announced a cut in the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively, bringing down their retail rates from record highs. In reality, the Khattar government does not want to pass on the benefit of reduction in crude oil prices to the people of Haryana. “The Khattar government is dishing out deceit by indulging in faking of numbers. The Haryana government has purportedly reduced the VAT on petrol by 6.5 per cent but put a rider of maximum reduction of Rs 1.12 only,” Surjewala claimed. “In the case of diesel, it is even more intriguing. The Khattar government has purportedly reduced VAT on diesel by 0.40 per cent but increased the maximum VAT amount from Rs 10.08 per litre to Rs 11.86 per litre,” he further claimed. Surjewala, who is also a former Haryana minister, asked the Khattar government to explain the reason or the logic for restricting the reduction in maximum VAT relief to Rs 1.12 per litre and increasing, instead of reducing, the maximum VAT amount on diesel by Rs 1.78 per litre. “The reason is clear – whenever the crude oil prices will fall, Khattar government will profiteer and people of Haryana will get no benefit. But if the crude oil prices were to increase, the burden of the same shall be put on the people of the state. This is particularly a draconian anti-farmer measure,” he alleged. Meanwhile, a Haryana government statement on Friday said after the state reduced VAT on petrol and diesel, the price of petrol has come down from Rs 106.94 to Rs 95.27 per litre in the entire state. Also, the diesel price has come down from Rs 98.60 to Rs 86.51. “Petrol and diesel prices are still higher in other states as compared to Haryana. In Punjab, petrol is Rs 105.02 per litre, in Delhi the price of petrol is Rs 103.97 per litre. Similarly, petrol in Himachal Pradesh is Rs 96.06 per litre,” the government statement said. “It is evident from the figures of these states that petrol and diesel are cheaper in Haryana and the people of the state are getting the benefit of the price reduction,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/past-hikes-in-excise-vat-were-modi-khattar-govts-jizyah-tax-surjewala/articleshow/87550111.cms||---

The aircraft, which was on a flight between Morocco and Turkey, was diverted to the Mediterranean island of Mallorca on Friday due to an alleged medical emergency, the Civil Guard police force told AFP. During the evacuation of the supposedly ill traveller, about 20 passengers took the opportunity to flee while the plane was on the tarmac. Two people were arrested, the police said. Investigators were working on the hypothesis that the medical incident was staged in order to enter Spain illegally, the El Pais newspaper reported. The passenger who complained of discomfort was taken to hospital, where he was declared to be in perfect health and arrested for "assisting in illegal immigration", according to the daily. A passenger who accompanied him to the hospital had also disappeared, said the paper, which reported five people were arrested in addition to the faker. According to aircraft tracker FlightRadar24, the diverted plane was an Air Arabia Maroc Airbus A320 on a flight between Casablanca and Istanbul. Due to the security incident, 13 planes bound for Palma were rerouted to other airports, and 16 departing flights suffered significant delays, according to airport authorities. The airport reopened around midnight Friday after being closed for about four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/passengers-run-off-after-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-spain/articleshow/87550320.cms||---
---||India||Pollution not limited to northern states, everyone will have to think over it: Punjab cabinet minister||NEW DELHI: Punjab Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday said that pollution is not just limited to northern states of the country and every citizen will have to think about it. "Pollution is a global issue. It is not limited to Northern Indian states like Punjab, Haryana and Delhi and stubble burning. Both the farmers and city residents will have to think over this issue. Rather, every citizen of the country will have to think about this issue," said the minister. His comments come after farmers in Amritsar on November 5 demanded a compensation of Rs 7,000 per acre from the state government to control stubble burning in their fields. "We demanded 7000 Rs per acre to handle the stubble burning. But the government has not given us that money. No farmer wants to set the stubble on fire. If the government does not want to give us the subsidy, they can take the stubble from us," a farmer had said. Stubble burning is a process of setting on fire the straw stubble, left after the harvesting of grains, like paddy, wheat, etc. The process of burning farm residue is one of the major causes of air pollution in parts of north India, deteriorating the air quality around this time of the year. Combing with vehicular emission, it adversely affects the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the national capital. The Air Quality Index of Delhi continues to remain in the 'severe' category, informed the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research on Saturday. As per SAFAR's analysis at 6 am today, Delhi's overall air quality was found to be in the 'severe' category with the overall AQI standing at 533.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pollution-not-limited-to-northern-states-everyone-will-have-to-think-over-it-punjab-cabinet-minister/articleshow/87549264.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Sameer app, the city's air quality index (AQI) stood at 449 in the severe category at 8am on Saturday. It was 462 on Friday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Due to rampant bursting of crackers on Diwali on Thursday despite restrictions in place, the air quality in Delhi was the poorest in five years post the festival with rise in incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states. The city's AQI slipped to the 'severe' category on Thursday night and continued its upward trend to reach 462 at noon on Friday. The weather office has predicted strong surface winds that will help clear out pollutants in the city's air on Saturday. Experts said the air quality degraded to severe in Delhi-NCR due to unfavourable weather conditions calm winds, low temperature and low mixing height and a poisonous cocktail of emissions from firecrackers, stubble burning and local sources. The ministry of earth sciences' air quality forecast agency, SAFAR, stated that stubble burning accounted for 36 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 on Friday, the highest in this season so far. Delhi witnessed a cold morning on Saturday as the minimum temperature in the city was recorded at 14.7 degree Celsius, normal for this time of the season. The city will witness a partly cloudy sky with shallow to moderate fog in the morning and strong surface winds during the day, the India meteorological department (IMD) said on Saturday. The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 28 degree Celsius, it said. Humidity at 8.30am was 78 per cent, the IMD said. Weather scientists said the fog/smog condition has improved in Delhi-NCR as forecasted. There was shallow fog and visibility remained in the 600 to 800 metre range reported at Delhi's two airports from 5.30am to 9.30am, weather office said. “Due to westerly to northwesterly winds set in and have also reached a speed 8 to 15kmph and some humidity reduction or moisture dry up,” it said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/higher-wind-speed-flushes-out-pollution-in-delhi/articleshow/87550479.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Petrol, diesel to cost less after Centre, state cut tax||BHUBANESWAR: The cost of petrol and diesel has become cheaper in the twin cities after the state government reduced VAT on fuel by Rs 3 per litre following the Centre’s decision to cut excise duty. From Friday midnight, petrol in the twin cities will cost Rs 101.88/litre while diesel will come for Rs 91.51/litre. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday announced reduction of VAT on fuel, becoming the first non-NDA state to cut tax. A day before, the Centre had announced reduction in excise duty of petrol by Rs 10/litre and diesel by Rs 5. An official source said the decision to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel would cost the state exchequer Rs 1400 crore per annum. Besides loss of revenue, the state is also going to lose around Rs 700 crore in view of reduction of excise duty by the Centre. Hence, the total loss to the state exchequer on account of reduction in VAT is approximately Rs 2,100 crore, said a finance department official. The decision to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel has been taken to provide relief to the public from rising fuel prices, said the official. Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Tripura, Karnataka, Mizoram, Haryana, Gujarat, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are among the states which have slashed VAT on petrol and diesel. Major non-NDA ruled states which had mounted pressure on the Centre to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel are yet to reduce VAT. In May last year, the state government had hiked VAT on petrol from 26% to 32% and diesel from 26% to 28% with an aim to increase revenue base in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The dip in fuel prices after reduction of excise duty and VAT by the Centre and the state government has come as a sigh of relief for the consumers. “We appreciate the decision of both the Centre and state to cut tax. But the price of petrol and diesel need to be reduced further for the benefit of the public. Increase in diesel price has a cascading effect on essential commodities. Both the Centre and states should come up with a concrete solution to deal with it,” said Rati Ranjan, a professional based in the city. The Congress continued to attack the Centre and state, terming the reduction in excise duty and VAT on fuel not adequate. The BJD, which had decided to launch a statewide agitation from Friday on rising fuel price, has decided to postpone it for 10 days and urged the Centre to reduce the price of LPG. The BJP, meanwhile, said the state government should cut more VAT as states governed by the saffron party have reduced it by Rs 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/petrol-diesel-to-cost-less-after-centre-state-cut-tax/articleshow/87550615.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi

Calling for ramping up financial support and making adaptation a priority, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in its ‘Adaptation Gap Report 2021’, released at the UN climate conference COP26, said the costs of adaptation was estimated to be at the higher end of $140-300 billion per year by 2030 and $280-500 billion per year by 2050. Read AlsoDeveloping countries may need $300 billion annually by 2030 for adapting to face climate changeGLASGOW: At a time when affluent nations have not even delivered on their promised $100 billion per year of climate finance, a report of UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on Thursday called for ramping up financial support and said the annual costs of adaptation may actually be three times moreIn contrast, climate finance flowing to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation planning and implementation reached merely $79.6 billion in 2019. Though affluent nations, being historical polluters, had in 2009 promised to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020, they have, so far, not delivered on it. In fact, their ‘climate finance delivery’ plan, released on October 25, has stated that the developed countries could mobilise that much of finance only three years later (by 2023). Questioning this gap, Modi while delivering his speech at the summit on Monday said, “Promises made till date regarding climate finance have proved to be hollow... The world’s ambitions on climate finance cannot remain the same as they were at the time of the Paris Agreement”. Read AlsoPM Modi resists 2050 net-zero goal pressure, commits to 2070India on Monday committed to become a ‘carbon neutral’ country through a ‘net zero’ goal by 2070 with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing this major target at UN climate conference (COP26) and appealing to world leaders to make ‘lifestyle change’ issue a global movement – World LIFE - by“Today, when India has resolved to move forward with a new commitment and a new energy, the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies have become more important. India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest.” He also spoke about monitoring the track record of developed countries on delivering climate finance as promised by them way back in 2009. The report also found that the opportunity to use the fiscal recovery from the pandemic to prioritise green economic growth that may help nations adapt to climate impacts is largely being missed. So far, $16.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed around the globe, but only a small portion of this funding has targeted adaptation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/countering-climate-change-in-developing-world-could-cost-5-10-times-more-than-current-fund-flows/articleshow/87550038.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Bhubaneswar||Bhubaneswar flouts cracker time limit||BHUBANESWAR: Residents of the capital city on Thursday allegedly flouted the 8pm-10pm limit set by the government for bursting of firecrackers on Diwali, setting off fireworks well before and after the scheduled time. While last year’s Diwali amid the pandemic saw almost no cracker-related waste, this year the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) had to deal with a huge quantity of such garbage despite the government’s norms to use only green crackers. The accumulation of waste bears testimony to the fact how people have violated the norms and kept bursting crackers. Last year during Diwali (the first amid the Covid-19 pandemic), the BMC didn’t have to deal with tonnes of additional waste a day after the festival as the sale and use of crackers was banned. Apart from stray instances of bursting of crackers, the capital city didn’t witness such activity amid the pandemic like it did in the previous years. “Since last year there was a ban on bursting of crackers, the city generated usual municipal waste. But this time, the waste is slightly more due to crackers. We are yet to measure the exact difference in waste load compared to normal days,” said BMC deputy commissioner Suvendu Sahu. BMC sources said although the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) is yet to come out with the pollution level post-Diwali, there was visibly more pollution in the ambient air. On a normal day, the BMC has to handle around 600 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste generated from the city. There must have been a rise in an additional 100 metric tonnes waste load for the BMC sanitation team on Friday, sources said. “Since green crackers were allowed, people became complacent and bought several varieties of crackers from clandestine sources. Last year, they were not able to celebrate and that was the reason why they were a bit more enthusiastic this time,” said a BMC officer. BMC additional commissioner Laxmikanta Sethi said enforcement was carried out to regulate cracker sale. “We haven’t received any specific complaint of people violating cracker sale norms. However, it will be looked into if people have violated the timing norms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bhubaneswar-flouts-cracker-time-limit/articleshow/87550653.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

---||Bhubaneswar||Cyber crooks cheat trader of 30L with promise to install mobile tower||BHUBANESWAR: A businessman of Deogarh district lost over Rs 30 lakh to cyber fraudsters, who cheated him on the pretext of installing a Jio mobile phone tower on his property. The cyber police station of the state Crime Branch in Cuttack has started an investigation following a complaint lodged by Sanjay Kumar Dalabehera, the victim, recently. Dalabehera received an anonymous call on November 6, 2019 where the caller introduced himself as a senior executive of Reliance Jio. The caller inquired whether Dalabehera owned around 400 sq ft land and lured him by promising big money if he gave his land on rent for setting up a mobile phone tower. Dalabehera evinced interest when the fraudster assured him of getting Rs 15 lakh lumpsum rent and offered a job to any of his family member in Reliance Jio. The anonymous caller asked Dalabehera to send document of the land (mobile tower site), Aadhaar card, PAN card and his bank account. The conman asked Dalabehera to pay advance money of Rs 10,000 towards getting a commercial licence for setting up of the mobile tower. Without verifying the credentials of the caller, Dalabehera paid Rs 10,000 on November 7, 2019. Subsequently, the cyber crooks kept on demanding money from him towards registration fees, tender filing, tender clearance, file verification fees, anti-pollution certificate, billing charges, attachment fees, transport charges, Covid clearance fees, Income Tax and GST charges. Strangely, an unsuspecting Dalabehera complied with their instructions every time. “The victim had neither seen the caller nor met him for the business deal. But he transferred Rs 30.47 lakh on different dates to some bank accounts shared by the accused. After realising that he was cheated, he lodged a complaint with us,” an officer of the cyber police station said. During investigation and verification of the bank accounts of the receivers, the police have come to know that the accused belonged to Assam and West Bengal. Police said efforts were on to identify the accused. In July this year, Jagatpur police in Cuttack arrested two persons from Kolkata for allegedly cheating a businessman of Rs 39 lakh by luring him to set up a Jio mobile tower on his land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cyber-crooks-cheat-trader-of-30l-with-promise-to-install-mobile-tower/articleshow/87550735.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The family suspects that the minor was taken away by a leopard while he was playing with his younger brother outside the house, a forest official said on Friday. Wildlife officials launched a search operation for Yog Raj around 11pm after the family informed the police. However, they have not found any evidence showing that the child was taken away by a leopard or any other wild animal. Divisional forest officer (wildlife), Shimla, N Ravishankar said the Rapid Rescue Team (RRT) of the forest department has not found any evidence about the involvement of a wild animal so far.

Once a champion of a Covid-zero strategy to manage the pandemic, the country of 25 million has moved towards living with the virus through extensive vaccinations, as the Delta variant has proven too infectious to suppress. "Another, magnificent milestone, Australia," Morrison said in a video post on Facebook. "That's four out of five, how good is that? This has been a true Australian national effort." While vaccinations remain voluntary on the federal level, Australia's states and territories introduced mandatory measures for many occupations and workers. The unvaccinated are barred from many activities, such as dining out or concerts. On Monday, Australia eased international border curbs for the first time during the pandemic, but only for vaccinated people from highly inoculated states. Media said about 3,000 people gathered for a peaceful protest against vaccine mandate protests in Melbourne, the capital of the southeastern state of Victoria, which spent nearly nine months in six lockdowns through the pandemic. Australia has seen frequent, occasionally violent anti-vaccine rallies during the past few months, but the movement remains small, with polls showing the numbers of those who oppose vaccinations are in the single digits across the nation. The nationwide vaccination figure incorporates some uneven levels, however. Nearly 90% of eligible people have been fully vaccinated in the most populous state of New South Wales, and almost 95% in the capital Canberra, but this figure drops to just 65% in the sparsely populated Northern Territory and Western Australia. The country recorded 1,558 infections and 10 deaths on Saturday, with the majority of infections in Victoria. Some parts of the Northern Territory are in a snap, three-day lockdown, after an outbreak grew to three cases. Despite the Delta outbreaks that led to months of lockdown in the two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, the national tally of less than 179,000 infections and 1,587 deaths is far lower than that of many developed nations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australia-hits-magnificent-milestone-with-80-rate-of-vaccinations/articleshow/87550823.cms||---

---||World||At least 8 dead, many injured at Texas music festival||HOUSTON: At least eight people died and numerous others were injured in what officials described as a surge of the crowd at the Astroworld music festival in Houston while rapper Travis Scott was performing. Officials declared a ``mass casualty incident'' just after 9 pm Friday during the festival where an estimated 50,000 people were in attendance, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena told reporters at a news conference. ``The crowd began to compress towards the front of the stage, and that caused some panic, and it started causing some injuries,'' the fire chief said. ``People began to fall out, become unconscious, and it created additional panic.'' The show was called off shortly thereafter. The fire chief said ``scores of individuals'' were injured. Officials transported 17 people to hospitals, including 11 who were in cardiac arrest, Pena said. Many people were also treated at the scene at NRG Park, where a field hospital had been set up. About 300 people were examined at that site throughout the day, he said. Astroworld is a two-day music festival that was scheduled to take place Friday and Saturday in Houston. The event was sold out, according to the Astroworld website. Saturday's performances have been canceled. Drake joined Travis Scott on-stage at the concert _ which was live-streamed by Apple Music _ and posted photos to Instagram after the performance. Event promoters had arranged for medical units to be on scene at the festival, however once the crowd surge began, those units were ``quickly overwhelmed,'' Pena said. Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite was near the front of the crowd and said it seemed the surge ``happened all at once.'' ``Suddenly we had several people down on the ground, experiencing some type of cardiac arrest or some type of medical episode,'' Satterwhite said. ``And so we immediately started doing CPR, and moving people right then, and that's when I went and met with the promoters, and Live Nation, and they agreed to end early in the interest of public safety.'' Pena said officials did not immediately know the causes of death for the eight people who died. A medical examiner would investigate. It wasn't clear whether all eight who died were among the 17 that had been transported to hospitals. The deceased had not been identified as of early Saturday. Officials set up a reunification center at a hotel for family members who had not been able to reach relatives who had been in attendance at the event. Authorities were looking to connect families with festivalgoers who were transported to the hospital, ``some as young as 10'' years old, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner called for calm and urged people not to jump to conclusions as to what caused the surge. ``I think it's very important that none of us speculate. Nobody has all the answers tonight,'' Finner said. He added that there have been several rumors surrounding the event that authorities would look into. ``We're going to do an investigation and find out because it's not fair to the producers, to anybody else involved, until we determine what happened, what caused the surge,'' he said. ``We don't know, but we will find out.'' The Associated Press reached out to a representative for Scott but did not immediately hear back. Finner told reporters that Scott and the event promoters cooperated with police. The deadly surge was the most deaths at a US concert since the 2003 Station nightclub fire that killed 100 people in Rhode Island. Eleven people died and about two dozen were injured in 1979 at a concert for The Who as thousands of fans tried to get into Cincinnati's riverfront coliseum.

---||Guwahati||Lumding forest eviction drive from Monday on Gauhati high court orders||GUWAHATI: Acting on orders of Gauhati high court, the Assam government will carry out an eviction drive in Lumding reserve forest in Nagaon district in phases from Monday, but to avoid any unwanted situation like that in Darrang district last September, the government is counselling the settlers to leave on their own. The reserve forest is spread over 22,403 hectares of land out which 1410 hectres are under encroachment at present. Hojai divisional forest officer Gaunadeep Das said the first phase of the eviction drive will take place on Monday and Tuesday on about 500 hectares of land in the reserve forest. "There are around 3,000 people living on the 1,410 hectares of land. The district administration as well as the forest department have counselled the people. A few families have understood the fact and left the place. Efforts are on to make the remaining families understand the facts," Das added. Two civilians, including a 12-year-old child were killed in police firing at Dholpur in Darrang district on September 23 when villagers attacked the police and officials of district administration during the eviction drive. Special director general of police (law and order) GP Singh along with Hojai deputy commissioner Anupam Choudhury, superintendent of police Barun Purkayastha along with other top officials visited the area to take stock of the situation on Friday. Talking to the media, Singh said, "There is a high court order to make the reserve forest encroachment-free. We went there to take stock. Around 80% of the families already have their home at different places of the state. But they came here and settled here for agriculture purposes." Gauhati high court had passed the eviction order on September 14, while hearing a petition filed by BJP leader Shiladitya Dev. The state had submitted before the court that the eviction drive would be carried out in phases to make the forest encroachment-free. It may be mentioned that the state government on Wednesday, during a hearing of a batch of PILs on eviction carried out at Dholpur in Assam's Darrang district in September, said it would not take any coercive action against any person it seeks to evict, unless it is compelled to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/lumding-forest-eviction-drive-from-monday-on-gauhati-high-court-orders/articleshow/87551115.cms||Mukut Das

"Sidhu's repeated utterances seek to derail the efforts of the Punjab government to ensure justice in the drugs matter and the sacrilege cases," Deol said in a statement. Sidhu had opposed the appointment of state Advocate General APS Deol and Director General of Police Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and indicated that these two appointments were part of the reason he quit. "Navjot Singh Sidhu is obstructing the functioning of the government and the office of AG," Deol said. "There is a concerted attempt by vested interests to malign the functioning of Congress Party in view of upcoming elections in Punjab for their selfish political gain by politicising the constitutional office of the Advocate General of Punjab," he added. Deol had represented former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, who headed the state police six years ago during the incidents of sacrilege and a police firing on protesters. Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said he has withdrawn his resignation as the party's Punjab chief but declared that he will not re-assume charge till the state's new advocate general is removed. Even while announcing that he is taking back his resignation as Punjab Pradesh Congress president, Sidhu continued to target the new Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government in the state. Sidhu said all he was asking was what the Channi government has done in the past 50 days on the sacrilege case and on making a special task force report on drug cases public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-is-spreading-misinformation-punjab-advocate-general-aps-deol/articleshow/87551293.cms||---

The incident happened around 1.30am on Friday when the thieves seated in the i20 arrived at Noor Communication showroom in Saifi market in Greater Noida’s Surajpur area and allegedly cut the six locks and a channel attached to join the shutter. Possible professionals, the accused allegedly uprooted the DVR of the CCTV set up before escaping from the spot. At least some of the accused who got down from the i20 and orchestrated the theft have been caught on CCTV cameras installed at some other buildings around the showroom. In one of the CCTV footages, at least three accused can be seen arriving inside the lane a few meters away from the showroom a few minutes after a police patrolling vehicle leaves the spot. The accused can be seen speeding over a pothole making the showroom owners suspect that they might be well known to the area. “They simply arrived there a minute after the police patrol van left. They stopped at some distance and two persons have been caught on camera doing all the movement. One of them was talking on the phone while another could be seen moving around with a bag,” Imran’s younger brother Irfan told TOI. Irfan said that while the presence of three suspects was clear, they suspect that there could be more than four persons involved in the theft. “They have taken away around 600 mobiles of Samsung, Redmi, One Plus, Vivo, Techno, Oppo, Redmi, RealMe, Intel, etc. They have even taken out stuff from inside the drawers. It does not seem possible to escape with so much in one vehicle,” he said. Imran said that the accused opened the cash counter and took out Rs 6 lakh cash which was kept inside the same. “In all, I have suffered a loss of about Rs 2.5 crore,” he said. There are as many as eight cameras installed inside and outside the showroom but the accused simply fled with the DVR. Cops suspect insiders’ handAfter the information of the theft was reported to police, a forensic team reached the spot and took away the broken locks. Cops suspect an insider’s role in the incident and have detained some four-five youths including workers of the showroom. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said that the way the crime has been orchestrated, it seems difficult to execute the same. “We have asked the owner to give the exact numbers of the missing items. The thieves seem to be well aware of the area and the spot,” he said. The Surajpur Police has lodged an FIR in the case under IPC section 379 (theft).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-armed-thieves-break-into-mobile-showroom-flee-with-600-new-handsets-cash-worth-rs-2-5-crore/articleshow/87551425.cms||Shikha Salaria

With a couple of senior former Congress MLAs of the state returning to the legislative assembly as BJP legislators after the recent byelections, there is speculation of an expansion of the BJP-led ministry. "Not thinking of a ministry expansion at this moment. A team (current ministry) is working. Let the government complete one year and then I will think of it," Sarma said. The 14-member ministry of the BJP-led alliance was sworn in on May 10 last and Sarma still has the liberty to fill up maximum four more berths. The ministry includes 11 members from BJP, two from ally AGP and one from other ally UPPL Article 164(1A) says that the total number of ministers in a state cannot not exceed 15 per cent of the total number of members of its legislative assembly. Going by this formula, Assam, which has 126 members in the assembly, can have maximum 18 ministers, including the chief minister. On Wednesday, the government appointed 36 new chairmen, chairperson, vice-chairman, member secretaries and deputy advisors of various government departments, corporations and state-owned companies. All of them are leaders from BJP, AGP and UPPL. Sarma said the new appointments have been made "with the objective to make these companies and corporations profit-making entities and ensure and are able to pay their employees their salaries." "I will be sitting with all of them next month and discuss ways and means of turning around these companies," Sarma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/not-thinking-of-expanding-ministry-till-may-next-year-says-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/87551744.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Centre is at the wheel, we are being taken for a ride, says FM||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finance minister K N Balagopal has dismissed demands that state government should forgo a portion of its share on tax on fuel to make petroleum products more affordable in the state. Such a call was not only unviable and untimely but also founded on false grounds, he said. “First, there is no logic behind the demand that Kerala should forgo the tax share in reaction to the reduction announced by the Centre. The Centre collects more tax per litre of fuel than the state. Secondly, it’s wrong to say there was no additional price reduction in Kerala. When the Centre slashed diesel and petrol prices by Rs 10 and Rs 5, the effective reduction in Kerala is Rs 12.30 and Rs 6.56 respectively. The additional reduction is the Kerala government's contribution. We don’t need to make further reductions as the central government is primarily responsible for the high price," he told reporters. Balagopal said it is high time that the states think about the propriety and right of the Centre in collecting hefty tax/surcharge by using a constitutional provision meant for resource mobilisation during emergency situations. Explaining the tax system, he said unlike the Oommen Chandy government, the LDF government never tried to make additional revenue by increasing the state tax rate when the Centre reduced prices. "Some political leaders talk as if the cascading benefit (of Rs 2.30 and Rs1.56) passed on to people in Kerala is a natural phenomenon. It’s not so. The additional benefit has percolated to the market only because the state government decided not to make tax revision to maintain the tax flow to the exchequer," he said. While the Centre collects Rs 32.9 and Rs 31.8 per litre of diesel and petrol sold in the state, Kerala collects 30.08% tax per litre of diesel and 22.76% tax per litre of petrol. This being the fact, it's natural that the fuel price in Kerala will come down once the Centre reduces the tax or the price. "There is no need for the state to make an additional cut in tax. The Chandy government had raised tax on fuel13 times to offset the benefit of price reduction by the Centre. At the same time, the LDF government had slashed the tax rate on petrol and diesel in June 2018. At that time, it did cost the exchequer Rs 5.09 crore," Balagopal said. Considering the subsequent fuel price rise, the state government has granted a reprieve to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore till date,” Balagopal said. The slump in tax revenue due to the current price cut will be more than Rs 500 crore during the current fiscal. It will increase to Rs 1,000 crore next year. “The state government may not be able to run the social welfare schemes if it makes additional cuts in the tax on fuel,” he said. The minister also said Kerala was one of the few states that did not impose more tax on petroleum products during the Covid-19 pandemic. States like UP, Goa, Haryana, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka had increased the fuel price for additional resource mobilisation, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-is-at-the-wheel-we-are-being-taken-for-a-ride-says-fm/articleshow/87551918.cms||---

"He told the district administration officials to try and achieve 100% vaccination in the state before Christmas, as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent virtual review meeting with chief ministers. He also set the vaccination target of 9 lakh doses in the state in the next 40 days," said an official.

The landing price of fuel in Kerala thus already includes the central government’s duty or cess. Hence, a cut in fuel price by the Centre will result in two factors – a reduced price for the consumer and a decline in the state’s revenue Just for illustration, the price of petrol worth Rs 1,000 will attract a state sales tax of 30%, which is Rs 300. Thus, petrol worth Rs 1,000 will cost Rs 1,300 when it reaches the consumer. And when the central government brings down the price of petrol from Rs 1,000 to Rs 900, the state tax imposed on it will be 30% of Rs 900, which is Rs 270. Hence the final price will be Rs 1,170 when that quantity of petrol reaches the consumer. The finance minister’s claim that the petroleum prices have been slashed at the state level is wrong. The only slashing done was by the central government and the state has only transferred that benefit to the customers. The Union government, meanwhile, had suggested that in order to bring down the prices further, the states could reduce their own taxes from the current level of 30% to 27.5%. The Kerala finance minister is not willing to do this as it will affect the finances of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/why-fuel-price-wouldnt-go-down-further-in-kerala/articleshow/87551951.cms||Shenoy Karun

The incident happened around 10pm on Thursday when the youths identified as Sunil, Anil and Gopal were bursting crackers in front of Rajveer’s general store. When Rajveer objected to the same, the youths had a fight with him and started hurling abuses at him. They allegedly told him that they will burst crackers there itself and asked him if the area belonged to his father. After an argument ensued, the youths left for their home but after some time, they returned with some more supporters. “Sunil and Gopal returned with their friend Rajkumar, Anil and the Rajkumar’s father Shri Prasad. They got together and started to burst crackers outside Rajveer’s house,” phase III SHO Vivek Trivedi said. Upon this, Rajveer came out of his house and confronted the accused. Rajveer’s sister-in-law Anju told mediapersons that when Rajveer objected to the accused bursting crackers, they did not listen to him. “They asked if the area belonged to their father and started abusing him. Since my brother-in-law was getting agitated, we brought him inside the house. My son went out to fetch milk and returned since the youths continued to burst crackers and hurl abuses. I asked him not to go out,” she said. After Rajveer came out of the house to confront them again, the youths allegedly again hurled abuses at him. This agitated Rajveer’s family and his nephew Vineet and brother Lokpal too joined him outside the house. In a bid to support his uncle, Vineet and Lokpal attacked Sunil, Gopal, Anil, Rajkumar and the latter’s father Shripal with sticks. “The youths along with Rajkumar’s father were badly beaten up. This infuriated Rajkumar who brought his licensed pistol and resorted to firing. While one gunshot was fired in the air, Rajkumar shot another one which hit Vineet in the lower abdomen,” Trivedi said. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said that the fight started over bursting of crackers and snowballed into a violent tussle. “The youth was rushed to the Kailash hospital where he continues to recuperate. Rajkumar and Gopal have been arrested,” he said, adding that Shripal, Anil and Sunil remain absconding. Vineet’s cousin Atul told TOI that he continues to be in a critical condition. An FIR has been lodged in the case against Rajkumar, Shripal, Anil and Gopal under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace). --||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-fight-over-bursting-crackers-snowballs-into-violent-dispute-26-year-old-shot/articleshow/87552013.cms||Shikha Salaria

The victory flame has travelled almost over a year throughout the cities and villages across the country, including the native places of Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra awardees of 1971 War. It would formally be received with full military honours at 57 Mountain Artillery Brigade on Saturday after Vijay Prarikrama in the city. The Artillery Brigade has organised a commemorative event in the city, including a cultural show, combined forces brand display, 1971 War gallery and military equipment display along with felicitation of Veer Naris and veterans of Bangladesh Liberation War. The victory flame will bid adieu to Agartala on November 9 after it was honoured by 21 Assam Rifles, BSF, CRPF and state police. The arrival of victory torch in Agartala was marked by the wreath-laying ceremony wherein homage was paid to the martyrs of 1971 war by civil military dignitaries at Albert Ekka War Memorial here. Lance Naik Ekka was martyred in the battle of Gangasagar, near Agartala along the Indo-Bangladesh border during Indo-Pak war. The army officials said Agartala was the hub of strategic planning for '71 Liberation War. Pakistani forces had set Agartala as the target, barely days before they surrendered before Indian army. Agartala was the launch pad for Operation Cactus Lilly and the epicentre of military and political planning for the war. "The valiant act of Lance Naik Ekka and his team had saved Agartala from Pakistani forces. The fearless and spirited people of the state worked as fighters, provided inputs about enemy locations and were helping Indian forces besides providing shelter and assistance to the displaced brethren from East Pakistan," the army statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/victory-torch-of-1971-war-reaches-agartala-homage-paid-to-martyrs/articleshow/87552066.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Prices of petrol and diesel have been seeing an upward trend over the past few weeks. The prices of the two petroleum products reduced after Centre announced a cut in excise duty of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively. Subsequently, several states and union territories reduced Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. Meanwhile, Punjab, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are yet to take a decision. Taking to Twitter, Badal said, "Akali workers today conducted a political surgical strike on CM Charanjit Channi by succeeding in gherao of his residence despite garrisoning of MLA flats & multiple barricading. Akali Dal has sent a clear message to CM - stop photo-ops and fulfil promises made to Punjabis." He further said, "This corrupt Congress government and it's CM who is only interested in loot and scoot lathi-charged peaceful Akali workers raising voice of farmers demanding compensation of Rs 50,000/acre for cotton growers and reduction in State VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 10/Ltr in front of CM residence." Badal also tweeted saying: "Akali workers also took on Gandhi family & demanded it stop protecting Cong leaders like #JagdishTytler who conducted '84 genocide besides asking Charanjit Channi why he agreed to elevation of Tytler. I thank our brave workers who resolved to continue to fight rights of Pbis (Punjabis)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sad-chief-leaders-workers-protest-outside-punjab-cms-residence-over-petrol-diesel-prices/articleshow/87550617.cms||---
