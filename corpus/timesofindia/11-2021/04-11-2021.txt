This is the third hooch poisoning case in the state within 11 days. Four persons were killed in Siwan on October 24 and eight more were killed at Saraiyya in Muzaffarpur on October 28 and October 29. In the Gopalganj incident, at least four persons are ill after poisonous hooch consumption and they are undergoing treatment at government hospital. They had complained of nausea, stomach ache, vomiting and other ailments typical to poisonous hooch consumption, as per authorities. Gopalganj DM Nawal Kishore Choudhary, SP Anand Kumar and other senior authorities rushed to Mohammadpur with medical teams soon after deaths came to light on Wednesday morning. SP Kumar said that medical survey is going on in Mohammadpur and neighbouring villages to identify those who are ill. “Medical assistance is being provided to them. it is during the survey that we came to know about the four persons who were ill from hooch consumption,” he said. SP said that those who had died from poisonous liquor consumption are Santosh Sah, Chote Lal Soni, Chote Lal Prasad and one Mukesh Ram. “The deaths had started taking place from late Tuesday night. Post-mortem of all four bodies is under process of being conducted one after another and viscera would be preserved for further analysis,” he said. SP said that they all had consumed liquor at the house of deceased Mukesh and one Chotu Ram at Chamari Tola in Mohammadpur on Tuesday night. He said that three persons have been arrested and at least 36 pouches of liquor have been seized by police from both houses. “The arrested persons are being interrogated. Several more are evading arrest for whom raids are going on. Separate teams have been formed for it,” he said. Kumar said that Mukesh’s brother Sunil Ram was arrested with 31 litre of liquor in September and he is presently behind bars. “Chotu’s father Nagendra Ram and brother Ramanand Ram are also involved in liquor smuggling. We are trying to ascertain the source from where liquor was brought,” SP said. He said that medical teams are still deployed in the village and neighbouring areas tracing any ill person. He said police conducted massive raids in neighbouring police station areas of Mohammadpur too leading to liquor seizure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/poisonous-hooch-claims-four-more-lives-in-gopalganj-three-arrested/articleshow/87514352.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||World||Federal Reserve to begin slowing economic aid as inflation worries rise||WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve will begin dialing back the extraordinary economic aid it's provided since the pandemic erupted last year, a response to high inflation that now looks likely to persist longer than it did just a few months ago. In a statement Wednesday after its latest policy meeting, the Fed said it will start reducing its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases in the coming weeks, by $15 billion a month, though it reserved the right to change that pace. Those purchases have been intended to hold down long-term interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending. With the economy recovering, that's no longer needed. The Fed will slow its $80 billion in Treasury purchases by $10 billion a month and its $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion in November and December and said similar reductions ``will likely be appropriate'' in the following months. That suggests that the central bank might decide to accelerate its pullback in bond buying if inflation worsens. If the pace is maintained, the bond purchases would end altogether in June. At that point, the Fed could decide to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, which affects many consumer and business loans. That would be much earlier than Fed officials had envisioned last summer, when they collectively forecast that the first rate hike wouldn't happen until late 2023. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, market traders now expect at least two rate hikes during 2022. The changing expectations reflect a central bank that is rapidly shifting from an effort to boost the economy and encourage more hiring to one that is increasingly focused on rising inflation. Prices jumped in September from a year earlier at the fastest pace in three decades. The Fed now faces the delicate task of winding down its low-rate policies, which it hopes will slow inflation, without doing that so rapidly as to weaken the job market or even cause another recession. In its statement Wednesday, the Fed slightly altered its long-standing language on inflation to raise the possibility that high prices could prove longer-lasting. Previously, it had said inflation was ``elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors,`` notably supply shortages as the economy has swiftly recovered from the recession. Now, it says, elevated inflation largely reflects ``factors that are expected to be transitory.'' That change echoes recent shifts in Chair Jerome Powell's public remarks, in which he has acknowledged that inflation has endured longer than expected and that risks of higher inflation remain. At the same time, the Fed's latest statement suggested that the officials still think shortages of materials and labor are major factors in the rise in inflation _ factors that would presumably ease over time. ``Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy,`` the statement said, ``have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.'' The economy has steadily recovered from the pandemic recession, although growth and hiring stumbled in the July-September quarter, partly because a surge in delta cases discouraged many people from traveling, shopping and eating out. Many economists say they're hopeful that with vaccinations increasing and the delta wave fading, job growth will pick up in October from September's weak pace. The October jobs report will be released Friday. Last week, the government reported that prices surged 4.4% in September from a year earlier _ the fastest 12-month increase since 1991. Yet while inflation is running hot, the job market isn't back to full strength. The unemployment rate was 4.8% in September, above its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. And roughly 5 million fewer people have jobs now than did before the pandemic. That puts Fed officials, particularly Powell, in a bind: They might want to keep their benchmark short-term interest rate at nearly zero, where it has been pegged since last March, to boost the economy and encourage more hiring. But they are facing growing pressure, including from Republican lawmakers in Congress, to rein in rising prices, which are offsetting much of the benefit that many Americans have enjoyed from recent wage increases. Wages and salaries soared in the July-September period by the most in at least 20 years. That suggested that workers are increasingly able to compel higher pay from businesses that are desperate to fill a near-record number of open jobs. But the gain was largely offset by rising inflation. And large pay increases can drive up inflation further if companies raise prices to cover their higher costs. The Fed's meeting occurred as Powell's future as Fed chair remains uncertain. President Joe Biden has yet to announce whether he will re-nominate Powell for another four-year term. Powell's current term expires in early February, but previous presidents have usually announced such decisions in the late summer or early fall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/federal-reserve-to-begin-slowing-economic-aid-as-inflation-worries-rise/articleshow/87516281.cms||---
---||Business||Federal Reserve unveils bond-buying 'taper,' holds to 'transitory' inflation belief||WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it will begin trimming its monthly bond purchases in November with plans to end them in 2022, but held to its belief that high inflation would prove "transitory" and likely not require a fast rise in interest rates. However, the U.S. central bank nodded to global supply difficulties as adding to inflation risks, saying that those factors "are expected to be transitory," but would need to ease to deliver the anticipated drop in inflation. "In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made," the Fed said it would start cutting its bond purchases, as was broadly expected, marking a formal shift away from policies put in place in March of 2020 to battle the sharp downturn and massive layoffs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet even in announcing a $15 billion monthly cut to its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), it did little to signal when it may begin the next phase of policy "normalization" by raising interest rates. "Economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen," the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its statement at the end of a two-day meeting, but did not change its intent to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero until inflation had hit 2% and was "on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time." Overall, the central bank said it still believed that recent high inflation would abate, but the small change in language indicated Fed officials see the process taking longer. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, has run at double the target rate since May, but officials are reluctant to change their policy outlook until it is clear that the pace of price increases won't ease on its own. The Fed instructed its market agents at the New York Fed to begin executing the reduced bond purchases in the middle of this month, but only laid out that plan for November and December. Starting in mid-November, it will buy $70 billion of Treasuries and $35 billion of MBS per month, a pace that will drop to $60 billion of Treasuries and $30 billion of MBS per month in mid-December. Policymakers, the Fed said, judge that "similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but (are) prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook." U.S. stocks gained ground following the release of the statement, with the S&P 500 index erasing a modest loss to rise 0.10%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to a session high near 1.60% and the dollar weakened against a basket of major trading partners' currencies. "They're hedging their bets, but that's not anything new, because we've heard publicly they're a little less confident that things are going to come down as quickly on the inflation side as they thought," said Joseph LaVorgna, Americas chief economist at Natixis in New York. "Along with supply disruptions, things just drag on a bit longer and the statement reflects those realities," he said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the latest statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/federal-reserve-unveils-bond-buying-taper-holds-to-transitory-inflation-belief/articleshow/87516299.cms||---

---||World||Federal Reserve's taper: How does it work?||The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. Here's a guide to why and how the Fed is cutting back on this key component of its crisis-era support and what that means for the size of its future balance sheet. What is the Fed's asset purchase program?The Fed has gobbled up trillions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) since the onset of the pandemic in a process known as quantitative easing (QE) to lower long-term interest rates, keep financial conditions loose and help spur demand, similar to the playbook used following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. It currently buys $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in housing-backed securities each month. Since it began the program, the Fed's balance sheet has swelled to $8.6 trillion from $4.4 trillion. An $8 trillion stash of Treasuries and MBS account for most of its total holdings. Why will it begin to taper those purchases?The economy, on pace to expand this year at the fastest rate since the 1980s, no longer needs such extreme measures of support and keeping them in place could do more harm than good. For example, low mortgage rates have fueled a boom in house prices, but the problems that now afflict the economy are mostly supply issues while demand, which the bond buys most directly affect, is buoyant and shows no sign of faltering. "They are doing it because the economy is really strong... The economy can stand on its own," said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. How does tapering work?The Fed announced that in mid November and December it will reduce the amount of Treasury securities purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion. It expects to continue that pace in the months ahead, meaning it would phase out the bond buys completely by next June. The Fed doesn't stop them all at once "to avoid jolting financial markets and sending (market) rates higher than they would (naturally) be," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. Officials also said they could speed up or slow the pace of purchases if need be. The expected eight-month pace of tapering is also much faster than last time, indicative of the Fed's confidence in the sharpest recovery in decades and a desire to be in a position to raise interest rates from near zero next year if inflation remains persistently high. What next for the Fed's balance sheet policy?By next June, the Fed's balance sheet will sit at just over $9 trillion, about $8.4 trillion of which will be bonds associated with multiple rounds of QE dating back to the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The question is what to do after that. Last time, the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet two years after it began to raise its main short-term interest rate, also known as the Fed funds rate, by not replacing securities as they matured. Fed watchers think the central bank will also be patient and passive this time around, not least because it reduced the balance sheet too much in 2018-19. That resulted in demand for bank reserves outstripping the Fed's supply, causing volatility in short-term money markets and a U-turn from the Fed, which was forced to increase the balance sheet again to improve financial market functioning. But it will reduce its balance sheet, right?Not necessarily. Last time around the Fed was focused on reducing its balance sheet because there was some discomfort with it as an untested policy tool. Having used their balance sheet as a main plank of policy twice since the Great Recession "officials now understand that it's going to be brought out next recession and it's going to be a tool in the toolkit," said Coronado. One option, already flagged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, would be to just hold the balance sheet steady and let the economy grow into it. As gross domestic product grows, the balance sheet would effectively shrink as a percentage of GDP, exerting less influence over time. The total balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP is now almost 36%, roughly twice what it was before the pandemic. Others are not so sure, arguing that keeping too large a permanent balance sheet could limit its effectiveness come the next recession and might sway the Fed to reduce its size again. "These numbers are big no matter how you look at them... There are reasons to think about 'normalizing' some of these policy tools over time. I do think they will probably perceive some benefits, in that it will open up greater scope for doing more quantitative easing next time," said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. What do Fed policymakers say?So far, few policymakers have weighed in decisively. Fed Governor Christopher Waller last month called for a shrinking of the balance sheet over the next couple of years by letting maturing securities roll off, similar to last time. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in September the Fed may want to keep longer-term rates low by retaining a large balance sheet, but counter that stimulus with a higher Fed funds rate. That, however, might raise the risk of an inverted yield curve, an argument for shrinking the balance sheet, George also said, neatly illustrating the conundrum Fed officials face as they ramp up discussions in the months ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/federal-reserves-taper-how-does-it-work/articleshow/87516514.cms||---

It appears, according to local sources, that 10 or more of the Poonch infiltrators have trekked down to villages in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. Shopian residents, sources said, were shocked to see well-armed terrorists hiding in forests in the area. They said some terrorists who escaped during the Poonch gun battle have even taken refuge in various villages in Shopian district. However, top Army officers said they were confident about tackling the Poonch infiltrators using a new method. According to locals, the Army is allotting new house numbers to individual hearths and recording the names and other details of those who dwell there, including the mobile phone numbers of all family members. "It makes it easy to check the backgrounds of residents and also learn the details of any visitor to the district. The allotment of house numbers to all village houses means we have to contact our informers less frequently as contacting them risks exposing them," a senior military officer deputed to the district said. "We get to know about the arrival of any guest at any house in the district with the new mechanism," he said. We appreciate the method as it also save us from daily frisking on the roads. They simply feed our house number into their mobiles and get our details," he said. According to intelligence sources, the terrorists have been instructed not to use mobile phones in south Kashmir, particularly not in Shopian district, and have been told to lay low till further instructions from their handlers across the border. DGP Dilbag Singh, meanwhile, reviewed the security scenario in south Kashmir and called for augmenting security in vulnerable places. He said operations should be stepped up to check the movement of "criminals, militants and other suspicious elements".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poonch-infiltrators-believed-to-have-trekked-down-to-shopian/articleshow/87516572.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Delhi||With Diwali treats, Indian outfits and desi décor: Diplomats set for a joyful Diwali||After celebrating Diwali virtually last year, diplomats in the city are hoping for a brighter Diwali this yearDiwali is among one of the favourite festivals of Canadian Deputy High Commissioner Amanda Strohan. Even though she had quiet celebrations last year at her home in India, it didn’t dampen her spirits. “Last year was challenging for everyone because of the pandemic, so it was a quiet celebration. Nonetheless, we enjoyed it. We decorated our home with lights, and my husband prepared a special meal. I took the opportunity to follow the celebrations that were happening in Canada and India. Last year’s Diwali gave us a chance to virtually see what was happening elsewhere and to think about the contributions that Canadians of Indian origin have made in Canada,” says Amanda. Amanda Strohan, Canadian Deputy High CommissionerShe shares that her stay in India has taught her a lot about the richness of festivals celebrated here. “I was looking forward to celebrating Indian festivals before I arrived here. I have learnt a lot about the depth and richness of festivals like Diwali. It is not just a celebration for a day, it is a long season of celebrations,” she says. The Deputy High Commissioner had shopped for Diwali in advance. “I went to Lajpat Nagar to shop for Diwali treats, presents and decorations. I am also a big fan of Sarojini Nagar, so I was happy to go there and pick up treats for Diwali. I love everything about Diwali. I love that it is the festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil, knowledge over darkness and close-mindedness. I love the traditions, preparations and energy of people – shopping, cooking, decorating. I find the lights around the city really uplifting, but if I have to choose one thing, I would pick food. I am a real lover of Indian food, and Diwali is a great opportunity to try things that I have never tried before,” she says. Amanda hopes that this festive season will provide some comfort to people who have experienced loss amid the pandemic. “Last year had been a difficult year for all of us. I like this one tradition on Diwali, where we keep our doors open to welcome good fortune. I hope that open doors remind us to open our hearts every day of the year.” ‘On Diwali, we eat, dance, and make merry as one big family at the embassy’The Australian High Commissioner has witnessed several Diwali celebrations in Australia. He says that this year he is excited to celebrate the festival with his colleagues at the embassy. “Diwali is one of the most important festivals of the year for Australians of Indian origin and other communities. What fascinates me the most is the spirit with which it is celebrated by one and all, the coming together of families and friends, houses lit up beautifully with  diyas and lights and the joyous atmosphere everywhere.” Barry O’Farrell, Australian High CommissionerHe adds, “Last year, unfortunately, Diwali was affected by the COVID protocols, but I joined my colleagues for a virtual celebration. The festival is usually celebrated with great enthusiasm and bonhomie at the High Commission. Colleagues dress up in their ethnic fineries for our annual Diwali get-together. We eat, dance and make merry as one big family,” he says. The ambassador adds, “Australia is one of the most multicultural societies in the world, including home to almost 7,00,000 Indian-Australians. During my time as the Premier, the New South Wales Parliament was specially lit up for Diwali, and an annual celebration was held. Now the famous Sydney Opera House is also lit up for Diwali. Celebrations of Indian festivals and culture is part and parcel of Australia’s way of life, thanks to the Indian diaspora. This Diwali, I will pray and hope for separated families to be able to reunite. The pandemic has made it a difficult time for families separated from their loved ones, so I hope they can all be with each other again soon.” ‘I like Diwali lights and décor, and I also like how it is also about family bonding and sharing love’Last year on Diwali, Mexican ambassador Federico Salas went on a holiday to Udaipur, and this year, too, he has planned a brief vacation in Rajasthan. The ambassador, who has been in Delhi for the last two years, says that he loves how families get together to celebrate and spend time with each other during Diwali. “My stay in India has been enlightening in many ways. India is an incredibly diverse and fantastic country. Wherever you go, there are different festivals and celebrations. At the same, there is unity in the way everyone comes together to celebrate these festivals. To some extent, it reminds me of Mexico. Like most people, I like Diwali lights and décor, but most importantly, I like how this festival is also about family bonding and sharing love,” says the ambassador, who has a keen interest in Indian textiles and weaves and loves wearing kurtas. Federico Salas, Mexican AmbassadorHe adds, “I had several Indian friends back in Indonesia when I was the ambassador there. One of them invited me to a Diwali party and asked me if I had a kurta.

The nod has been given for all those aged 18 and above but does not apply to pregnant women. The nod has come at a time when close to 20 countries have already recognised Covaxin. Recently, an official from the WHO had said the organisation trusts Indian industry, indicating that the approval was on the cards. The approval not only opens the doors of countries around the globe to use Covaxin in their immunisation programmes, but also comes as a major respite to those who had taken two doses of the vaccine but were still facing restrictions in travelling abroad. "The technical advisory group, convened by the WHO and made up of regulatory experts from around the world, has determined that the #Covaxin vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against #COVID19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks & the vaccine can be used globally. #Covaxin was also reviewed by WHO's strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation (SAGE) and recommended use of this vaccine in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above," WHO said in a tweet. Read AlsoIndia's Covaxin gets WHO approval: Who said whatNEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday approved India-made Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. The WHO decision has been welcomed by the government. Here's who said what: Bharat Biotech:  The vaccine developer, Bharat Biotech said thatOn pregnant women, the WHO said the available data was insufficient to assess its safety or efficacy and that studies in pregnant women were planned, including a pregnancy sub-study and a pregnancy registry. The emergency listing got delayed last month as the technical advisory group sought some additional clarification from Bharat Biotech for its final risk assessment. The advisory group had sought more clinical trial data from the company by gender and age groups. While it took around 90-100 days for WHO EUL for Covaxin, the UN agency maintains that it is not the only vaccine that has taken so much time to receive approval and there are others that have taken longer. Bharat Biotech had submitted its expression of interest on April 19 this year and the rolling data submission began on July 6. Bharat Biotech said with validation from the WHO, countries can now expedite their regulatory approval processes to import and administer the vaccine. Organisations such as Unicef, Pan-American Health Organisation and the GAVI COVAX facility will be able to procure the vaccine for global distribution to priority populations, ensuring equitable access. Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella said, "Validation by the WHO is a very significant step towards ensuring global access to India’s widely administered, safe, and efficacious Covaxin. The EUL will enable us to contribute to accelerating the equitable access of Covid-19 vaccine, and the access to our vaccine globally, thereby addressing the current public health emergency." The company said after kicking off expansion of its manufacturing capacities in Q1 2021, it had scaled it up to 50-55 million doses per month as of October 2021. It is now eyeing an annualised capacity of one billion doses by the end of 2021 and is also in the process of carrying out technology transfer to companies in India, the US and others.

The rise was the best in the last 12 years while the gain in investors’ wealth—in terms of BSE’s market capitalisation—was the best ever, official data showed. The year ended with BSE’s market cap at Rs 266 lakh crore ($3.6tn), which elevated India to the sixth largest market spot in the world in terms of market value. Samvat 2077—the calendar followed by mainly the trading community on Dalal Street—will go down as one of the best years in terms of returns and the regularity with which the leading indices hit new all-time highs, even though the economy struggled due to the ongoing Covid-induced pandemic, market players said. Metals, banking & financial services, and software exporters led the rally while pharma and FMCG stocks witnessed muted gains in prices. The gains came on the back of nearly Rs 1.25 lakh crore worth of net buying of stocks by foreign institutional investors, while domestic institutions, which include mutual funds, insurance companies, banks and others financial companies, were net sellers at about Rs 34,700 crore, CDSL and BSE data showed. The year will also be marked as the year when new age consumer-facing tech-enabled companies, for years being privately held by a handful of private equity-venture funds, started getting listed. The trend, often called private going public by merchant bankers and analysts, was led by food delivery company Zomato and soon followed by CarTrade. A host of such companies, that include FSN E-commerce (Nykaa), PB Fintech (Policybazaar) and One 97 Communications (PayTM), are now in various stages of going public during Samvat 2078. According to Yesha Shah, head of equity research, Samco Securities, Samvat 2077 could be termed as the year of unicorns and technology companies. Technology adoption, which was formerly limited to certain sectors, has now become mainstream, Shah wrote in a note to clients. “With the advent of e-commerce, (the) move to online prompted major alterations in sectors such as travel, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, and education. With increased internet access, smartphone penetration, and 5G modernization in India, the user base of Indian tech-driven fintech, edtech, healthtech and e-commerce start-ups is rapidly growing. This trend is backed up by India's growing list of Unicorns, which has resulted in the nation having the world's third largest start-up ecosystem. As a consequence, it was not unexpected that 2021 provided an appropriate opportunity for numerous such start-ups to make their public market debuts,” Shah wrote. The year’s rally on D Street also catapulted some Indians to the club of the richest people in the world and Asia. The list includes Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries, Gautam Adani of Adani Group and Radhakishan Damani of D-Mart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-ends-samvat-2077-38-higher-best-in-12-years/articleshow/87517498.cms||---
---||World||S African Damon Galgut wins Booker Prize for 'The Promise'||LONDON: South African writer Damon Galgut won the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction on Wednesday with ``The Promise,'' a novel about one white family's reckoning with South Africa's racist history. Galgut had been British bookmakers' runaway favorite to win the 50,000-pound ($69,000) prize with his story of a troubled Afrikaner family and its broken promise to a Black employee _ a tale that reflects bigger themes in South Africa's transition from apartheid. Galgut took the prize on his third time as a finalist, for a book the judges called a ``tour de force.'' He was previously shortlisted for ``The Good Doctor'' in 2003 and ``In a Strange Room'' in 2010, but lost both times. Despite his status as favorite, Galgut said he was ``stunned'' to win. Galgut said he was accepting the prize ``on behalf of all the stories told and untold, the writers heard and unheard, from the remarkable continent that I'm part of.'' ``Please keep listening to us _ more to come,'' he added. Historian Maya Jasanoff, who chaired the judging panel, said ``The Promise'' was a profound, forceful and succinct book that ``combines an extraordinary story, rich themes -- the history of the last 40 years in South Africa -- in an incredibly well-wrought package.'' Galgut's ninth novel traces members of the Swart family _ the word is Afrikaans for black _ haunted by an unkept promise to give their Black maid, Salome, her own house. The book is structured around a series of funerals over several decades; Galgut has said he wanted to make readers fill in the narrative gaps themselves. He is the third South African novelist to win the Booker Prize, after Nadine Gordimer in 1974 and J.M. Coetzee, who won twice, in 1983 and 1999. ``The Promise'' was selected over five other novels, including three by U.S. writers: Richard Powers' ``Bewilderment,'' the story of an astrobiologist trying to care for his neurodivergent son; Patricia Lockwood's social media-steeped novel ``No One is Talking About This'' and Maggie Shipstead's aviator saga ``Great Circle.'' The other finalists were Sri Lankan author Anuk Arudpragasam's aftermath-of-war story ``A Passage North'' and British/Somali writer Nadifa Mohamed's ``The Fortune Men,'' about a Somali man falsely accused of murder in 1950s Wales. Jasanoff said many of the shortlisted novels, including Galgut's, reflected on the relationship between past and present. ``This is a book that's very much about inheritance and legacy,'' she said of the winner. ``It's about change over a period of decades. And I think it's a book that invites reflection over the decades and invites and repays rereading.'' Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize has a reputation for transforming writers' careers and was originally open to British, Irish and Commonwealth writers. Eligibility was expanded in 2014 to all novels in English published in the U.K. The judging panel winnowed their list from 158 novels submitted by publishers. Only one British writer, Mohamed, made the final six, a fact has renewed debate in the U.K. about whether the prize is becoming U.S.-dominated. Last year there also was only one British writer on a U.S.-dominated list of finalists, Scotland's Douglas Stuart. He won the prize for ``Shuggie Bain,'' a gritty and lyrical novel about a boy coming of age in hardscrabble 1980s Glasgow. For a second year, the coronavirus pandemic has scuttled the prize's usual black-tie dinner ceremony at London's medieval Guildhall. The winner was announced in a ceremony broadcast live on BBC radio and television.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/s-african-damon-galgut-wins-booker-prize-for-the-promise/articleshow/87517633.cms||---
---||World||US sanctions Israeli firm NSO Group, maker of Pegasus||The Biden administration announced on Wednesday it is putting new export limits on two Israeli hacker-for-hire companies -- including the well-known spyware company NSO Group -- saying their tools have been used to “conduct transnational repression.” Based on leaked targeting data, findings by a global media consortium earlier this year provided evidence that the spyware from NSO Group was allegedly used to infiltrate devices belonging to a range of targets, including journalists, activists and political opponents in 50 countries. The US commerce department said NSO Group and the firm Candiru are being added to the “entity list,” which limits their access to US components and technology by requiring government permission for exports. The department said putting these companies on the entity list was part of the Biden administration's efforts to promote human rights in US foreign policy. “The United States is committed to aggressively using export controls to hold companies accountable that develop, traffic, or use technologies to conduct malicious activities that threaten the cybersecurity of members of civil society, dissidents, government officials, and organisations here and abroad,“ US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. A prominent Russian firm, Positive Technologies, and the Singapore-based Computer Security Initiative Consultancy were also placed on the list for trafficking in “cyber tools used to gain unauthorized access” to IT systems, the department said. The Treasury Department put sanctions on Positive Technology, which has a broad international footprint and partnerships with such IT heavyweights as Microsoft and IBM, earlier this year. Researchers say methods used by NSO Group, the world's most infamous hacker-for-hire company, have grown so sophisticated that it can now infect targeted mobile phones without any user interaction. In July, Microsoft said it had blocked tools developed by Candiru that were used to spy on more than 100 people around the world, including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics and political dissidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-sanctions-israeli-firm-nso-group-maker-of-pegasus/articleshow/87517947.cms||---

According to agency officials, three of them were of lieutenant colonel rank at the time of the alleged crime while one of them was a colonel. The case pertains of hiring of 54 “Mates” in 2012, officials said. After registration of FIR, searches were conducted at Pune (Maharashtra), Porbandar (Gujarat) and New Delhi at the premises of the accused which led to recovery of incriminating documents, agency officials said. The sleuths have also recovered documents pertaining to investment made in movable/immovable properties. A CBI spokesperson said on Wednesday: “A case has been registered against Colonel Arvind Parashar, the then Commander Working Engineer (CWE) of Military Engineering Services (MES), Jhansi and two former deputy CWEs — lieutenant colonels R R Negi and A K Singh — apart from then Garrison Engineer D S Rawat”. Sources said the agency was likely to make multiple arrests in the case. A preliminary enquiry was conducted after the agency received a complaint. The CBI has sought documents related to the recruitment of Mates in 2012 and will soon summon those named in the FIR. It is looking at the role of some yet to be identified public servants and a few private persons in the case, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-books-4-military-officials-for-recruitment-irregularities/articleshow/87518051.cms||---
---||Business||Excise duty cut on fuel both a fiscal and political call||NEW DELHI: For the last several weeks, any question to a government official or an oil company executive about the possibility of a reduction in excise duty on fuel elicited the now familiar response – “it’s a political call”. But it was as much as a political call as an economic decision given that the Centre wanted its fiscal position to be comfortable before effecting the cut ahead of crucial assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and other states. After all, the annual impact of the cut is seen to be of the order of Rs 1.5 lakh crore with the dent to the exchequer during the remaining part of the current financial year pegged at Rs 62,500-65,000 crore. "If the revenue situation wasn't comfortable, maybe we would not have been in a position to go for this kind of a reduction," a government source said. The latest numbers released by the Controller General of Accounts showed that the Centre’s tax revenue jumped 27% during the first half of the current financial year to Rs 10.8 lakh crore – which is 60% of the full year target. There is expectation that direct tax collections will be higher than the budget estimate. Besides, GST collections are back on track after slipping in the backdrop of the second wave of the pandemic. What has provided further cushion is a 33% increase in excise duty collections to over Rs 1.7 lakh crore during the first half, led by taxes on petrol and diesel. So far, it has managed to rein in spending and has a cushion to push additional capital expenditure, although there may be some belt-tightening in some "wasteful segments" to keep the overall fiscal numbers in check. During the Centre's first half, fiscal deficit was contained at 35% of the full year target, the best in several years. Amid the overall rosy economic picture, oil prices and its inflationary impact were proving to be a sore point and were seen to be fanning inflationary expectations with economists already talking about second order impact on freight and other segments of the economy. All along the government had maintained that inflation numbers were not reflecting the impact of high pump prices given the low weight in the indices. While everyone, including the Reserve Bank of India, had warned about the inflationary pressures in the economy, it wasn’t until Wednesday that the finance ministry finally acknowledged it. “In recent months, crude oil prices have witnessed a global upsurge. Consequently, domestic prices of petrol and diesel had increased in recent weeks exerting inflationary pressure,” it said in a statement, adding that the reduction in prices will help the poor and the middle class, while providing a further boost to consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/excise-duty-cut-on-fuel-both-a-fiscal-and-political-call/articleshow/87518065.cms||Sidhartha

He used to run a juice shop in the city’s busy Chickpet. He survived the stroke but lost his speech, thanks to Aphasia.Aphasia is a disorder caused by damage in a specific area of the brain that controls language, expression and communication. Aphasia affects a third of stroke survivors and results in a struggle to process language and communication.People with Aphasia have trouble in speaking, reading, writing and understanding a language.Though Shiva Kumar joined Bengaluru’s Samvaad Institute for Speech and Hearing for speech therapy in 2010, he left it midway with acute depression, thinking that he may never get his speech back.But Shiva returned to the institute in 2017 and regained his speech after nearly three years of therapy. Now, he drives an autorickshaw funded by Samvaad.“I had a lot of things to say, but I could not utter a word. My family shifted to Chikkabanavara. I have been running an autorickshaw for a year now and I am able to make a living,” said Shiva, who speaks with a slight delay but converses without hesitation.Radhika Poovayya, the speech language pathologist and US Board Certified behavior analyst, who is the founder-director of Samvaad and treated Shiva, said Aphasia is the most neglected disorder among stroke survivors. “They are just mute. Most families do not bother to take them for speech therapy for years,” said Poovayya, who offers free of cost therapy.Since its inception in 2005, Samvaad has treated 50 persons with Aphasia and that is because of low awareness about the problem itself, Poovayya said. “We understood that money was a constraint for many in affording speech therapy and we made it free of cost in 2011,” she told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stroke-survivor-overcomes-speech-disorder-becomes-auto-driver/articleshow/87518223.cms||Sunitha Rao R

If you want to keep the work of Babu Jagjivan Ram alive then you should not vote for the BJP,” Siddaramaiah had said at a Madiga Dhindora community meeting.However, the statement created a stir within the BJP with widespread protests against Siddaramaiah and ministers named by the former CM condeming it.With the statement drawing widespread flak, Siddaramaiah said he never intended to target the community at large. “I want to clarify that the statement was targeted only at the Dalit leaders like Karjol or Jigajinagi who have joined the BJP. It was not meant for the community at large,” the former CM said defending himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/siddaramaiahs-dalit-remark-irks-bjp/articleshow/87518224.cms||---

Sanghavi, an event planner and founder of Prarambh a socio-cultural organisation, told TOI that three generations and 60 family members used to meet for every festival for the past five years. They had to stop their festive get-togethers in early 2020 due to the pandemic and have decided to finally meet for Deepavali after a long hiatus. “Almost 10 to 12 families come together. To beat the traffic and other logistical issues, we finalise a function hall and meet there for every festival. We are all excited to meet again now,” he said, adding that everyone in the family who is eligible to be vaccinated has received both their doses. The family members reside in different parts of the city like Sadashivanagar, Rajajinagar etc. He said they are all excited to meet each other after such a long gap. “We will all still be cautious. But the joy of seeing your family in person, for a special occasion, is beyond measure,” he added. Like Nilesh, several Bengalureans are pushing aside their fear of the virus and meeting their families this time. Many say vaccination and reduced travel restrictions have made it safe and easy to meet their family members. Sushma Kumar, a techie residing in Banaswadi, will be visiting her aged grandparents in Davanagere after two years. The last time she saw them was for the festival in 2018. “In 2019, I was travelling outside the country for work and in 2020, the pandemic happened. I will finally be celebrating this festival with my family,” she said. Sushma said for every festival before this, either there were travel restrictions, or someone in the family would be ill, forcing her to shelve her travel plans. “I celebrated Holi, Dasara and every other festival alone or virtually,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/deepavali-sees-return-of-family-meets-after-2-yrs/articleshow/87518226.cms||Farheen Hussain

Replying to a query on the Congress's statement that this result would prove to be an indicator of the 2023 Assembly elections, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said the bypoll results had no connection with the election in 2023 and would not have any bearing on the state government. “The Opposition has to say like that. The Congress too had lost many bypolls in the past,” he said. The CM also sought to know why the Congress leaders were not talking about Sindgi. “What do they (Congress leaders) have to say about Sindgi where they lost with a margin of 38,000 votes?” Bommai asked. Stating that various factors were responsible for the election results, Bommai said comparing the bypoll results to state elections was inappropriate. He also downplayed the Hangal defeat, stating that it was a “collective” defeat and not that of a single leader. “We will also face the assembly polls under a collective leadership,’’ he said. Reacting to Siddaramaiah’s statement that the bypoll result was just the beginning of the anti-incumbency wave against the BJP, which will wash them away, Bommai dismissed it as a blip on the radar. “Even during Siddaramaiah’s tenure as CM, they lost many byelections. The bypolls are fought on local issues. The general polls are on a different scale,”he said, adding the defeat would be analysed in detail and the issues will be tackled ahead of the 2023 assembly polls. Rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa termed it “accidental” victory for the Congress and said the BJP will reclaim the seat . “The tsunami has washed them away across the country in various states and at the national level. They were even washed away during the previous assembly elections and other bypolls. Hangal has given them a stick to hold on to, in this wave. It is just accidental victory with a margin of 7,000 votes,” he said. The Congress had launched an attack against the CM and the BJP hinting that this was just a beginning of things to come. “People were analysing that the Congress will be wiped out and is a sinking boat. We have proved with our pan-India performance that it is not the case. The BJP has been unable to secure a solid victory at the bypolls in any state and lost prestigious seats. Hangal voters have sent a strong message to the nation,” said KPCC president DK Shivakumar. In Hassan, party state vice-president BY Vijayendra, said Bommai had assumed power just two months back and this was not a big loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hangal-byelection-was-fought-under-collective-leadership-says-bommai/articleshow/87521696.cms||---

Bengaluru city police confirmed later that it was the actor’s friend Mahagandhi, not Sethupathi, who was attacked by a drunk passenger after an altercation. Both parties reached a compromise and no police complaint was filed. Mahagandhi too is an actor. Sources at KIA said the incident in the video, possibly shot by a bystander, shows a man in white shirt and black trousers jumping and kicking a man outside the arrival area of the airport. The altercation happened when, around 11.30pm on Tuesday, a group of men including Tamil star Vijay Sethupathi was walking outside the arrival gate. The suspect kicked the man to the actor’s left. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel on duty outside the terminal caught the attacker and handed him over to Bengaluru city police at the airport. The video went viral on social media on Wednesday evening. The attacker, Johnson, was a fellow passenger. He had an argument with Vijay Sethupathi’s friend and fellow actor Mahagandhi inside the airport over a trivial issue. The matter escalated and Johnson attacked Mahagandhi, police sources said. KIA police pursued the matter but Johnson and Mahagandhi told Bengaluru police that they were not willing to go ahead with any complaint and wished to end the matter. Sethupathi was unhurt. Airport police let off Johnson and Mahagandhi also left the police station after both gave statements on the altercation, sources added. Sethupathi had reached Bengaluru on Tuesday night for the filming of a television show at the Innovative Film City in Bidadi for a Tamil TV channel.

Another flyer with a job interview in Mumbai had documents in his check-in bag that is yet to reach him. A third passenger who paid Rs 8,000 for excess check-in luggage to carry items for her newborn niece in the national capital too is waiting to lay her hands on them. Like them, many passengers of IndiGo airlines have not received their baggage several hours after their flight from Bengaluru. On Sunday morning, a technical issue in the baggage handling system at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) delayed 90% of IndiGo flights. Most flyers, who landed late at their destinations, were in for a shock as their check-in bags had not reached. Many were heading home for Deepavali with sweets, gifts and clothes for their families to places like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Lucknow and Jodhpur. Gagan Gwalani, an IT professional, flew from Bengaluru to Delhi on Sunday to celebrate the festival with family. “The airline spoiled the festival spirit. I’m yet to get my luggage with clothes,” said Gwalani. Many passengers said their complaints to automated phone lines of the airlines have not been of much use. Neha from Delhi shared online the ordeal her sister who flew from Bengaluru to Delhi went through after paying the airline Rs 8,000 as excess baggage charges. Until Wednesday, the family hadn't heard from the ground staff on the complaint. IndiGo stated the bags were left behind due to baggage belt failure at Bengaluru airport and their team is working to fix the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-days-on-passengers-who-flew-from-kia-are-yet-to-get-luggage/articleshow/87518231.cms||Petlee Peter

Rejecting the bail petition filed by 39-year-old Nkoa Theodore, Justice K Natarajan pointed out that the petitioner had stayed at Marriott Hotel in Whitefield last year under a different name as clearly indicated by records placed before the court and added that the petitioner is staying in the country without authorisation as he hadn’t even applied for extension of visa, though it had expired on January 6, 2021 itself.“The investigation is completed. There is a prima facie case against the petitioner. He impersonated the name of a person and produced false documents and stayed in the hotel, even though his passport had expired. Such being the case, if the petitioner is granted bail, he is likely to abscond and him fleeing away from justice is not ruled out. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled for bail,” the judge further added.Theodore, a resident of Yaunde, capital of Cameroon, had sought bail in connection with the case registered by Whitefield police for offences punishable under sections 419 and 420 of IPC and section 14 of the Foreigners Act, 1946. Theodore approached the high court after the sessions court refused him bail. He claimed that he had come to India for treatment and was under treatment from January 2020 till May 2021. He further contended that due to Covid lockdown, he was unable to renew his visa and was unable to go abroad due to non-availability of flights. On the other hand, the high court government pleader argued that the petitioner created fake documents and stayed in the name of one Jammy Latty even though his name is different, which is nothing but impersonation and cheating.He further added that the visa of the petitioner expired on January 6, 2021, while the investigation was completed and chargesheet already filed. Theodore was arrested on July 19, 2021, following a complaint by one Lakshmipathy, an employee of Marriott Hotel, Whitefield.The complainant stated that around 2.20pm on July 18, the petitioner checked in at the hotel and identified himself as Germain Koulibaly by furnishing copies of his passport and visa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-rejects-bail-to-cameroonian-who-booked-into-hotel-with-fake-papers/articleshow/87518232.cms||---

The team that worked on the finding comprised Zeeshan A Mirza of the National Centre for Biological Sciences (Bengaluru), Virendar K Bhardwaj of Guru Nanak Dev University (Amritsar) and Harshil Patel of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (Surat). The story behind the discovery was an unusual one, Zeeshan said. Virendar, a master’s student, was back home in Chamba because of the lockdown. He was exploring his backyard, photographing and uploading pictures of what he had found on Instagram. They included images of snakes, lizards, frogs and insects. “I saw one of these images in his search feed and discussed the photo with Harshil. I then contacted Virendar and inquired about the snake, which belonged to a group of snakes commonly called Kukri as they bear teeth that are curved like that of the Nepali dagger Kukri. The snake which Virendar found was similar to the Common Kukri snake (Oligodon arnensis), however it differed in several aspects,” Zeeshan said. The photo was uploaded by Virendar on June 5, 2020, and after extensively surveying the area by the end of the month, he found two snakes which were enough to start their identification. The work was delayed as labs were not functional for a long time and visiting a natural history museums was not possible. After labs resumed work, molecular data (DNA) for the species was generated which confirmed that the species was indeed different from the Common Kukri snake. A joint paper was submitted in the first week of August 2021 and was published in the recent issue of the international journal Evolutionary Systematics. The new species has been named Oligodon churahensis, after the Churah Valley in Himachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/instagram-post-leads-to-discovery-of-snake-species/articleshow/87521284.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The stone for the sculpture, called the Krishna Shile in Kannada, comes from HD Kote and is similar to the one used in making the Hoysala temple deities. Adi Shankaracharya is said to have attained moksha at Kedarnath. The samadhi of Shankaracharya has been rebuilt at Kedarnath and was monitored by the Prime Minister's Office. Artists from across India were given a design to work on. Eight of them were selected and in September 2020, the model made by Arun was selected by the PMO to be replicated on a bigger scale for the Samadhi Sthal. Arun took nine months to complete the statue that depicts Adi Shankaracharya in the popular sitting position. The original design provided to the artists was different. Arun took the freedom to make changes to it. In the end, it was his artistic changes that won over the PMO. The 37-year-old Arun comes from a family of sculptors. His father, Yogiraj Shilpi, passed away a month ago. Arun, however, had to spend a month in Kedarnath overseeing the statue’s installation. Arun's grandfather B Basavanna Shilpi was himself patronised by the Mysore court. “This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the Prime Minister had taken a personal interest in it and selected my work. The holy place it is being installed at, the belief of millions of people who revere Adi Shankaracharya all weighed heavily on me," Arun said. Arun has done challenging work earlier too. A few years ago, he made the life-size statue of the last ruler of Mysore Kingdom, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, which is now on the Hardinge Circle in Mysuru. It is one of few marble statues made by Indian artistes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/sculptor-from-mysuru-chiselled-14-ft-shankaracharyas-statue/articleshow/87518236.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC: Atrocities Act can’t be used just because of complainant’s identity||Bengaluru: An offence under Section 3 of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cannot be invoked in a chargesheet merely because the alleged victim of the crime belongs to a Scheduled Caste or is a Scheduled Tribe, the high court has said in a recent order.“It is not as though in every crime, if victim happens to be a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, an offence under Section 3 of the Act has been committed. If the motive for crime is not casteist, the accused can only be chargesheeted for any of the offences under the Indian Penal Code that can be appropriately invoked in the background of the incident of crime or under other laws which can be applied as the facts and circumstances indicate,” Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar has observed in his order.The Act is meant to protect Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes from atrocity or oppression, the judge said, and cannot be allowed to be misused.“Therefore, there is a greater responsibility on the investigating officer to take a decision wisely before filing the chargesheet,” the order said while quashing proceedings initiated against a petitioner before a city special court.In this specific case, the judge noted that no offence of atrocity appears to have taken place. The two offences were under Sections 172 and 173 of IPC relating to the avoidance of summons.Lokanath, a resident of Rajajinagar in Bengaluru, had challenged the proceedings initiated against him on the basis of a complaint lodged by Srisangam Priya, a resident of Tumakuru.Srisangam had filed a complaint with the Halasuru Gate police alleging that Lokanath had attempted to grab 3 acres and 3 guntas of his land at Herohalli village by getting the revenue records converted in his name. Lokanath had also tried converting the land for non-agricultural use, Srisangam alleged. When Srisangam, an ST, made this complaint, the police also slapped charges under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Lokanath contended that he was the absolute owner of the land and added that the dispute was purely civil in nature and no offence under the Act was made out against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-atrocities-act-cant-be-used-just-because-of-complainants-identity/articleshow/87518239.cms||---

The maximum sentence he faced for the charges was five years imprisonment. “As the star witnesses of the prosecution are not present to prove the case, the testimony of prosecution witness (police & others) has become redundant. It is the victim who has to state what the accused did,” the court said. The child had arrived in the city with her parents from another state by train as they were to board a flight to Tehran where the father, an engineer, was employed. However, after losing their luggage, mobile phone, passport, tickets and other valuable documents, they were forced to spend some nights in the railway waiting room while her father made alternate arrangements. On one of those nights, when the mother woke up, she allegedly noticed the accused molesting the child. She shouted for help after which the staff of the Railway Protection Force and police apprehended him and handed him over to the GRP. The court said that in the absence of evidence of material witnesses, it was of the considered view that benefit of doubt is required to be given to the accused. as the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. “In such circumstances, the accused deserves to be acquitted of the charges levelled against him,” the court said. The court said that while the prosecution had examined seven witnesses, none of them had witnessed the incident. The court further said that though two RPF personnel had apprehended the accused, the testimony of these witnesses only goes to show that they had caught him in front of the ladies waiting room when he was trying to run away. “As far as CCTV footage is concerned, though the CD is produced with the chargesheet, mere filing of the CD itself is not sufficient to prove that the accused has committed the offence charged. It is well settled that upon testimony of the investigating officer, FIR cannot be proved and the accused cannot be held guilty for the offence,” the court said. It was the prosecution’s case that the family had arrived at CSMT on June 24, 2015. However, since they lost their belongings, the child’s father contacted the Iranian authorities who, in turn, told him that he would get his papers on June 29, 2015. Since the family did not have any place to stay in the city, they decided to take rest at CST railway station, where the minor was molested, the prosecution said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/survivor-missing-youth-who-spent-6-years-in-jail-acquitted/articleshow/87518260.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||Assam to settle Darrang-evicted only if names are part of NRC||GUWAHATI: A key condition for rehabilitating families evicted from state-owned land at Sipajhar in Assam’s Darrang district last September is that the beneficiaries’ names must be part of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC), the BJP-led government informed the Gauhati high court on Wednesday. The HC is hearing a batch of PILs on the eviction drive, which triggered mob retaliation from illegal settlers and led to police firing in which two people were killed and several injured. Bilal Ikram, counsel for petitioner and Congress MLA Debabrata Saikia, said apart from the NRC clause, the state had set a couple of other conditions for the rehabilitation of those evicted during the land reclamation drive. “One condition is that the families must be landless. The state will also verify if they are erosion-affected,” he said. Saikia, who is the leader of the opposition in the assembly, will file a rejoinder specifically opposing the condition that those evicted must be part of the NRC to be eligible for rehabilitation. The NRC, which is unique to Assam, was first compiled in 1951 and updated and published in 2019 on the instructions of the Supreme Court. The updated citizenship rolls have yet to receive either the apex court or the Registrar General of India's approval. Saikia’s counsel quoted the advocate general as assuring the court that the state would not take any coercive action against any potential illegal settler unless it was compelled to do so. On the mob violence on September 23, the state said an inquiry was underway to ascertain the facts and circumstances leading to the incident and whether any external force or organisation was involved in inciting the mob fury.The division bench recorded the submissions made on behalf of the state government in the order issued on Wednesday. The state sought more time for the revenue and the home and political departments to file two additional affidavits. The court will next hear the petitions on December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-to-settle-darrang-evicted-only-if-names-are-part-of-nrc/articleshow/87518185.cms||Mukut Das

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict. The Chandigarh police had arrested the teacher on May 24, 2018, on the complaint of the boy’s parents after registering a case under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The boy’s parents filed the police complaint after the child disclosed the crime before a counsellor of an NGO. The families of the teacher and the boy know each other well. The boy and his sister had started taking tuitions from the woman in September 2017. As per the police complaint, after some time, the woman asked the boy’s parents to send their daughter for tuition separately so that she could focus on their son. When the parents did that, the woman teacher started sexually abusing him. In March 2018, the boy’s mother barred him from going for tuitions, following which the teacher locked the boy in her house in the presence of his parents and her husband. The boy was rescued with the help of neighbours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/woman-teacher-gets-10-years-in-jail-for-abusing-14-year-old/articleshow/87518280.cms||---

He has also also been fined Rs 5,000, reports Rebecca Samervel. He had initially touched the child’s hand and later sat next to her and put his leg over her thigh. While the survivor remained untraceable, the court relied on the statement of an eyewitness, now a 29-year-old man, who was also a student in the examination hall at Tilak Nagar. Finding Nandkumar Shinde from Chembur guilty, the court said, “There was no fault on the part of the informant [minor]. However, the accused outraged her modesty by putting his leg on the informant’s thigh. This conduct of the accused with the informant [girl] while she was writing examination paper, indicates that he is having errant behaviour…,” the court said. The court refused to let off the accused under the Probation of Offenders Act that provides for a convict to be released on a bond of good behaviour instead of serving a sentence.“The main reason for not extending benefit of probation to the accused under the Probation of Offenders Act is that the present offence is against the woman, which is directly affecting life and right to privacy of the informant,” the court said. Relying on the evidence of witnesses — including the eyewitness and the principal to whom the girl had first complained and the investigating officer, the court said nothing is elicited to disbelieve their evidence. “Nothing is elicited to show that there is any undue influence... that there is enmity between the prosecution witnesses and the accused. Nothing is elicited from the mouth of the prosecution witnesses that they are deposing falsely with intention to falsely implicate the accused,” the court said. In her complaint to the police, the girl had said that she had appeared for her exam on March 16, 2007, between 11.30 am and 1.30 pm. On that day, the accused was assigned duty of the invigilator in her exam hall. During the examination hours, the accused came near her desk and pressed her hand. After some time, the accused sat on her bench and he put his leg on her thigh. The girl then shouted and began to cry. The accused then left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/survivor-missing-teacher-jailed-for-molestation-on-witnesss-word/articleshow/87518318.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Clearly with an eye on the BMC elections scheduled early next year, Mumbai suburban district guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday presented a Rs 497-crore district planning development committee proposal to the legislators from the suburbs. Thackeray, during the presentation, said that the emphasis is on creating amenities and at the same time, ensuring neatness and reimagining Mumbai. The upgrade plans include creating a Hanging Gardens replica close to the beginning of the tunnel on the Eastern Freeway and developing the jetty at Trombay, said cabinet minister Nawab Malik. A skill development institute has been proposed at Khar, he added. Thackeray said that focus will be on resolving Mumbai’s traffic problems by ensuring signals are in sync, and bus stops will to be redesigned to ensure better safety for women and proper seating arrangements with adequate space for advertisements so that the BEST undertaking can earn revenue. Footpaths outside railway stations will be improved, and safety embankments will be built to prevent landslides owing to floods, he added. However, last year the budgeted funds meant for these embankments were not spent. Cabinet minister and MLA from Malad (W) Aslam Shaikh said Aksa beach will be redone “like a San Francisco beach”. BJP MLA from Bandra (W) Ashish Shelar said that they are not opposed to everything proposed by the government. “They have put forth grand plans clearly with an eye on the BMC polls. But local MLAs have not been taken into confidence while preparing these plans to understand whether they can be implemented or not. Most important, the finance minister has announced a 50% cut on all expenditure. We hope the minister will make an exception for Mumbai suburbs and allow all this expenditure,” he said. Shelar said that while the government has made an announcement of Rs 100 crore for the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) and a complete makeover of Marve beach, it has refused to make arrangements for the promenade at Bandra Bandstand and Carter Road. “The MMB wants BMC to take over the maintenance. The BMC does not have the rate schedule for the items used for the making of these promenades. Why should the MMB, along with the residents, not take up the upkeep of these promenades given that it is now flush with funds?” he asked. BJP MLA from Charkop Yogesh Sagar, who is recovering from Covid-19, said that last year his constituency received no funds from the district planning development committee. “I have no hopes of getting any funds this year as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aksa-revamp-hanging-gardens-replica-on-suburbs-upgrade-plan/articleshow/87517061.cms||Clara Lewis

Load testing on the bridge is likely to start on November 6. In a bid to ease traffic congestion at Benz Circle, Nirmala Junction and Gurunanak Junction, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) granted the city two flyovers. Construction work on the first flyover was completed in 2020 and work on the second flyover started in November 2020. The 2.47-kilometer-long second flyover starts from Fakir Gudem lands at Vinayak Theater Centre. Lakshmi Infrastructure and Developers India Private Limited (LIDIPL) took up work on a war footing and completed the project in a record time of 12 months. NHAI authorities said project works were completed six months ahead of the April 2022 deadline. The new flyover has advanced features such as notice barriers on both sides. After receiving complaints about vibrations on the first flyover, the authorities increased the number of pillars from 48 to 55. Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) inspected work on the flyover and appreciated the agency and NHAI for completing the project in record time. “We thank Union minister Nitin Gadkari for all his support. He backed us in all forms and sanctioned whatever projects were needed for the city. The support of the Union government has made these projects a reality. I will strive to bring in more projects,” Kesineni said. The official inauguration of the flyover is likely to be in December 2021 after rigorous testing and safety clearances, Kesineni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/flyover-works-completed-in-record-12-mnths/articleshow/87515184.cms||Venu Lanka

At present, Bihar has less than 50 active Covid cases while 24 other districts have zero active cases. State health minister Mangal Pandey told TOI on Wednesday that special focus was being given on conducting tests. “Samples are being collected and tested at the airport, railway stations and bus stands,” he said and urged everyone to get fully vaccinated against Covid.

Health experts advise people to avoid exposure. Head of PMCH paediatrics department, Dr Anil Kumar Jaiswal, said there has been nearly 30% increase in children coming to OPD with cough, fever and cold in the past one month. “In case of bronchitis, it is because of virus and in case of pneumonia it is because of bacteria,” he said. Not only children, even elderly people are coming to the hospitals with problems occurring due to change in weather. Associate professor at medicine department of AIIMS-Patna, Dr Divendu Bhushan, said there has been a rush of such patients in the OPD and most of them are old-age people. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) medicine department associate professor Dr R D Singh said there has been massive increase in the number of patients with viral fever, cough and cold in the past 20 days. He advised people to incorporate healthy diet and increase their immunity. He said with temperature falling further, those suffering with high blood pressure have to be more cautious as the chances of stroke also increase. “They should get their BP checked and not miss their medicine,” he cautioned and asked people to properly cover their body and not get exposed to the cold weather. Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said there has been an increase in the number of children coming to his clinic with cough, running nose, fever and respiratory issues. He said such problems were mainly because of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Dr Shah said the viruses cause respiratory infection, mainly in the upper tract. “Parents have to be watchful. If cough or fever is not persistent and a child is looking healthy, taking his meal and not suffering from acute bronchitis, then he will recover with proper diet and hydration,” said Dr Shah. He even cautioned parents not to give antibiotics and avoid self-medication. “Paracetamol is given, but for that body weight and age is taken into consideration,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-avoid-exposure-during-changing-weather/articleshow/87515406.cms||Sheezan Nezami

They have also been given project clearances. The envisaged investment is worth Rs3,400 crore. The districts chosen for the 17 units are Muzaffarpur, Bhojpur, Nalanda, Purnia, Buxar, Begusarai, Madhubani, Gopalganj, East Champaran and Bhagalpur. Their establishment and opening have also become certain, since they have been linked with oil marketing companies (OMCs) for using the ethanol produced by them for blending with petrol, Hussain said. These districts are known for production of sugar cane, rice and maize, besides having abundant water and cheap labour. At the moment, 10 of the 38 districts have been selected to have the ethanol production units, but other districts would also be covered, as the total project worth Rs30,000 crore submitted by 151 companies is in the pipeline, he added. Hussain was addressing a function organized by Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) to felicitate the representatives of 17 companies who had secured licence to open their production units. Additional chief secretary of industries department, Brijesh Mehrotra and other senior officials of the department were also present on the occasion. “In fact, the industrialization of the state is on the runway for take-off due to licence/clearance given to the 17 investor companies to establish their ethanol production units,” Hussain said. Mehrotra said a high-level meeting involving the representatives of these companies and those from the Union food and petroleum ministries, as well as representatives of financial institutions and chief general managers of various banks, is to be held through videoconferencing on November 8 to clear their queries and concerns. Speaking at the function, four representatives of the companies concerned said they were somewhat wary of investing in Bihar in the beginning, but the ease of doing business in the state was better than even Telangana, which is considered the best in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-clears-ethanol-projects-worth-rs-3400cr/articleshow/87515981.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Will continue to serve people of state: Nitish||PATNA: Delighted over the victory of his party from both seats in the assembly bypolls, CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said he would continue to serve the people of the state till the date he has the mandate to do so. Nitish, who had reached the JD(U) office to participate in a function organized to felicitate its first-time MLAs Aman Bhushan Hajari and Rajiv Kumar Singh, told mediapersons, “I will only serve the people. There is no other thing in my mind.” Hajari and Singh were declared elected in the assembly bypolls from the Kusheshwar Asthan (SC) and Tarapur seats respectively on Tuesday. Talking to reporters, Nitish said both the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats were earlier held by JD(U) MLAs who passed away. The bypolls were necessitated due to their untimely death. “During the bypolls, I always said that people are the master and they will give their verdict. Our duty and religion is to serve them,” he added. The CM further said, “The JD(U) candidates have won the election from both the seats in the current assembly bypolls. The results came in our favour because the leaders and workers of all the allies of the NDA went to the public together.” He added, “People from opposition parties continued to protest us, but we had no interest as to what they were saying against us. People had faith in this government and they once again voted in favour of the NDA candidates in the bypolls.” Asked why the magic of RJD chief Lalu Prasad did not work, Nitish replied, “What magic? They only said absurd things about us during the campaigning. We did not reply to those absurd things. We always believed the people are the master whereas they believed that the members of their family are actual masters. This is the difference between us and them… We are not interested in speaking against others. We believe in the execution of works and not in speaking anything against others.” Asked about the RJD leaders’ claim about the fall of Nitish government after the bypoll results, the CM said, “They can say whatever they like. The people have now declared their verdict. I congratulate all of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-continue-to-serve-people-of-state-nitish/articleshow/87515972.cms||Madan Kumar

The department has invited tenders from prospective bidders to procure the required equipment for the centre. Hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease, are among commonest genetic disorders. Sickle cell disease is a haemoglobin disorder that requires lifelong management and contributes to infant and childhood morbidity and mortality. The disease is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal HbS genes. Dr K Satish Reddy, a general physician, said persons carrying only one of these genes are called ‘carriers’ as they do not suffer from any disease but carry the abnormal gene and transmit it to the next generation. “The carriers cannot be recognised clinically, but only by performing special blood tests,” he said. Sickle cell anaemia, a genetic disorder affecting red blood cells and usually found in the tribal belts of north-coastal Andhra, Bastar and south Odisha, is a potent killer that destroys the immune system of its host. It results in inadequate amino acid production and the affected person suffers from jaundice, spleen enlargement, swelling of hands and feet, joint pains, breathlessness and over time complete destruction of the individual’s immune system resulting in other complications. Hundreds of students in Visakhapatnam tribal area are suffering from sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia. The thalassemias and sickle cell disorders require lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation. The excess iron that gets into the body through blood transfusions needs to be removed by use of the expensive chelators. The frequent blood transfusions and other treatment modalities require a supportive environment. The integrated centre for hemoglobinopathies at KGH is expected to serve these cases from north coastal Andhra Pradesh, while three more centres are also planned at the regional level in Kakinada, Guntur, and Kurnool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/now-centre-at-kgh-to-treat-genetic-disorders/articleshow/87515097.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Visakha rural area should get a good name across the nation instead of being known as ganja hub,” Rao said, while addressing the gathering at Indian Medical Association hall here during an awareness meeting on ganja eradication. Around 100 sarpanches, besides police officials from the district, attended the meeting. Cultivating ganja and its transportation is illegal and supporting such kind of activity is also illegal, the DIG said. “Narsipatnam has got a bad name as it is considered the starting point for transportation of ganja. Ganja cultivation has brought a bad name to Visakha rural area. The area should be developed as a tourism destination, rather than being known for ganja cultivation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/sarpanches-called-to-help-end-ganja-hub-tag-for-agency/articleshow/87515141.cms||---

The research assumes importance as it would be easy to develop medicines to block the molecules responsible for the pandemic virus as the safest way of treatment. The finding was presented to a group of scientists and international media on Tuesday as part of the silver jubilee annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience, to be held at Chicago, the US, on November 9. Other institutions associated with the research are PGI Chandigarh, IIT Gandhinagar and Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Mumbai. The AIIMS-P team leader, Dr Ashutosh Kumar of anatomy department, said, “The research carried at all these institutions using various tools and methodologies and study of postmortem brains of the Covid deceased for expression of genes and proteins identified the new set of molecules, Nrp 1 and Furin, which carried the virus to brain.” These molecules are present in olfactory nerves, the nerves in the nasal part, sending signals of smell to the brain. Hence, nose could be the main route through which the virus enters the brain. He said it was this reason that the loss of smell was one of the important symptoms of the Covid patients. “Reaching the brain through olfactory nerves, these molecules, which are proteins in nature, damaged the neurons, leading to a number of physiological disorders and in some cases even death. This study was based on the observations and examination on the postmortem brains during the second wave of the pandemic which hit Bihar and many other states early this year. “In the course of study on post-Covid patients, we found 30% of them having developed some neurological problems like anxiety, depression and partial loss of memory. These could also be due to the effects of these molecules on brain even after recovery from the disease,” Dr Ashutosh said. He said the data on postmortem brain studies shared by the institutions associated with the research concluded that the set of Nrp molecules, supported by furin molecules, facilitated the passage of Covid virus through nose to brain. According to Dr Sanjeev Kumar, Covid nodal officer at AIIMS-P, altogether 11,371 Covid patients were admitted in his hospital in the two waves of the pandemic, out of which 1220 died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/scientists-identify-molecules-carrying-covid-virus-to-brain/articleshow/87515361.cms||VK Tripathi

The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) had to invite a request for proposal (RFP) from private companies to construct the project. However, after the letter was written, the process was put on hold. The state has urged the Centre to share the project with the NHAI after sharing the project cost. Earlier, to implement the multi-crore Northern Ring Road project, JDA had decided to appoint a consultancy firm to prepare the detailed project report (DPR). An official source said, “At the time when the project was conceived, the state government decided to give it to NHAI. Later, there was a change in the plan. Exercise has been started again to bring NHAI to share the project with JDA.” The project cost of 45km (Bagrana to Achrol) is pegged at Rs 2,887 crore. The Ring Road project will consist of a six-lane access-controlled expressway and a three-lane service road on both sides. The northern corridor will also be developed on the lines of the 47km southern corridor (Agra Road to Ajmer Road) and the JDA will acquire 360-metre-wide strip of land. While the transport corridor will be constructed on a 90-metre-wide land, the civic body proposes 135 metres wide development corridor along the transport corridor for commercial purpose. Not learning lessons from the past, the JDA is once again planning to acquire extra land for the northern corridor, which might force farmers to protest in future. “In the master plan 2025, the JDA has kept the northern corridor 360-metre-wide, same as southern corridor,” said an official. As per the initial proposal, the civic body would require approximately Rs 1,808 crore for acquiring land for transport corridor. The agencies have identified land in 26 villages of three tehsils — Amber, Jaipur and Jamwa-Ramgarh — to acquire it for Ring Road. The Ring Road project was proposed to be constructed in phases. “Now, the state government is only planning to construct the corridor to connect Delhi Road and Agra Road. Chandwaji Expressway would be used as Ring Road to Delhi Road and Ajmer Road via Sikar Road,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/share-northern-ring-road-project-cost-raj-to-centre/articleshow/87517698.cms||---

He also said that the banking community, through the Indian Banks’ Association, has taken up the matter with the government. “The arrest of Mr Chaudhuri is extremely unfortunate. There have been several reactions in the public space of the banking community as well as previous chairmen. It appears that an opportunity was not given to him to be heard before the arrest. We have utmost faith in the country’s judicial system and are confident that he will be released unconditionally at the earliest,” Khara told reporters here on Wednesday. Banking sources said that the complainant in the same case had filed a false FIR against the resolution professional (RP) who had been appointed to take charge at the defaulting company. This had resulted in a landmark judgment that said a case against the RP can be filed only with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). Khara denied that there were any irregularities in the sale of the loan by SBI. “As far as SBI is concerned, we adhere to the best practices in corporate governance and there has been no irregularities in the instant case and the prescribed rules and process were followed by the bank in dealing with this account.” Khara indicated that the decision on the sale of the NPA was unlikely to have been taken by Chaudhuri. “Issues of this magnitude are invariably dealt with at a local level and the top management of the bank, including the chairman, are not involved in decision making. We have got the structure in place and we are confident that people across the hierarchy can take decisions in such matters,” Khara said. Banking sources said that the complainant in this case was politically connected. They said that it appeared to be a premeditated case as most of the higher courts are on vacation for Diwali. Meanwhile, SBI sources said that the valuations mentioned in the order are irrelevant as the properties were not sold by the bank. They said that the bank had sanctioned a term loan of Rs 24 crore and a cash credit limit of Rs 1 crore was sanctioned in 2008 and the loan had to be restructured within a year itself. Despite restructuring, the loan turned into a non-performing asset in 2010. This prompted the bank to send a recall notice for Rs 34 crore in 2012 and a suit was filed in the debt recovery tribunal in 2013 for Rs 40 crore. As the bank was not successful in attaching the property under the Securitisation Act, the loan was sold to Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) for Rs 25 crore in 2014. The ARC too could not recover the loan and finally invoked the IBC. The promoters had filed an FIR against the RP, who was arrested. It was in this case that the landmark order was passed requiring complaints against the RP to be filed only with the IBBI. Banking sources said that both NCLAT and the Supreme Court have passed strictures against the promoters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chaudhuri-wasnt-heard-before-arrest-sbi-chief/articleshow/87516835.cms||---
---||Business||SBI Q2 profit up 67% at record Rs 7,627cr||Mumbai: The country’s largest lender SBI posted its highest quarterly profit of Rs 7,627 crore for the September quarter, up 67% on the back of an 11% rise in net interest income and healthy recovery from stressed accounts. The net interest margin improved by 16 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) to 3.5%, which was also reflected in the net income numbers, which rose to Rs 31,184 crore in Q2FY22 from Rs 28,181 crore in the year-ago period. SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that, while all indicators pointed to an improvement in the economy, credit demand was yet to pick up. “Our estimate is that capacity utilisation is still at 60%. The utilisation of working capital limits is around 50%, but we are seeing signs of demand in some sectors and our pipline for term loans is Rs 1.5 lakh crore,” he said. Khara added that asset quality improved following better collection efforts. SBI’s record profit is despite making a provision of Rs 7,418 crore for the family pension scheme. The gross deposits of the bank rose 9.8% year-on-year to Rs 38.1 lakh crore, while gross advances, including investments in corporate bonds and commercial papers, rose 6.2% to Rs 25.3 lakh crore. The share of low-cost deposits — current and savings accounts — improved to 46.2% of total deposits from 45.4% a year ago. Home loans, which constitute 24% of the loan book, rose 10.7%. However, slippages — when standard account turns into a non-performing one — rose 51% as of September-end to Rs 4,176 crore from Rs 2,756 crore a year ago. After making provisions, the net non-performing assets (NPAs) of the bank stood at Rs 37,119 crore. The net NPA as a percentage of total loans stood at 1.52%||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-q2-profit-up-67-at-record-rs-7627cr/articleshow/87516815.cms||---
---||Business||Cheaper hypertension drug blocked||Mumbai: Affordable versions of a hypertensive combination drug, Valsartan, will go off retail shelves soon. The Delhi high court has temporarily restrained drug companies — including Natco Pharma, Torrent Pharma, Eris Lifesciences and Windlas Biotech — from marketing generic copies of the popular combination Valsartan and Sacubitril, responding to a suit filed by the MNC Novartis. The court ruled that the generic versions infringed the patent held by Novartis (IN051) on the combination of Valsartan and Sacubitril, used for treating hypertension. The product is a ‘supramolecular’ complex of the two compounds, for which a patent application filed in 2007 is still pending, legal experts told TOI. The generic companies are also selling supramolecular versions of the drug. A supramolecular complex is a structure where the two entities are arranged and bonded to form a single unit. As against this, in the patented version, the compounds are isolated, as in a physical mixture. The generic companies, including Natco, are expected to file an appeal soon. The court held that the supramolecular complex is covered by the patent IN051 and is infringing it, the experts added. The order passed by Justice Jayant Nath hence upheld ‘prima facie’ validity of the patent. “Hence, merely because the plaintiffs have filed an application for registration of a supramolecular complex of the two components of Valsartan and Sacubitril, being application No. 4412, does not modify or change the position vis-a-vis interpretation of claim 1 of the suit patent. Prima facie, there is no merit in the said plea of the defendant,” the order, a copy of which is available with TOI, said. The combination drug marketed by Natco as Valsac is priced at Rs 1,260 for the 50mg (28 tablets) and at Rs 1,540 for the 100mg, which was launched in 2019. Novartis markets the combination drug under the brand Vymada 50mg for around Rs 1,100 per 14 tablets’ strip. When contacted, a company spokesperson said, “Novartis believes strongly in the intellectual property covering all our medicines and will continue to defend our IP rights.” Officials representing the generic companies were not available for comments. According to the defendant, “The plaintiff, it is stated, has misleadingly and falsely stated that the said supramolecular complex is covered under the suit patent IN051.” Further, the plaintiff has deliberately suppressed the fact that the plaintiff has also a supramolecular complex which is covered by the pending patent application. In the said application, it is stated that the plaintiff has taken a stand that the supramolecular complex was invented much after the suit patent and was not known at the time of filing of the suit patent. Further, the defendant has also filed a counter-claim for revocation of the Indian patent IN051, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cheaper-hypertension-drug-blocked/articleshow/87516746.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

GCCI has also requested Union minister for road transport and highways (MoRTH) Nitin Gadkari to complete the NH4A highway stretch at Anmod Ghat and also start construction of a flyover between Gauri fuel station at Porvorim and the circle at Socorro. In a letter to Gadkari, who was in Goa on an official visit, GCCI also urged MoRTH to initiate a probe into the sub-standard widening of the Patradevi — Porvorim and Panaji — Canacona sections of NH66. “With the overall poor quality of road that is unfolding, on the Patradevi to Pollem important stretch of the NH 66, there is a fear that Goa will become far more famous as a death trap for bikers and other motorist, including long trailer trucks,” said GCCI president Ralph De Souza. “Ours is a tourist state and we certainly cannot afford it. Even truckers would not prefer using this road, which will defeat its very purpose.” GCCI said that the recently completed four-lane concrete roads are sub-par with poor drainage, irregular banking angles, exposed aggregate and poor levelling making them accident prone. The lack of illumination at diversions also poses a risk for motorists. “Truckers are reluctant to come to Goa thus increasing freight cost, which is passed on to the consumer. The uneven and wavy nature of the road has also increased the number of road mishaps. There are instances where empty containers have fallen off the trailers,” Souza said. GCCI said that the delay in upgrading the 4km stretch between Gauri Petrol pump at Porvorim and the circle at Socorro has created a major bottleneck. The industry body has also expressed concern over the closure of the Anmod Ghat for over 16 months. Gadkari has assured GCCI that he will explore ways to complete and reopen the Anmod Ghat route. “Due to this the traffic is diverted through Karwar or Yellapur increasing the distance, time and freight affecting supply and cost of goods. Goa is largely dependent on tourism and this highway is an important link in the Sagarmala project,” said GCCI in the letter to Gadkari. Sousa said that expediting the completion of the Zuari bridge will be a big boon to the Goan economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-bad-roads-dent-tourism-logistics-sector/articleshow/87517302.cms||---

Stating that the JNUTA condemned vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar’s “arbitrary behaviour,” a statement issued by the teachers’ body read, “…(Kumar) has time and again shown complete disrespect for university processes in his haste to implement his personal agenda rather than what is in the academic interest of the university. He has also misused his position to harass multiple faculty members, who have resisted his illegalities.” JNUTA added that, while the high court’s recent order was a “relief” to members of the academic community, it remained to be seen whether the VC “rectifies his illegalities or continues to brazen it out in the belief that he is a law unto himself.” The teachers’ body also raised questions on the “silence maintained by” the Centre on the allegations against the vice-chancellor. Despite attempts by TOI, JNU’s senior officials did not respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnuta-alleges-vc-misused-his-position-says-hc-order-a-relief/articleshow/87517074.cms||---
---||Mumbai||UP case chargesheet names Wadhawan brothers & 23 others||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday submitted a chargesheet against 25 accused in the money-laundering case involving Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) before a special court in Mumbai. The accused include DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, then UPPCL director (finance) Sudhanshu Dwivedi and former secretary of UP Power Sector Employees’ Trust Pravin Kumar Gupta. Among the total accused, 12 are people; the rest are companies associated with them or had been used for allegedly laundering money. State-owned UPPCL had allegedly invested Rs 4,123 crore from its employees’ provident fund corpus into DHFL financial institution as fixed deposits without taking required approval from the government authority. Of the total UPPCL money, the DHFL has yet to pay Rs 2,268 crore principal amount. The ED alleged that DHFL promoters laundered this money through fictitious transactions and the money was used to purchase assets in the UK. Two months ago, the ED had provisionally attached assets worth Rs 578 crore (57 million) of a company of Wadhawan Global Capital (UK) Ltd. The investigation found that the Wadhawan brothers had allegedly siphoned off over Rs 1,000 crore UPPCL money to the UK after layering it through more than 30 Indian-based companies controlled by them. The ED followed the money trail to Wadhawan Global Capital (UK) Ltd. It is stated that the DHFL had a separate common account where they would get UPPCL investments. In the same account, the Wadhwans were also getting money from various other sources, including as loan and investments. The ED found that around Rs 450 crore came in this common account and during the same period the money was layered through different companies and diverted into the account of Wadhawan Global Capital (India) Ltd. From there the money was further diverted abroad into account of Wadhawan Global Capital (UK) Ltd as an investment. The ED alleged that the DHFL was engaged in the disbursement of high-value loans to other companies related to its promoters during the period when it received the UPPCL investment. The DHFL sanctioned unsecured loans to those companies on the direction of Kapil Wadhawan and most loans turned into non-performing assets. The Wadhawans are presently in judicial custody in two other money-laundering cases connected to Yes Bank and DHFL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-up-case-chargesheet-names-wadhawan-bros-23-others/articleshow/87517080.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Lucknow||Back from Canada, the stolen Annapurna idol to be installed at KVT||Lucknow: The Narendra Modi government at the Centre has reclaimed an ancient idol of goddess Annapurna from MacKenzie art Gallery of Regina University in Canada. The idol, which is said to have been stolen from Varanasi nearly 100 years ago, will be handed over to the UP government on November 11 at a grand function in New Delhi, Union culture and tourism minister G Kishan Reddy said on Wednesday. The state government, in turn will organise a massive `Shobha Yatra’, spanning over four days (November 11 to November 14), all the way from Delhi to Varanasi while passing through 17 districts, including Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Lucknow, Kanpur and Ayodhya. The idol will be duly placed at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi after performing a `Pran Pratishtha’ on November 15, which also happens to be an auspicious day of Ekadashi. Reddy said that the idol was received by the ministry of culture on October 15 after concerted efforts of the ministry of external affairs and Archaeological Survey of India. He said that the people of the civil society and seers in Varanasi have been campaigning for reclaiming the idol of Annapurna for a long time. The Union minister said that the Indian government had managed to reclaim 55 idols and paintings from abroad since independence, of which 75% have been brought back after 2014 after BJP came to power at the Centre. The minister said that the Centre has identified 157 more idols and paintings which will be brought back from foreign shores, including Belgium, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and UK, after due diplomatic perusal. In fact, nearly 100 of them are in the US alone. “PM Modi has spoken to US president Joe Biden on the issue,” he said. Reddy said the Centre has asked the cultural wings in various embassies across the globe to identify and get hold of the idols, painting and artefacts, which were allegedly misappropriated during the British rule. CM Yogi Adityanath said that the development marked “endorsement of Indian culture and heritage” on a global platform. “The coming back of Annapurna idol will be of prime importance for Kashi (Varanasi) which is known as one of the oldest cities in the world,” Yogi said, asserting that the goddess holds a special place in the city of lord Vishwanath. Yogi said a host of ministers will be present in Delhi on November 11, which also happens to be Gopashtami (cows are worshipped on the day), when the idol is handed over to the state government. The CM said that the `Shobha Yatra’, organised to mark return of Annapurna idol, will originate in Delhi, and pass through Ghaziabad, GB Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Hathras to halt in Kasganj on November 11. The idol will be kept in Soron religious site in Kasganj. On November 12, the yatra will resume and pass through Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj to halt at Kanpur’s Tapeshwari temple. The next day, the idol will pass through Unnao, Lucknow, Barabanki to halt in Ayodhya, where the idol will be kept at Ram Janambhoomi. On November 14, it will pass through Sultanpur, Pratapgarh and Jaunpur to reach Varanasi. UP culture minister Neelkanth Tewari and cane minister Suresh Rana will accompany the `Shobha Yatra’, which will be received by respective ministers-in-charge of districts where the idol reaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/back-from-canada-the-stolen-annapurna-idol-to-be-installed-at-kvt/articleshow/87517722.cms||---

The teacher is providing food and education to the kids and wants them to complete their education. Sunil Jose, a mathematics teacher at a private school, is working on education of street children so that they can emerge as better citizens with better opportunities.  “We adopted 50 child beggars and got them admitted to government schools in Kayar and Pancheel. These children live in the slums with no proper houses,” said Jose. “We also arranged vans for these children that would carry them from the slums to their schools. These children also get midday meals at the government schools. After school, the van picks them and brings them to my house, where they have extra classes and then dinner,” added Jose. Uddan Society has four teachers who teach at least for 2 hours after their school duty. “The purpose behind the move is to stop the children from begging and keep them busy with their studies,” said another teacher. Jose is providing breakfast and evening meals as well as clothing to these children from his salary. A paediatric doctor Alok Garg is also associated with the society and is looking after the health concerns of these kids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/ajmer-teacher-group-adopts-50-child-beggars-admits-them-to-govt-schools/articleshow/87517708.cms||---

The fire quickly tore through the shop, setting off a wave of panic as huge explosions rang out in quick successions. Firecrackers exploded one after the another, some even flying out on the shop and landing on the road outside. Huge flames began to tower over the building and a thick plume of smoke enveloped the area by the time fire tenders arrived. One vehicle was reported to have charred in the fire. Several fire tenders were summoned to contain flames before they could engulf nearby shops.

---||Delhi||Diabetics must keep an eye on complications||NEW DELHI: A survey conducted by the community ophthalmology division of AIIMS, University of Hyderabad and the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment conducted across 21 districts in the country has revealed that as many as 17% of diabetes patients suffer from retinopathy, a complication that affects the eyes. Of them, nearly 4% suffer from retinopathy that threatens eyesight while 12% have mild disease. The researchers involved in the study say there is a need for a coordinated and multi-sectoral approach to reduce the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy. This can include early identification of people with diabetes and their routine screening for eye sight-related problems along with availability of treatment facilities, they add. The survey results and recommendations have been published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO). The total sample size of the survey was 63,000 people aged 50 years and above. According to the report published in IJO, the prevalence of diabetes in the surveyed population was approximately12%. Among them, one-third were newly diagnosed diabetics, that is, diagnosed at the time of the survey. The study revealed that the prevalence of diabetes retinopathy (DR) among persons with diabetes was 17%, the prevalence of sight threatening retinopathy was 4%, and the prevalence of mild retinopathy was approximately 12%. Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in the current study were more than 10 years of diabetes, poor glycaemic control and insulin treatment. “The current study highlights the substantial burden of diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy in India and the critical need to adopt a coordinated and multi-sectoral approach to reduce their prevalence. There is a need for early identification of persons with diabetes and their routine screening for DR along with availability of treatment facilities,” the authors say. Diabetes damages blood vessels all over the body. The National Eye Institute, US says damage to the eyes starts when sugar blocks the tiny blood vessels that go to the retina, causing them to leak fluid or bleed. To make up for these blocked blood vessels, the eyes then grow new blood vessels that don’t work well. These new blood vessels can leak or bleed easily. The experts say people suffering from diabetes should get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. “Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first, but finding it early can help you take steps to protect your vision,” they add.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diabetics-must-keep-an-eye-on-complications/articleshow/87517089.cms||---

The searches were conducted in Porbandar, Pune in Maharashtra and in New Delhi which led to the recovery of incriminating documents and other evidence pertaining to investments made in moveable and immoveable properties, said CBI officers. The CBI started the search after the agency registered a case against former commander working engineer (CWE) of the Military Engineering Services (MES) in Jhansi among other officials, in connection with an alleged recruitment scam. “Former CWE Col Arvind Parashar, former deputy CWES Lt Col RR Negi, Lt Col AK Singh and garrison engineer Lt Col DS Rawat, among other unidentified people have been booked by the probe agency over allegations of illegalities committed in the recruitment of around 54 mates in the MES, Jhansi in 2012,” said an official statement by the CBI. Earlier also, the CBI had begun investigation in the alleged irregularity case in the Indian Army. The agency in February this year had registered a complaint after receiving an input about the alleged involvement of serving personnel in taking bribes for clearance of review medical exam of temporarily rejected officer candidates at the base hospital in New Delhi. The CBI had then booked six lieutenant colonel-ranked officers along with some others for alleged corruption in the recruitment of Army officers through Service Selection Board centres.

With both the central and state government lowering the excise duty, the price of petrol in Goa will be reduced by Rs 17 per litre and diesel by Rs 12 per litre. Sawant said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has given a great Diwali gift to all Indians, by announcing reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel. “I thank the PM Narendra Modi as this decision shall give great relief to common man and help control inflation. In addition, the government of Goa shall reduce an additional Rs 7 on petrol and Rs 7 on diesel, thereby reducing the price of diesel by Rs 17 per litre and petrol by Rs 12 per litre,” Sawant tweeted. On Wednesday, petrol was selling for Rs 107.36 per litre while diesel stood at Rs 104.31. Once the taxes are reduced, petrol is expected to cost around Rs 95 per litre, while diesel will retail for Rs 87.3 per litre. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that the government needs to do more to reduce fuel prices. “After facing defeats in by-polls and constant protests by Congress, the insensitive BJP government reduces excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10. This is not enough. Will the Prime Minister reduce LPG cylinder prices? Goa chief minister must immediately cut VAT on fuel and give relief to Goans,” said Kamat. Since the time, Pramod Sawant was sworn in as chief minister in March 2019, VAT has been increased on four occasions, the first being on June 14, when VAT on petrol was hiked from 15% to 20% and VAT on diesel was increased from 15% to 18%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/petrol-at-rs-95/l-diesel-at-rs-87-3-in-goa/articleshow/87517281.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Amaravati||AP: Tobacco farmers oppose plans for contract farming||AMARAVATI: Tobacco growers are opposing the Centre’s plans to introduce contract farming in tobacco sector. Farmers organized a meeting on Thursday on the occasion of World Tobacco Growers’ Day and demanded the Centre to make a retreat.  They warned that the contract farming in FCV tobacco sector will only aggravate problems of farmers by taking them back to pre-1984 era of exploitation. Addressing the meeting, former vice-chairman of the tobacco board, Gadde Seshagiri Rao, said that it was deplorable that the Centre had moved a proposal about contract farming with the tobacco board officials without holding consultations with the growers. ”It is going to have a disastrous effect on the livelihood of millions of growers dependent on the cultivation for decades,” said Rao. He said that the growers braved several calamities to grow the crop amidst Covid-19 and faced economic losses due to lockdown and delayed auctions. He said that many growers are still struggling to make both ends meet and avoid further losses. “In such challenging times, the government contemplating to introduce contract farming is a matter deep concern and causing distress among the farming community,” said Rao. Virginia Tobacco Farmers Association president Karatam Venkata Reddi Naidu said that they have always appreciated the Centre’s instinct to help out the FCV tobacco farming sector with agri- development schemes and welfare activities.

DCP (North) Paris Deshmukh said a special team arrested the two persons idenitfied as Pabir Das alias Babi (30) and Anil Jatav alias Prince (23). “We have recovered Rs 21 lakh from the two,” Deshmukh said. Police said an FIR was filed at Kotwali police station on October 23 by a trader, suspected to have ties with hawala operations, claiming that two accused barged into his house located in Rajaji ka Rasta and looted Rs 25 lakh by holding a knife to his wife. Police constituted special teams to examine over three dozen CCTV camera footage. “We prepared sketches of the two suspects. The team spoke to over 500 autorickshaw drivers and showed them sketches,” Deshmukh told TOI. He said police teams fanned out at different locations to follow up on leads for two suspects. “We discovered that Babi had worked at a bag shop on Nahargarh Road. He learned about the trader and his work during his stint there. He followed the trader for several days before raiding the house,” Deshmukh said. He added that Babi had crafted an elaborate plan to stage the loot on multiple occasions. His plans went awry due to some reasons. “Das accumulated a lot of debt during the lockdown. He finalised his plans for the heist and enlisted the help of his childhood friend Anil Jatav,” Deshmukh added. Police said Das has a criminal past, he was earlier booked by Moti Dungari, Shipra Path and Bajaj Nagar police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-held-for-looting-rs-25-lakh-from-trader/articleshow/87517723.cms||---

Minister Radhakrishnan issued a statement on Wednesday that minister Murugan’s complaint with regard to the fishermen was completely false. Sri Lankan navy caught two Indian fishing vessels along with 23 fishers on board for poaching in Sri Lankan waters east of Point Pedro and Vettilaikeni on October13. The Sri Lankan navy also seized the fishing gear used for ‘bottom trawling’ and their catch. On October 18, two fishermen, S Sugandhan, 22, and A Xavier, 38, of Kottaipattinam in Pudukkottai district were caught by the Sri Lankan Navy for crossing the international maritime boundary line (IMBL). In the incident, a fisherman, R Rajkiran, 28, drowned after his trawler was hit by the navy vessel. Radhakrishnan said that the additional chief secretary in the ministry of fisheries-fishermen welfare and animal husbandry had written to the joint secretary of the Union ministry of external affairs and the prime minister on October 14 and on October 15 to take steps to release the 23 fishermen of Nagapattinam. Chief minister M K Stalin had also written to the Union minister for external affairs to initiate action to release the two fishermen on October 20, said Radhakrishnan adding that he too had taken up the issue with L Murugan through a letter on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tn-shared-all-info-on-fishers-with-centre/articleshow/87517079.cms||---
---||Trichy||Heavy rain, Covid-induced losses dampen Diwali shopping, cracker business in delta districts||TRICHY: Incessant rain played spoilsport on last-minute Diwali purchases in Trichy and surrounding districts as shoppers faced a harrowing time wading through water, not to speak of the effect it had on cracker sales. Retail traders say though fireworks sale are better compared to what they were last year when tougher restrictions were in place, they are nowhere close to pre-Covid times. Apart from intermittent rain, families still struggling to beat pandemic blues by way of job and income loss, restrictions imposed by court and appeal from social activists to abstain from bursting crackers have had an impact on cracker sales. People in the delta district don’t have enough finances to spend as kuruvai harvest is not yet complete, said V Sathyanarayanan, secretary of Federation of Kumbakonam All Industries and Traders Association. “People don’t have enough money to celebrate the festival due to lack of income. They can’t borrow as private financing companies and micro-financing companies are not willing to give loan to people fearing that they would not repay it properly,” he said. However, wholesale traders and big enterprisers have managed to attain their targets. Platform and street vendors could not earn much due to the rain, he added. P Srinivas of Balaji Crackers in Trichy said ban on bursting joint crackers has caused a dip in sales of even smaller varieties. “Youths normally prefer garland crackers with 1,000 and 10,000 shots. However, due to a court order banning such crackers, the manufacturers themselves restricted their production. But people are not buying even Bijli or multi-shot crackers which contain even 25 shots. Moreover, intermittent rain dampened sales. If there was a respite from the rain at least in the afternoon, traders can hope to do good business,” Srinivas added. As for the customers, their spending has not been anywhere close to pre-Covid-19 times. People have cut down their purchases by up to 30%, said another wholesale trader from Palakkarai. “Usually we used to see more number of customers making purchases ranging from Rs 400 to Rs 1,000. However, retail sale has drastically come down this year due to job loss,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/heavy-rain-covid-induced-losses-dampen-diwali-shopping-cracker-biz-in-delta-dists/articleshow/87517083.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat RERA imposes a fine of Rs 60,000 on builder||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera) has imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 on a builder for not mentioning the Rera website address in an advertisement board that was erected at the housing project site in Chandkheda. The project involved in this case is East Ebony at the New CG Road in Chandkheda by Harsiddh Infra and its promoter is Dharmendrabhai Patel. Rera issued a notice to the promoter of the scheme in September asking why he should not be fined for not mentioning the Rera website address in the advertisement and the prospectus. It said that it is mandatory to mention the Rera portal address and the Rera registration number for the project in any advertisement material including the hoardings. The promoter’s attention was repeatedly drawn to this lapse in the hoarding on various occasions. The notice further said that by not mentioning the portal in the hoarding at the project site, the promoter had prima facie violated the provisions of section 11(2) of the Real Estate (Regularization and Development) Act. The promoter was summoned for explanation in an online hearing and clarified that after the receipt of the communication from Rera, he has now mentioned the website address in the hoarding. He also apologised for the lapse. Rera granted 10 days to Patel to file an affidavit revealing whether there is any other hoarding placed in which website was not mentioned. Patel informed the authority that the mistake was rectified and he would abide by all guidelines issued by the authority. The Rera functionaries perused the photographs of the new hoarding and found that a laminated piece of paper was pasted on the hoarding in which the website was mentioned. The authority still found a problem with this and said that the guidelines say, “The font size of Rera registration number and website address should be mandatorily equal to or larger than the contact details of the proposed project.” But the font size in Patel’s hoarding was smaller than the contact details. Rera said that the fine stipulated in such a lapse is up to 5% of total project cost, which is Rs 50.99 crore for this scheme. The authority ordered Patel to deposit Rs 60,000 fine from his pocket and directed that the amount should not be withdrawn from the project fund or it should be extracted from buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rera-imposes-a-fine-of-rs-60000-on-builder/articleshow/87516282.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘REET results way to avoid CBI probe’||JAIPUR: The Opposition in the state has questioned the declaration of Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) results within 36 days claiming that it was a way to avoid Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigation. BJP MP Kirori Meena has alleged that the chairman of the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) has tried to cover up his involvement in the paper leak case by releasing the results of REET in haste. "Despite their best efforts, they will not be able to do so. The mask will soon be removed from the faces of the ones that are copying the hard work of the unemployed. Despite having enough proof of the REET paper leak case, instead of handing over the facilitators, the SOG is wasting time in catching the pawns. CBI investigation is necessary to bring out the truth," said Meena. Upen Yadav, president of Rajasthan Berozgar Ekikrat Mahasangh, said, "The state government needs to answer about the need to hurry the process of result announcement. There are candidates that are waiting for the results of recruitment examinations held in 2013 and 2018. These are all very shady and against this we will celebrate this black Diwali without food." The recruitment examinations Yadav mentioned are Panchayati Raj LDC recruitment in 2013, Laboratory Assistant Recruitment in 2018 and RUVNL, JEN recruitment 2021. Around 12,000 candidates took the examinations, but are still waiting for the results. TOI tried to contact RBSE chairman Dharampal Jaroli, but his was phone was off. Opposition also raised the issue of BEd final semester students being eligible for taking the REET examination. They said results were announced and many selected students are yet to get their final results. A government officer said it was the work of the higher education department to release the results for BEd. "The RBSE is nowhere related to this and students will be given posting as per the guidelines for recruitment. Higher education department should take cognizance and announce the results for finial year BEd examination soon," the official said, seeking anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-results-way-to-avoid-cbi-probe/articleshow/87517735.cms||---

---||Varanasi||CM Yogi to attend ‘pran pratistha’ of Annapurna idol returned by Canada||Varanasi: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will attend the ‘pran pratistha’ (consecration) of the ancient idol of Goddess Annapurna, which has been returned by Canada, in a temple on the premises of Kashi Vishwanath Dham on November 15. The stone idol, measuring 17.30 X 9.90 X 4.90 cm was stolen from Varanasi and smuggled to Canada over a century ago. “The idol has already arrived in New Delhi from Canada due to the initiative and efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Wednesday. The idol will be brought from New Delhi to Varanasi by road and will reach here by November 14. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be present for the consecration ceremony of the idol, which will be installed in a temple on the Kashi Vishwanath Dham premises, he added. In his Mann Ki Baat programme on November 29 last year, the PM had broken the news about the return of the idol. “I want to share some good news with you all. Every Indian will be proud to know that a very old idol of Devi Annapurna is being returned by Canada to India. This idol was stolen from a temple in Varanasi and smuggled out somewhere around 1913. I express my gratitude to the Government of Canada and to all those who made this propitious deed possible,” he had added. “Mata Annapurna has a very special relationship with Kashi. The coming back of her idol is pleasing for all of us. Just like the idol of Mata Annapurna, we lost a lot of our invaluable heritage due to international smugglers. Now, the smuggling activities have been curbed. We have also increased our efforts for the return of our artefacts and succeeded in bringing back a lot of such idols and artefacts in the past few years,” he had said. In his Dev Deepawali address at Raj Ghat in Varanasi on November 30, 2020, the PM had again spoken about the return of Goddess Annapurna’s idol from the MacKenzie Art Gallery at the museum of University of Regina in Canada. A virtual repatriation ceremony for the idol was held on November 19 and was attended by Dr Thomas Chase of the University of Regina, the high commissioner of India Ajay Bisaria and representatives of MacKenzie Art Gallery, Global Affairs Canada, and Canada Border Services Agency. The idol was part of the university’s collection steered by the MacKenzie Art Gallery through a longstanding partnership dating back to the early 1950s. Artist Divya Mehra had drawn attention about the idol while going through MacKenzie’s permanent collection and preparing for her exhibition From India to Canada and Back to India. The statue was part of the original 1936 bequest by Norman MacKenzie. When Mehra researched the story behind the idol, she found that MacKenzie had spotted it on his trip to India in 1913. A stranger had overheard MacKenzie’s desire to have it, and stole it for him from the temple on the banks of the Ganga at Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-yogi-to-attend-pran-pratistha-of-annapurna-idol-returned-by-canada/articleshow/87515166.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya Deepotsav sets fifth Guinness record in a row||AYODHYA: The moonless night of Wednesday lit up in a jiffy when the main Saryu ghat got illuminated with nearly 9.5 lakh diyas in one go, recording its name in history with the fifth consecutive Guinness World Record for the largest display of oil lamps, at Ram Ki Paidi. An official adjudicator along with the team from Guinness World Records was present in Ayodhya on the special eve. The official certificate declaring the world record has been handed over. A drone helped count the exact number of lamps: 9,41,551. The ghats looked majestic with the flickering wicks of lamps being reflected in the river Saryu. The chants of Jai Shri Ram reverberated all around, keeping energies high as people thronged the area in large numbers. Since early morning, about 14,000 volunteers of all age groups including students of 15 colleges and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University (RMLAU), people associated with 45 NGOs and NCC cadets had started to fill the earthen lamps with oil and wicks in preparation for the evening. Around 5.30pm, adjudicator Rishi Nath gave the green signal for lamps to be lit and it was done. Last year, RMLAU along with the state government’s tourism department, had created a record with over 6 lakh lamps being lit at the ghats. In fact, the two have been breaking their own world records for the largest oil lamp display every year, ever since the first record was made in Ayodhya on Diwali in 2017. For the newest record, a total of 10,95,645 lakh diyas were set up at 32 ghats of Ram Ki Paidi. The aim was to light up 9 lakh of these for the record. Another 3 lakh were placed at various maths and temples around the temple town. People lit up lamps in their homes too. “I have been coming to Ayodhya every year since 2017. I take a month-long Kalpvas in an ashram on Ram Ki Paidi and volunteer to set up the stage for Lord Ram’s welcome,” said Barabanki resident Vijaya Kumari (62). Kushi (10), who had also taken Kalpvas with her grandmother, was busy pouring oil in the lamps ahead of the illumination. Students of Saket Degree College Vikas Yadav (19) and Chandresh Yadav (18) were ecstatic to be volunteering for the event for the first time. “This is our city and we wanted to be part of history. There was a process to select volunteers and we were on cloud nine to have made it,” they said. Several other volunteers dressed in white paced up and down the ghats readying for the mega event. When it was declared that 9.4 lakh diyas had been counted successfully, a loud cheer filled the atmosphere. Firecrackers followed the festivities. After the lamps were lit, a 3D holographic show, projection mapping and a laser show based on Ramayana was showcased on the temples. Selfie with ‘Ravan’: Characters from the Shobha Yatra which was taken out earlier in the day were also roaming the streets around Naya Ghat. People were amused to see Ravan with his nine other heads dangling by the side. The man playing Lord Shiva with the snake around his neck also crossed the streets. Several people clicked selfies with the characters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-deepotsav-sets-5th-guinness-record-in-a-row/articleshow/87517743.cms||Yusra Husain

During the meeting, the party’s position in the polls was also discussed including the loss of both the seats to Congress. “The party anticipated defeat in both the seats, but they didn’t anticipate such a big defeat as its candidates secured third and fourth positions in Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar, respectively. Prima facie, the internal fight over the selection of candidates and rise in fuel prices have cost the party,” said the source. The party leaders have also held discussions on the statewide protest lined from November 15 over unfulfilled poll promises by the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-starts-to-analyse-poll-debacle-in-2-seats/articleshow/87517739.cms||---

The question before the SC was whether to interfere in the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had quashed certain allotments made by the Hooda government on FCFS basis for development of a group housing colony under the Final Development Plan of Gurgaon Manesar Urban Complex for 2025. A bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka said, "The undisputed facts which have emerged from the records are that neither in the public notice dated October 1, 2010, which came to be published on October 4, 2010, nor in the Final Development Plan of May 24, 2011, nor in policy instructions, which came to be circulated on July 5, 2012, regarding receipt and validity of the applications for grant of licence, prescribed that the method of allotment was on FCFS basis." Writing the judgment, Justice Rastogi said the Haryana government and its authorities are silent as to "from where this (FCFS) practice had been borrowed/adopted", which is alien by the scheme of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 Act or the 1976 Rules framed under this law. The bench found that though most realtors, who applied for land at Gurgaon-Manesar Urban Complex, had prior knowledge about the FCFS policy though the government had nowhere mentioned about it in the policy documents or made any public announcement, thus keeping the public at large in dark about such a scheme. As a result, there was a race among realtors for getting land allotted through the FCFS scheme, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/land-allotment-policy-on-gurgaon-manesar-complex-draws-sc-ire/articleshow/87517097.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Submitting a petition to Pudukottai district collector Kavitha Ramu and the district superintendent of police Nisha Parthiban on Tuesday, his wife R Birundha, who was married to him 40 days ago, stated that she was not allowed to identify the body of Rajkiran when it was brought in a sealed coffin to Kottaipattinam from Sri Lanka on October 23. Rajkiran drowned in the sea after a Sri Lankan navy vessel hit the trawler in which he and two other fishermen, S Sugandhan, 22, and A Xavier, 38, of Kottaipattinam, were allegedly crossing the IMBL on October 18. The two fishermen were arrested by the navy on October 20. The young woman also pointed out that there were no documents such as a death certificate and postmortem report. Postmortem was body was said to have been performed at Jaffna Medical College Hospital on October 22. “Therefore, it is not correct to assume an autopsy was indeed conducted on Rajkiran’s body,” she said. On seeing the photographs of the body and based on the information collected from the ‘eyewitnesses’ of the incident, Birundha said that Rajkiran sustained bullet injuries on his body. His face has been badly injured. She also stated that fresh blood on his body indicated that Rajkiran had not drowned due to the ‘collision’ as claimed by the Sri Lankan navy. Raking up all the suspicions, she demanded that a criminal case should be registered over the death of Rajkiran following which his body should be exhumed to enable her to identify her husband. She also demanded an autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fishermans-wife-wants-husbands-body-exhumed/articleshow/87517085.cms||---

The CBSE, which has schools in every state, has 22,903 students in the top 50,000, including several hundred from Rajasthan. The figures mean that out of every 100 top performers, 10 are from the state. Rough estimates say almost 2/3 of the students are from government schools with poor economic and rural backgrounds scripting success largely on their own. Ramnivas from nondescript Bhimtal village in Barmer has secured 712th rank in NEET. He cracked the exam without any formal coaching institute. “I prepared from RBSE books with help of my teachers ,” said Ramnivas. Dr Bharat Saran, a physician at a government hospital in Barmer, is running a sewa sanstha for 50 villagers providing free coaching to poor students eyeing to become doctors. This year, 10 students from his centre cracked the NEET exam by relying upon only textbooks. “RBSE is among the toughest board in the country since its beginning. Those who study science from RBSE develop a better aptitude for any competitive exams,” said Saran. Girdhar Singh, principal of a government senior secondary school in Malpura and a national award winner, has evaluated senior secondary books from different states for a national programme. He said, “The strength of RBSE lies in regular revision of syllabus. It doesn’t update the curriculum keeping what other boards in mind but also taking inspiration from the international curriculum. The teaching pedagogy followed by teachers is also responsible for the power-packed result,” said Singh. TOI called up education minister Govind Singh Dotasra and RBSE chairman DP Jaroli but were not available for comments. Sources said it was the overall best performance by the state superseding the state boards of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The figures revealed that 13 boards have more than 50% of the share in the top 50. The state has the fifth-highest number of students who appeared in NEET, which is still is a very big figure for the state which is among the worst in terms of literacy levels. In fact, the state has earned disrepute for having the worst literacy rate among women in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/10-of-nations-top-neet-performers-are-from-raj/articleshow/87517746.cms||Shoeb Khan

Speaking to reporters media in Ajmer, Pilot said, “The three farm laws, increasing price of petrol and diesel, unavailability of fertilisers and rising inflation have affected the masses and left people anguished.” He claimed that votes had been cast against the central government for destroying the system built over years. Voters exercised their franchise against the BJP in Himachal Pradesh too. He said the BJP does not even look like an opposition party in Rajasthan as deposits of their candidates have been forfeited leaving them in third and fourth positions. The Congress has been on a winning track in the bypolls in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan, which shows people are looking for a change now, he added. Pilot, who was in Jodhpur on Wednesday to express condolences at former minister and religious head of Madhav Singh Diwan’s residence in Bilara on the demise of his son and former secretary of Rajastha Youth Congress Mohabbat Singh Nimbole in Jaitaran in Pali district while talking to media said the BJP was not capable to ruling even when it was in power and the recent results, first in HP and now in Rajasthan was a clear indication that only Congress was a hope for the people. “Today Congress has been steadily growing under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and people, who are frustrated by the autocratic rule of the BJP, have been looking up to Congress for change,” Pilot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-are-tired-of-bjp-says-pilot-after-congs-bypoll-win/articleshow/87517754.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Interfaith couple alleges assault by wife’s family||Thiruvananthapuram: A young interfaith couple has raised allegations that the husband who belongs to a scheduled caste community, was brutally assaulted by the wife’s brother, who belongs to a Christian forward community. The Chirayinkeezhu police under rural district police have registered a case, invoking relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and launched a search for the accused. Midhun Krishnan, 26, and Deepthi George, 24, are the couple who have raised allegations of harassment. Deepthi's brother, Danish George, who is a doctor by profession, has gone absconding following the incident, the police said.  The police also said that the alleged crime took place on Sunday outside Deepthi's residence. The case was registered on Monday after Midhun's mother Ambika filed a complaint with the Chirayinkeezhu police. Mithun Krishna is currently undergoing treatment at medical college hospital and his statement is yet to be recorded. Speaking to the media, Deepthi alleged that her brother attacked Mithun Krishna after he refused to accept her family's offer to either convert to Christianity or back off from the relationship. The family even offered Mithun Krishna money to call off the wedding with her, she alleged. Attingal DSP Suneesh Babu, who is leading the investigation, said that a special team has been constituted and dispatched to Tamil Nadu in search of the absconding accused. The police have collected surveillance camera footage of the alleged attack. The DSP also said that though the young couple has raised allegations of attempts at forced religious conversion, the complaint filed by Ambika does not mention this. The investigation team is also taking legal opinion regarding steps to be taken on this in case the couple stand firm on this accusation and their statement would be recorded then. According to the police, Deepthi allegedly eloped with Mithun Krishna, who works as a data entry staff at an Akshaya Centre at Kadakkavoor, during the early hours of October 29. On the same day, they appeared before the Chirayinkeezhu police and Deepthi informed them that she wanted to go with Mithun Krishna. Her father and brother too were present at the station then. A day later, her father and brother visited Mithun's home and invited them to their church to talk about the marriage. It was then they allegedly demanded Mithun to convert to Christianity. He promptly rejected this demand. On their return journey they were taken to Deepthi's home to meet her mother. But her mother allegedly refused to let them inside the house. Following which the wife’s family started to engange in a quarrel with Mithun Krishna and his friends, who were accompanying them. It was during this tussle the alleged castiest slurs were used against Mithun and he was thrashed by the wife’s brother Danish George, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/interfaith-couple-alleges-assault-by-wifes-family/articleshow/87516307.cms||---

The pipeline that supplies raw water to Cantonment water works was breached on Saturday night, causing flooding in Panmala. Pune Municipal Corporation had initiated repairs, expected to get over by Tuesday. Officials attributed the delay to unavailability of parts. “Since the pipeline is old, its parts were not readily available. The casting of these parts is in the final stages and they will arrive by tomorrow, after which PMC’s water supply department will begin installation. The work will be completed on a war footing to restart the supply. It will take another three-four days,” an official from PMC’s water supply department said. The administration has been lifting water from the Mutha canal. Water supply to the areas like Kharadi, Hadapsar, Mohammadwadi was affected due to the breach. Officials said water was being supplied to all the areas and that there have been no major complaints. “We are monitoring the situation. Pressure is low in some parts of Hadapsar,” an official said. Meanwhile, the administration has reopened Sinhagad Road for traffic after repairing a part that was damaged by the breach. A lane close to the divider where pipeline was breached is closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pipeline-repair-to-take-3-more-days/articleshow/87494387.cms||---

All the dams at Tirumala including Papavinasam, Gogarbham, Kumaradhara-Pasupudhara and Akasa Ganga have reached their full capacity. Tirupati MP M Gurumoorthy, who inspected Gogarbham dam, said the water levels had reached full reservoir levels and the crest gates were lifted almost after 6 years to let water downstream. Non-stop rains have inundated Madhura Nagar and several low-lying colonies in the temple city.

---||Ahmedabad||Traditional ‘chopda’ a hit with architects, designers||Ahmedabad: Kartikeya Sarabhai, the founder-director of the city-based Centre for Environment Education (CEE) is often seen clutching a red or yellow bound book — mostly associated with the traditional account keeping. “I have been using these books for many years,” he said. “I may have about 100 of them now. I jot down thoughts in them. The books are handy and very sturdy.” As Diwali heralds the ‘chopda pujan’ ceremony on Thursday, one of the integral and most crucial items on the table will be a red book — either with plastic or cloth cover. The traders reverently invoke their family deities, seek blessings for good profits in the Gujarati New Year, and make 15 marks with vermillion on the first page of the book. Even though much of the accounting work has shifted to computers, for small traders, the tradition is revered. “But for the past several years, we have also been catering to another class when it comes to the chopda — students and professionals,” said Mohammad Moin Soniwala, one of the bookmakers in Manek Chowk. The Soniwalas are among the kagdi families of the Walled City that still make hand-stitched books. Kagdi stands for ‘papermaker’ in Gujarati. “Due to durability, low cost, and good quality of plain paper, we get a lot of demand from designers and architects,” said Soniwala. “While the books of accounts are in demand around Diwali, we create the books for other professionals through the year.” Soniwala added: “For these professionals, we have changed the size to the more common A4 or smaller. We have also changed the binding, sometimes even integrating special cloth like ajrakh on demand.” Small notepads with the same binding — although done on sewing machines — also make a good souvenir for visitors to the city, said booksellers. Altaf Kagdi, another bookseller, said that his establishment recently made a folio book, half the width and double the length of a traditional book. It was for a French architect who often visits the city and orders the specific book. “The design of the book sets it apart as something from the bygone era. Besides, it has rugged functionality,” he said. Prof Rutul Joshi, a faculty member at Cept University, said that he had started using the ‘chopda’ during his student years and remains hooked to them. “The plain paper gives scope for the exploration of architectural ideas,” he said. “The best part is that the pages don’t yellow easily and withstand all weather conditions. So a ‘chopda’ has remained my constant companion.” Manoj Mistry, the owner of a stationery shop near NID, said the books have remained in demand among students primarily due to their looks. “But we also get regular demand from professionals,” he said. Soniwala said that in terms of sales at his shop, accounting and non-accounting books now comprise a 50:50 ratio. “We still get demand from small traders from Rajasthan and Maharashtra for account books,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traditional-chopda-a-hit-with-architects-designers/articleshow/87516301.cms||Parth Shastri

BJP members alleged mischief in submission of ward boundaries draft prepared by BMC to SEC. Tweets by BJP workers on the issue have the hashtag. Andheri MLA Ameet Satam on Wednesday tweeted, “I have written a letter to the State Election Commissioner & Chief Election Commissioner regarding illegal submission of ward boundaries draft prepared by @mybmc to State Election Commission. Also, there’s a horrendous plan to remove names of voters from certain pockets across Mumbai from the voter list. #ShivsenaCheatsMumbaikar.” In the letter to chief election commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra and SEC U P S Madan, a copy of which is with TOI, Satam and corporator Vinod Mishra said there should be a forensic investigation into BMC’s draft. “A forensic audit of computers, laptops and email IDs of officials from BMC’s election and IT departments should be conducted. BMC officials must be asked to immediately freeze data they submitted to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal. An investigation should be ordered into the role of the civic chief in sharing demographic data with the chief minister,” they said. BJP also asked SEC not to act on data and draft boundaries submitted by BMC. “SEC must keep a strict watch on preparation of electoral rolls and ensure people are not deprived of their right to exercise their franchise. It is necessary to investigate the allegations against the BMC chief for manipulating data at the behest of his political masters,” the letter stated. BMC on October 26 submitted a final draft of the rectified electoral ward boundaries of Mumbai’s 227 electoral wards to SEC. BMC’s election department officials said they had completed rectification of boundaries of constituencies and around 20% boundaries have been changed. A senior official said, “During verification there were 15-20% changes depending on population migration in case it happened in the ward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mischief-in-submission-of-ward-boundaries-draft-to-sec-says-bjp/articleshow/87517100.cms||Richa Pinto

The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Monday detained the suspect for questioning. “Prima facie, the probe revealed that the man had duped many people from the twin towns, Pune and also from around the district. He had sold the stolen cars in various parts of the state. Our probe is on,” said a senior police officer, adding that cops are in the process of recovering the stolen vehicles, and also looking into whether any more people are involved in the crime. Rakesh Badgi (34), an employee of private bank, had filed a complaint against the suspect with the Daund police. Badgi told TOI that he had come in contact with the suspect through his neighbour. The suspect had taken Badgi’s neighbour’s car for a monthly rental of Rs25,000. When Badgi checked with the IT company where his car was supposedly being used, he found that the company had made no such agreement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khed-travel-agent-stole-21-more-cars-in-daund/articleshow/87494395.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mangaluru||Fuel price rise affects taxi operators||Magaluru: Those operating taxis and maxi cabs, who were hoping to recover from the losses incurred due to the pandemic this festive season, are severely hit due to the rise in fuel prices. Anand K, general secretary, Dakshina Kannada Taximen and Maxicab Association, told TOI, “The pandemic has hit us really hard, and many taxi and maxi cab owners are struggling to pay loans. Many drivers have shifted to other professions. We were expecting business to take off this festive season from Dasara onwards, as people have started travelling around, especially to temples in and across the state. However, business is not happening on expected lines. Customers, after an initial inquiry, generally tend to compare the fares with the last trip, and feel that travelling in their own vehicle, or borrowing a friend or relative’s vehicle works out cheaper. Though we do have a good number of inquiries, the same are not converted into business.” The cabs too have increased their fares. He said that cabs that used to charge Rs 2,500 per day, have increased the fares to Rs 3,000 per day for 250 km, which is a minimum distance that a consumer has to pay for, whether they cover the distance or not. The earlier fares were fixed when diesel cost Rs 60 per litre, Anand said. “We recently met the commissioner of transport with a request to fix the fares through the District Road Transport Authority (RTA). However, though that may not be possible, the commissioner has assured to look into various problems that we shared with him. We hope the government takes measures to crack down on own-board (white number plate) vehicles that are used as taxis. This is further adding to the crisis of taxi owners. Private vehicles are deliberately being rented out to taxi services by owners for making money, and in case of an accident, the insurance claim will certainly be an issue,” he said. The association has also requested the authorities at the Mangaluru International Airport to reduce the parking fees. There are nearly 2,600 members with about 5,000 vehicles in the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fuel-price-rise-affects-taxi-operators/articleshow/87515190.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

---||Lucknow||Grandeur, development of Treta Yug is back in Ayodhya, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||AYODHYA: “Yogiji ek kaam karo, mandir ka nirman karo”. Reminding the people that this was the slogan that welcomed him when he visited Ayodhya for the first time after becoming the CM in 2017, Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that the most revered of the seven sanatan dharma cities (saptapuri) is not just witnessing the grandeur of the Treta Yug but is also being developed on the lines characteristic of that age. “You may have forgotten your demand, but I did not forget my work. In a few years from now, by 2023 to be precise, Ayodhya will become India’s most sought-after religious centre. The increasing scale of Ayodhya Deepotsav (from 51,000 lamps in 2017 to 12 lakh lamps today) speaks for our vision),” the chief minister said. “While the Treta Yuga like Diwali in Ayodhya has been restored, it is undeniable that the temple town is on a Treta Yug like vikas yatra (journey of development),” the CM said while launching projects and schemes worth over Rs 600 crore for the temple town. Adding that the idea of Deepotsav came after realisation that while the world celebrated Diwali, it was a low-key affair in the city of its origin. “Diwali is Ayodhya’s gift to the world and the festival cannot remain a plain and simple affair in the city of its origin. We also felt that if the glory of Ayodhya had to be restored on the global platform, a gala deepotsav was necessary,” he said. Saying that five years ago it was unimaginable to organise a deepotsava of this grand scale, Yogi said: “UP has become the focal point of faith with the central and state governments working together to achieve new heights of development.” Reiterating the slogan ‘Jo kaha woh kiya’, the CM said that the success of his government in the past 4.5 years can be measured with the faith and trust that people bestow upon it. “In the days to come, Ayodhya will be linked with cities of the world once the international airport project gets functional. The new face of Ayodhya will speak for the power of faith, patience (vis-à-vis ongoing Ram Temple construction) and development,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/grandeur-devpt-of-treta-yug-is-back-in-ayodhya-says-yogi/articleshow/87517759.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Pune||Pune couple wanted for fraud held at Delhi airport||PUNE: Koregaon Park resident Alnesh Somji (37) and his wife, Dimple (38), who face charges of duping one of their former employees and two other investors of Rs3.37 crore, were nabbed from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGAI) in Delhi before they could fly out to Canada. In the FIR registered with the Koregaon Park police on October 27, complainant Yogesh Dixit alleged that in 2010 Alnesh convinced him to invest Rs40 lakh of retirement benefits received by his (Dixit’s) father in the real estate business and get returns at 24% per annum. The complainant said he got returns till 2018, and thereafter the firm stopped giving him returns. In the FIR, Dixit named two other investors from Rasta Peth and Camp, including an elderly woman, who invested over Rs1 crore each and alleged that the firm collectively owed them Rs3.37 crore, inclusive of interest. On October 29, the police issued a lookout notice for the Somjis, as they did not turn up in response to three summons, at all airports. A city crime branch team took the couple into custody in Delhi on Monday night. “The two are being brought to Pune after a Delhi court on Tuesday issued a two-day transit warrant to facilitate their travel and production before a Pune court,” crime branch inspector Balaji Pandhare said. Alnesh’s father, Akil Somji, in a statement released through a PR agency, denied all the allegations levelled by Dixit. He said Dixit acted with mala fide intention by not disclosing to the police that the Somjis had returned all his money on October 25 — two days before the registration of the FIR. The statement said the other two persons, named as investors in the FIR, did not file any case and the Somjis did not owe them any money. Dixit told TOI, “I did receive the money as claimed by the Somjis, but that was after I approached the police with a complaint application and an inquiry was started. My family and I went through hard times all these years to get our money back.” Inspector Pandhare said, “The complainant has so far given us no confirmation about having received his money. The FIR was the culmination of an inquiry process which was started 10 days before it came to be lodged. The police had thrice issued summons but the Somjis did not respond.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-wanted-for-fraud-held-at-delhi-airport/articleshow/87494415.cms||---

The deceased Manji Sonagra’s body was fished out of Narmada canal on Tuesday. According to police, Sonagra had borrowed Rs 7 lakh from Jeram Dalwadi through Naran Dalwadi and Prakash Koli. As Sonagra was not able to repay the amount, the trio had been harassing him for the past sometime. Sonagra’s son told police that some days ago the trio had visited their farm and forcefully purchased cotton bales at half price. They even threatened Sonagra to hand over the ownership of his house to them if he could not repay the loan. Due to the harassment, Sonagra used to remain worried. On the afternoon of November 1, Sonagra left home and did not return till late night. The family members unsuccessfully searched for him in and around the village.

Only progress is said to be acquisition of land, which by itself is not a solution of the problem, said the NGT in a recent order. “When a serious situation of water pollution has been found and directions issued by this tribunal in the year 2017 and in spite of funds being available, the problem remains unattacked, it may be a clear case of failure of the authorities to perform their duties, to the detriment of the citizens for which accountability needs to be fixed,” the order said.RIICO in its affidavit had said the upgrade of CETP was in the process and for utilising treated effluent, the steps for giving contract were in the process and would be completed within 18 months from the date of the work order (for which no date is indicated). RIICO had also said the stand of the state is that sewerage treatment plant has been created for managing sewage and RIICO is to take steps for utilization of treated effluent. RIICO said that the works are in the process of being awarded. The work for setting up of the STP by the Municipal Council is also in the process.But the NGT order said there is nothing in the said reports which can rebut the findings in the reports of the joint committee of central Pollution Control Board to the extent of continuing violations or question the assessment of compensation which is in fact based on very conservative approach and may need upward revision so as to ensure that cost of restoration is met. Since the issue involved herein relates to the compliance of CETP and STPs, apart from both Rajasthan and Haryana individually monitoring compliance, CPCB is required to resolve inter-state issues under the Water Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ngt-blames-raj-for-not-making-effluent-plant-functional/articleshow/87517806.cms||---

On Tuesday, according to Raikhad municipal corporator Beena Parmar’s account, two boards were prepared together. One was for Rangani Mata temple and the other for the pol. It appeared to some that the agency had mistakenly swapped the newly painted boards. But other local residents clicked images of Gandhi Chowk’s board being repainted. “Had there been an incident of a board swap why was the board repainted?” said a local resident of Gandhi Chowk. “Also, why would a board meant exclusively for a temple have ‘chowk’ against its name? There was an attempt to change our address.” Another corporator from Raikhad area, Afsana Chisti, said: “There is no controversy now. The board with Gandhi Chowk painted on it has been restored.” Chisti added: “For many decades, our mailing address, including that for our tax and billing documents, has borne the name of Gandhi Chowk. The local residents were worried.” Parmar added: “There is a temple just opposite Gandhi Chowk and the agency had mistakenly swapped the boards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pols-gandhigiri-bapu-stays-on-address/articleshow/87516323.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Why acquire land without compensation: Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Emphasizing that the state is not expected to take the land of people and not pay compensation, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday sought the personal affidavits of the additional chief secretaries of the concerned departments of Uttar Pradesh. Hearing the petitions filed by Jeet Narayan Yadav and two others, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Piyush Agrawal fixed December 3, 2021, as the next date of hearing. All three petitioners had submitted that their land was taken but no compensation has been paid to them. The court took a serious note of the submission and observed that it regularly hears such matters where either the land is acquired and possession thereof has been taken but no compensation has been paid or cases where possession has been taken without acquisition of land and without payment of compensation. It was pointed out that land is mostly acquired by revenue department, public works department or irrigation department following which the court directed the additional chief secretaries of the three departments to get a list of such cases pending in this court prepared along with the issues raised therein. They have also been asked to apprise the court as to what steps have been taken to resolve the grievances of the petitioners as the state is not expected to take the land of people and not pay compensation. The court also directed the additional chief secretaries to file personal affidavits by the next date of hearing i.e., December 3, 2021. In another similar case, (Ram Kailash Nishad and others v. State of U.P. and others), the Allahabad High Court has directed all the district magistrates of the state to dispose of the pending applications by February 18, 2022, seeking compensation or raising objection in respect of farmers’ land being taken without following the acquisition process and the action taken on them. This petition will be next heard on February 25, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/state-not-expected-to-acquire-landwithout-paying-compensation-hc/articleshow/87515237.cms||---

According to officials in the employment department, proposals were pitched to consider having Industrial Training Institute (ITI) or Rajasthan Knowledge Corporation Limited (RKCL) as its training partner for the scheme. Two Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) employees, Ashok Sangwan and Rahul Garg, were arrested by the ACB for accepting a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from a complainant in lieu of clearing his pending bills of Rs 1.5 crore. Apart from these two, Pawan, Gawande, and Kartar Singh (general manager) were named as accused in the bribery case. Pawan, who also held the post of secretary labour and employment department, was shunted out of the secretariat to Bikaner as commissioner, colonisation. Minister for employment and entrepreneurship (independent charge) Ashok Chandna said, “First, the government ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes) are not available in every block of the state. RSLDC centres have been set up in every block for training purposes. Second, the duration of ITI courses is longer and for the whole year. Hence, it is not obligatory for this (skill training for unemployed youths under the scheme).” “Does any department stop functioning if it is embroiled in controversies? This is a decision of the government. It is a good thing that ACB has taken action against those who were involved in malpractices. But, the department will keep functioning. It doesn’t stop functioning if one or two employees indulge in wrongdoings,” added Chandna. The repackaged scheme mandates four-hour internship per day for five days a week at state government offices or enterprises for jobless youths (beneficiaries) to avail the benefits of the scheme. The beneficiaries will stop getting the allowance if they discontinue internship, stated fresh guidelines for the scheme issued by the employment department. Under the new scheme, the unemployment allowance will be increased from Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 for girls, specially-abled persons and transgenders, and from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for boys. Now two lakh beneficiaries will be eligible for the scheme every year, which is an increase from 1.6 lakh until now. A beneficiary will be eligible for unemployment allowance for 2 years. If they don’t have any professional degree or diploma (for example: BEd, BTech, MBBS, BSc nursing, or BPharma), they will have to undertake skill training for three months conducted by RSLDC. The beneficiaries will have to wear a cap, t-shirt, or a jacket with the name of scheme inscribed on it while on duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/tainted-dept-made-training-partner-for-govt-scheme/articleshow/87522679.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Silver imports in October at almost 7-year high||AHMEDABAD: It’s raining gold? No, it’s a silver rush this festive season! Buoyed by upbeat demand on festive muhurats of Dussehra and Pushya Nakshatra, silver imports in October surged to nearly a seven-year high. Some 146-metric tonne silver was imported in Gujarat in the month of October according to data compiled by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC). The last time silver imports were this high was in December 2014, at 166.96 MT. Bullion traders and jewellers attributed the surge in sale to the muhurat purchases that took place since Navratri, despite a rise in silver prices. “Silver demand has remained good over the past two months, not just for bars, coins and artefacts made of silver but even jewellery on both the festive muhurats. An estimated 9% decline in prices in early part of October did encourage jewellers to stock up for the upcoming festive and wedding season. Moreover, increasing number of young professionals tend to buy more of silver jewellery, that is light on the pocket and comes with elegant and trendy designs,” said Jigar Soni, president, India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) – Gujarat chapter. After a decline in prices last month, silver prices have firmed up once again to Rs 65,800 per kg as on Monday. Besides silver, gold demand also remained upbeat from both retail consumers as well as investors, who generously made muhurat purchases. Gold import stood at 5.3 metric tonnes (MT) in October, up 110% against October 2020, suggests AACC data. This was largely driven by increased procurement by jewellers for festive season. In fact, at least 400kg gold was traded in Ahmedabad alone on festive muhurats of Dussehra and Pushya Nakshatra. Weddings which were to take place last year due to the pandemic situation and are being held after Diwali and this has generated a lot of pent-up demand for gold. “Wedding jewellery comprises most part of purchases during festive muhurats as people have booked their orders for deliveries well in advance. The sale was good on Pushya Nakshatra. Besides this, demand for bullion is also good. People have realised the value of gold during the pandemic and are investing in gold eyeing handsome returns over a long period,” said Ashish Zaveri, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silver-imports-in-oct-at-almost-7-yr-high/articleshow/87516353.cms||Niyati Parikh

The list was released by the world-renowned university a few days back. Out of eight scientists who figure in the top 2 per cent list include three from AU’s department of Biochemistry including Prof Bechan Sharma, Prof Abhay Pandey and Prof SI Rizvi, two from the department of Botany including Prof SM Prasad and Prof DK Chauhan and one each from the Department of Material Science (Prof Ravindra Dhar), K Banerjee Centre of Oceanography (assistant professor Sudhir Singh) and department of Chemistry (Prof MC Chattopadhyay). The report was prepared by Prof John PA loannidis of Stanford University and his team and published by Elsevier. Total 3,352 Indian researchers found a place in this list that represents the valuable impact of India on the global research platform, said AU’s Dean (Research and Development) Prof SI Rizvi. Talking to TOI, Prof Rizvi added that the inclusion of eight faculty members in the coveted list is a big achievement for AU which is grappling with the huge number of vacant faculty positions. The University is preparing a conducive environment for research and the researchers are being given high-class facilities to carry out their work in cutting edge research areas. To give impetus to research, the University has instituted two prestigious awards; the Dronacharya award to be given to a faculty member of the rank of Assistant Professor) and the M N Saha award for the best research scholar in Science and Humanities. The two awards will be announced during the convocation in front of the Education Minister, said Rizvi. It is worth mentioning that despite the decrease in the strength of faculty, the research output of the University is exemplary. The data from SCOPUS shows that the citation impact of research papers published from Allahabad University is 0.99. It is to be noted that the world average value is 1. This data shows that the quality of research at Allahabad University is at par with world standards. The number of research papers published (indexed in Scopus) from Allahabad University during the period 2016-20 is 1728, and the H-index of the University is 39 which is very good, informed the Dean, Research and Development. The recent achievement of Allahabad University scientists will certainly be an inspiration to young faculty members and research scholars, added Prof Rizvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/8-au-researchers-feature-in-stanford-univs-list-of-top-2-scientist/articleshow/87515354.cms||---

Due to pandemic situation in the state, the state education board had earlier allowed schools to admit students till September 20. This deadline was later extended to October 31 to ensure that students are not left out of the admission process. “The district education officers have been directed to make sure that schools do not enrol students after the October 31 deadline. This is done keeping in view that academic interests of students. If students are now given admission, their course curriculum may not be completed in time,” said sources close to the development. Due to mass promotion for the academic year 2020-21, schools were expected to see a big rush for admissions this year. Of the 7.92 lakh regular students, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared the Class X board exams last year.

Driven by these sentiments, the Nizamuddin Dargah has been providing a beautiful example of communal harmony on Diwali. “For four years, non-Muslim followers of Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya have been coming to the dargah before Diwali to illuminate it with diyas,” said Altamash Nizami, member of the Dargah Committee. “It is a unique example of communal harmony.” The resting place of the Sufi saint has always drawn people from across faiths. “It is not only during Diwali that people from different faiths come here with their festive sentiments to express their love for Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya,” said Nizami. “Even during Holi, programmes are organised here that attract people from across faiths.” The dargah was lit with chirags through the year, on Diwali it’s a different view with diyas added to the lights, said Nizami. “It is a way for adherents to express their love for the saint,” added Nizami. Several non-Muslim devotees arriving at the dargah with diyas a day before Diwali told TOI they did not want to be named because their love for Nizamuddin was personal to them. However, they added that that dargah visit was not about religion. “It’s about the peace one doesn’t find everywhere but here. It’s only to be experienced — it’s a sentiment beyond description,” said one of them. A Hindu visitor, lighting an earthen lamp, said, “The richness of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb blending in the echoing voices of qawwals in praise of Lord Krishna and Hazrat Ali sums it up. The light shines for everyone at Nizamuddin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nizamuddin-dargah-lit-up-with-diyas-on-diwali/articleshow/87517202.cms||---

Also there is the multi-storeyed car parking that can accommodate 600 cars for which a traffic dispersal plan is needed. For this, RITES has been engaged to come up with a proper traffic management plan,” said NDITA chairman Debashis Sen. The authorities on Friday initiated the process to engage a firm for doing a route survey of the western and eastern side of Sector V.  The authorities are feeling the need to reduce traffic congestion at important crossings of Sector V with a system that will quickly disperse vehicular traffic in key intersections. Officials said that RITES will do a detailed study of the existing traffic situation in Sector V at peak hours which will include the existing traffic infrastructure and conditions along with recommendations as to how the traffic dispersal plan could be implemented. The traffic dispersal plan will also include suggestions on infrastructural changes such as demarcating parking bays, no parking zones, cycle lanes and also suggestions on the transportation options such as electric vehicles, e-bikes and public bicycles. NDITA was also working on the plan to turn a key stretch from Infinity Benchmark to RDB Boulevard into a pedestrian plaza where no cars will be allowed to enter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rites-to-prepare-traffic-plan-for-sector-v/articleshow/87516423.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Training for the visually impaired teachers||Thiruvananthapuram: The participants of the on-going training programme for the visually impaired teachers in G-suite are hopeful of broadening the opportunities of interaction with the students. The programme was initiated by the KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education). About 65 teachers from primary to higher secondary schools from the district are participating in the training program. The training is done through a screen reading software. The data will be converted into sound with the help of the software ORCA. Teachers with visual impairments will be able to overcome their restrictions by using this software. “As a result of the pandemic, schools are adopting a hybrid approach to education, which includes both online and offline components. As a result, visually impaired teachers must be familiar with the application. The 65 teachers were divided into six groups. Two such groups will attend the training session each day. This training will make it easier for them to use the G-suit platform for pupils,” said Sophiya S, master trainer at KITE. “It is usually difficult for the visually impaired teachers to interact with students during the online classes. So, this is a solution for that. It is a screen-reading technology. The visually impaired teachers can utilize this technology with the help of an assistive software,” said Vinod B, master trainer and a teacher at government school for visually impaired, Vazhuthacaud. The teachers attending the programme said it is going to benefit them a lot. “I used to make phone calls to my students when the limitations of the pandemic hit the blind teachers so hard. Then we began using WhatsApp and Telegram. I was concerned about the difficulty in using G-suit, but this training helped us to learn quickly. It will help us to give the information to different students. It was difficult for us to check WhatsApp when students send their academic works individually,” said Smitha Shyamgiri, a teacher participating the training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/training-for-the-visually-impaired-teachers/articleshow/87516420.cms||---

The civic officials claim that the number of dogs being sterilized at the animal birth control centre is increasing gradually and shortly they will achieve the target of 1,800-2,000 sterilization every month. As per the officials, on an average more than 500 dog bite cases are reported in the district every month. However, they say it is not possible to shift the dogs somewhere else from their habitat. Since 2015 when the civic body had started the animal birth control programme in the city, it has operated upon 55,000 stray dogs, whereas the initial plan was to sterilize only 25,000. But lack of planning forced the authorities to continue the programme because they had not conducted any survey to find out the exact number of stray dogs in the city. This is the reason that even now the officials are not clear till what time this programme will continue. However, for increasing the number of operations, capacity at the animal birth control centre has been increased. Municipal corporation senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Singh Dhalla says, “Initially, there was no planning and sterilizations were done in a haphazard manner, but now we are doing it properly and ward wise to cover all areas. The complaints about dog bites or nuisance will continue because we can only operate upon the dogs, and cannot shift them elsewhere. Now as the number of dogs being sterilized is increasing gradually, their population will come under control.”A resident of Haibowal, Vanita Gupta, says, “The authorities should come out with a plan whereby all stray dogs are sterilized. The civic body should construct proper dog pounds outside city limits to control bite cases.” A retired professor from PAU veterinary college Dr Prannath Verman, who is a member of Vets’ Club, says, “Without a specific scheme, the civic body will not be able to control this menace. The MC should first focus on female dogs, as these give birth twice in a year and in one time about five pups are delivered. So the MC should consider the birth rate while making plans to control their population. With the involvement of the industry, the civic body should run programmes to get stray dogs adopted or keep them in pounds.” Scarcity of dog catchers Though a private firm has been catching stray dogs and operating upon them, there is shortage of skilled catchers. The officials claim that due to Diwali and Chhath Puja, labourers have moved to their hometowns, so dog catching will slow down, but it will pick up pace after festivals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sterilization-pace-up-but-stray-dog-menace-continues/articleshow/87515333.cms||---

For example, the fare increase for Dubai is three times the cost during the same period last year, 30% higher for Maldives, 20% for Europe etc. For key domestic destinations, pricing is almost two times for Goa, 20% more for Manali and 25% for Jaipur,” said Indiver Rastogi, president and group head for global business travel at Thomas Cook (India) and SOTC. With the restoration of domestic air capacity to 100% and reopening of the airport, we expect rationalization of pricing, Rastogi added. A spokesperson of travel portal Yatra.com said airfares increased by 36% compared to Diwali last year. “Airfares from Pune increased by around 20% this year compared to 2020. Passenger traffic increased by nearly 100% during Diwali,” said the spokesperson. City-based travel companies said that compared to Diwali 2020, the number of people travelling this year has almost doubled. “However, compared to pre-pandemic times, there is a deficit of around 25%. Airfares are nearly at par with pricing during Diwali 2019. Last year, the number of flights were fewer, people weren’t vaccinated and regulations were more, which isn’t the case now,” said Santosh Gupta, the owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays. Another travel company representative said that compared to the pre-pandemic traffic, Pune still lags by 40%. “That has not affected airfares, which are much higher. In 2019, one-way fare from Pune to Jaipur was around Rs 14,000 during Diwali. Last year, it was around Rs 9,500. This year, it is nearly Rs 15,000. Airfares are high because more people are travelling, compared to last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travel-soars-airfares-nearly-at-par-with-pre-pandemic-levels/articleshow/87516413.cms||Joy Sengupta

After the deadlier second wave of Covid-19 this year, and many getting at least one shot of the vaccine, this year’s Diwali is indeed one of hope and gusto. Optimistic and confident with their two shots, people are finally looking forward to little celebrations — shopping their hearts out and spring-cleaning and decorating their homes with some extra fervour. People are also displaying the best floral rangolis, hosting or attending intimate Diwali or pre-Diwali gatherings, preparing sweets and savouries at home, and dancing and merrymaking. What is Diwali if not fun and festive spirit! While some have travel plans, others are willing to bask in the silence and cosy emptiness of Ahmedabad, and enjoy its carefree, deadline-free mornings. “Diwali and New Year will mean meeting and greeting family members, enjoying those precious afternoon naps after scrumptious meals, and staying put at home to enjoy some downtime,” said Dharati Parikh, an Ahmedabad-based teacher. “It indeed feels a bit closer to normal after the topsy-turvy year and a half that was.” The bustle is back in the market and traders and retailers are enjoying increasing footfalls and buoyant consumer sentiment, which is keeping their cash registers ringing. At the same time, those willing to escape the ordinary are flocking to remote destinations. “I am travelling with my husband, son, and our pack of dogs. We’re headed to a distant homestay near Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand,” said Richa Singh, a city-based entrepreneur. People in city ready for Diwali, prepare festive treats“We plan to be away from our customary routines, mobile network, and the city’s hustle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diwali-brings-radiance-of-hope-confidence/articleshow/87516409.cms||---
---||Pune||Politicians’ greetings dot skyline, Pune citizens vent ire||PUNE: Hoardings, flexes and Diwali lanterns featuring local political figures wishing people Happy Diwali have come up at every nook and corner of the city. Citizens have been complaining on social media about such hoardings, defacing public places. Most of these banners and other things have come up in the past week. “I do not understand the logic behind these hoardings. Do these politicians think that citizens would be impressed by their photographs? Or do they think that we would vote for them if we keep seeing them? Just because they are politicians, even the local body doesn’t want to tear the hoardings down, fearing repercussions,” said a hairstylist in Baner. TimesViewHundreds of illegal banners wishing residents a &quot;happy Diwali&quot; have mushroomed across city streets in most municipal wards. In their complaints to the civic body the citizens have rightly argued that these hoardings have become a major eye sore. With the civic polls likely in February 2022 supporters of many local aspirants will continue to indulge in such publicity stunts in the coming months. The civic body must impose a heavy penalty on the offenders, besides razing the illegal banners.Vihang Shah, who has complained against such banners to the Pune Municipal Corporation on its social media handle, said that while some action was taken till last month, there has been no action from the civic body since the last week or two. “Every 10 minutes, you can see one or the other local or state politician’s face peering down at you, either inviting you to a Diwali Pahat or wishing you a happy Diwali. Almost all of them are illegal. In some places, they almost cover the signal, or the signboards if you try to look at these from a distance. First, they are defacing public property and secondly, they are not even paying for legally putting up banners. Some of the hoardings are erected on footpath jutting out in odd angles,” said Shah. An assistant municipal commissioner, while acknowledging the problem, said, “We will bring down illegal banners and posters. It is illegal to hang Diwali lanterns on junctions etc. All of them are done by politicians or their cronies. Most of these boards etc are erected at the dead of night and taking action against people whose faces appear on banners is not possible because they can always claim they did not do it. In this case, catching the real perpetrators is hard. We are trying to take down as many as we can and also urge citizens to complain to us whenever they see these hoardings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/politicians-greetings-dot-skyline-citizens-vent-ire/articleshow/87516387.cms||Ardhra Nair

While the woman, Mubarak Sultanova, had pleaded guilty and sought her sentence to be limited to the 55 days she had already spent in jail when first arrested, both the magistrate court and the sessions court sentenced her to two years in jail, while assuming that it was the minimum sentence under the section she was charged. The high court, however, found that the magistrate court that first convicted her and the sessions court that upheld the conviction, had both committed an error by holding that the offence under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act is punishable with imprisonment for not less than two years. “Though this offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, it does not provide a minimum sentence. The trial court and the appellate court committed an error, by holding that the offence under Section 14 is punishable with imprisonment for not less than two years,” the high court said. The high court further said that it appeared that both the courts inadvertently read Section 14-A of the Foreigners Act and sentenced her for a period of two years. Under section 14A the maximum sentence is eight years and minimum sentence is two years. Sultanova, pleaded guilty before the magistrate court where she was tried and sentenced. Later she moved the sessions court claiming that she was unaware of the consequences of pleading guilty as she was not well versed with “Indian judicial language”. A sessions court this month, however, upheld the sentence. Her advocate Ayaz Khan then moved the Bombay high court against the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-suspends-sentence-of-overstaying-uzbek/articleshow/87517165.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Jewellery sales increased by 30-35% compared to last year, according to the city’s leading jewellers. Ticket sizes of the purchases were also reported to be largely stable, despite the high rates of gold, which have evened out over the past few weeks. According to many jewellers, while traditional items sold well on Dhanteras and the days preceding it, younger people also made purchases taking advantage of the lower gold rates for lighter jewellery. “Traditional items like gold and silver coins, silver plates and idols were sold, as well as traditional jewellery. Overall, sales are up to 40% more than last year, and are better compared to 2019 as well. We have also seen firsttime buyers purchase jewellery and one-two gram gold coins,” said Atul Ashtekar, partner at KRA Jewellers. Others said that like Dasara and the entirety of the festive period, the demand for bullion was lower than that of jewellery, with the younger generation opting for regular-use jewellery. “The response this year was fairly good, and at least 20% more than last year’s. Jewellery sales were more than that of bullion, with the those aged above 40 years opting for heavier jewellery. Younger people prefer lighter jewellery, such as 18k studded jewels, which they can use on a regular basis. They pick jewellery that matches their apparel purchases,” said Amit Modak, CEO of PN Gadgil and Sons Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dhanteras-comes-as-boon-for-jewellers/articleshow/87516422.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Apart from the 14 functional fire brigade stations in the Pune civic limits, five others are ready and another five are under construction. Ranpise said that the areas such as Kharadi, Dhanori, Solapur road, and Wagholi were in need of the fire stations. “Our fire station in Yerwada has to cater to Kharadi and other adjoining areas. They need separate fire stations for faster response,” he said. He said, “According to our earlier 340sqkm city limits, we needed at least 40 fire stations, but due to the recently merged villages, the city limits has expanded further to 520sqkm and we now need at least 70 such fire stations. We have written to the city engineer about the need of the additional fire stations, especially to cater to the need of the merged villages. For every two villages there should be at least one fire station available.” Similarly, there are only six such stations in the PCMC limits. Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade department officials said they sent proposals to allot the land to new fire stations, but no action has been taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-needs-over-70-fire-stations-ranpise/articleshow/87516438.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Injured children were taken to medical college hospital. The deceased person was identified as Soman Nair, 65, a resident of Cherumanchal near Aryanad. Four students who were injured were discharged from the hospital after preliminary care, while one student has been admitted to the hospital. The accident occurred at Cherumanchal bus stop in Aryanad. The bus stop is located next to a curve. The police said that the KSRTC driver was negotiating the curve when a portion of the bus scraped against the top of the concrete roofed bus shed and the roof gave away under the impact. It fell over the students and Soman Nair who were waiting at the bus stop. Aryanadu SHO Jose N R said that the students only suffered minor injuries and that the bus shed would have collapsed due to lack of stability. Panchayat authorities said that the bus shed was around 18 years old and structural instability may have been an issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/one-killed-five-hurt-as-bus-rams-waiting-shed/articleshow/87516437.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With new drug molecules, cure in sight for psoriasis||HYDERABAD: New drug compounds could help in the treatment of the nagging skin ailment, psoriasis, a top team of researchers from the University of Hyderabad (UoH) and Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences said on Wednesday. While the discovery has been granted an Indian patent, the researchers have filed for an international patent and said the discovery could provide relief to patients from this recurring skin disease. Psoriasis, which is characterised by red patches with silvery scales on different parts of the body, has always remained an enigma to medical and health scientists. Various theories have been proposed for the onset of the disease, but none of them has thus far provided a conclusive evidence on what exactly triggers the problem. Also, there is no known medicine to cure the problem. Psoriasis, however, is non-infectious. In this backdrop, the discovery of drug molecules for treatment of psoriasis gains significance. The research team comprised Prof P Reddanna, Dr Kumar Reddy and Dr Nooruddin Khan of UoH and Harshavardhan Bhuktar, Sharda Shukla and Prof Manojit Pal of Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences. The discovery could also help in finding cure for other major health problems like arthritis, coronary heart diseases, allergy, asthma, certain forms of cancer and even Alzheimer's disease. “A recognized feature of psoriasis and other proliferative dermatoses (skin ailments) is the accumulation in the skin of the unusual arachidonic acid metabolite called 12R-HETE, which is product of an enzyme known as 12R-Lipoxygenase or 12-R-LOX. Research using microarray (a lab tool that detects large number of genes simultaneously) in humans reveal that 12R-LOX was pathologically over-expressed during psoriasis and other proliferative skin dermatoses,” the research study said adding that 12R-LOX forms a potential target for the development of proliferative skin disorders, including psoriasis. The research team validated 12R-LOX as the target for the development of anti-psoriasis drugs through a series of experiments. And the invention is the outcome of a collaborative project between the two institutions funded jointly by the department of science and technology (DST) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, the researchers added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-new-drug-molecules-cure-in-sight-for-psoriasis/articleshow/87517855.cms||Syed Akbar

The bhumipujan of the ‘Public Plaza’ under the New Kalanagar Flyover was performed by minister of tourism and environment Aaditya Thackeray and MLA Zeeshan Siddiqui. MMRDA is reshaping the Kalanagar junction as a part of refurbishment of Western Express Highway. The public plaza was proposed by MMRDA Urban Designing Cell to utilise the space under the flyover and to avoid its misuse. At most places, space below the flyover has turned into a dumping ground. Some of the space is also used by drug addicts and a few places have been occupied by vehicles as parking spot. The 2,828-sqm plaza will be accessible by ramps on both sides and will consist of several attractive design elements. The project is expected to cost Rs 4.5 crore. There will be a light art sculpture, an aesthetic design element, placed at the starting point of the plaza, highlighting entry to the BKC Art district. Another feature is the linear water body with series of descending heights of fountains. There will be plants and flower beds with shade-loving shrubs around the water bodies. For convenience of visitors, benches and seating arrangement will be provided at an appropriate distance along the water body and flyover pier. Thackeray said, “We decided to undertake the urban beautification and enhancement of suburban Mumbai similar to work undertaken in Worli and other areas in south Mumbai. W e wish to create more such areas to improve surroundings in and around BKC-Kalanagar junction.” Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “The leftover spaces, when converted into recreational area, will work as an effective public space and will be a catalyst for overall development of the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-work-on-public-plaza-at-bandra-flyover-takes-off/articleshow/87517185.cms||Manthank Mehta

About a dozen traders from India’s western state had come to Uttarakhand to earn some profit and recover their losses but the low tourist footfall in the wake of devastating rain spells in Kumaon has ruined their plans. “Ahead of Diwali, traders like us travel to different states to sell our produce. We have been coming to Nainital during Diwali for several years now. However, the last few years have been disappointing. Last year, it was Covid-19, and this year, the rain-related incidents have kept tourists from the lake town, reducing the sale of our hand-made iron utensils dramatically,” Savita, a trader from Rajasthan, told TOI. Echoing a similar sentiment, Madan, another trader from Rajasthan, said, “It seems we would not even be able to recover the travelling cost let alone make a profit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-hit-traders-from-rajasthan-struggling-to-make-a-sale-in-rain-battered-nainital/articleshow/87515399.cms||---

There is a possibility of political pressure from the corporators to allow such stalls and hinder any action against them, considering the civic polls early next year,” he alleged. PMC fire department chief Prashant Ranpise told TOI that they have given no-objection certificate (NOC)s to only those vendors who have set up their stalls across nine civic grounds, while Pimpri Chinchwad fire department officials said they gave NOCs to only 48 such vendors. Notably, the PMC had taken action against 15 illegal stalls earlier last week. An official from the Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade department said, “The police and the anti-encroachment departments should take action against illegal stalls as the fire brigade department is restricted to giving only NOCs.” Ranpise said his department was under high alert to cope with any unwarranted fire-related incidents this Diwali and all the 383 staff members of the department would be on their duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activist-alleges-encroachment-demands-crackdown-on-illegal-firecracker-stalls/articleshow/87516466.cms||---

---||Pune||Traditional, new trends in festival of ‘faral’||PUNE: Diwali is also the festival of faral, which food historians say, is not just sweets and savouries, but also emotive. Alka Kunte (65) has been living in Bengaluru for 40 years, but makes every faral item she learnt from her grandmother. “It takes days to fully prepare the dough for delectable anarsa, it is time-consuming, and it needs concentration and effort to make flaky crispy concentric circle layered chirote. Faral making is nostalgic because it is associated with my grandmother and all my relatives coming together in a house full of laughter,” Kunte said. Konkan’s Touch Food historian Mohsina Mukadam said whatever is harvested in that part of Maharashtra is reflected in Diwali faral. “Our chakli and ladoos were not the original ones. People used to make 7-8 types of poha with jaggery, with coconut milk, with musk melon and other flavours which was the original faral. The shev ladoo is made with besan and cooked with jaggery syrup,” she added. Some communities make Bor, a round sweet made with rice four and a little hard to bite. Others make satyachi karanji or kanawala. It is also made with many layers, and has to be fried carefully. Chiwdas are common but the spices can be different. “Not many people make kadboli. It is hollow from inside and crispy outside. In Konkan , people make karanji with besan stuffing and not coconut and semolina,” Mukadam added. Khandeshi stands out Asha Patil, a food expert from the region, says Daraba ladoo is unique. “Wheat is soaked and tied in a cloth overnight, air dried and ground. We make the ladoo using just sugar. Sanjori is another speciality from Khandesh. Maida or daraba is the outer cover. Rava is roasted and soaked in sugar/jaggery syrup along with some other fillings and stuffed inside the maida. It is flattened into round shapes and evenly cooked. It is very popular in rural farming communities. Karanji is stuffed with dry coconut mixture. Another ladoo is made of besan pudis,” Patil said. Basundi, shrikhand are made during Diwali. “There is Gujarati and Marwadi influence. People also make kaju katli here. Three to four families also come together to call chefs to make faral in Khandesh,” said Patil. Western Maha flavour Manjiree Kapadekar, food expert and a writer of cook books from Kolhapur, said that rava ladoo here is with fresh coconut. Another speciality here is the Kolhapuri pudachi wadi with coriander. “Rawa, besan and boondi ladoo is also another staple for faral,” Kapadekar added. Vidarbha creations Gourmet chef from Nagpur, Vishnu Manohar, said Vidarbha offers many variations of chakli. “We make onion chakli by soaking the flour in chopped onion. It can only be eaten immediately after it is fried. Also, white butter is used to soak the flour which is then mixed with garlic, green chilli and green coriander to make a different chakli, again a tradition not seen in rest of Maharashtra,” he added.  Kanawale with dry coconut, kanole or steamed roti generally eaten along with kheer is specific to Vidarbha region, added Manohar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traditional-new-trends-in-festival-of-faral/articleshow/87516473.cms||Ardhra Nair

Speaking to TOI, Rawat said that it was not an overnight decision. “The party seniors, all ministers, MLAs had been consulted and they had agreed to the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. If the decision is a correct one and aimed at welfare of people and development, then why are there any talks of withdrawing it. The government should not bow to pressure,” Rawat added. He also said the long-term impact of the move will benefit all stakeholders, including priests. “Proper procedure was followed and when people did not have a problem with the Board in 2019, then why are these issues cropping up in 2021,” he added. Calling the management board as the most reformative step taken in Uttarakhand in 21 years, Rawat said, “The rights of priests have not been infringed upon. The aim of the government was not to take over all the activities, but to improve the system and facilities. Even ex-CM ND Tiwari mooted the concept.” “The number of devotees has shot up to 36 lakhs in the last few years. So, the government had decided to come up with this Act for proper management,” said the former CM. During his recent visit to Kedarnath, Rawat was denied visit to the temple as some priests showed him black flags and raised slogans. “Giving the issue a casteist line is not right. It was surprising that while priests at Kedarnath raised slogans, the priests at Triyuginarayan welcomed the move. If someone has an issue, he should approach the government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/party-seniors-all-ministers-and-mlas-gave-consent-for-char-dham-board-says-ex-cm/articleshow/87515408.cms||Kautilya Singh

In the early hours of October 29, an official from a liquor manufacturing company alerted a logistics firm in Baramati about the accident of one of its trucks, which had been hired for transporting 975 boxes of liquor worth Rs66 lakh from Baramati to Jalgaon. The official also informed the firm manager that he was told locals had stolen the liquor boxes at the site of the mishap. The manager immediately left for Undavadi, a village located 125km from Baramati. When he reached, truck owner Ajinath Jarad and driver Ankush Bendre were at the accident site and the vehicle was turned on its side, but very few boxes of liquor were lying around. “Jarad also showed the manager video clips of people stealing boxes,” sub-inspector Prakash Kharat of the Baramati taluka police told TOI. Believing Jarad, the manager filed a complaint with the police against unknown persons. However, during the probe, it was revealed that this was a pre-planned theft by Jarad and Bendre. “The duo had kept 470 boxes in a godown at Indapur and then created an accident scene at Jarad’s native village, Undavadi,” Kharat said. The police on Monday arrested Jarad, Bendre and the godown owner, and recovered the liquor boxes. While police have now recovered 470 liquor boxes from the godown, the remaining 505 boxes are still missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truck-owner-stages-mishap-to-steal-liquor/articleshow/87494579.cms||Mihir Tanksale

He said like most families in Kumhar Mandi, it’s a family business, passed down generations. During peak seasons of Diwali and summertime, all family members display their products on the roadside. However, sales and availability of raw material have been on the decline over the past few years and the pandemic nearly brought things to a halt. Potters at Kumhar Mandi said that the clay used to make diyas, which earlier used to be readily available in Doon, has now become difficult to access. The price has nearly tripled and it has to be brought from areas like Saharanpur and sometimes, it’s not available at all. Plus, peoples’ tastes have changed and the takers for plain earthen diyas have reduced. As a result, potters now have to import items from areas like Siliguri, West Bengal. The potters also said that the administration has not allotted them a designated place to sell their products and when they sell their products on pavements, they are made to leave by cops. “We have protested many times for a designated vendor zone to be allocated to us, but nothing happened on the ground. We also have also given a memorandum to the district magistrate, addressed to the chief minister, to solve our problems,” said a potter who did not wish to be named. Due to the challenges and uncertainty, this may be the last generation at Kumar Mandi making clay décor. “Seeing the low returns of this business, the next generation doesn’t want to pursue it. Now they are looking for other options which are more promising,” said Bharat Bhusan, another potter in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dying-flame-potters-at-doons-kumhar-mandi-say-few-takers-left-for-earthen-diyas/articleshow/87515428.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

The recruitment will see the appointment of teachers at pre-IAS Coaching Centre, university sub-centre at Osmanabad, Model College and Gopinathrao Munde National Institute of Rural Development and Research among other facilities. As per the official norm, the maximum workload allotted to one teacher will be nine hours per week. Besides fulfilling the educational criteria, the applicant should clear the National Eligibility Test (NET) or the State Eligibility Test (SET) among other criteria. The proposed recruitment will have a 30% reservation for women candidates. Student activist Tukaram Saraf said the upcoming recruitment must be conducted fairly and transparently. “The selection of teachers should be based purely on merit. The recruitment of only deserving candidates will serve the larger interest of students,” he said. Bamu has cancelled its earlier ad for the similar recruitment of CHB teachers. As per an earlier advertisement, fewer teachers were supposed to get recruited as the university had decided to continue the services of some of the existing CHB teachers. The move had drawn flak from a section of stakeholders who pressed for fresh recruitment for all the posts. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-to-appoint-231-teachers/articleshow/87514574.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Theatre Rd accused hid in flat for 6 hrs||Kolkata: Dudhkumar Dhal alias Suman, former driver of chartered accountant Abhay Chowdhury, was arrested on Wednesday for murdering his 91-year-old mother Renuka Chowdhury on Monday night inside her ninth-floor flat at a posh Shakespeare Sarani complex. Cops from the Shakespeare Sarani police station said Suman, who had confessed to the crime, had hidden in the flat for almost six hours without getting caught. Suman was captured on CCTV camera, entering the complex after 6pm on Monday and leaving around midnight. It is not clear whether he committed the crime on his own or had an accomplice. “We have arrested Suman and recovered Renuka’s costly mobile from him. Another mobile, too, has been found. He has confessed that Renuka’s necklaces and earrings are with him and we are recovering them,” said DCP (South) Akash Magharia. Following Renuka’s murder, Suman was rounded up from his in-law’s place at Dankuni on Tuesday night, as reported in TOI earlier. He was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till November 11. Cops, who are questioning Suman to find out whether loot was his only motive, took him to the site of the crime on Wednesday to reconstruct the sequence of events. “The fact that there was loot is certain,” said Magharia. According to police, the accused had entered the housing complex between 6pm and 6.30pm. CCTV footage of him roaming inside the complex pointed at conclusive evidence against him, said sleuths, adding he was seen leaving a few minutes past midnight. Suman told police he had been sacked from his job three years ago and he had tried to gain entry inside the flat by convincing Renuka to recruit him again. The accused, claimed sources, had stolen Rs 2.5-lakh jewellery from the house in 2018 and lost his job. When Suman had asked Renuka to give his job back, she had reportedly asked him to return the stolen items. . “Suman claimed he waited for the opportune moment when the main door would be kept open. He claimed he went inside the house and hid inside the 2,000-sqft flat while Abhay and the help, Pawan Yadav, were still inside the flat. He committed the murder and fled after midnight with the booty. But the fact that he could hide for such a long time without being detected needs investigation. We are probing if he was helped by someone else, especially in securing entry into the flat. Yadav will be questioned,” said Magharia. Police believe the accused thought the family had bought gold on the occasion of Dhanteras, but Abhay and Renuka had stuck to routine and gone to bed in separate rooms by 9.30pm on Monday. Police said besides Suman’s mobile tower location and CCTV footage, they had found his mobile switched off on Tuesday morning, a little after the murder came to light. “We also learnt Suman had visited the house even on Sunday. We used technical expertise to track him down,” said an officer. Earlier, the post-mortem report said Renuka had died due to smothering around midnight. Renuka was declared brought dead when her son, Abhay, could take her to SSKM Hospital after 7.30am on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/theatre-rd-accused-hid-in-flat-for-6-hrs/articleshow/87516485.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He then removed the number plate and sold it to Dileep Kumar, a scrap dealer, for Rs 2,500. They then cut the bike into pieces and packed the parts in a sack. The police who checked the CCTV visuals identified Abhishek and arrested him. Following his interrogation they took Dileep also into custody.

A 16-year-old boy was also detained for helping the accused in the act. While the minor drove a moped, accused Mohammad Saad Qureshi, a resident of Zampa Bazaar, riding pillion lit a cracker and flung it towards the petrol dispenser. The cracker fell on the ground near the dispenser’s pipe, but thankfully, an attendant at the petrol pump near Someshwar Circle on Udhna Magdalla Road kicked the live cracker away in the nick of time, thus averting a major disaster. The incident happened on Monday when many people were present at the pump. Motilal Chaudhary, manager of the petrol pump, lodged the complaint in Umra police station on Tuesday. The petrol pump submitted CCTV footage of the pump in which the accused are seen clearly while throwing the cracker. Cops have booked the accused under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 336 (act endangering human life or the personal safety of others) and others. While the minor, a student of class X, was released after brief detention for investigation, Qureshi, who is unemployed and class XII dropout, was released on bail. “They told the police that they wanted to play a prank and hence did the mischief. None of them have any criminal records,” said a police officer at Umra police station. “The cracker could have led to massive fire and even a major blast. It is a residential area and a hospital is adjacent to the pump. It could have led to several fatalities,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/teen-throws-cracker-at-petrol-pump-held/articleshow/87515463.cms||---

Vegetables grown on campus are sufficient for the students of the department of Catering Science and Hotel Management to conduct cooking classes. The garden, Sprinkle of Green, is the brainchild of Bidhu Bhusan Das, dean culinary chef of the department. Bidhu, who was the executive chef at ITC Hotels for three decades, said his intention was to make students grow their own vegetables as part of learning. “We experimented with 35 types of vegetables and found that we could successfully grow 20 including broccoli, cauliflower, fenugreek, red pumpkin, cherry tomato, spinach and cucumber. We need not get vegetables from the market for practical sessions anymore,” he told TOI. Bidhu, who is staying on campus, is nurturing the garden with the help of his students. “We have started growing herbs like thyme and basil. Students made herbal drinks last week by making use of the herbs grown here. Every week, we make a soup made of vegetables and flowers. Such practices will enhance culinary skills of students and enhance their profile when they go out,” said college secretary Ajeet Kumar Lal Mohan. The vegetables are organically-grown. “The vegetable garden is yet another step towards creating a sustainable campus. This is one of the green campuses with trees and limited concrete infrastructure. We plan to run the entire campus with non-conventional energy sources soon,” Ajeet added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kitchen-garden-provides-bountiful-harvest-for-budding-chefs-of-navakkarai-college/articleshow/87516490.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Coimbatore||Paazee scam: Madras HC upholds transfer of probe to CBI||In a setback to IPS officer Pramod Kumar, the Madras high court has refused to set aside transfer of investigation to CBI into the multi-crore Paazee forex scam case. Paazee received deposits from the public to the tune of Rs 100 crore on the promise of paying high interest by investing the money in foreign exchange. As the company failed to repay deposits, an FIR was registered against the firm based on the complaints from the depositors in 2009. Subsequently, another FIR was registered by the Tirupur North police based on a complaint from driver of Kamalavalli, one among the directors of Paazee Company. According to the FIR, V Mohan Raj, then inspector of police, Aanaimalai police station, and Shanmugaiah, inspector of police CCB Tirupur, had demanded and received Rs 3 crore as bribe from Kamalavalli to settle the financial problems of Paazee. During the probe, Mohan Raj gave a statement that he received money from Kamalavalli and other accused in the Paazee scam only on the instructions of the then inspector general of police, west zone, Coimbatore, Pramod Kumar IPS. Later, based on petitions moved by investors, a single judge of the court through an order dated April 19, 2011 transferred the investigation to the CBI. Aggrieved, Pramod Kumar preferred an appeal contending that the case has been registered against him without obtaining the sanction from the Union government since he was an IPS officer and the same has been subsequently transferred to the CBI. Since the plea was dismissed by the high court, Pramod Kumar moved the Supreme Court. The apex court remanded the matter back to the high court and directed fresh adjudication after affording Pramod Kumar opportunity of being heard. As per the SC order, Justice C V Karthikeyan reheard the matter and said, “In the instant case, the infraction of Article 21 of the Constitution was sought to be re-examined to the limited extent to find out whether non-hearing of the writ petitioner had caused him prejudice.” When the single judge was hearing the matter, CB-CID Vellore had already pointed its needle of suspicion against the writ petitioner. Therefore, the CBI cannot be charged with prejudice, the court said. “They (CBI) did not pick and choose the writ petitioner from thin air and arrayed him as an accused. CB-CID, Vellore already had gathered materials against him. CBI consolidated those materials and gathered further materials and filed the final report. I would also readily state that if CBI had not investigated, CB-CID Vellore would also have drawn the same conclusion,” the judge said. The court then dismissed the plea confirming the transfer of investigation to CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/paazee-scam-hc-upholds-transfer-of-probe-to-cbi/articleshow/87516489.cms||---

Joshi, who hails from Silauni village in the Pithoragarh district, was preparing for the medical exam in Delhi for the past one year. The student of the Asian Academy School has scored 700 out of the total 720 marks. The Pithoragarh resident’s elder sister is already enrolled in an MBBS course in Delhi. Kshitiz Kumar Singh has grabbed 691st position in the NEET 2021 results. This was the third consecutive attempt of the Haldwani resident as in previous years, Singh was unable to get a satisfactory position which would have helped him get a college of his choice. The student of the Haldwani-based Doon Public School aims to get admission in a top medical college. Another notable mention is Dehradun’s Sachin Dagur who got 490 rank nationally. Overall, Uttarakhand had a decent result this year in the medical entrance exam but unfortunately nobody from the state was able to secure a position among the top 100 candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pithoragarh-boy-becomes-state-topper-in-neet-2021/articleshow/87515445.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Beggar fails to pay surety, spends 5 additional months in jail||MUMBAI: A 34-year-old beggar living under the Bandra skywalk and accused of murdering her husband with a paver block a year ago, spent over five additional months in jail despite being granted interim bail in May, as she could not furnish the surety of Rs 50,000. The woman was once again granted bail by a sessions court last week. The court reasoned that both accused Mehrunissa Singh and her husband were heavily drunk. “…accused had dealt the blow of paver block on the head of the deceased simply because the deceased had earlier injured her with the same paver block. There does not appear any intention on her part to commit murder of her husband,” the sessions court said. Advocates Chandni Chawla and Payoshi Roy sought bail for Singh, submitted that she has been in custody since October 2020. In this order, the court allowed Singh to be released on a provisional cash bail of Rs 15,000, a much simpler process than furnishing surety. “The accused shall furnish surety (of Rs 15,000) within 4 weeks from the date of release, failing which the cash bail shall stand forfeited without any separate order to that effect,” the court said. For a surety of over Rs 15,000, one has to furnish a solvency certificate of an immovable property worth that much or more. For a surety of Rs 15,000 or lesser, income certificate, ration card and proof of residence is enough. It is the prosecution’s case, that the couple who had a daughter, were addicted to alcohol. It was submitted that they used to quarrel every day when drunk. It was further alleged that on October 2, 2020, they both drank and started quarrelling. During the quarrel, the husband threw a paver block at Singh. She sustained a bleeding head injury. The prosecution alleged that after the husband went to sleep, out of anger, Singh threw a paver block on his head. Thereafter, they both continued sleeping. The prosecution told the court that the following morning the child got up and realised that her mother was injured and her father was not moving. She called the neighours who came and informed the police. Later, the offence was registered. Granting Singh bail, the court said, “It is also very clear that they used to take shelter at the sky walk and would beg to survive. There appears no likelihood of any tampering with evidence. In such circumstances, and particularly when the chargesheet is already filed, further detention of the accused does not seem necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-beggar-fails-to-pay-surety-spends-5-addl-months-in-jail/articleshow/87517218.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Dehradun||Protests over Char Dham Board continue despite CM visit, talks with priests||Dehradun: From Congress leaders Harish Rawat, Navjot Singh Sidhu, and Punjab chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi to many from the BJP, a host of politicians have lined up to visit Kedarnath over the past few days, which lead up to the visit of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on November 5. The holy site is also under the limelight because of protests staged by teerth purohits (priests) over the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act. The priests' protests took an angry turn when they refused to allow former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat -- under whom the Board was constituted -- to offer prayers at the shrine on Monday. Fearing that the issue may blow up in the forthcoming polls and also overshadow the Prime Minister's visit, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, along with senior ministers, left for Kedarnath on Wednesday to take stock of the preparations and also pacify the disgruntled priests. While both sides held talks over the issue, slogans were raised during the visit of the chief minister, along with cabinet ministers Harak Singh Rawat and Subodh Uniyal. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson for the Char DhamTirth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, "The visit of the CM and his two Ministers was opposed. Slogans were raised and we made our point clear. Minister Harak Singh Rawat has assured us that the Board would be withdrawn by November 30." Dhami said, “Most preparations for the PM's visit have been made and some remaining work would be completed soon. The Prime Minister is coming to inaugurate and launch projects worth Rs 400 crore. He is scheduled to inaugurate the statue of Adi Shankracharya and address the people of Kedarnath.” On the issue of protesting priests, he said, “There is no anger. We had a word with them and have asked them to bring all issues to the knowledge of the committee formed over the issue. The purohits can speak to us or write to us about their problems. We will take steps only after consultation with all stakeholders.” Soon after the CM's visit, cabinet agriculture minister, Subodh Uniyal, told TOI, “We have spoken to the priests and a decision will be taken by November 30, after a cabinet meeting.” Interestingly, the Uttarakhand government has called for a two-day winter session at Gairsain. The issue has sparked rumours of a possibility of the government rolling back the Act, which has witnessed large-scale protests from the priests. On the other hand, the Indian National Congress has already announced that it will withdraw the Act if voted to power. “We will not take any step that is against the sentiments of the people of Uttarakhand. The Act will be rolled back if our party comes to power,” ex-CM Harish Rawat said. The priests of Char Dham have been at loggerheads with the government over the issue since 2019. Amid heavy protests from the Congress party, the Bill was tabled and passed in the state assembly in December 2019. During his brief tenure as CM, Tirath Singh Rawat had announced plans to remove 51 smaller temples, which were included under the ambit of the Act, and also said that the decision of the Board would be reviewed. Later, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, during his visit to Uttarkashi on July 15 this year, announced the review of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. On August 15, he formed a committee headed by Badri Kedar Temple Committee chief, Manohar Kant Dhyani, to look into the matter and recommend changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/protests-over-char-dham-board-continue-despite-cm-visit-talks-with-priests/articleshow/87515464.cms||Kautilya Singh

He is also not eligible for the 7.5% reservation for government school students as he joined the corporation school only after Class VIII. Students should have studied from Class VI in a government school to claim benefit of the reservation.Though Irfan wanted to pursue MBBS, as he has secured an engineering seat, he is planning to pursue engineering instead of repeating NEET.S Narmadha of the Mariammal Girls Higher Secondary School in Pollachi, who scored 388, is the district topper among students of aided-schools. While the 7.5% reservation is not applicable for students in aided schools, Narmadha may not get a government seat as candidates from backward class community should score at least 600 marks to qualify for it.Narmadha is hopeful of getting a veterinary seat as 85% weightage is given for Class XII marks for admission to veterinary colleges. While there are only seven colleges in the state, she is expecting good competition. If she is unable to get a seat, she is planning to repeat NEET.According to district chief education officer N Geetha, performance of students in NEET this year has been bad compared to the last year. “The highest score in the district among government school students was over 400 last year. But this year, it was 332 and only two scored more than 300 marks. Among aided school students, the highest score in the district was 388 and only three students secured over 300,” she said.As many as 209 students of government schools and 126 students of aided schools had appeared for NEET this year from Coimbatore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/neet-toppers-of-govt-aided-schools-may-not-get-quota/articleshow/87516492.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Goa||As Narkasur ‘music’ hits elders, kids, officials turn deaf ear to it||PANAJI: Blatant violation of noise pollution regulations was seen across the state on Wednesday, as groups displaying Narkasur effigies blasted music to earsplitting levels. Authorities looked the other way as infants, senior citizens and the ailing suffered the onslaught of the blaring music. In areas like Panaji, Porvorim and surrounding places, citizens reported that the music began by around 6pm to 7pm and continued well into the night. The decibels were beyond the permitted levels, as doors and windows were seen rattling to the sound, citizens said. “We are all senior citizens living in this colony at Bambolim and it is not correct for music to be allowed to be blasted to this level. Besides affecting human health, this noise pollution is harmful to our environment. Humans and all terrestrial animals have tolerance only up to a certain level of sound. The norms on noise pollution should be strictly implemented,” said senior citizen and retired scientist Vinod Dhargalkar. In some cases, the Narkasur effigy and the accompanying loud music was seen being permitted within 200m distance from hospitals on Wednesday. WHO guidelines state that excessive noise is a health risk, which, besides impacting hearing, can also adversely affect the heart, our sleep cycle and take a toll on pregnant women. North Goa collector Ajit Roy, however, insisted that the decibel levels are being closely monitored. “We have a team in place. In addition, a police team is also going around and monitoring the situation. We have a control room, where one can place a complaint and action will be taken,” Roy told TOI. However, one citizen reported that a complaint to the official email address of the North Goa collector saw no action being taken. In a social media post, Santa Cruz-resident Sanjeev Sardesai said that while the creativity of the effigies needs to be appreciated, the event of Narkasur comes with a downside. “The uncontrolled, high pitched, amplified sound of HiFi speakers, playing late into the night, medically affects many senior citizens with heart and (blood) pressure ailments, and less said about the smoke the better! Hope good sense prevails on the groups to burn these effigies in open ground and not on roads,” Sardesai said in his social media post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-narkasur-music-hits-elders-kids-officials-turn-deaf-ear-to-it/articleshow/87517228.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Coimbatore||Check rising input costs: Builders||COIMBATORE: The ever-rising construction material cost has upset the apple cart of developers, who are unable to complete a project within an estimated cost. Stating that they were obliged to complete a project within the cost that was agreed upon while commencing the same, the developers said the hike in raw material cost in the past six months had derailed their project estimations and they were not able to finish a project within the agreed upon cost. In this wake, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (Credai) has sought the government to take steps to control the price rise of construction materials and help the real estate sector work towards the goal of providing affordable houses. There are roughly 110 developers in the district and many of them are into affordable housing projects for middle-income groups. Gugan Ilango, president, Credai, said the transportation cost of all inputs had increased as well in tandem with the fuel price hike. “There is a huge demand for steel in the export market and the domestic players are focusing on cashing in on the same. It has resulted in short supply of steel to the local market, pushing up both the demand and prices further.” He said the cost of cement was much lower in neighbouring states compared to that of Tamil Nadu. He said the cost of all raw materials had gone up as a result of not regulating the vendors properly. “It is unfortunate that the price hike has dealt a big blow to the industry and customers alike just when the industry was beginning to recover from the Covid-induced slowdown in the business.” Rajiv Ramasamy, secretary, Credai, said the construction firms should be allowed to negotiate with customers and revise the project cost to accommodate the rise in prices of raw materials. “Since the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) doesn’t allow this, there should be a regulatory body to check the input price rise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/check-rising-input-costs-builders/articleshow/87516501.cms||Sampath Kumar

At present, Dehradun only has one burn ward at Coronation Hospital with 12 beds and the burn specialist is working as a general practitioner at the medical college. When asked about the issue, Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent, Doon medical college, told TOI, “We have the necessary approval. A burn specialist is already a part of the team. When the burn unit becomes functional, that doctor will take over as the head of the department and additional personnel will be added gradually.” With Diwali around the corner, the number of beds was increased to 18 but still, it is woefully short of the required numbers, say health watchers. “The number of beds in the burn ward can be raised if the need arises. It’s a new ward with all essential facilities available for patients,” said Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer, Dehradun. The capital city also has a burn unit at a private hospital in the Kargi area.

Bishop Paritosh Canning, who met principals of all the schools under him on Wednesday, said the Kolkata diocese would not give a blanket instruction on re-opening and would leave it to them to decide on date and modalities. Canning said principals would have to decide whether they were ready or needed some more time to get the safety measures in place. “The diocese will not give any blanket instructions. I have told the principals to be extremely careful with the safety measures. They should earmark funds for the next academic session for sanitisation as re-opening makes it a prime requirement,” he told TOI. Some schools, such as La Martiniere for Boys, will re-open on November 16 in a staggered manner, but St James’ and Pratt Memorial will take more time. At St James’, classes IX and XI will not go to the campus before January 2022 and same is the case with Class IX at Pratt Memorial. Scottish Church Collegiate School has decided against bringing in Class IX immediately as 95% parents have not given their consent. “We are starting our online exams for classes IX and XI from November 8 and this will go on for a month after which the winter break will start. So, they will come to campus only in January, when school re-opens. Classes X and XII go to school in November for semester exams,” said St James’ principal T H Ireland. Pratt Memorial principal Carolyn Lionel said Class IX would go to school after the winter break and Class XI would go around November 20 for their practical classes. “We are ready with our sanitisation plans and working on other modalities now,” she said. La Martiniere for Boys is re-opening on November 16 with classes IX and XI, while classes X and XII will go once to collect admit cards. “We are expecting around 10-15 students in each of the five sections of class IX and six sections of class XI to come in first,” said acting principal John Stephen. Class XII at St Thomas’, Kidderpore, have been going to school for 10 days for practical classes. About 99% parents gave their consent, secretary John Ghosh, told the Bishop. “We have worked out a new routine for every group that will start from November 16,” Ghosh added. Scottish Church principal Bivas Saniel said he would start with X, XI and XII. “Ours is a state board school and we have to arrange for selections for classes X and XII,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-rush-for-nov-16-re-open-when-ready-bishop-to-cni-schools/articleshow/87516518.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While the differently-abled welfare department used to procure artificial limbs from private manufacturers through government insurance schemes earlier, the in-house production centre has now helped the department to avoid delays.Since its inception, the centre has helped 50 beneficiaries to get light-weight artificial limbs. About 30 of them were patients who underwent amputations in CMCH and other 20 were referred by the differently-abled welfare department. A doctor said cases of limb amputations are increasing due to various reasons like trauma and diabetes. There are only a few artificial limb centres in every state. Earlier, the amputated patients from Coimbatore had to go all the way to Chennai for free prosthesis, which was difficult considering their health and financial condition. Getting a prosthesis from a private set-up would cost a patient around Rs 3 lakh. S Vertivel Chezian, director, institute of orthopaedics and traumatology, CMCH, said, “Our idea was to set up an artificial limb centre in Coimbatore Medical College Hospital to help the needy in the western part of Tamil Nadu without putting any financial burden on the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/50-patients-benefit-from-cmchs-artificial-limb-centre/articleshow/87516494.cms||Sampath Kumar

The new plant, set up as part of the district administration’s larger plan of having at least one oxygen plant in each tehsil and municipal towns across the district, has enabled the Bhor hospital to have 60 oxygen beds and six ventilator-supported beds. Earlier, patients from Bhor and the adjoining areas had to travel long distances for oxygen or ventilator beds, the authorities said. Medical officer (MO) Dr A Berule of the SDH said, “During the peak of Covid -19, we needed at least 80 oxygen jumbo cylinders. We had to refer some critical patients to other hospitals due to unavailability of oxygen.” The hospital has an operating theatre room and caters to 400-450 patients daily, he said. “Apart from Covid patients, we will now be able to treat all types of patients here,” he added. Dr. Ambadas Devkar, tehsil health officer, Velhe, said, “Patients from remote areas cannot afford treatment at private hospitals.

The state public health officials have directed the local authorities to prepare a detailed list of pending first dose and second dose beneficiaries, with the focus remaining on 100% first dose vaccination by November-end. “We have directed the local authorities to plan the schedule so that the health workers or the Asha workers can visit houses and direct the beneficiaries to the nearest vaccination centre. The process will start after Diwali,” said a senior health official. The state has registered 73% vaccination of first dose beneficiaries and 34.06% inoculation of second dose beneficiaries so far. According to the public health department figures, a total of 15 districts in the state have above 70% first dose coverage. Only two districts — (60%) and Pune (51.27) — have above 50% second dose coverage, according to the updated figures till November 1. The mandatory 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield remained a hurdle in second dose coverage despite a steady supply of vaccines, said an official. State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI that five districts — Nandurbar, Akola, Buldhana, Aurangabad and Hingoli — with a little above 50% first dose beneficiaries would be in focus to speed up vaccination. District collectors of these districts participated in the Prime Minister’s meeting on Wednesday. “The first dose coverage in these districts was in the range of 50%, while the second dose was in the range of 20-25%. We shall be concentrating on these districts, besides focusing on the others to complete 100% first dose by Novemberend,” he said. State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that the state had been allocated 2.27 crore Covishield doses for the month of November. Of them, 2.1 crore doses were allocated for government sites and 17.45 lakh doses for private sites. The state is expecting around 10-15 lakh Covaxin doses this month, said another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-diwali-govt-to-focus-on-door-to-door-vaccination/articleshow/87516500.cms||Nisha Nambiar

State chief wildlife warden Sunil Limaye, who was on a daylong visit to Gadchiroli on Monday with a team of Stripes And Green Earth (SAGE) Foundation from West Bengal, said, “A herd of 20-21 elephants is moving in over 1,800-hectare area in some pockets in South Dhanora forest range. Even as we are not disturbing them, there is a need for continuous monitoring.” Limaye said Gadchiroli deputy conservator will submit a Rs1.40 crore plan to seek funds from the DPDC to monitor and conserve the elephant habitat. “We plan to formulate a short-term and long-term plan to protect the habitat and build the capacity of staff and train people. At present, we are monitoring the animals with the help of camera traps and drones,” he added. The elephants are shuffling in forest areas surrounding Kanhartola, Munjarkundi, and Sisur. Though the tuskers are not deliberately raiding paddy, the crop is damaged when they move through the field. Till now, the department has paid over Rs1 lakh towards compensation to the farmers for crop damage in around 15-20 acres. The SAGE team led by Sagnik Sengupta that visited the area suggested strict monitoring of the herd with all details of their movement with timings and reason for their stay at the location. The team observed that the herd is quite different from other migratory herds from Chhattisgarh which are in Madhya Pradesh. “This herd is very docile in nature and their attitude is different from other herds. Till December or January, strict monitoring needs to be done as there are chances the herd will try to move from the area where they currently are. We have proposed to do monitoring and study the movement pattern and also nature of the herd,” said Sengupta. Limaye said, “The funds that we have sought will be used for development and maintenance of perennial inside forest, taking up plantations, preparing primary response team (PRT), awareness programmes, faster disbursal of crop damage compensation, make proper ID of each individual in the herd by clicking pictures. In case of movement of elephants towards villages, we will temporarily shift them to pucca houses.” The herd of around 21 elephants has arrived in Gadchiroli after 300 years. According to forest officials, this herd had started in 2014 from Odisha and must have crossed Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh before entering Gadchiroli. The elephant is a heritage animal and has been included in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. ‘Project Elephant’ was launched in February 1992 to address the threats to the survival of elephants in our country on account of loss of its habitat, migration path, and poaching for tusks. Elephant reserves are not recognized under the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forest-dept-draws-rs1-4-cr-plan-to-protect-elephants-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/87515517.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the officials, many districts are lagging in the first dose vaccination target. There was a need to speed up the inoculation pace, they stressed. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The focus now has been shifted to the second dose vaccination. Pune district already has a good 95% vaccination rate for the first dose. Soon, the guidelines will be given for the door-to-door vaccination.” He said most of the blocks had been covered. Focused vaccination was the need of the hour for remote places in rural areas, he said. Deshmukh said most of the vaccination centres across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas in the district would remain shut now because of the festive season. Suryakant Devkar, chief immunisation officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) told TOI, “The vaccination will be under way till 2pm only on Friday. On Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, we have decided to give it a break.” Deshmukh said the district received around 1.92 lakh Covishield doses and 21,000 Covaxin doses on Wednesday. “We already had a good number of doses pending with the Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural units. The additional doses would prove helpful in continuing with the momentum of the vaccination,” he said. On Wednesday, a total of 10,010 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district with Covishield and Covaxin doses at over 500 vaccination sites. The district now has administered 1.21 crore doses, of which 78.55 lakh are first doses and 42.91lakh are second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-finishing-1st-dose-inoculation-by-month-end/articleshow/87516512.cms||---

Until over a week ago, Pune district had the highest active cases in the state at 6,000-7,000-plus. The number has now dropped to 3,194, state public health department data showed. Mumbai now has the highest number of active Covid cases in the state at 4,186. State health department officials told TOI that the drop in Pune’s active cases over the past few days had not only been because of a data update exercise but also due to an actual drop in new Covid cases and high recovery rate. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “This trend of lower active cases in Pune than Mumbai has been visible since the past eight to 10 days. Though both Pune and Mumbai have active cases in a similar range, Pune’s caseload recently fell below Mumbai’s due to two reasons: a recent data management exercise and actual fall in active cases in Pune as the second Covid wave wanes.” Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Active cases in Pune have primarily reduced because of several reasons, including a significant drop in Covid cases in the rural belt. The percentage of immunization against Covid-19 is nearing 100 (first doses) in rural areas, as we can no longer find beneficiaries to inoculate with the first dose.” Prasad said active cases in Pune rural recently dropped by 33%. He said there had been multiple days in Pune rural where hospitals did not register even a single Covid death in the recent times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-not-pune-dist-now-has-max-active-cases-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87516525.cms||Neha Madaan

You are well aware that due to closure of schools, the buses and pool cars remained idle and non- functional. Therefore, there is a possibility of developing technical glitches and maintenance issues. Considering the safety and security of the students and general public, it is mandatory that proper fitness check-up is done prior to ferrying of students,” said DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha in a letter to the secretaries of West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners & Operators Association and Pool Car Owners Welfare Association. He stated, “The matter is extremely urgent and due priority be accorded from your end.”  A few accidents occurred after private buses hit the road once restrictions were lifted earlier this year. “We witnessed a few mishaps and the most prominent one being the minibus accident on Red Road. We wish no such incident gets repeated,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Arupam Dutta, vice president of Poolcar Owners’ Welfare Association said a few pool cars are already running for various companies. “We think, not even 15 per cent of our cars will be required, as only Classes 9 and 11 will be travelling. We will merge routes and use cars which are already running,” said Dutta. “The buses need to be ready, and hence we have sought sometime to work out modalities,” said Himadri Ganguly of The West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners’ and Operators’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-tell-pool-cars-school-buses-to-do-fitness-test-before-ferrying-students/articleshow/87516551.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Mohammad Akhtar Imam (55) had shifted his two tuskers — Rani and Moti — to Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand around two years ago for their safety as he apprehended threat to his life, Janipur SHO Uttam Kumar said. Akhtar had bequeathed 6.2 acres of land in Murgiachak to his two elephants. He had returned to Patna on Tuesday night after meeting Rani and Moti. Akhtar’s bullet-riddled body was found lying in a pool of blood inside small jungle he had specially prepared for the two tuskers on his property near his residence. Police suspect Akhtar’s son Mohammad Meraj’s involvement in the murder as he had earlier also attempted to kill him for share in the property. Meraj, a notorious criminal, has been lodged in Beur jail since June, 2019 after he shot a constable dead on Danapur court premises while attempting to flee. Akhtar used to spend most of his time with the two elephants since the age of 12, the SHO said. He was shot at least eight times in his neck, chest and abdomen. The SHO said five empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. Four to six criminals were ivolved in the murder, he suspected. Phulwarisharif SDPO Maneesh Kumar Sinha said Akhtar was killed over land dispute. He said police have come to know that at least four to five criminals had come to meet Akhtar and took him away to sign an agreement for purchasing land. “His son is the prime suspect. Some land mafias also wanted to capture Akhtar’s properties. Akhtar also had a land dispute with one of his relatives in Sultanganj, Patna City,” he said. “His son had also got a fake rape case registered by his girlfriend against Akhtar several years ago,” he said. “Akhtar used to keep a village youth, Chandan, as his son and Meraj disliked it, too,” he said. “As per Akhtar’s will, his NGO, Asian Elephant Rehabilitation and Wildlife Animal Trust (AERAWAT), will own the properties transferred to the elephants for their care if something wrong happens to him. In case the two elephants also die, the entire property would go to the state government, as per the will,” Sinha said. The SDPO said Akhtar had several acres of ancestral land in Murgiachak of which a major share was bequeathed to the elephants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-who-bequeathed-land-to-2-pet-tuskers-shot-dead/articleshow/87515530.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Pune||Pune: DIAT develops lemongrass-flavoured solution to counter microbial infection||PUNE: The Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) has developed ‘Silvo-Kavach’, a water-based fumigation solution which can protect large open spaces from microbial infection. The solution, emitting lemongrass fragrance, can be used in public spaces, complexes, on industrial premises etc, said DIAT scientists. Project head Sangeeta Kale, said, “The solution has citrate components with lemongrass flavour to check foul smell. It is environment-friendly and does not cause irritation of the eyes. The solution has been tested by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratory in Pune for all parameters and the results have been quite positive.” C P Ramanarayanan, vicechancellor, DIAT, said, “Our inhouse innovation and incubation centre had hosted its first start-up company, Navyukti Innovation Private Limited in January. This is the first product of the company. It is also working in the field of biosensors and other industrial sensors.” Kale said, “We are in talks with government and local self-government establishments, big housing societies and hospitals to scale up market application of the solution.” Dr Avinath Bhondwe, former state president, the IMA, said, “Use of sodium hypochlorite can prove to be dangerous as the solution is highly inflammable. Fumigation is usually carried out in large areas. A scientificallyproven solution is needed to prevent any adverse impact. The solution containing sodium hypochlorite can cause skin irritation, burning sensation and, if it enters the respiratory system, it can cause choking. Thus, an environmental friendly solution is required to address these concerns,” Bhondwe added. Ayush Prasad, Pune ZP CEO, said, “We may consider DIAT solution for use if its results are proven scientifically.” “We have recommended spraying of the solution after a gap of three hours in open areas,” Kale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diat-develops-lemongrass-flavoured-solution-to-counter-microbial-infection/articleshow/87516554.cms||Sandip Dighe

Replies from concerned departments are being sought. Back office is also working very hard to ensure compliance with all orders,” said Pande. Earlier, activists used to complain about delays in getting orders. Pande said now orders will be made available within a week or 10 days. “Copies of orders will be made available online,” he said. Pande is probably the first SIC from the city. For the last two years, there was no full-time SIC for Nagpur division. Additional charge of office here was given to other SICs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5400-cases-pending-for-last-3-years-new-sic-plans-to-clear-pendency/articleshow/87515539.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Eye on civic elections, netas shower people with Diwali goodies||Thane: This Diwali festival seems to have given the politicians a right opportunity to win over voters ahead of the municipal elections slated for early next year. Many netas using their respective political party banners have started reaching out to their voters by doling out free festive goodies, holding musical events and also delivering valuables under the guise of competitions at the local level. While a political party from Thane has started distributing packets of utna (scented bathing scrub) splashing the details of their respective candidate from a ward in Wagle Estate, another has arranged a musical event for its residents in Naupada. Another party is distributing sweets among people, an attempt to sweeten their mood ahead of the voting season. Political observers say that such activities give the candidates a perfect opportunity to be visible in their constituency, and also appease them without attracting any negative attention. “Diwali is a big festival and many families have faced an adverse impact of Covid-19, and what better way to liftetheir sprits and brighten their mood by offering them goodies as many are already reeling under rising prices of essentials,” said an analyst. Meanwhile, even as politicians try to outdo one another in catching the attention of voters, some residents said they will not be affected by such appeasements. Nonetheless, they aren’t complaining about the steady stream of attention given by the netas either.  “We are aware of the works done in our area, and will accordingly make a conscious decision when it comes to voting,” said a resident from Naupada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-eye-on-civic-elections-netas-shower-people-with-diwali-goodies/articleshow/87517249.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Kolkata||Relaxed Cov curbs bring patrons back to restaurants||Kolkata: The easing of Covid restrictions on footfall and closing time for businesses has brought Bengali patrons, who like to dine late, back to restaurants in the evenings. But restaurateurs say the situation could have been a lot better had the deadline on night restrictions been pushed back by half-hour to give diners the comfort of enjoying their food without having to worry about being flagged down at a checkposts for staying out beyond the permitted hours. “Logically, the night restriction deadline should have been pushed back by half-anhour to 11.30pm when restaurants were allowed to operate till 11pm instead of 10.30pm. But we are fine with it. Given the challenges, we have to accept the constraints. We have pushed back the closing hour to 10.45pm from 10.15pm and that is already making a difference,” said Mocambo, Peter Cat and Peter Hu?? owner Nitin Kothari. Sudesh Poddar of Manthan, Songhai and MS Lounge said the 30 minute push-back has made a lot of difference as it suits the Bengali standard time for dinner. “We have pushed back the last order from 9.45pm to 10.15pm and it has brought Bengali patrons back to the restaurant. Traditionally, Kali Puja and Diwali are dull after the overdose during Durga Puja. But we are seeing a fair bit of renewed traffic since Sunday, when restaurants were allowed to operate for half-an-hour more and that augurs well for business,” he said. Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2 founding partner Shiladitya Choudhury and Gaurav Ghai of Kwality echoed Poddar’s view. “While non-Bengalis walk in to dine early, Bengalis prefer to eat around 10pm. The extended half hour allows them to enjoy a relaxed dinner instead of hurrying through it,” reasoned Chowdhury. “We are now closing at 10.45pm instead of 10.15pm and that does make a difference for customers,” said Ghai. Some though wish the night restrictions had also been pushed back to allow customers the peace of mind that they would be able to return home without encountering cops on the road. “We wish the night restrictions were also pushed back. But we aren’t complaining,” said Monica Lieu, owner of Beijing, Kim Ling, Kim Li, Tung Fong and Mandarin. But biryani joints like Aminia that have lost nearly 15-20% of business due to the early closing hour hope the situation will improve further soon. “In restaurants, 60% business is generated around dinner time, a bulk of which happens between 8pm and 12pm. Even now, we have to take the last order at 10.15pm,” said Aminia operations manager Firoz Molla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relaxed-cov-curbs-bring-patrons-back-to-restaurants/articleshow/87516556.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A similar trend was observed in Mumbai, where 29,093 tests threw up 225 positive cases on Tuesday as against Wednesday’s 319 cases from 34,442 tests. In Maharashtra, the total tests increased from 91,105 to 1,03,563 in the same period. The daily toll in Maharashtra dropped to 39, including five registered in Mumbai. For the last two months, the BMC (and the state) have been recording the highest tally of the week on Wednesdays. On Monday, when the week’s lowest tallies are usually recorded, the tally in state and Mumbai were 809 and 258, respectively. Many experts, including health minister Rajesh Tope, have indicated that the state could witness a slight rise in cases after Diwali which will also see the winter drop in temperature. “At the moment, Covid numbers are down because of overall vaccination,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “There is increased mobility and socialising in the city, yet the numbers are down. Our genomic sequencing haven’t shown any new variants of concern, indicating that the situation is under control,’’ said Kakani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mumbai-testing-increases-daily-cases-go-up/articleshow/87523993.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid jabs per session down to 100 in Maharashtra in November||PUNE: The average number of beneficiaries vaccinated per session in Maharashtra has come down to 100.9 till November 1 from 106.8 till the beginning of October, state health department data shows. Many districts in the state have recorded a drop in the number of vaccinations per session, with Pune’s average dropping to 107.6 till November 1 from 113.2 tabulated up to October 6. Mumbai’s average has dropped from 179 to 169.3 vaccinations per session during the period. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, told TOI that the department had put a plan in place to increase the jab count after Diwali. “We are drawing up a list of unvaccinated people, as well as the beneficiaries due for the second doses. This is primarily being done in the rural areas due to higher manpower,” he told TOI. As per the plan, advance sessions for beneficiaries, whose list has been drawn, will be created for upping the jabs after Diwali. “Efforts post-Diwali could be a game changer. The health department is taking massive efforts to vaccinate the largest numbers. Even at the village level, ASHA workers, women health workers at sub-centres, Primary Health Centres (PHC) medical officers and their assistants and the staffers at the rural and sub-district hospitals are working around the clock without taking a single day’s off. The district and state-level officers continue planning and monitoring uninterrupted vaccine supply up to the village level,” Desai said. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “Beneficiaries per session have reduced across the state due to the festival and the diminishing fear of a Covid third wave. However, more focus will now be on the second dose beneficiaries through the survey-plus-immunization programme Har Ghar Dastak post-Diwali.” On the advance sessions to be created, Deshmukh said the sessions would be created days in advance for beneficiaries due for second shots. “The planning and publicity of such sessions on CoWIN are on,” he said. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “The number of unvaccinated people (even with one dose) is now minuscule. Even the rural blocks that were lagging have touched 95% of vaccination with at least one dose. This is one reason why the average beneficiaries per session has reduced.” He said, “By the last week of October, we could hardly find any beneficiaries who had not even taken a single dose. This is apparent by the total vaccinations done in the district in September (24.37 lakh) as against October (15.97 lakh). November and thereafter will again see a rise in vaccinations, as there will be a massive chunk of second dose beneficiaries who took their first shots in August and September.” Another state health department official said, “Conducting vaccination sessions during the next few days of Diwali at the undesignated vaccination sites has been left to the discretion of the vaccination sites’ staffers owing to the festival. However, designated vaccination sites such as hospitals and primary health centres will continue to conduct sessions during the festival days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-nov-avg-beneficiaries-vaxxed-per-session-in-state-down-to-100/articleshow/87516570.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Kolkata||Panel penalizes hosps for Swasthya Sathi refusal||Kolkata: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has taken serious cognizance of multiple allegations of patients being refused hospital admission under Swasthya Sathi scheme across the state. It has penalized the hospitals and also ordered an inquiry into allegations of malpractice at a hospital in East Burdwan that refused a admission under Swasthya Saathi. It was a wrong notion that Swasthya Sathi helpline did not work on weekends, said Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Roy, chairperson of WBCERC. The numbers work day and night. He also said should any private facility refuse admission to card-holders, the family could lodge complaints from the hospital itself on the tollfree and WhatsApp numbers. Sanat Kumar Gosh, a patient in East Burdwan, had sought admission at Sharanya Hospital there under Swastha Saathi. His son, Subhadeep, told WBCERC that not only was the admission refused under the scheme, they were also forced to buy medicines from a ward boy at prices higher than that at hospital pharmacy. While Swasthya Sathi would have allowed a bed charge of Rs 1,800, the hospital charged him Rs 3,300. “The family was forced to buy expensive antibiotics from an employee. The drugs were sold in an area not covered by a CCTV camera. This is a serious offence and we have ordered ADM (health) of East Burdwan to hold an inquiry. Till the inquiry is over, the hospital’s licence will not be renewed,” Roy said. The commission awarded a refund of Rs 10,000 to the patient’s kin. Sanat was hospitalized from September 8 to 22, after which he died. In another case, a Howrah patient, who needed an emergency hernia operation, was refused admission under the scheme at Kasturi Das Memorial Hospital. The family was told Swasthya Sathi approval would take time as it was a Saturday. They were advised to get the surgery done by paying Rs 20,000. The hospital said it would treat the patient as that under Swasthya Saathi after the surgery. The commission said though the hospital didn’t refuse admission under the state scheme entirely, call recordings revealed the hospital was guilty. WBCERC slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, based on a complaint by Chiranjit Saha, whose father was refused admission at several hospitals under Swasthya Saathi. Saha alleged the patient was not even given primary treatment at the emergency though he had Covid symptoms. The hospital claimed its emergency was full and treatment was delayed. The patient was later admitted to Sterling Hospital, where he died. The commission awarded a discount of Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panel-penalizes-hosps-for-swasthya-sathi-refusal/articleshow/87516573.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The sharpshooter has been identified as Raju Singh, but his accomplice, Golu, managed to escape. Police have announced a reward of Rs 25,000 to anyone for information on the absconding criminal. Kamal Sharma, the hsband of Priya, is on the run, said police, adding that he has also been booked for murder. The motive behind the crime seems to be a marital dispute between the couple, said an officer involved in the investigation. A day before the crime, Priya had filed a dowry case against her husband at Chandpur police station. Bijnor superintendent of police (SP), Dharamveer Singh, said, "During a routine checking of vehicles on Tuesday night, a police team signalled two men on a bike to stop but they tried to escape. When policemen tried to intercept them, the bikers opened fire at the cops, who retaliated. Accused Raju, 29, who hails from Khadana village under Majhola police station area of Moradabad, sustained bullet injuries on his leg. His accomplice, Golu, of Kashiram colony in Moradabad, managed to escape. A police constable, Monu Kumar, also received bullet injuries on his hand." The SP added: "There are a dozen cases registered against Raju. He admitted before police that he, along with Golu, shot Priya dead. Raju claimed they were hired by Kamal Sharma and given Rs 5.5 lakh for the crime." Priya was gunned down in posh Saket colony of the city around 11.30am on October 29 as she was on her way to college. Local residents said they rushed out after hearing a gunshot and saw Priya's body lying in a pool of blood. Some of them saw two bike-borne assailants speeding away. The bullet hit Priya's temple, killing her on the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-profs-hubby-gives-rs-5-l-to-contract-killers-for-murder/articleshow/87513772.cms||Harveer Dabas

The arrested accused has been identified as Ashisht Kumar Maurya, from Basti in Uttar Pradesh and currently residing in the Jwalapuri area of West Delhi. The investigation has revealed the accused person’s involvement in similar cheating cases across the country. The Aurangabad cyber police team, led by inspector Gautam Patare, seized 42 debit cards, 26 bank passbooks, 74 cheque books, four audit books, PAN cards, Aadhaar cards, three mobile phones and half a dozen SIM cards. The authorities said the suspect is part of the gang that befriends the targets on social media, falsely claiming to be non-resident Indians (NRIs). The cyber police authorities said that the victim in this case is a tax consultant by profession. She had received the money as a one-time settlement from her husband at the time of separation. The accused got in touch with the woman via a social networking site and claimed to be a foreign resident with a hefty fat pay scale. The suspect shared morphed pictures with the victim, which showed him at different locations in foreign countries. After winning the confidence of the victim, the accused proposed to her and as a token of love claimed that he had sent some precious gifts. While the woman awaited the gifts, she received a call from a person claiming to be an official in the customs department, and threatened to register a case for sourcing precious articles in the form of gifts and trying to evade customs duty. The accused allegedly asked the woman to deposit the money in the name of custom duty and cheated her of over Rs 21 lakh. Months later, she realized that she had been cheated, so she lodged a complaint with the cyber police station earlier this year, following which an offence of cheating, criminal breach of trust and sections of the Information and Technology Act were registered against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/youth-part-of-cybercrime-racket-nabbed/articleshow/87514599.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Modi was interacting with CMs, collectors of over 40 districts in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and other states with low vaccination coverage. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and his junior Dr Bharati Pawar were also present. Just a day earlier, CM Uddhav Thackeray had set November 30 as the deadline for vaccination of all residents of the state with one dose. The PM called for developing “micro strategies keeping in mind the experience so far to go for saturation vaccination by addressing the gaps at the local level”. Collectors listed out challenges they faced such as rumours resulting in vaccine hesitancy, difficult terrain, and challenges created due to prevailing weather conditions in recent months. Modi said vaccine hesitancy could be tackled by maximising community engagement through religious and community leaders. He urged health workers to knock on every door, ‘Har Ghar Dastak’, to ensure double vaccination and to reach every house, ‘Har Ghar Tika, Ghar Ghar Tika’. Aurangabad collector Sunil Chavan made a presentation, saying clerics and religious leaders of various faiths had been invited to participate in the ‘Mann Mein Hai Vishwas’ campaign launched by the state government. He said as an incentive, special funds would be provided to the first 25 villages in the district that achieve 100% vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-inoculate-all-aurangabad-tourism-workers-says-pm/articleshow/87517278.cms||---

The BJP state committee meeting attended by BJP national general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh has charted out a plan to invigorate the party rank and file. Recalling the tirade former Union minister Yaswanth Sinha had unleashed against the party leadership when Rajnath Singh was the party president, Santhosh unequivocally clarified to the state leaders that factional fighting would not be tolerated. He said leaders should try to expand their contact with people and personal differences should not stop a leader from initiating discussions with party colleagues. In an apparent reference to the letter written by BJP former general secretary (south) P P Mukundan, Santhosh told the state office-bearers on Tuesday that there was nothing wrong in leaders writing letters to him on organizational matters. But, to write a letter and leak it to the media even before the letter reaches the addressee is an unacceptable practice. Santhosh said the party was not ready to hold a single person responsible for the electoral failure. “If Surendran is responsible for the electoral debacle, I am also responsible for the same. In that case everyone else above me is responsible for the outcome in one way or another. Does it mean that all should quit their posts?” he asked. The leadership meeting has decided to appoint district prabharis (party in-charge). Each state office-bearer would work as the district prabhari. All vital organizational decisions would be taken by the district leadership in consultation with the prabharis. The district prabharis will have to compulsorily spend certain days in the district they are in charge of. According to sources, the number of members in the BJP state core committee is likely to be whittled down and more youngsters would be inducted into the highest decision-making body. Actor Krishnakumar, who recently joined the party, would oversee the youth wing activities of the party at the state level. Meanwhile, a political resolution passed by the BJP state conference demanded the decommissioning of Mullaperiyar dam and implementation of Gadgil committee report in its true spirit. It asked the state government to drop the SilverLine rail project and condemned the government for charging a case against Pala bishop for advising his laity against falling prey to the machinations of terror outfits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-central-leadership-reposes-faith-in-surendran/articleshow/87516586.cms||B S Anilkumar

Thakur was suspended on October 6 during his posting at Jehanabad. He was earlier posted in Patna when massive financial irregularities and forgeries had been detected. Thakur had allegedly allowed backdated entry of BS-III and BS-IV vehicles for registration using forged money receipts causing loss to the state exchequer. The bureau had lodged an FIR on Monday for disproportionate assets worth Rs91.22 lakh against Thakur. But the raid at Thakur’s flat number C-303 in Hari Radha Apartment on Sardar Patel Path at S K Puri revealed information about two flats on Gola Road in Patna, including a duplex worth around Rs2.5 crore, two more flats in Noida (UP), two in Ranchi and land purchased at Siliguri in West Bengal besides additional documents showing Rs90 lakh deposited in 11 bank accounts, investment of Rs60 lakh in 22 life insurance policies, gold and silver jewellery worth around Rs4.5 lakh and Rs1 lakh in cash. “Some of these properties were not known earlier and their details came to light after Wednesday’s raid,” a senior officer said and added that as per a rough estimation, Thakur’s properties must have the market value of Rs10 crore. He said all the bank accounts have been frozen. “We have also come to know about a locker in the SBI branch at S K Puri, which would be opened after seeking court order,” he said. The bureau also found documents showing that Thakur’s daughter had done MBBS from a private medical college in Kishanganj. “She is presently working as an intern in a hospital in Patna,” he said. The officer said Thakur’s son is doing MBA in Dubai. “Without huge donations, these two admissions could not have been possible. Thakur has been asked to furnish documents related to his children’s fee payment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vig-raid-on-dto-yields-assets-worth-rs5-crore/articleshow/87515611.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Deepa P Mohan also said that one of them is still there in the department and she had told the current vice-chancellor Sabu Thomas who was the director of the department then, about this. She also alleged that no action was taken on her complaint then. She said that she is scared to go to the department since one of them is still there. Deepa said that she will be filing a formal complaint about the sexual assault. Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor said that he had not received any complaints from the research student regarding this. “These are all false allegations,” he said. He also said that the student should come back to the varsity and complete her PhD. “I will extend all support to her in completing the PhD and I had offered to be her research guide also,” said Thomas. The hunger strike by Deepa entered the sixth day on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, she was shifted to hospital for medical support after her health deteriorated. She returned to the agitation venue late on Tuesday night. She is alleging that she had to face caste discrimination in the varsity and was not provided facilities for doing her research. The university authorities held talks with Deepa on Monday and agreed to all her demands except her demand for removing the head of the nano science department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mgu-woman-researcher-raises-sexual-abuse-allegation/articleshow/87516599.cms||---

Police have registered an FIR against 11 people, including some lawyers, under various sections of IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by Mudgal’s son, Mahan. No one has been arrested so far. Police said that preliminary investigation suggests that a long-standing property dispute between Mudgal and his brothers may have led to the lawyer's murder. Family members of the deceased alleged that they had already informed the police about the dispute, but they did not take the matter seriously. According to the FIR lodged by Mahan Mudgal, the incident took place when his father was sitting near a local dhaba and four bike-borne men came and opened fire at him. “My father immediately collapsed and when my brother and I tried to catch the shooter, they opened fire with an intention to kill us. However, we were not hurt,” Mahan Mudgal said in the FIR, adding that a person named Rajeev had threatened his father over the phone that he would kill him and his family just two hours before the incident. SSP Agra Sudhir Kumar Singh said the matter is being investigated in detail and teams have been formed to nab the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/lawyer-shot-dead-in-agra-11-booked/articleshow/87513030.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Agra||TIMES IMPACT: Sans power since Independence, UP illage to light up for 1st time in 75 yrs||Agra: The darkness of village Tulai Ka Nagla in UP's Etah will finally, after 75 years, dissolve into oblivion. The state government has now announced that it will be electrified within the next two months. The declaration came two days after TOI reported about Tulai Ka Nagla's umpteenth ''dark Diwali", with villagers complaining to this correspondent that their petition for power has been pending for over 60 years. UP power minister Shrikant Sharma said that the village has been included in the newly launched 'Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme' of the Centre and that action is being taken to light it up. Managing director of state government-owned discom Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (DVVNL) conducted a meeting with the district magistrate and electricity department officials to work out a plan to bring power supply to perhaps one of India's last dark patches. The Centre had claimed total electrification and last-mile delivery of electricity in every nook and corner of the country back in 2018. Electricity department officials said each house in the village will be lit within the next two months. The process of setting up electricity poles will begin after Diwali. Meanwhile, the local administration made arrangements to light up the village during Diwali so that residents do not have to celebrate a "black festival" ever again. DVVNL MD Amit Kishore said, “Work for electrification of Tulai ka Nagla has begun. The superintendent engineer of Etah has been asked to prepare a work plan. We will ensure that it is completed in a time-bound manner.” District magistrate of Etah, Ankit Kumar Agrawal, told TOI: “A team, led by the sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj and consisting of electricity department officials, was sent to the village to assess the on-ground situation. Electrification will be done on a priority basis. I have also ordered temporary arrangements for illumination so that villagers can celebrate the festival of lights.” Sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj, Manvendra Singh, said that a generator was brought in and lights installed on the main road of the village. He added that the generator can, for now, also be used by residents to illuminate their homes. This arrangement will remain in place for a week. He said that the state's non-conventional energy development agency has been asked to provide solar lights for the villagers. The village, with a population of about 300, has over 30 houses without an electric bulb. Residents have to travel a distance of 2 km to Raja Ka Rampur just to do basic tasks such as charging mobile phones. Students are unable to attend online classes and use candles to study in the evening, and women, every single day, prepare dinner before the sun sets. Thanking TOI for highlighting the decades-old plight of the village, Rajaram, a resident who claims to be 100 years old, said, “Since the past several decades, we have been trying to reach out to public representatives and local authorities. Years passed and governments changed, but we remained in darkness. Today (Wednesday), senior officials came to the village for the first time and assured us that each home will be electrified. We have no words to express our happiness. It will be a very happy Diwali for us this time.” Resident Ranjana Shakya said, “We have got our biggest Diwali gift in 60 years, maybe more. Village roads are being illuminated for the first time. The SDM has informed us that we will be getting electricity within the next two months. This will help students. After sunset, we will not have to survive on candles, diyas, and torches. We have made plans to celebrate big this year. Residents who had migrated out of the village because of the lack of power supply are also willing to return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/times-impact-sans-power-since-independence-up-illage-to-light-up-for-1st-time-in-75-yrs/articleshow/87513815.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Aurangabad||HC slams apathy towards plea of martyred soldier’s father||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has slammed the Parbhani district officials for their "apathy" towards deciding a 70-year-old man's plea for allotment of land under a government scheme after his soldier son had martyred in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) in 1996. "The authorities cannot show apathy to such persons and ought to have processed the claims on priority basis. By enormous delay the very purpose of such a benevolent scheme stands frustrated," the bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice R N Laddha said in an order on October 20. The HC directed the district collector of Parbhani to take a decision on the proposal of the petitioner for allotment of land within a period of one month from the date of order. Parbhani resident Namdev Rankhambe moved the HC in June by filing a petition through his lawyer Sachin Deshmukh stating that his 21-year old son Manchak, an army sepoy with the Mahar Regiment died on July 7, 1996 during operation 'Rakshak' carried out in J&K. On July 30, 2001, Namdev applied for allotment of a government land in his capacity as an immediate surviving family member of an army jawan who has died in the line of duty. The tehsildar of Sonpeth in Parbhani district submitted a report to the collector in 2002 stating that there was no encroachment on the government land proposed for allotment. A second report was forwarded on May 15, 2008 by the Tahsildar to the Sub Divisional Officer again notifying that no encroachment appeared on the government land. On October 14, 2020, the Resident Deputy Collector asked the District Army Welfare Officer to make an inquiry and to submit the report. The assistant government pleader appearing for the state submitted that in February this year, the report has been submitted to the collector along with battle casualty certificate and all other relevant documents. "In that event the Collector, Parbhani ought to have taken a decision by now," the HC bench observed. The HC said, "We fail to understand the lethargy on the part of the officials, the petitioner, a father of the martyred, is moving from 1996 seeking implementation of the benevolent Government Scheme. The reports are called for at the interval of six to eight years and that too without processing further. It is high time, final decision is taken by the authorities." "We have passed this order, as it is stated that the report and all documents are forwarded to the Collector, Parbhani in February 2021," the bench noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-slams-apathy-towards-plea-of-martyred-soldiers-father/articleshow/87514610.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While Aurangabad and Jalna districts come under the jurisdiction of the Aurangabad zone, the defaulter farmers together have paid Rs 9.42 crore towards their current and outstanding dues, as per an official release. “As a part of the amnesty scheme, interest and delayed payment charges on power dues towards agriculture pumps is waived off and farmers need to pay only 50% dues after further certain written off amount till March next year to get a complete waiver in remaining amount,” MSEDCL authorities said. The state power utility has said 66% of revenue recovered from the ongoing amnesty scheme will be utilised for strengthening power infrastructure in rural areas. “The 33% share will be disbursed each through gram panchayat and district levels. The money will be utilised for setting new power sub-stations, fitting new power transformers and giving power connections in rural areas. The payment of dues, therefore, is beneficial for farmers in multiple ways,” said the authorities. To know their arrears towards agricultural pumps, farmers are requested to visit the nearest MSEDCL office or simply enter their consumers' number on https://billcal.mahadiscom.in/agpolicy2020/.

Ashish, son of Union MoS for home Ajay Mishra Teni, is accused of mowing down protesting farmers in Kheri on October 3 causing death of four farmers and a journalist who was covering the agitation. Several others were injured. Meanwhile, two farmers from Singahi area of Lakhimpur Kheri district who are suspected to be involved in the "lynching" of three BJP workers, were arrested by SIT on Wednesday, said special prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav. The arrested farmers have been identified as Ranjeet Singh and Avtaar Singh alias Nikku. So far, four farmers have been held by the SIT while 13 people, including Ashish, have been arrested for the farmers' deaths. The judicial custody of all the accused has been extended till November 16 as the probe is still pending with SIT, the SPO added. Hearing on the bail applications of co-accused Ashish Pandey and Lavkush Rana was also deferred by the court of district and sessions judge Mukesh Mishra till November 15, said district government counsel Arvind Tripathi. Tripathi said defence counsels moved an application in the court for an explanation from the prosecution over a purported photograph of an injured BJP worker, Shyam Sundar Nishad, seen in police custody. Later, he was declared brought dead at a hospital. He was allegedly lynched by the angry protesters after the car mowed down the farmers. The prosecution objected to the production of the photograph, the authenticity of which is yet to be verified, Tripathi added. "Ashish's counsel has also submitted a photograph showing him at a wrestling event in Banbirpur village, but it can be admitted as primary evidence until verified by a forensic lab," the SPO said. The court called for a 'status report' on this from the prosecution, who sought 15 more days as some forensic reports are yet to be received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-main-accused-ashishs-bail-plea-hearing-deferred-till-nov-15/articleshow/87513832.cms||---

Choutuppal mandal tahsildar K Gangadhar, deputy tahsildar Mamatha and senior assistant Janaiah were suspended by Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district collector Pamela Satpathy after an inquiry by the additional collector following a complaint from the NRI owner. The additional collector’s report revealed that the three officials colluded with people who laid claim on a few acres actually owned by the NRI who had legal ownership documents. The officials instead of rejecting the notarised affidavit submitted by the fraudsters, went ahead and registered the land in their name. As this was brought to the notice of the collector, an inquiry was ordered and additional collector Srinivas Reddy visited the tahsildar’s office, verified the records and submitted a report which showed the wrongdoing on the part of the three officials.

---||Aurangabad||Over Rs 2,110cr disbursed to M’wada rain-hit farmers||Aurangabad: The administration has given around Rs 2,116 crore compensation towards crop damage for the benefit of rain-affected farmers in Marathwada till Tuesday, the authorities concerned said. The amount of help disbursed so far is 75% of the total help received by the division from the state government, the official data revealed. Aurangabad deputy divisional commissioner Parag Soman on Wednesday said that all eight districts in Marathwada have been asked to ensure speedy release of compensation. “As the first instalment towards compensation, the state government has released Rs 2,821.7 crore for Marathwada, where 100% disbursement will be over soon. The government is expected to release the second instalment of the remaining 25% after Diwali,” he said. The MVA government, in the second half of October, had declared a revised relief aid worth Rs 3,762.2 crore for the rain-hit farmers in the eight districts of Marathwada. The revised financial help was Rs 1,100 crore more than actual compensation worked out as per norms of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). As per official data, over 4.7 lakh farmers in Marathwada were adversely affected by the rain during the recent rainy season, especially in September. Rajan Kshirsagar, of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha, said the respective administrations should ensure that the help received from the government reaches the target farmers. “We fail to understand the logic behind disbursing the help in two instalments, with one said to get released after Diwali. It has been weeks since the natural calamity had hit the farmers and many farmers are still waiting for help hand from the government,” he said. Kshirsagar also said that inordinate delay in providing help to farmers would affect necessary preparations for the imminent rabi season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-rs-2110cr-disbursed-to-mwada-rain-hit-farmers/articleshow/87514631.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Non-state board students pay huge fines for HSC forms||Nagpur: Many CBSE, ICSE and other board students who shifted to state board junior colleges are now shelling out over Rs4,000 in fines because of delay in submitting the crucial eligibility form. All of this because some junior college teachers either did not inform or follow up with such students to submit their documents. Eligibility form is mandatory for all non-state board students if they wish to appear for HSC exams. This form is to be submitted to the board office through the junior college where students are enrolled. Shriram Chavhan, joint secretary (additional charge) of Nagpur divisional board, said, “As soon as such students take admission in Std XI, it is the duty of that college to get eligibility forms filled up by students. These forms are then sent to us by the college itself. Last date for submission of eligibility form is September 15 in the year when students enter Std XI. Unless this form is submitted and approved by us, students cannot appear for HSC.” However, due to either the pandemic or long closure, many colleges did not inform or follow up with students. A parent, whose child now has to pay almost Rs4,500 in fine, said, “My son is now in Std XII and is being asked to fill a form which should have been submitted when he was in Std XI. Even if colleges were not open in physical mode or students themselves opted for online classes, there is no excuse for such information not being percolated to students.” Now as more and more students become aware of the lapse, they are rushing to the board office in Civil Lines to collect eligibility forms. This form is available at a cost of around Rs150 (students should pay whatever is mentioned on the form) and is to be filled up by the student. Students must carry their migration certificate along to ensure that the process is smooth. The form is then submitted to the college where the principal or any authorized official signs it and forwards to the board office. After that, it does take a week or two for the entire process to get completed. Chavhan said, “Eligibility form is for basically ensuring that students are eligible to appear for our state board exam. We verify which subjects they had taken up at Std X level and are those considered as valid for HSC admissions or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/non-state-board-students-pay-huge-fines-for-hsc-forms/articleshow/87515660.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala’s ‘manathakkali’ to treat liver cancer||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The berry-bearing black nightshade shrub has been proved to have a compound useful for treating liver cancer. The compound---Uttroside-B---isolated from the plant as part of an ongoing research programme of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) has been granted the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) ‘orphan drug’ designation. The leaves of ‘Manathakkali’, a perennial shrub (Solanum nigrum) common in the backyards of houses and along pathways of Kerala, have immense properties to protect the human body’s largest internal organ from uncontrollable cell growth, said a team of scientists with RGCB working in the project. ‘Orphan drug’ designation supports development and evaluation of new treatments for rare diseases and allows fast-track approval of the drug. The technology patented by Dr Ruby John Anto, a senior scientist at RGCB, and her student, Dr Lekshmi R Nath, has been bought by US pharma company QBioMed. The technology transfer was done through Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, RGCB revealed here on Wednesday. Dr Ruby and Dr Lekshmi isolated the drug molecule, Uttroside-B, from the leaves of the Manathakkali plant. RGCB director Dr Chandrabhas Narayana said the research has the potential to be a major breakthrough in treatment of liver diseases, including liver cancer. The first milestone payment from QBioMed has already been received, he said. “The findings are path-breaking, given that the liver, which primarily detoxifies food while aiding digestion, is found to be increasingly susceptible to cancer in modern times. The malignant disease of the bile-producing organ is estimated to kill no less than 800,000 people annually even as 900,000 new cases are reported every year,” he said. In collaboration with Dr L Ravishankar (CSIR-NIST, Thiruvananthapuram), who has developed a novel method to isolate the compound from Solanum nigrum leaves, Dr Ruby and team are currently studying the compound’s efficacy against fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver cancer caused by food toxins. Dr Ruby said at present, there is only one FDA-approved drug available for liver cancer treatment. The compound developed by her team is found to be more effective than the one available, she said. Toxicity evaluation in human volunteers has shown that the compound is also effective in treating fatty liver. Recent results from Dr Ruby’s lab indicate that Chloroquine Phosphate, a drug used against malaria, if used in a combinatorial regimen with Uttroside-B, can tremendously improve the therapeutic efficacy of Uttroside-B against liver cancer. The technology has been granted patent by the US, Canada, Japan and South Korea. The research work was published in the Nature group of journals, ‘Scientific Reports’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/black-nightshade-can-fight-liver-cancer/articleshow/87516638.cms||---

Indian Resort Hotels Ltd has been directed to handover possession of the land to the tourism department on or before the end of six months from the date of issue of the order. It has also been directed to pay arrears of rent along with interest amounting to Rs 65 crore within 30 days from the date of receipt of the order. The North Goa collector has been directed to take possession of the property if the company fails to comply with the government’s order. The termination order will become effective in six months from the date of issuance of the order. The tourism department had planned to have recreational and amusement facilities for tourists at the site and procured the property at Rs 53 lakh and leased it to Indian Resort Hotels Ltd for 50 years for a lease of Rs 1 crore. The official said the company failed to carry out any development as was agreed upon and it did not even pay the rent. The company faced difficulties in getting various permissions, that were mandatory to execute the plan of having facilities for tourists, he said. “It is a prime land having a beautiful view, and a lot can be done to elevate the touristic value of the place. The prime property has been left unutilised for so many years,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-over-20-yrs-govt-nixes-lease-deed-with-resort-chain/articleshow/87517290.cms||---

Recently one Vinod Ambadekar — who works as a traffic controller with Travel Time (one of the red bus operators) — suffered eye damage after he was attacked by a group of autorickshaw drivers near Maharajbagh depot. At around 9.22am on Wednesday, an Aapli bus coming from Khaparkheda power station reached Mahadula bus stop on Koradi-Nagpur Road, where around three passengers alighted and as many boarded the bus. “Conductor Shivdas Kawle (36) was busy issuing tickets to passengers. Before he could understand anything, a young man boarded the bus and allegedly slapped Kawle, while two of his accomplices abused the driver,” police said. The youth also snatched the ticket fare collected by Kawle, which he returned later. The trio were autorickshaw drivers and were very angry over Aapli Bus ferrying passengers. Over this, they attacked Kawle and abused the bus driver. Later, Kawle dialled the police control room and filed a complaint with Koradi police station. Cops have registered a case and are probing further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/autorickshaw-drivers-thrash-aapli-bus-conductor/articleshow/87515666.cms||---

---||Kanpur||SP to contest 2022 polls in alliancewith PSPL, small parties: Akhilesh||Kanpur: Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said on Wednesday that his party with contest the upcoming 2022 UP assembly elections in alliance with Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) and other small and regional parties. Giving broad hints of cementing ties with his estranged uncle and PSPL chief Shivpal Singh Yadav, Akhilesh said his party will give full respect to ‘Chacha’. In the past few days, PSPL president Shivpal Singh Yadav has been continuously expressing his willingness for a poll alliance, saying his priority is always to side with SP for contesting the 2022 assembly elections and had been waiting for a signal from his nephew. On Wednesday, Akhilesh finally gave positive signs on alliance with his uncle. Akhilesh said many parties are allying with SP for 2022 elections. “Samajwadi Party is constantly trying to bring regional and smaller parties together for the 2022 assembly elections. Many parties have come with SP recently. SBSP chief O P Rajbhar announced his association with us at a programme in Mau. It is natural that we will forge an alliance with the party of ‘Chacha’ and SP people will give him full respect. I want to assure that,” he said. Shivpal had formed PSPL in 2018 after he left Samajwadi Party when Akhilesh took over the reins from his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. Akhilesh, who reached his ancestral village Saifai on Wednesday to celebrate Diwali, also exchanged greetings with the party workers on the occasion and appealed to them to light a lamp in memory of the farmers who died due to fertilizer shortage, crop loss and other reasons. He said, “Let us all take a pledge to work to ensure happiness in everyone’s life and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.” “At the same time, we should also realise that many people are not able to celebrate the festival due to high inflation. People are not able to fulfill their needs due to rising costs. Today, we got the news that a farmer committed suicide in Baghpat due to debt,” he added. Akhilesh further said farmers are in trouble and are not getting benefits. “Many farmers have lost their lives while standing in line for fertilizers. Paddy is standing in the fields, but the government is not able to tell where farmers can get the due price of their crop.

Chavan, who attended the virtual meeting chaired by the PM with districts with low-vaccination coverage, said the recent heavy rainfall and associated issues hampered the pace of vaccination drive in Aurangabad district. “The PM has asked us to provide vaccination coverage to all, including those from the tourism and hospitality industry. A set of stern measures, including compulsory vaccination for certain groups, will be taken to improve the vaccination coverage soon,” he said. A day before the meeting convened by the PM, the Aurangabad district administration had made getting at least one dose mandatory for government employees and the business community. The partial vaccination has also been made compulsory for getting government NoCs, to travel in buses, and visit government establishments. When asked whether vaccination can be made mandatory as the central government has declared it to be voluntary, Chavan said, the state government has already introduced such a condition for boarding the local trains in Mumbai. “If Mumbai can make Covid vaccination compulsory, Aurangabad, which is known as the tourism capital of the state, has to follow the suit in public interest,” he said. Chavan further said awareness measures are also being planned to improve coverage. “We are roping in celebrities and religious leaders to spread awareness on the importance of vaccination as such individuals have a large influence. It is an ardent appeal to all beneficiaries to get fully vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. Out of the total target population of 32 lakh, 55% of beneficiaries are partially vaccinated, while over 22% are fully vaccinated. The percentage of fully vaccinated beneficiaries in Aurangabad district is considerably low when compared to the state average of 33%, as per the official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-collector-pm-for-push-in-vax-coverage-to-win-tourists-confidence/articleshow/87514635.cms||---

The incident happened at Mohammadpur in Gopalganj district on Wednesday. This is the third hooch tragedy in the state within 11 days. Four persons had died in Siwan on October 24 and eight more at Saraiya in Muzaffarpur on October 28 and 29 after consuming spurious liquor. The deceased were identified as Santosh Sah, Chote Lal Soni, Chote Lal Prasad and one Mukesh Ram. At least four persons, who also allegedly consumed poisonous liquor, were undergoing treatment at the government hospital. They had complained of nausea, stomach ache, vomiting and other symptoms typical to poisonous hooch consumption, the authorities said. Gopalganj DM Nawal Kishore Choudhary, SP Anand Kumar and other senior authorities rushed to Mohammadpur with medical teams soon after deaths came to light on Wednesday morning. The SP said they consumed liquor in the house of deceased Mukesh and one Chotu Ram at Chamar Tola in Mohammadpur on Tuesday night. “They started dying one after another thereafter. Their postmortem examinations were being conducted and viscera would be preserved for further analysis,” the SP said and added that a medical survey was being conducted in and around Mohammadpur to identify if any other person was ill. He said three persons were arrested and at least 36 pouches of liquor had been seized from both the houses. “Those arrested are being interrogated,” he said. Kumar said Mukesh’s brother Sunil Ram is in jail after police arrested him with 31 litres of liquor in September. “Chotu’s father Nagendra Ram and brother Ramanand Ram are also involved in liquor smuggling. We are trying to ascertain the source from where the liquor was brought,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/spurious-liquor-claims-4-more-lives-in-gopalganj/articleshow/87515683.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After playing hard to get for long, ‘attacker’ leopard walks into cage||MUMBAI: The 2-year-old sub-adult female leopard that had caused panic in Aarey Colony for more than a month was trapped in a cage behind Chhota Kashmir on Wednesday evening. Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests, said that the leopard that has now been trapped is the one that the forest department had been looking for. “After successful operation of Thane forest, Sanjay Gandhi National Park and members of Mumbaikars for SGNP, the so-called ‘problem leopardess C 32’ is trapped successfully and has been taken to SGNP. We will see what is to be done next. We will take care, find out what exactly has gone wrong with the leopardess. The other leopardess which was trapped earlier, the sibling of C 32, will be released in due course of time and if possible with a radio collar around her neck,” said Limaye. Jayesh Bhise, a local, said a cage had been set up on the edge of Ekta Nagar basti behind Chhota Kashmir close to a forestthicket. “The forest officials would routinely come on rounds to check if the leopard had been trapped. Around 7.30 pm, it was they who found the trapped leopard,” he said. It was only on Saturday that Limaye had renewed permission to continue the operation to trap the spotted wild cat. Typically, permission is granted only for a month. The Thane forest division, which oversees Aarey Colony, had set up camera traps to identify the leopardess that was attacking humans. During one such trip to lay camera traps, the team had managed to take a picture as she made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a human. This picture was then matched with earlier picture records of all leopards in SGNP and Aarey. The leopard was identified by its rosette pattern which matched with that of C 32. In over a month C 32 has attacked nearly eight people, including a 4-year-old child and a senior citizen. All of them were treated at Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Centre for claw injuries and required suturing. Two cages with a bait in one were laid at different locations in Aarey Colony where the leopard had attacked people. The first leopard to be captured was the sibling of C32 and she continues to be in captivity. The second one that was trapped was the mother of the two female leopards. The mother was immediately released after it was verified that she was not the one attacking humans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-playing-hard-to-get-for-long-attacker-leopard-walks-into-cage/articleshow/87517296.cms||Clara Lewis

The plant, having automatic scum breaking mechanism, will treat 5,000 kg of food, fish and vegetable waste generated in the SGPDA markets. The Rs 2.4 crore plant has been set up as a pilot project. Depending on its performance, Margao Municipal Council (MMC) plans to add two more such plants at the SGPDA market. Plans are also on the anvil to set up two 25 TPD plants at Sonsoddo. Speaking on the occasion, Sardesai urged MMC councillors to work towards setting up the two plants before the 2022 assembly elections. “If you can’t, you are misfit for the job and should sit at home,” he told the councillors, most of whom owe allegiance to him and Kamat. Pune-based Urja Agency, which has bagged the contract, will operate and maintain the plant for five years, MMC chief officer, Agnelo Fernandes said. “From this plant we are going to make 400cum biogas that will generate 450 units of power on a daily basis. The power generated will be used for the plant’s operations and for streetlights at the SGPDA market. The plant will also produce 700 to 1,000 kg fo organic manure per day which will be used for maintenance of the municipality garden and lawns,” he said. Bio-methanation is a process by which organic material is microbiologically converted under anaerobic conditions to biogas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-gets-5-tonne/day-bio-plant-to-treat-mkt-waste/articleshow/87517297.cms||---

The CM showed the teachers the order already issued by the government, effecting a hike in their salaries. The teachers, however, said that they are also fighting for regularisation of their services and that their agitation has only been suspended temporarily based on their meeting with the CM. “I have issued an order 10 days ago. They were being getting paid Rs 16,000, which salary will now be hiked to Rs 25,000 a month. Until now, they were getting paid for only ten months in a year, now they will get paid throughout the year. I don’t know why they sat for the strike. Because I had already told them that the order to revise their salary was issued,” said Sawant. The teachers were appointed by the state government on contract basis under the Goa Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, utilising central government funds. The teachers are engaged to teach from Class I to VIII, which acts as a supplementary assistance to regular teachers in the school. The contract teachers, however, said that they are being engaged on a contract basis for a number of years now and after dedicating so many years of services should be considered for regularisation by the government. “We have done whatever we could for the teachers. Five to six of the teachers do not meet the required qualifications, but we have given them whatever fits within the regulations,” said the chief minister . Some days ago, the teachers had refused to call off their strike even based on an assurance to hike their salaries by the chief minister. However, on Wednesday, Sawant presented the order which has already been issued to effect an increase in salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/contract-teachers-call-off-strike-after-cm-shows-order/articleshow/87517294.cms||---

The action against four establishments, mainly involved in milk products, in Shirol tehsil is considered the biggest raid carried out by FDA ahead of Diwali. The khawa was made using skimmed milk powder and whey powder. As per the natural process, khawa is made by evaporating the milk slowly and the reduced milk solid is termed khawa. It is used to make sweets like peda, barfi and to make masala milk.  Mohan Kembalkar, the assistant commissioner of FDA, said, “The khawa prepared by unnatural means was sold to Pune-based sweet shops. The colour of such adulterated khawa is the same as that of natural khawa but did not have a good taste. This adulterated khawa is much cheaper and made faster so the sweet shop owners may fall prey to it. We have destroyed the khawa and the raw materials used by the establishments.” The FDA received the information about the adulterated khawa being prepared in these establishments. The samples of the khawa and raw materials are sent for testing. Now the establishments have been sealed. Kembalkar said legal action will be initiated once the lab test reports arrive. The FDA authorities are going to communicate with the sweet shop owners to whom the adulterated khawa was sold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-fda-destroys-1400kg-adulterated-khawa/articleshow/87514644.cms||---

Road widening from Bolshe Circle to Fereira Garden at Sonsoddo, widening of roads and construction of drains around Don Bosco College, hot-mixing of internal roads at SGPDA market, hot-mixing of roads at Pajifond and widening of road from Gogol junction to Maruti temple are among the works launched earlier this week. Sardesai informed the people that along with widening of roads, beautification of the road at Bolshe circle will be done by placing benches similar to those at Opinion Poll Square. “Even this path could be used as a walking track as it will be around 900 m long,” he said. “Along with public safety on the road, the complete facelift of this area will take place after the project is completed, and within three months, this road will be widened,” he said. The Goa Forward Party president further said that through his ‘Sunday Dialogue’ programme, people had demanded widening of roads to avoid accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-unveils-devpt-works-worth-rs-22cr-in-fatorda/articleshow/87517307.cms||---

The CBI has named inspector Jagat Narayan Singh, sub-inspectors Akshaya Mishra and Vijay Yadav and three other police personnel of Gorakhpur’s Ramgarh Tal police station as the accused in the case. So far, the case was being probed by UP Police's special investigation team (SIT). Six police officials have been booked in a murder case and suspended from service. Though they were absconding, all the accused were arrested in October. Meenakshi said that it was only through the media that she came to know about the registration of an FIR by the CBI. "Thanks to the government and CM Yogi Adityanath, who not only helped the family financially but he appointed me as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Kanpur Development Authority and accepted my demand for a CBI inquiry. Now the killer policemen of my husband will not be able to escape under any circumstances." To recall, Manish Gupta had died allegedly after being tortured by the police during a police raid at a hotel in Gorakhpur. Manish's wife Meenakshi had made several demands after her husband's death including a CBI inquiry, necessary compensation and a job. Accepting Meenakshi’s demand, CM Yogi Aditya Nath had not only recommended the case to CBI for investigation, but also gave financial assistance of Rs 40 lakh and also ordered to appoint her as OSD in KDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/wife-of-businessman-killed-by-police-thanks-cm-for-registration-of-fir-by-cbi/articleshow/87515686.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Ex gratia to Covid-19 victims’ kin from November 15||MUMBAI: The state is keen to start disbursal of Rs50,000 ex gratia each to kin of Covid-19 victims by November 15. State disaster management department officials said they would issue a GR soon. Funds had been allocated, they added. Nearly Rs700 crore was to be allocated for disbursement. Around 1.4 lakh Covid deaths have been reported in the state so far. State principal secretary (relief & rehabilitation) Aseem Gupta told TOI a website was being tested for financial transactions and a user acceptance test would be rolled out soon. “We were hoping to roll it out during Diwali, but testing is on. The GR should be issued soon,” he said. One can apply for ex gratia to the district collector with Covid-19 death certificate of the kin and other documents mentioned in the application. The collector will make payment through DBT (direct benefit transfer), said another official. Collectors have been told to prepare a list of beneficiaries ahead of disbursal. State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas earlier issued an order to form grievance committees to address issues from kin of Covid deceased. “Kin of Covid deceased having grievances regarding certification of Covid death or delay in disbursal of Rs50,000 can approach grievance redressal committees under the collector in rural areas and under deputy municipal commissioner in the city areas,” stated the order. Public health department told collectors and commissioners to form grievance redressal panels.

The district has now slipped to ninth position. So far, 25 lakh citizens above 18 years age have received first dose and 10 lakh have received both doses. The number of beneficiaries with both doses is 35%. The authorities claim that vaccine hesitancy among the citizens is a major cause of worry. “Several reasons are responsible for the vaccine hesitancy. First is the misinformation owing to the fear mongering on social media. We have therefore sought the help of local public representatives, religious leaders to appeal to the beneficiaries to get the vaccine,” said Farukh Desai, district vaccination nodal officer.. Desai added that the vaccine is safe and very few beneficiaries have witnessed adverse effects. Even those affects are minor and subside in a day or two, he said. The less turnout of beneficiaries during the festival period has resulted into district slipping to ninth position in the vaccination turnout. The officials claimed that by November-end the entire target population will get the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-16l-in-kolhapur-dist-have-second-dose-due/articleshow/87514665.cms||---

The Indian Air Force Station at Chakeri and adjoining civilian pockets remain the Zika epicentre in Kanpur. “All 25 patients are stable and have been isolated. There’s no need to panic due to the spurt in cases. Special teams have been constituted to monitor patients and collect samples of their family members, relatives and other contacts. One of the 36 infected has been shifted to Kanshiram Trauma Centre in Rama Devi from home isolation,” said district magistrate Vishak G Iyer on Wednesday after an emergency review meet with health officials at Ursala Hospital. The DM said the health department had collected blood samples of more than 600 people on October 30 and 31 and dispatched them to KGMU, Lucknow, and 25 samples had tested positive the virus. The latest cases were reported from Pardevanpurwa, Pokharpur, Tiwaripur, Asharfabad, Shyamnagar and Adarsh Nagar areas of Chakeri. A senior health department official said, teams of district administration and health department are scanning the travel history of health workers to zero in on their contacts. An alert has been sounded in a 30km area around the periphery of IAF hangars and affected areas of Chakeri and a massive vector control drive has been launched. “Isolation beds with mosquito nets have been arranged at Kanshi Ram Hospital, Ursala Hospital and Dufferin Hospital. Teams have been deployed for surveillance, source detection and reduction, investigation and door-to-door campaign,” said the DM. “I appeal to citizens to remove stagnant water in houses or in the neighbourhood to wipe out mosquito breeding sites. Fogging and sample collection is continuing in full swing,” he said. The first Zika case was reported from Pardewanpurwa in Chakeri on October 23 after a 57-year-old Indian Air Force officer tested positive for the virus. Later, he was admitted to Air Force hospital, where the doctors stated his condition to be stable. Later, two more IAF staffers and one civilian tested positive on October 30. A day later, another six, all civilians, tested positive for the virus. Last week, the state government stepped up measures to eliminate mosquito-breeding spots to eliminate the virus. The agencies have removed more than 120 mosquito-breeding points in more than a dozen localities of Chakeri. Data till October 31 showed that more than 15,000 households had been surveyed to check larvae breeding points. A Central team also visited Kanpur and collected samples from affected areas. Chief Minister Adityanath has directed officials to undertake extensive door-to-door sanitisation and fogging to stop Zika spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/states-zika-tally-climbs-to-36-after-25-more-including-6-iaf-men-test-positive-for-virus-in-kanpur/articleshow/87515698.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Maxwell Rodrigues, co-director of Mattzus Learning Technologies, thanked the government for disbursing the funds, which have been pending for close to a year.

---||Delhi||As severe crisis looms in Delhi, fate partly in your hands||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category for the second consecutive day on Wednesday with an overall Air Quality Index of 314, marked by shallow smog in the morning. The pollution level is forecast to surge on Diwali and the AQI is likely to slip into the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category or even touch the ‘severe’ category on Thursday and Friday. Strong surface winds may then bring about an improvement on November 6. The impact of stubble burning in neighbouring states on Delhi’s air was calculated to be 8% of the PM2.5 level. Forecasting body System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) counted 3,271 such fires on Wednesday. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “Due to cyclonic circulation over north-west Rajasthan, the wind direction changed to south-easterly and easterly. The wind speed slowed during the transition phase and light wind caused accumulation of pollutants.” Track the pollution level in your cityThe air is expected to degrade on Thursday. The sub-committee constituted for implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) held a meeting on Wednesday and later said, “The AQI is likely to deteriorate marginally on November 4 and may be in the higher end of ‘very poor’ category on November 5 and 6 as the winds turn north-westerly. But even with higher emissions, model predictions do not indicate air quality hitting the ‘severe’ mark.” SAFAR warned that the city air was likely to worsen if there were fireworks on Diwali, though all pyrotechnics have been prohibited. Its bulletin said the share of stubble burning was likely to rise from November 4 due to transport level winds reaching Delhi from north-west where farm fires were located. “In addition, very calm local wind conditions with little ventilation are expected over the next three days,” it said. The forecasting body has estimated that if no firecrackers were burst in Delhi, the PM2.5 level would likely be in the upper end of ‘very poor’ during November 4-6. However, even if there is half the firework emission of 2019 this year, then the AQI would be prone to touch the ‘severe’ category in that period. IMD has predicted surface winds at the speed of 20-3 kmph during the day on November 6 and 7. This will help disperse pollutants and help the air improve slightly, though SAFAR said it would still fluctuate between a high ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ levels. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Pre-emptive measures for controlling emissions from local sources must be implemented at the earliest. The government must also step up public messaging to urge citizens not to burst firecrackers on Diwali. This will help avoid the additional pollution load."

---||Mumbai||BMC permits Chhath Puja, says avoid beaches; it’s injustice, say BJP & Congress||MUMBAI: The BMC has allowed Chhath Puja celebrations this year, but has urged devotees to ‘avoid’ city beaches and instead perform the puja at artificial ponds. The civic body has also asked the city police to ensure there is no crowding at beaches. However, with the BMC elections just a few months away, politics over the festival, which is mostly celebrated by north Indians, has heated up. Congress and BJP termed the Shiv Sena-led BMC’s decision an “injustice to devotees”, and demanded that Chhath Puja be allowed with certain restrictions, like it had been done for Ganeshotsav. Chhath Puja, which will start on November 10 and end the next morning, is mostly celebrated by Bihar and Uttar Pradesh natives. Women fast and pray to the sun and Chhathi Devi for the long life and well-being of their husbands and children. In a circular issued on Monday, the BMC detailed issued detailed guidelines for Chhath Puja celebrations amid the pandemic. “...mass celebration of Chhath Puja at seashores should be avoided and the police must ensure that there is no crowding. Organisations seeking permission at the ward level should construct artificial ponds at their own cost... and drain them after Chhath Puja is over,” it stated. The circular also said that all those participating in Chhath Puja should be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and the organisers should screen everyone. In closed venues, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 100 persons; and in open areas, a maximum of 50% of the ground capacity will be permitted, with a ceiling of 200 persons. Terming the guidelines “unfair”, the BJP and Congress have taken up the issues with the BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said: “The BMC must allow puja at beaches. It must create artificial ponds to avoid crowding and not put the responsibility on the organisers. This is unfair since Ganpati visarjan was allowed in a limited manner.” Congress functionary Suraj Singh Thakur concurred. “There are many north Indians in Mumbai...The BMC must allow the festival to be celebrated in a limited manner, just like Ganeshotsav.” This Ganpati festival, the BMC had capped the height of idols, banned all processions and allowed only five people to gather for pooja at pandals and 10 for visarjan. It had banned physical darshan at pandals; instead mandals were asked to instead arrange for online darshan for devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-permits-chhath-puja-says-avoid-beaches-its-injustice-says-bjp-congress/articleshow/87517441.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin, Patna’s overall AQI was recorded at 235 at 4pm on Wednesday, a sharp spike from 203 a day before. It was the average of the AQI measured by five continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations at BIT-Patna (277), Eco Park (273), S K Memorial Hall (199), DRM Office-Khagaul (200), and Patna City (228). An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. A ‘poor’ AQI essentially means that people may suffer from breathing problems on prolonged exposure to the air. Ashok Ghosh, the chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), told this reporter that transition in weather and use of firecrackers were the two major reasons for a rise in air pollution in Patna. “We have already asked the district administration to ensure compliance of the National Green Tribunal’s order. However, people are still bursting crackers. The only relief is that lesser number of Patnaites are doing so because they have understood how harmful the after-effects are,” he added. The BSPCB is conducting a 14-day special monitoring drive to study the behaviour of the toxic pollutants during Diwali and Chhath. Four monitoring stations have been installed at Parivesh Bhawan, Beltron Bhawan, I-T roundabout and Kankerbagh. Ghosh said, “On the basis of the results of the special monitoring drive, the BSPCB will prepare a report on the air quality during Diwali and Chhath. Accordingly, an advisory will be issued and corrective measures taken by next year.” He added, “Now, metals like lead, tin, strontium, cadmium, barium and many harmful chemicals are used in firecrackers. The fume from these can affect the lungs of the Covid-recovered patients and kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-turns-poor-might-deteriorate/articleshow/87515732.cms||Faryal Rumi

The average of daily case positivity rate was around 1.5% with 2,445 tests done. Over the past two weeks, the number of covid tests done has reduced to 2,000-2500 a day, and it could be attributed to fewer people falling sick. Over the last ten days, daily infections have been in the range of 30 to 40 cases. Three patients were hospitalised during the day, and one was discharged. The recovery rate was 97.9%. The caseload of Margao urban health centre dropped below 50, while that of Panaji has gone below 40, the only two centres that have relatively more cases. Dharbandora primary health centre had nil cases on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/320-active-cases-vity-rate-at-1-5/articleshow/87517418.cms||---

During the 2020-2021 period, 39 MDR-TB cases were reported in the district. There were 55 and 83 cases in the earlier consequent years. The health administration has decided to start a separate ward for drug-resistant TB patients at the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital. The authorities credit the starting of the out-patient department (OPD) and testing facilities at the CPR hospital for the decline in MDR-TB cases. MDR-TB is caused by microbial organisms that are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, the most potent drugs used to treat tuberculosis. Anita Saibannavar, a pulmonologist at the CPR Hospital, said, “Overall, TB cases are going down due to the use of masks by citizens to avoid the Covid infection. The decline in MDR-TB cases is a relief as such patients do not respond to medicines and continue to spread the disease.” “Since 2015, steps are being taken to stop MDR-TB cases from growing. We have an OPD running, we also get all the tests done and give medicines free of cost. We ensure no patient skips the treatment midway,” she added. The cost of medicines used for the treatment of MDR-TB patients is high and, therefore, the patients from well-to-do families too come here for treatment said Saibannavar. “The treatment for MDR-TB takes time. The cost of medicines for dredging is high and treatment cost goes up to Rs 15 lakh at private establishments,” Saibannavar said. Meanwhile, a special drive to find TB patients in the district will be organised between November 15 and 25. District collector Rahul Rekhawar has said private doctors may be punished under the IPC if they fail to notify the TB patients undergoing treatment with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-sees-a-drop-in-number-of-mdr-tb-cases/articleshow/87514676.cms||---

Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said, “On October 23, Lanka police had initiated the process to book Rai, who is lodged in the Naini jail of Prayagraj, under Gangster Act for his involvement in many criminal cases. The special court accepted invoking the Gangsters Act against Rai, who had appeared through video conferencing.” Rai and Sujit Belwa, a co-accused in the same criminal cases also in jail, had been booked under Gangster Act on the same date and the court had already remanded Belwa in this case, he added. As per police records, 21 criminal cases are lodged against Rai, who had been booked under Gangster Act twice in 2009 and 2011. A total of 39 criminal cases are lodged against Belwa, who had also been booked under Gangster Act and Goonda Act in the past. Rai had gone behind the bars on June 22, 2019, in a rape case filed by a woman against him at the Lanka police station in May 2019 alleging he raped her at his apartment on March 7, 2019 and also recorded a video. Rai, who had filed nomination as BSP candidate from Ghosi Lok Sabha seat, won the election as an absconder and later surrendered before the court on June 22, 2019. The complainant and prime witness had died after setting themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi on August 17, 2021, after levelling serious allegations on police officials and other authorities. The state government took action against many police officials after the self-immolation by the victim and witness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/jailed-bsp-mp-atul-rai-booked-under-gangsters-act/articleshow/87515744.cms||---

The event was organised by the Kolhapur Hikers, a trekking group from the city, and around 200 people participated to light clay lamps at the fort. Traditional lathi-kathi and mardani games were also performed at the fort. Sagar Patil, the founder of Kolhapur Hikers, said, “Forts are a symbol of ‘Hindwi Swarajya’ established by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. During fesitvals, we celebrate at our homes, but these historical forts often remain in the dark. Therefore, we started celebrating Diwali at the forts. This was the eighth year of Deepotsav at Panhala fort with the tagline ‘Ek Sanj Panhal Gadavar, Swarajya Chya Gad Kotanvar’, which means one evening on Panhala fort. It is held on the night of Dhantrayodashi. Around 200 people including our group members and other Kolhapur citizens participated. The event went on till the midnight. Deepotsav started with prayers and lighting of lamps at the Shiv mandir at the fort by Panhala court judge Ritesh Mavatwal, Panhala mayor Rupali Dhadel and deputy mayor Pallavi Naikawdi.” Citizens who took part for the first time in the Deepotsav thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Priyanka Patil, a banker from Kolhapur, said, “Last year, I missed Deepotsav due to Covid. I had decided to participate this time. It was a wonderful experience to light up the historical fort at Panhala, which stands tall in testament to the brave history of our Maratha warriors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/200-participants-help-light-up-the-historic-panhala-fort-on-deepotsav/articleshow/87514692.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Quarantine rules flouted rampantly, say experts, warn coronavirus still on prowl||MUMBAI: There is growing concern that quarantine norms are not being followed with seriousness despite the state Covid task force emphasising that isolation protocols shouldn’t be compromised even if cases are declining. Recently, the wife of a Covid-positive patient accompanied her husband to the hospital to get him admitted and carry out the initial formalities. Similarly, a man who was Covid-positive accompanied his father, positive as well, to get him admitted to a private facility. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the state task force, said such instances of blatant violation of Covid protocols are now routinely seen. “I have come across such cases myself. It is important that contacts of positive patients quarantine themselves and get tested,” he said. Even if the contacts are vaccinated, they have to follow the quarantine protocols, he added. Quarantine rules require high-risk contacts to stay home for 14 days. The corporation tests them between 5 and 7 days. For every positive case, the state had said that 15-20 contacts must be traced. Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical officer of health for M West ward, said the seriousness around quarantining has definitely diminished. “We do carry out contact-tracing and reach out to them for testing as well, but many undergo the tests themselves. We tell them to stay indoors for 14 days,” he said. Another ward officer said many even resume work, particularly people living in the slums, before completion of 14 days. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force, said asymptomatic contacts too must strictly follow the quarantine norms. “They should get tested and resume activities only after finishing 14 days. Mumbai continues to see 200-300 cases daily, which means the viral activity has not disappeared,” he said. The city, being densely populated and a hub for migration, needs to remain extra vigilant, he reminded. Outside Mumbai, district-level officials too are finding it challenging to keep people at home. An official from Jalgaon admitted that contact-tracing is not carried out with the same vigil but health officials do visit households to tell them about the norms. Dr Avinash Aher, district health officer of Washim, said they selectively send contacts for institutional quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-quarantine-rules-flouted-rampantly-say-experts-warn-virus-still-on-prowl/articleshow/87516724.cms||---

In their place, 15 railway stations from Kolhapur, Sangli and Miraj section are expected to be shifted to the Solapur division. The Railway Road Passenger Association has opposed this idea stating that these stations were shifted from the Hubli division to the Pune division 17 years ago. Due to the shift, these stations were not developed properly, and now shifting them to the Solapur division may affect the ongoing works. Sukumar Patil, a member of the Railway Kruti Samiti, said, “Stations in Kolhapur, Sangli, Miraj section were in the Hubli division of the South Central Railway. To carry out developments at these station, the political leaders from the region made the demand and then these stations came to the Pune division. The development of these stations had not taken place even then. And now, if these stations go to the Solapur division, are passengers going to get all the facilities?” Shivnath Biyani, a member of the advisory committee for the Pune division, talking about the proposal of shit the stations, said, “It is not known if this is a rumour or truth. If this is indeed true, then it will affect the development of stations in the Kolhapur, Sangli, Miraj section for sure and we will oppose the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/proposal-to-swap-divisions-of-rail-stations-sparks-concern/articleshow/87514709.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

It has also saved chronic patients from having to spend thousands of rupees at private hospitals. Dialysis patients are treated free here and a senior doctor at the CHC, Dr Shyam Kankonkar, recalling a time when a patient told him that is was becoming difficult for him to buy an Erythropoietin injection, said that when this was conveyed to the health minister, he immediately made it available to patients free of cost. “It is a costly injection given to the patient on dialysis. A patient needs to be given three to four of them every month. Buying so many injections was becoming a burden for them,” Kankonkar said. One patient said that every month he had to spend around Rs 15-17 thousand for the Erythropoietin injection before but it was made free at the Valpoi CHC. Presently the centre is treating 61 chronic kidney patients. A patient said that earlier it was very difficult for him to travel to GMC twice or three times a week. “I also had to wait for long hours for my turn. This was the biggest task. But ever since the dialysis unit started at Valpoi, it has become very easy for us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dialysis-unit-at-valpoi-centre-cuts-travelling-treatment-cost-for-patients/articleshow/87517456.cms||---

Investigators said that Shahid used the siphoned money to repay his loan that was due for many months while another accused Bharat Gida invested the money in land. The probe also revealed that Navdekar learnt the trick of duping people from Nigerian gangs by seeing their videos online. Crime branch officials said that Shahid, who was arrested three days ago in a Rs 30 lakh cheating case, had seen videos of the Nigerian gangs’ rackets on YouTube for months. “During interrogation, Shahid, a resident of Mumbai, said he saw many videos of the black dollar scam executed by the Nigerian gangs in different parts of the country. He thought it was a good way to make quick money and hence he decided to form a gang,” said a crime branch official. Shahid, who was in the used tyres business, had come in touch with Gida, a resident of Amreli, during the former’s business visits to Gujarat. Shahid and Gida, who have cases of assault, kidnapping and cheating registered against him, then made plans to dupe people and they involved two more persons Mahesh Vala and Imran Bhurani. Maulik Prajapati, a businessman from Ahmedabad, came in contact with Gida last year. Gida convinced Prajapati to invest money in black dollars and earn quick profits. Gida, a former leader of National Students Union of India (NSUI), Amreli then introduced Prajapati to Shahid who posed as customs inspector AK Malhotra. Shahid told Prajapati that he has black dollars worth lakhs of rupees and the latter could earn huge profits by selling them in the open market. Crime branch officials said Shahid and his gang took Rs 30 lakh from Prajapati but handed him papers dipped in black colour at a hotel in the city When Prajapati realized that he had been duped, he approached the crime branch that began investigations in the case. The cops arrested all the four within a few days and they suspect that the gang must have duped many more people. “Our team has left for Amreli to get more details about the accused. We will also visit Mumbai to get more details about Shahid who has a luxurious car in his name,” crime branch officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/kingpin-took-to-crime-to-repay-bank-loans/articleshow/87515779.cms||---

The research may also be used for the analysis of the radiation doses in medical treatment, industries, space and research quickly. Sonkawade was working as a senior scientist with Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi (formerly Nuclear Science Centre), where he did this laborious research 10 years ago. He filed for the patent through the institute he was working with at that time. His research is titled ‘Microwave Induced Etching of LR 15 Type 2, Solid State Nuclear Detector.’ While speaking to TOI, Sonkawade said, “The research involved finding out the radiation amount at the fastest possible speed. The tracks are seen on the film after the nuclear radiation gets exposed to these detectors. Sometimes, the tracks are not properly visible in the scan and thereby, the amount of the nuclear radiation dose is either underestimated or overestimated, which is very dangerous in the medical field, industries or research activities.” “This technique is very accurate and gives results within a few seconds to minutes. It is risky for the patients if the radiation turns out higher or lower than the expected amount. It may cause serious complications in the patients and, therefore, the research to find out exact dosage of radiation was needed,” he added. Sonkawade added that the research has far-reaching consequences and benefits which perhaps made the patent office take long to give approval. “We used a simple domestic microwave for the research. During the research, many parameters were optimized such as proper wattage of the microwaves, its time and chemical etchant’s normality. The technique can now be shared with the industries that are working in the development of nuclear radiation detectors. Many hurdles were faced during the research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/suk-prof-gets-patent-for-work-on-nuclear-radiation-measurement/articleshow/87514748.cms||Abhijeet Patil

He heard a plea by Sanville D’souza, alias Sam D’souza, who had also urged for three days’ notice before any coercive step is taken against him. D’souza moved court apprehending arrest by the special investigation team set up by the state government to look into the payoff allegations. There was an allegation made by a witness, Prabhakar Sail, that a deal of Rs 18 crore was made for the release of Aryan Khan. Sail had specifically named D’souza as a beneficiary. D’souza’s advocate argued that he is not arraigned as an accused and there is no FIR against him. “During the course of the whole thing, allegations made by some persons against Sameer Wankhede stating that to grant relief, he had taken money,” he said. But Justice Tavade interrupted him, saying he won’t hear the petition. “I’m not going to entertain this. You have a forum. Don’t waste my time,” he added. The petition said D’souza is a consultant in a stone quarry business. On October 1, he was contacted by an associate Sunil Patil, who had information about drug use on Cordelia and the involvement of celebrities. Patil told Sam that Kiran Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali would contact him. Patil took NCB officials’ contact numbers from D’souza. On October 2, Patil said that a very influential person was arrested for drugs and asked D’souza to verify. Gosavi told him that Aryan was arrested and he wanted to speak to his father’s manager Pooja Dadlani. D’souza’s petition said he contacted Dadlani through a mutual friend, a hotelier, and met her at Lower Parel. Dadlani allegedly told him she “is the decision-taker.” D’souza introduced Gosavi to Dadlani. Gosavi showed her a list in which Aryan’s name was not present and informed her that Khan had no drugs on him and he could help Aryan “get out of the situation.” Thereafter, Dadlani and Gosavi spoke in private, he said. On October 3, D’souza said he was “shocked” to learn an FIR has been registered against Khan. After that, he learnt from Patil that Gosavi had taken Rs 50 lakh from Dadlani through Sail, who is also Gosavi’s bodyguard. D’souza said he realized Gosavi was a fraud and that his “only motive was to recover the money than be known for fraud.” Therefore he contacted Patil and Gosavi, recovered the money and returned it to Dadlani through her husband. D’souza’s petition said he is innocent and has nothing to do with the alleged offence and he is falsely implicated by Sail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-rejects-dsouzas-plea-for-pre-arrest-bail-in-payoff-case/articleshow/87516752.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Every festival, food safety officers of the civic body swoop down on eateries and create an impression that there is massive activity against those selling food not fit for consumtion. The reality, however, is that the number and scale of food business operators is far larger than what a team of eight food safety officers can handle. Even the number of samples collected by these officers through the year are grossly insufficient to ensure quality food throughout the year. The eight officers collected only 491 samples till this month in the year. In 2020, 210 samples were collected and, in 2019, the figure stood at 281. These details emerged when leader of opposition Congress party in the VMC Ami Ravat visited the food safety department and sought data. According to Ravat, the test results of whatever few samples are collected also arrive in around two weeks. “By the time the results come, the stock of the failed sample is sold and consumed by consumers,” said Ravat. She also stated in a letter to the VMC top brass that a large number of cases were undecided in the courts. Designated officer for food safety and additional health officer Dr Mukesh Vaidya said that the civic body had begun the recruitment process for 12 food safety officers. “The strength will be increased to 20 from eight. Applications have already been scrutinised and a test will be taken soon,” he said. Vaidya said that the Food Safety and Standards Act of India (FSSAI) itself provided 14 days to test a sample. He added that he would not comment on the pendency of cases as it was a judicial matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/you-may-have-gorged-on-unhygienic-sweets-already/articleshow/87515803.cms||---

A senior IPS officer told TOI that in view of the communication from the commission, the probe will be entrusted to joint commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre Patil. “Nangre Patil is expected to record the statement of Wankhede and submit a report to the commission through the Mumbai Police Commission,” the IPS officer said. Malik had raised doubts over the caste of Wankhede, alleging that Wankhede belonged to the Muslim community but had forged documents to secure an SC certificate and got a prestigious job in the government. “Wankhede is a Muslim, we have documents to prove it,” Malik claimed. Further, Malik said a section of social activists would soon move the state’s social justice department for verification of Wankhede’s caste papers. As per rules, if a complaint is lodged, the district-level caste scrutiny committee is expected to verify the complaint as well as documents from both sides and give a verdict on validity of the certificate. “We will establish it, and Wankhede will lose his job,” Malik had claimed. Wankhede has said there is no substance in Malik’s allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-natl-sc-panel-asks-city-cp-to-probe-wankhedes-complaint/articleshow/87516767.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Valland began his journey on skates on Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary on October 31 from Karamsad, the ancestral town of Iron Man of India, and reached the Statue of Unity (SoU) the next day. Valland started preparing for the 145km skating challenge almost three months before. He used to train for as much as three hours every day. “From the beginning, I knew that this journey was not going to be easy. I built stamina and enhanced my capabilities to skate for longer hours during the last three months,” said Agstya, a student of PU’s Institute of Business Administration. He took the Karamsad-Anand-Vadodara-Kapurai-Dabhoi-Kevadiya route to reach SoU. The route from Karamsad to Kapurai was good for skating because of highway connectivity. But after Kapurai crossroads, the route was challenging as the road wasn’t ideal for skating, he said. “At times, I felt like giving up but I kept the purpose of my journey in mind,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pu-student-skates-145km-to-sou/articleshow/87515847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It’s often pointed out by potential IT investors that Kerala lacks the facilities that other IT hubs offer. They often point out the need for avenues for refreshments of that sort. Since the Covid restrictions have started to ebb away, the government would certainly go ahead with the plans, which we have already announced,” the chief minister told the House during the question hour. The state government had earlier sought recommendations from IT industry bodies regarding what the state needs to do for attracting more investment in IT. Industrial bodies were unanimous on the need to open pubs and wine parlours, which they said would enliven the comparatively sedate night life in Kerala cities. Though the demand was always on paper, successive governments were not taking a call on the same fearing criticism. Responding to another question, excise minister M V Govindan told the House that the government was actively considering production of wine like mild alcoholic drinks. The government, he said, was exploring options to produce comparatively less harmful liquor varieties by reviving industrial units like the now defunct Malabar distillery. However, a final decision on such matters would be taken only based on wider consultations, he added. The minister said the government has plans to start two more de-addiction centres in the state. He said several respected figures, including those in film fields were under the vicious spell of narcotics. “Narcotic consumption has become a fashion. A small section of officials in excise and other departments were found to have tacit understanding with the drug lobbies. Even high school students are drawn to substance abuse,” he said. The excise minister also noted that the ban on student politics has brought in more evils than benefits. “Substance abuse among students is on the higher side on campuses where student politics is banned,” he said. Though many substance abuse cases are reported, it only accounts to a fraction of the real deals. “It has been found that MDMA worth Rs 5.5 crore a kilogram is in use in the state,” he said, adding that the government was taking strict action in narcotic cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pubs-wine-parlours-to-lure-it-investors-on-the-anvil-cm/articleshow/87515872.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Posts opens doorstep courier service for international tourists||PANAJI: Goa Posts has started doorstep foreign parcel delivery service, which allows foreigners staying at hotels in Goa to avail of a courier pick-up service for international delivery of bulk orders. The paperwork is done at the hotel where the guests are staying with the help of telephonic guidance from the postal staff. This will save guests trouble of travelling to a post office and waiting in queues to book their parcels. “Tourists in Goa sometimes purchase a lot of things and then do not know what to do with them. That is where we come with a solution,” said senior superintendent of posts, Sudhir Jakhere. “We are targeting foreign customers directly by tying up with hotels for parcel service. Now people will not have to come down to the post office for international parcels. Instead we will provide doorstep facility throughout Goa,” Jakhere added. Besides saving the customer the trouble of arranging transport and carrying their bulk order all the way to the post office, the doorstep pick-up service eliminates the need to wait in queues to fill forms and pay postage. Banners informing of the foreign parcel service have been put up at various hotels across Goa with a helpline number listed on it. Anyone who wants to send an international parcel can simply call the number and the postal staff will help them in calculating the postage, filling out the custom clearance form and guide them to the nearest post office. “For bulk orders, we will also arrange pick-up and parcel-packing facility,” Jakhere said. Alternatively, the hotel owner or manager can also call Goa Posts for the service and the postman attached to the jurisdiction will provide the pick-up facility. The initiative kickstarted from October 16 onwards, and so far, there are nearly 150 hotels in the state that have been roped in by Goa Posts for this service. “Any other hotels that are interested to be included in our network are welcome,” Jakhere said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-posts-opens-doorstep-courier-service-for-intl-tourists/articleshow/87517476.cms||Nida Sayed

It was not clear whether the tweet was about his two targets so far, NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede or leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, or referred to a new development. शुभ दीपावली आप सभी की दिवाली मंगलमय हो होटल 'The Lalit' मे छुपे है कई राज़...मिलते है रविवार को— Nawab Malik نواب ملک नवाब मलिक (@nawabmalikncp) 1635920210000After NCB’s raid on a cruise ship on October 2 and the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, Malik targeted Wankhede, alleging raids conducted by Wankhede were fake, a charge denied by the NCB official. Malik said the NCB’s main witness was a man with criminal cases against him, who was absconding, and another witness was a BJP activist. Subsequently, Malik targeted ex-CM Fadnavis for his alleged links with drug peddlers. Fadnavis rubbished the allegations and retaliated, saying he had evidence to prove Malik has links with the underworld.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-reveal-hotel-secrets-after-diwali-says-malik/articleshow/87516803.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai is first city to fully vaccinate over 60% adults||MUMBAI: The city has fully vaccinated over 60% of its adult population against Covid, becoming the first among major cities of the country to reach the landmark. A total of 1.5 crore doses have been administered to fully immunise 56.4 lakh (60.6%) people. The city has an eligible population of 92.3 lakh, of whom 91.5 lakh (99%) have received at least one dose. Delhi, which has administered the maximum doses of over 2 crore, has given both shots to nearly 50% of its citizens. Among other cities, Chennai has given both doses to over 48% people while Bengaluru has fully vaccinated 57% of its population. BMC chief I S Chahal said the city could race ahead of other metros in complete vaccination owing to rapid scaling up of vaccination centres and participation of private hospitals. Of the total doses administered in Mumbai, almost 40% has been in the private sector. Within age categories, 68% people above 45 have got both doses, while in the 18-44 bracket, nearly 49% are fully inoculated. The road to fully vaccinating the city is still a long one and achieving that would mean covering another 36 lakh people. Chahal told TOI that the time has come for the government to consider reducing the 84-day interval between Covishield doses. Mumbai has around 35 lakh people who have taken the first dose and are waiting to be eligible for the second. “If the gap is shortened, overnight we will have 22 lakh people who will qualify for the second dose. Due to the gap, people who have got vaccinated with the first dose in September and October would have to wait till next year to be fully immunised,” he said. The commissioner has urged CM Uddhav Thackeray to discuss shortening of the 84-day interval with the Centre. What does 60% coverage mean for the city? Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said overall it’s a good position but it shouldn’t make people complacent. “On the positive side, we have 99% single dose coverage, our sero surveys have shown high prevalence and people have been exposed to the virus as well,” said Joshi. But the city is an international hub, has a significant presence of migrants, and above everything is densely populated, he reminded. “Besides, countries like Israel continue to see infections despite high vaccination rates. Hence, masking and other protocols cannot be compromised,” he said. After Mumbai, Pune has covered the second highest, 51% citizens, with both doses, followed by Sindhudurg and Bhandara at 47% each. Overall, Maharashtra has covered 34% of its 9.1 crore eligible population with both doses and 74% with at least one. Although Mumbai has reached the landmark, a general slowdown of vaccination across districts is pulling down both first and second dose coverage. The state government said on Tuesday almost 74 lakh people have not taken their second doses despite completing the interval. Pune has the highest number of people due (8 lakh), followed by Mumbai (5.5 lakh) and Nagpur (5 lakh). Chahal said the slowdown is inevitable in Mumbai as 99% have taken their first dose. And in the remaining population, many don’t qualify to receive their second dose yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-is-first-city-to-fully-vaccinate-over-60-adults/articleshow/87516831.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Tax data updation task may not be completed on time||Thiruvananthapuram: Property tax data updation process, which Mayor Arya Rajendran had declared would be completed within 30 days, has turned out to be a much harder task than anticipated by the ruling council. Till the end of October, hardly 40% of total verified tax receipts between 2016-17 and 2020-21 could be updated on the system. Two fiscals; 2020-21 and 2019-20, had the highest number of verified receipts -; 83,023 and 87,441 respectively of which updation could be done for less than half receipts for respective fiscals. Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, around 2.87 lakh verified receipts had to be posted of which only 1.11 lakh could be updated by the end of October. Thiruvallom zonal office has so far achieved the highest progress in updation of data. A slew of factors ranging from basic flaws in data to dearth of staff and unaddressed issues in software have affected the data updation of property tax. Even if the corporation manages to achieve some respectable percentage of data updation between 2016-17 and 2020-21, data of the fiscals preceding this period remain an unsolvable issue. One of the issues being raised in the council was that some of the tax payers would be issued demand notices starting from 2013-14 although they had paid all dues till the previous fiscal. The cardinal issues regarding the original database, glitches in software have also slowed down the process. The report submitted to the urban affairs director by the city corporation regarding the issues in tax data highlight lack of proper database, delay in proper updation (posting) as two major issues which have led to data inaccuracy regarding tax payment. The addition of wards following delimitation, rearrangement of wards, tax revision which marked a shift from annual rental value to plinth area necessitated huge transfer of data, updation of information. It so turned out that in many cases, the updation and transfer was incomplete which led to a situation where people have to furnish previous tax receipts while paying for a specific fiscal or else their accounts will show arrears of previous financial years. With data cleansing and posting requiring enormous manpower and time, corporation officials often updated the data whenever people came for other certificates and were required to pay the tax, the report pointed out. Former officials who had reported this issue said that previous councils and state governments often failed to grasp the gravity of the matter and some intervention happened from the corporation and the state government only when it turned out to be a political controversy. Even during the tenure of the previous council, the corporation shot off communications to the LSGD citing flaws in IKM software and often the blame was put on corporation staff for not properly updating the data. The points raised regarding technical glitches were brushed aside. With less than three days to go before the 30 day timeline announced by the mayor to end, the revenue officials are staring at an improbable task. The officials admit that without accurate data and smooth software, nothing can be done to ensure a clean database of property tax in the city corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tax-data-updation-task-may-not-be-completed-on-time/articleshow/87494937.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to the complainant Manji Boricha, accused Revtubha Jadeja came to their house on October 31 night when they were sleeping and started questioning him why the carcass was dumped near his farm. When Boricha denied the allegations, Jadeja started to abuse him and hurled casteist slurs and also threatened Boricha and his wife Raamu of dire consequences if they dare to throw another carcass again near his farm. The next day, the couple told their neighbours about Jadeja’s threats and tried to settle the issue amicably. However, when a settlement could not be reached, they decided to lodge a complaint with the Jamkandorna police station. Cops registered offences of criminal intimidation and under sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as the couple was Dalit. Police said that Jadeja had come to Boricha’s home at the time when a constable posted at their home had gone for dinner. The Dalit couple had been provided police security after a Dalit woman was murdered around one-and-half years ago leading to tension in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/couple-abused-for-dumping-carcass/articleshow/87514915.cms||---

Marigold flowers were sold at Rs 100 a crate (4 kg a crate) on Wednesday, against Rs 200 per crate on the same festive day last year. There has been good demand for marigold flowers during Diwali festival between Dhanteras to Laxmipujan. People use the flowers to perform puja, decorate homes, shops and vehicles. With the fall in prices, people who usually purchase one crate even picked up two or three crates. Farmers said they have fetched very low rates in comparison to the festive season last year due to huge supply of flowers. Farmers are hopeful that the marigold flower prices may increase on Laxmipujan on Thursday. “We received very low rates this year as compared to the same festive days last year. There had been a huge drop in prices due to a rise in supply as compared to demand,” said Dattatray Dongare, a farmer from Niphad. “Even during Dasara, around a fortnight back, we had fetched the price of Rs 300 per crate for marigold. I had sold over 200 crates on Dasara, but the marigold prices have crashed in the price range between Rs 75 and Rs 100 per crate,” said Dongare. “Although the flower prices have declined at large, we are expecting good rates on Laxmipujan and Diwali Padwa,” said another farmer Ashwin Malode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-markets-bloom-with-marigolds-prices-dip-50/articleshow/87514816.cms||Tushar Pawar

But what he did not bargain for was traffic policemen on duty halting him for the faulty number plate. Cops stopped the man at the Gotiram Bhaiyya Chowk on Shivaji Road around 6 pm on Tuesday. After he evaded them, they probed his record and unearthed the offence he had committed. The Khadak police have since booked him for an offence under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), after a complaint by constable Dheeraj Shelar. Senior police inspector (SPI) Shrihari Bahirat of the Khadak police said, “When the traffic policemen saw the partially obscured number plate, they tried to flag him down, but he accelerated and drove off. They chased him for around 25 metres on foot, at which point he stopped and ran away on foot.” He added, “The policemen found that the rider had breached several traffic rules since 2017, with four traffic violations and unpaid fines. A few months ago, he was warned for tampering with the number plate and asked to rectify it. We have impounded the vehicle and are searching for the rider.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scooterist-changes-number-plate-booked/articleshow/87515876.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Government & oppn spat in House over housing schemes||Thiruvananthapuram: The ruling front and the opposition had serious differences of opinion over the number of houses sanctioned and constructed under various housing schemes, including Life Mission, during the previous tenures of UDF and LDF governments, in the assembly on Wednesday. Raising the matter seeking leave for adjournment motion, MLA P K Basheer said the government that claimed it would ensure houses for all deserving under Life Mission in the last five years, has failed in its promise and 9,20,261 fresh applications are pending for last one-and-half years without publishing even the final list of beneficiaries. Local self government and excise minister MV Govindan said that the government completed 2,62,409 houses in the last five years, and after returning to power, it completed 13,600 houses under Life mission. The work on 87,000 houses is progressing and will be completed by the end of the financial year, and the government will complete one lakh houses every year in the coming four years, said the minister. He added that the final list of beneficiaries from the nine lakh-plus applications will be published by February next year. The minister compared the government’s achievement with the number of houses completed during the previous UDF government’s tenure, stating that the assembly records show that the UDF government could complete only 3,724 houses. Opposition leader VD Satheesan objected to the minister’s claims, and said that the minister is misleading the assembly and a reply by the LDF government itself in assembly last year said that 4,34,000 houses were constructed during 2011-12 till 2015-16 in the state under multiple schemes. He said that if the opposition cannot rely on the numbers given as an answer by the government itself, which document can they rely upon. He said that the present government has actually gone back on the concept of decentralization by bringing all housing schemes under one mission, thereby curtailing the financial independence of local bodies. “You are talking about decentralization and then usurping the powers of local self-government bodies. The local bodies have to mandatorily earmark 20% of their annual budget for housing under Life Mission, which means their financial independence has been curtailed. Also, they have no role in finalizing beneficiaries,” he said. Satheesan said that the 17-month delay in processing applications for houses under Life Mission would mean that housing schemes in the state had been stalled for a long period. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan intervened at this juncture and stated that the housing schemes as a whole have not been stalled, but the delay is only in processing the fresh applications. The opposition members later staged a walkout after speaker MB Rajesh refused to admit adjournment motion on the basis of the minister’s explanation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/government-oppn-spat-in-house-over-housing-schemes/articleshow/87515912.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Amid the festive season, vehicle movement is at its peak and security of passengers is being compromised due to such anti-social activities. A couple of travellers had complained that wind-shields of their vehicles got damaged when they were crossing the Kheda stretch of expressway on October 29. A complaint was registered at Chaklasi police station by the Kheda police in this regard. On Tuesday night too, in a replay of sorts, another couple of travellers got terrified when unidentified miscreants pelted stones leaving wind-shields of their vehicles damaged at around 8.10 pm. Anand police has, however, ruled out any attempt of robbery. “It seems to be an act of mischief by some unidentified miscreants,” Anand district superintendent of police Ajit Rajian told TOI, adding that a complaint has been registered by Anand rural police under section 308 of the Indian Penal Code. Going by the complaint registered by the security in-charge, around four cars and three trucks faced stone pelting near railway over bridge 18 near Samarkha crossroads on the expressway. The complaint has been registered against three unidentified miscreants. “We have formed teams to identify the culprits while patrolling has also been intensified to ensure that no untoward incident takes place,” said Vijay Purohit, police sub-inspector of Anand rural police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/stone-pelting-leaves-e-way-travellers-terrified/articleshow/87515894.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI that the civic body will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) through an agency which will be deployed after Diwali. “The tender process to appoint an agency for the purpose will start immediately after the festival,” he said. NMC has plans to develop shopping complexes and malls at 10 locations in the city. Public amenities like schools, hospitals and divisional offices are also to be developed within the complexes. The civic body will not need to spend on these proposed shopping complexes and malls at it owns the space. The prekects are to be developed in the public-private partnership (PPP) model. Around 40% of the constructed areas will be given to the NMC. These areas will either be leased out or used for schools, hospitals and other purposes. The developers will use the remaining 60% of the constructed areas and will hand the same over to the civic body after 30 years. NMC has vacant plots and old properties in the city. In the first phase, it has planned shopping complexes and malls on 10 locations and similar projects are to be planned in the second phase. NMC officials said ownership of the land will be with the civic body. The revenue of the civic body via property, water and other taxes from the town planning department have been badly affected due to Covid pandemic over the past one-and-a-half years, said the officials. Therefore, the NMC is planning to develop its properties through PPP model which will help it get additional revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-start-work-on-mall-projects-soon-after-diwali/articleshow/87514831.cms||Tushar Pawar

A group of volunteers, including members of various political parties, residence association, environmental organisations and activists, sports clubs, art clubs, freshwater fish farmers, Kudumbashree members and residents of the panchayat had started the cleaning work on October 31. They are cleaning the area of the lake which comes under the Venganoor grama panchayath. The lake is now filled with water hyacinth, lotus, giant salvinia and plastic waste. According to the convenience of the volunteers, the cleaning will start at 6:00 am every day and stop by 10:00 am. So, they can also go for daily jobs. On the first day of the cleaning process, more than 100 people participated in the initiative. Even the people who came for morning walks also joined them to clean the lake. Two years ago there was an unsuccessful attempt to clean the lake. “The district panchayat and the government should understand the importance of cleaning the lake and provide necessary equipment for the cleaning process. It will be too difficult to continue the work if there is only manpower. Our aim is to conserve the Vellayani lake and also to promote tourism,” said R S Sreekumar, the panchayat president. The panchayat is also planning to encourage tourism programmes around the Vellayani lake by renovating the park and by introducing boating, an open gym, a stall for organic fruits and vegetables, a shop for Kudumbashree products and swimming classes for children. They are also planning for a weekend talent show by ‘Kayalile kalakaranmar’, a group of talented individuals from the panchayat. “The government should take necessary actions to preserve our lakes, rivers and ponds. The public should understand that it is their responsibility to preserve our natural resources,” said Sreeraj S R, a volunteer who is working as a teacher at the Viswabharathi higher secondary school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/public-campaign-to-revive-vellayani-lake/articleshow/87494952.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops find CCTV clip of Shah Rukh Khan's manager’s Mercedes at Lower Parel; may book Kiran Gosavi||MUMBAI: The special investigation team (SIT) probing allegations of extortion in the cruise drug bust case has found CCTV footage of Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani’s blue Mercedes at Lower Parel where money is suspected to have exchanged hands to prevent the arrest of the actor’s son Aryan. The SIT is also likely to register a case of impersonation and extortion against Kiran Gosavi, a witness in the cruise drug seizure case, who is believed to have promised Dadlani help. If registered, it will be the third case against Gosavi—he has been booked by Pune and Amboli police previously. Gosavi, a self styled detective, was arrested by Pune police last month and is in their custody till November 5. The extortion demand came out in an affidavit filed by another witness in the cruise drug bust case, Prabhakar Sail, who is bodyguard to Gosavi. Sail had mentioned that Gosavi, Dadlani and Sam D’Souza, who claimed to be a businessman, met early October 3 at Lower Parel, hours after Aryan was picked up during the NCB raid on the cruise ship. Sail then dropped Gosavi to his Vashi residence. Gosavi later asked Sail to pick up money from outside a hotel in Tardeo. A person arrived in a car and gave Sail two bags, which he took to D’Souza at Trident Hotel. D’Souza counted the money and said it was only Rs 38 lakh, the affidavit stated. Sail claimed to have overheard a co-nversation where Gosavi and others discussed demanding Rs 25 crore, of which Rs 8 crore was to be paid to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. D’Souza, in a television interview on Tuesday, claimed that Rs 50 lakh was collected from Dadlani, but was later returned after he realised that Gosavi was a cheat. Sources said that after scanning footage from 10-15 CCTV cameras in the vicinity, they found a blue Mercedes and two Innova SUVs —one belonging to Gosavi and the other owned by D’Souza—at Lower Parel near Big Bazaar. The images show a woman getting off the blue Mercedes, chatting with Gosavi and then both returning to her car. After a while, everyone left in their own vehicles. “The CCTV footage only establishes a meeting between Gosavi, Dadlani, D’Souza and Sail at the spot. What happened between them we don’t know. We are calling D’Souza, but he has not turned up yet,” said a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity. Another officer said that they are in the process of registering an FIR against Gosavi for impersonation as his SUV has ‘Police’ written on it. It will also be examined if he claimed to be an NCB official, he added. The police are likely to record the statements of Dadlani and Aryan in this case. D’Souza, in his TV interview, said that Aryan told Gosavi to contact Dadlani and he is believed to have sent this voice note to her to reaffirm that he has access to the NCB office and was bargaining on behalf of an NCB official. D’Souza also said that Gosavi told him that he was under pressure from man whose number was saved as ‘SW’ [Sameer Wankhede] on his phone. But, through the Truecaller app, D’Souza found out that it was Sail’s number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-find-cctv-clip-of-srk-managers-merc-at-lower-parel-may-book-gosavi/articleshow/87516863.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nashik||Nashik civic body to conduct spot checks before felling trees||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to conduct spot verification of over 150 trees in the city, which are obstructions in road widening works. The spot verification is to be conducted by the tree authority committee members, NMC officials and local corporators. The NMC administration had tabled the proposal about felling 161 trees and transplantation of 28 trees at the meeting of the tree authority committee of the NMC for its approval. As many as 28 trees that have been proposed for transplantation belong to the species of peepal, banyan and cluster fig (Umbar) etc. These 28 trees are located on the left side of the road between Trimurti chowk and Mauli Lawns. NMC has plans to widen this road, but these trees have become an obstruction for road expansion works. NMC officials said it has been decided to conduct spot verification of trees before taking any decision on the issue. Moreover, the tree authority committee has also decided to slap fines to those resorting to illegal felling of trees. A fine of Rs 1 lakh will be slapped for illegal felling of trees and Rs 25,000 for illegal cutting branches of trees. NMC officials said if violators fail to pay the fine, then the fine amount will be included in the property tax bills of the person concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-conduct-spot-checks-before-felling-trees/articleshow/87514848.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Boy loses left eye after firecracker causes corneal tear in Andheri||MUMBAI: An 11-year-old boy lost his left eye after a firecracker injury caused a corneal tear. At JJ Hospital in Byculla, where Sai Bharankar is undergoing treatment, this is the second severe firecracker injury to be treated this week. A 10-year-old boy had suffered internal bleeding in the eye. Bharankar was watching friends light crackers at Dhangar Wadi’s Gilbert Hill Road in Andheri (W) late on Monday. The child also suffered severe injuries on his nose, for which he needed six stitches. Doctors from ophthalmology department of JJ Hospital said the boy came around 7.30pm on Monday with complaints of pain, bleeding and loss of vision in the left eye. On examination, they found there was a huge corneal tear and complete rupture of the globe. “The prognosis at this point is very bad. The explosion tore the cornea and distorted the globe. Chances of salvaging the eye are extremely poor,” said Dr Ragini Parekh, head of opthalmology, JJ. Doctors sutured the tear and are trying to prevent infection or damage to the other eye. Bharankar had stepped out of his house with friends after dinner to light crackers around 9pm. D N Nagar police have not yet registered a case as they are waiting for the boy to recover to record his statement. Bharankar’s mother Komal told police, “He was standing in a corner of the road and his friends were lighting crackers when a spark hit his eye. Some people took him to Cooper Hospital, from where he was taken to JJ,” she said. Dr T P Lahane, eye surgeon and former medical education director, said eye injuries usually see a surge during Diwali. “Children should not be allowed to light crackers without adult supervision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-boy-loses-left-eye-after-firecracker-causes-corneal-tear-in-andheri/articleshow/87516882.cms||---

The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has set up these industrial estates within the jurisdiction of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). Both streetlights and roads are maintained by the civic body, while MIDC supplies water to the industries in both the estates. According to Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA), almost 35% of streetlights are defunct in both the industrial areas. The Ambad MIDC is worst hit where around 50% of the streetlights are defunct, while 20% streetlights are not working in Satpur industrial estate. There are around 3,000 streetlights in both these industrial areas together. Nikhil Panchal, vice-president, AIMA, said that there was a concern that the industrial units could become targets of the anti-socials to pilfer equipment as all the estates will remain closed for a week during Diwali festival. Association members also pointed out that most internal roads in both the MIDC areas were in bad condition. The association has taken up these problems with the NMC, demanding that these issues be resolved at the earliest. Industrial activities have gained momentum after easing of Covid restrictions and movement of heavy vehicles to ferry raw materials and finished products from the units has increased. When contacted, NMC officials said that the issue was raised during a meeting with industrial associations last week. “We immediately started repair work after the meeting. A majority of the defunct streetlights have been repaired, while the remaining will be replaced with new ones shortly,” the officials said. NMC officials further said that the association’s demand of putting up new 50 electric poles in Ambad MIDC area is being met. Manish Rawal, who is the chairperson of the aviation committee of AIMA, said that NMC has repaired some defunct streetlights in Satpur MIDC areas, but around 20% of the streetlights are still defunct. Apart from this, the condition of some internal roads s bad. We want NMC to take up the road work at the earliest, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-industrial-estates-seek-working-streetlights-good-roads/articleshow/87514871.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||PSUs to ramp up cement production||Thiruvananthapuram: The government will scale up cement production in public sector undertakings as a measure to bring down the prices of construction materials in the state, industries and law minister P Rajeeve said in the assembly on Wednesday. Responding to a calling attention motion by Sunny Joseph MLA, the minister said the state is manufacturing only 10% of the cement required here and 90% of the cement market of the state is being controlled by private companies outside the state. “Malabar Cements, a PSU, is manufacturing and selling cements at a lower rate compared to other private players. The government has taken steps to increase production in Malabar Cements and intervene in price rise,” he said. An increase in the production of white cement, wall putty and grey cement have been included in the master plan for Travancore Cements, another PSU as well. The minister said the government will also set up ‘raw material banks’ under the micro-small and medium enterprises (MSME) clusters for curbing the price rise in raw materials. He said the shortage of building materials and the need to address the steep price increase of building materials have come to the notice of the government and that the main reason that aggravated the situation is the pandemic. The increase in the prices of raw materials has driven up the prices of materials used for construction, including cement, iron, PVC pipes, M-sand, P-sand, etc. The increase in the prices of petroleum products and coal shortage have also added to the problems. In addition, the transportation charges of cement from other states have also resulted in the price rise, the minister said. He said the government had convened a meeting of the stakeholders to address the price hike, asking them to reduce the prices to affordable levels. The government had given relaxations to the quarrying sector too to tide over the crisis, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/psus-to-ramp-up-cement-production/articleshow/87515950.cms||---
---||Agra||Times impact: Sans power since independence, UP village to light up for first time in 75 years||AGRA: The darkness of village Tulai Ka Nagla in UP's Etah will finally, after 75 years, dissolve into oblivion. The state government has now announced that it will be electrified within the next two months. The declaration came two days after TOI reported about Tulai Ka Nagla's umpteenth ''dark Diwali", with villagers complaining to this correspondent that their petition for power has been pending for over 60 years. UP power minister Shrikant Sharma said that the village has been included in the newly launched 'Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme' of the Centre and that action is being taken to light it up. Managing director of state government-owned discom Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (DVVNL) conducted a meeting with the district magistrate and electricity department officials to work out a plan to bring power supply to perhaps one of India's last dark patches. The Centre had claimed total electrification and last-mile delivery of electricity in every nook and corner of the country back in 2018. Electricity department officials said each house in the village will be lit within the next two months. The process of setting up electricity poles will begin after Diwali. Meanwhile, the local administration made arrangements to light up the village during Diwali so that residents do not have to celebrate a "black festival" ever again. DVVNL MD Amit Kishore said, “Work for electrification of Tulai ka Nagla has begun. The superintendent engineer of Etah has been asked to prepare a work plan. We will ensure that it is completed in a time-bound manner.” District magistrate of Etah, Ankit Kumar Agrawal, told TOI: “A team, led by the sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj and consisting of electricity department officials, was sent to the village to assess the on-ground situation. Electrification will be done on a priority basis. I have also ordered temporary arrangements for illumination so that villagers can celebrate the festival of lights.” Sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj, Manvendra Singh, said that a generator was brought in and lights installed on the main road of the village. He added that the generator can, for now, also be used by residents to illuminate their homes. This arrangement will remain in place for a week. He said that the state's non-conventional energy development agency has been asked to provide solar lights for the villagers. The village, with a population of about 300, has over 30 houses without an electric bulb. Residents have to travel a distance of 2 km to Raja Ka Rampur just to do basic tasks such as charging mobile phones. Students are unable to attend online classes and use candles to study in the evening, and women, every single day, prepare dinner before the sun sets. Thanking TOI for highlighting the decades-old plight of the village, Rajaram, a resident who claims to be 100 years old, said, “Since the past several decades, we have been trying to reach out to public representatives and local authorities. Years passed and governments changed, but we remained in darkness. Today (Wednesday), senior officials came to the village for the first time and assured us that each home will be electrified. We have no words to express our happiness. It will be a very happy Diwali for us this time.” Resident Ranjana Shakya said, “We have got our biggest Diwali gift in 60 years, maybe more. Village roads are being illuminated for the first time. The SDM has informed us that we will be getting electricity within the next two months. This will help students. After sunset, we will not have to survive on candles, diyas, and torches. We have made plans to celebrate big this year. Residents who had migrated out of the village because of the lack of power supply are also willing to return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/times-impact-sans-power-since-independence-up-village-to-light-up-for-1st-time-in-75-yrs/articleshow/87514073.cms||Deepak Lavania

The party brass would be visiting UP several times in the coming two months ahead of elections slated to be held in March 2022. The maximum visits as of now are of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November and December. He would be in the state at least 8 to 9 times before elections.

After November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the state on November 25. Before this, the Prime Minister would be in the state for three-day annual All India DGPs and IGPs meet slated to be held at Signature Building DGP Headquarters, Lucknow. A senior official said foundation laying and inauguration of projects have been lined up till December 25. Home minister Amit Shah is also expected to visit the state thrice in the month of November.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt relaxes Covid restrictions; hotels, wedding and cinema halls to operate at full capacity||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday made further relaxations in the ‘Covid restrictions’ which were in place in the state since October 19. According to the order issued by chief secretary SS Sandhu, the cap on wedding attendees has been removed and marriage halls will now be allowed to operate at 100% capacity. Similarly, coaching centres, cinema halls, gyms, swimming pools and sports stadiums, earlier allowed to operate with only 50% occupancy, have been fully opened. Besides, all social, political and religious gatherings, including large congregations, will be able to take place at full capacity. The SOP also mentions that home delivery of food items by restaurants should be encouraged. Norms of masks and social distancing will continue, added the order, which will remain in place till November 20. The decision to relax Covid curbs comes in the wake of the hill state recording a significant dip in new infections. On Wednesday, as per information provided by the Covid Control Room, seven positive cases were recorded in the state while the total number of active cases stood at 149. Meanwhile, traders have welcomed the relaxations with cautious optimism. “Although this Diwali has seen better market sentiment, people resorted to cautious spending and purchased limited stuff. While silver recorded good sale, there were lesser takers for gold ornaments. Most people’s Diwali shopping was already done when the announcement of easing of restrictions was done, so we will be able to gauge the impact of this new circular only after a few weeks,” said Pankaj Masson, president of traders’ body, Doon Valley Mahanagar Udyog Vyapar Mandal. He added that the decision to lift the cap on wedding attendees will certainly benefit the owner of wedding venues. Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer, Dehradun, urged people to not let down their guard. “Despite easing of restrictions, we urge people to remain cautious. They should wear masks in public, sanitise hands frequently and avoid crowded places. Those who have not taken the second dose yet must get it as soon as possible. The pandemic isn't over and hence, people need to practice restraint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-relaxes-covid-restrictions-hotels-wedding-and-cinema-halls-to-operate-at-full-capacity/articleshow/87514878.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Diwali restores brightness; celebrations to follow Covid rules||MUMBAI: Thursday’s Lakshmi Puja ceremony, which crowns the festival of Diwali, acquires renewed significance since the reopening of the economy after the pandemic. Salaried employees, traders, big investors and small vendors alike will propitiate Lord Ganesh and Goddess Lakshmi, and give thanks for the blessing of health and wealth. The biggest festival of the Hindu calendar falls on the night of Kartik Amavasya. Drikpanchang.com stipulates the Lakshmi Puja mahurat for Mumbai from 6.42pm to 8.35pm. Temples and gurdwaras will organise Deepotsav after the sunset hour. Gurdwara Dhan Pothohar in Santacruz will organise its Diwali kirtan, ardas and community kitchen from 6.30pm to 8.30pm. Food packets will be distributed instead of sit-down langar. Diwali is doubly important to the Sikh sangat as it also marks Bandi Chhod Diwas when Guru Hargobind secured the release of 52 kings held captive in Gwalior fort. This year, the annual Chopda pujan for traders stands altered by pandemic guidelines. Mumbadevi temple manager Hemant Jadhav said, “Typically, businessmen buy new account books or chopda and bring them in the temple to touch Mataji’s feet. Then they take the books to their office or place of business for pujan. But this year due to Covid restrictions, we will not allow our pujari to touch these items. So they may bring the chopda but will have to seek blessings from afar.” Late night, the Bengali community will perform Kali Puja, albeit earlier than usual, given government restrictions. Bengal Club, Shivaji Park, whose event at the local Kali temple usually spans 9pm- 1.30am, has advanced the puja to 6.30pm. Pushpanjali is at 8.30pm and special puja at 9.30pm. General bhog will not take place, though food packets will be distributed to those who offer special puja. Media coordinator Prasoon Rakshit said their priests and puja volunteers are fully vaccinated. Bombay Durga Bari Samiti will live stream its puja on YouTube and Facebook from 9pm till the aarti is complete around 2am, said president Susmita Mitra. Mitali Poddar, chairperson of the social and cultural committee, said there was no idol this year but hoped for a return to normality in 2022. Navi Mumbai Bengali Association will celebrate at Kali Temple Sector 6, Vashi, said spokesman Ashim Dey. Friday will witness Annakoot Utsav where Chhappan Bhog or 56 varieties of food and sweetmeats are offered to the gods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-diwali-restores-brightness-celebrations-to-follow-covid-rules/articleshow/87516887.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Eatala Rajender won despite TRS local network||HYDERABAD: Politically and organisationally no party is as strong and dominating as TRS in Huzurabad. Yet all this did not matter when it mattered most: TRS’ Gellu Srinivas Yadav lost the bypoll as voters went with Eatala Rajender of BJP. Of the 103 gram panchayats in Huzurabad constituency, all sarpanches are from TRS. In the two major municipalities, Huzurabad and Jammikunta, except half a dozen other members in 60 wards, it is the pink party that rules the roost. The BJP merely has three to four ward members in the constituency. Apart from these local elected representatives, Mandal Praja Parishad presidents, MPTCs and ZPTCs are elected on TRS tickets. After Eatala’s exit from the party, TRS leadership ensured that there was no local exodus and that all sarpanches, MPTCs, ZPTCs, ward members and chairpersons continued in the party. Minister Gangula Kamalakar even held separate meetings with them and all these leaders actively participated in the campaign. “Though local leaders campaigned against Eatala, voters preferred him over Srinivas Yadav. In some places such as Huzurabad town, where Rajender was considered weak, he still secured majority votes. Contrary to this, Srinivas Yadav could not get a majority in his own village Himmatnagar,” SK Zakeer, a political analyst, said. TRS sources said the party would hold a review on what went wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-won-despite-trs-local-network/articleshow/87515962.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Fireworks at Congress meet post-drubbing in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: Congress has decided to constitute a committee to review the reasons for the humiliating defeat of party candidate Balmoor Venkat in Huzurabad. The committee will also look into the issue of all-time low vote share, former minister Konda Surekha being denied the ticket and local leaders not campaigning for Venkat. A decision to this effect was taken after sparks flew in the Telangana Congress political affairs committee (PAC) meeting on Wednesday. Almost all top leaders, including AICC secretary in-charge of Telangana Manickam Tagore, A Revanth Reddy, K Jana Reddy, N Uttam Kumar Reddy were present. Senior leaders tried to corner Revanth stating the party leadership not only delayed the announcement of candidate but finalised a non-local at the last moment. Senior leaders V Hanumanth Rao and Sangareddy MLA T Jagga Reddy said the party was not even in a position to protect its cadre and retain at least 20 per cent vote share. Congress got less than 1.5 per cent vote share in Huzurabad. Right from the issue of no serious effort being made to stop P Kaushik Reddy from going into the TRS to party leadership not taking the bypoll seriously and Revanth allegedly declaring party tickets for his candidates in some of the constituencies, among other issues, were discussed. Jana Reddy threw his weight behind Revanth stating it was wrong on his part to take up total responsibility for the loss in Huzurabad and that it should be a collective responsibility of the party. He grew impatient when others tried to intervene and then left the meeting mid-way. Even Jagga Reddy said he would stay away from party affairs if the party leadership thinks that his straight talk was causing damage to the party. A heated discussion between MLC T Jeevan Reddy and Revanth and CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka and former Union minister Renuka Choudhary took place in the meeting. Tagore made it clear that no leader will speak about party affairs in public. Hanumanth Rao was given the task of ensuring truce between Komatireddy brothers and Revanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fireworks-at-cong-meet-post-drubbing/articleshow/87515969.cms||Roushan Ali

Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and district vaccination coordinator, said once such beneficiaries are identified, they would be vaccinated immediately. The administration has set a deadline of December 2 to complete 100% vaccination of the beneficiaries with at least the first dose. Only in Malegaon, where the pace of vaccination is sluggish, the deadline to complete first does coverage is December 31. “We are emphasizing on the first dose so that the citizens will get at least the first layer of protection against Covid. Health teams have been mobilised to identify people who are yet to get their first vacine doses,” said Misal. He also underlined the fact that the percentage of people taking their second dose after the ‘mandatory’ period is over is also very low. The administration has now asked the authorities to prepare lists of these people. “While all efforts are being made to administer the first doses, we will use the machinery even for administering the second doses. We will use this momentum to increase the number of ‘fully’ vaccinated beneficiaries,” another senior official of the health department said. The official added that various measures for administering the first dose have already been started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/admin-to-prepare-list-of-people-yet-to-take-jabs/articleshow/87514887.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Excise seize 1,750 litres of spirit||Thiruvananthapuram: In a major catch, the excise officials at Neyyattinkara range have seized 1,750 litres of spirit from three men who are suspected to be key members of an illicit liquor smuggling and distribution gang. The catch was made following two back-to-back raids conducted during Monday night which went on till Tuesday morning. The officials identified the accused as Joy, 36, of Krishnapuram near Neyyattinkara, Praveen, 29, of Uchakkada and Subi, 28, of Vlangamuri. The catch was made by a team led by Neyyattinkara excise inspector S S Sachin. The team intercepted an auto rickshaw during a vehicle check at Perumbazhuthoor on Monday night and seized 175 litres of spirit from it. They also took Joy and Praveen, who were in the rickshaw, into custody. During the interrogation, Joy revealed that there was more spirit stored in his house. Following this, the excise team conducted a raid at his residence and seized 1,190 litres of spirit hidden in the house and 385 litres of spirit stored in a mini lorry parked around three km away from the house. The team also confiscated another mini lorry which, according to the accused, was used to smuggle spirit from Tamil Nadu. Joy also revealed that it was Subi who supplied them the contraband following which he too was held. The officials said Joy was a contractor who took up road laying works. The two mini lorries seized were used to transport construction materials. But for the past one year the gang was engaged in illicit business. They would smuggle spirit from Nagercoil and distribute it among sellers, who would mix it with water and sell it as arrack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/excise-seize-1750-litres-of-spirit/articleshow/87494982.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Diwali dhoom dispels mkt gloom||Lucknow: Are positive sales and a huge footfall in various markets this Dhanteras signs of the economy recovering? Traders say yes, but add that for full recovery, the trend needs to sustain for some time. Much will depend on how income of the people improves in post-Covid times so that they can spend more despite high inflation following pandemic-induced recession. The pandemic had left a trail of economic devastation in many sectors but sales in automobile, restaurant, jewellery and electronic sectors have provided a booster dose. Increased business also means improvement in the income of those employed in these sectors. The increase in income will improve their purchasing power. As people will spend more, the economy will be back on track, they said. “We are coming back to pre-pandemic times. Last Diwali, sales were very low, but now we are recovering positively,” said Girish Oberoi, general secretary, UP Hotel and Restaurant Association. Similarly, with sales of Rs 20 crore on Dhanteras, the jewellery market saw a major boom. However, jewellers are still eyeing and expecting more recovery. “Festivals and marriages have always been profitable for us. Customers too have started regaining trust. They want to visit stores and personally select designs. However, we are receiving more high-income customers than middle-class ones. We expect things to improve in the coming days,” said Adesh Jain, president of Lucknow Chowk Sarafa Association. In electronics, sales of Rs 33 crore were recorded on Dhanteras in comparison to Rs 26 crore last year. Nakhas traders association president Pawan Manocha said, “Although online shopping websites have snatched a number of customers, we had good business during Dhanteras. We are confident sales will cross the two-year low.” A good turnout by customers to purchase both two- and four-wheelers indicates revival of the automobile sector, said members of Lucknow Automobile Association. Spokesperson Utkarsh Agarwal said, “Though business improved this season in comparison to last, the demand for luxurious and expensive cars was low. Only seven high-end cars were purchased during Dhanteras, but we hope to improve by the new year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/diwali-dhoom-dispels-mkt-gloom/articleshow/87517530.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Need to keep eye on 2020 firecracker hotspots so that efforts don’t go up in smoke||NEW DELHI: Seelampur in Shahdara, Raghopur in west Delhi, Himmatpuri in northeast Delhi, Lado Sarai in southwest Delhi and Sarvodaya Enclave, Hauz Khas and Mehrauli in south Delhi were among the top 10 firecracker hotspots on Diwali 2020. Massive amounts of crackers were burst in these places last year despite the ban on fireworks, according to an analysis by Ambee, an environmental intelligence company that measures air quality at street level. Ambee said the average PM2.5 levels at these 10 locations on Diwali last year, November 14, measured 450-480 micrograms per cubic metre between 6pm and 12 midnight against the safe standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The data of Delhi Pollution Control Committee too indicated high pollution levels in some localities on Diwali last year due to bursting of crackers. DPCC data showed Vivek Vihar, a residential area in east Delhi, as one of the most polluted on Diwali night in 2020. The hourly PM2.5 concentration there was 1,970 micrograms per cubic metre at 1am. The PM2.5 was 1,853 micrograms per cubic metre at 1am Mundka in west Delhi and 1,798 micrograms per cubic metre in the bustling sub-city of Rohini in north Delhi. “The top 10 most polluted locations recorded around 30% higher PM2.5 concentration between 6pm and 12am than the city average of 280-320 micrograms per cubic metre,” said Madhusudhan Anand, co-founder and chief technology officer at Ambee. “These locations are not the usual polluted hotspots, but saw high PM2.5 concentrations on Diwali day last year.” Despite the ban on firecrackers this year too, these hotspots could again see fireworks and the administration must create awareness and run a digital campaign to ensure the enforcement of the cracker ban, said Anand. Gufran Beig, SAFAR’s founder-project director, said, “On November 15 last year, a day after Diwali, Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Mundka, Nehru Nagar and Delhi University were identified as pollution hotspots. They are vulnerable this year too, and the civic agencies should monitor them closely.” The Central Pollution Control Board said in its Diwali 2020 report that Pitampura saw a spurt in particulate matter and SO2, indicating firecracker pollution load.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/need-to-keep-eye-on-2020-hotspots-so-that-efforts-dont-go-up-in-smoke/articleshow/87516890.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Responding to a calling attention motion regarding the pending applications for land conversions in the state, the minister said that 100 years ago, as per the details of the settlement of land, there were 30 lakhs acre of paddy land in the state. In 1970, the extent was 20 lakh acre and when the area of paddy land was assessed 14 years ago, the extent had reduced to 5 lakh acre, he said. The minister said that to address environmental issues and the reduction in area of farming land, the government had to introduce the act against conversion of paddy land and wetland in 2008. As per provisions of the act, while the conversion of wetland has been completely banned, paddy land can be filled only for construction of houses and for public purposes. Families that have no land other than paddy land are allowed to fill paddy land up to 10 cents in panchayat areas and up to five cents in municipality areas to construct houses, subject to conditions. The minister said that all paddy lands that were in existence on the day on which the act came into force, are included in the data bank. However, there are provisions to exclude such paddy land from the data bank that was filled before the act came into existence and was still included in the data bank. The 27A amendment in the act was introduced to change the status of the land that was filled before the act came into force, but is still recorded in the revenue records as paddy land or wetland. As per this, no permission is required for constructing a house of area 120sq m in 10 cents and for constructing a commercial building of 40sq m in five cents of converted land. However, for other purposes, fees have to be remitted for conversion, he said. He added that disposal of applications for land conversion up to 50 cents are being done on the basis of the village officer’s reports and for land conversions above 50 cents on the basis of the village officer and the agriculture officer’s reports and also based on the satellite images of the land. Such stringent provisions have been included to ensure that land converted after 2008 are not regularised, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/land-conversion-govt-earns-rs-447-crore/articleshow/87515985.cms||---

School exams have finished and after the first day of Diwali — the Vasu Baras — on Monday and Dhanteras on Tuesday, people have now started travelling to their native places, hence the bus stands are now witnessing huge rush. “As my children have finished school exams, I am now going to Dhule with my family. My husband will catch the first bus on Thursday to be at home for festivities,” said Rajani Kulthe, a resident of Nashik Road, travelling to Dhule by the MSRTC bus. Asked why they preferred a bus instead of taking a train, Sanjay Jahagirdar, another traveller, said, “Train bookings are full. There is no way to travel to Aurangabad other than by bus. This is the additional bus in which I got the booking for today.” The MSRTC authorities said the demand for the buses has increased and hence additional buses are also being pressed into service. “The demand for buses to travel to various destinations including Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Aurangabad from Nashik is increasing as the days pass. This is because most people work here and go to their native place for festivities. The MSRTC, Nashik division, has added at least 60 buses from the various bus depots to the destinations and they are also being fully booked,” said KS Patil, the divisional transport officer. Another senior officer of MSRTC said the people were earlier reluctant to book tickets for the MSRTC because of the strike called by the employees of some depots. “But since 11 of 13 depots are now functioning, the bookings for the buses are also on the rise. The rush is increasing and we expect to see a good season,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rush-at-msrtc-bus-terminals-innashik-city/articleshow/87514895.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chinna, who represents the independents, said the fact that they were not swayed by money power and pressure to withdraw spoke volumes about their resolve. “We have seen attempts to use money power in the elections. Our independent candidates have withstood pressure and remained in fray despite attempts to woo them or pressurise them to withdraw. We have been successful in sticking it out. The fact that money power could not work in the elections was clear and we are happy about it,” Chinna said. The votes secured by any of the independents would not have made any difference in the outcome of the poll as the winner, Eatala Rajendar of the BJP, was way ahead of his nearest TRS rival Gellu Srinivas Yadav.  Independents, therefore, were not the cause for cutting into any vote share or vote-bank. “It is a moral victory for independents,” Chinna said. One of the independents had entered the fray in the last six elections held in Telangana. Siliveru Srikanth of Jammikunta, who was given chapati roller symbol, which is strikingly similar to TRS’ car, polled 1,913 votes. Another independent Kante Sayanna polled 1,942 votes. Joining the league of securing 1,000 plus votes was NOTA, a choice made by as many as 1,036 voters who decided against voting for any candidate. Another candidate Lingidi Venkateshwarlu polled 580 votes and Varumalla Vishwam secured 724 votes. The youngest of the contestants, 25-year-old Ravula Sunil got 187 votes. Apart from TRS, BJP and Congress, rest were independents or those representing registered parties. In all, there were 30 candidates in the fray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/independents-claim-moral-victory-in-bypoll/articleshow/87515979.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The 5.25ft tall idol weighing 130kg is the largest to be seized by air customs so far. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said the idol could be dated to the Vijayanagara-Nayaka period based on iconographic details. A press release said the idol has ‘puranic’ designs and the wear and tear on it indicate that it may have been in use for a long time. It was sent by an exporter from Chennai to Kancheepuram for being refurbished as per the requirements of a client. A metal Ganesha idol of this size is considered rare as such sculptures are mainly made of stone. “The holes on the foot of the idol make it ideal for temple ceremonies,” the statement said. A customs official said the idol was traced following inputs about attempts to smuggle antiques out of the country. “An idol consignment came for export at the airport and we had a doubt that it could be an antique piece, but it was not. We traced the sender to a house in Kancheepuram and found this idol.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/400-yr-old-rare-brass-ganesha-idol-seized-in-kancheepuram/articleshow/87516893.cms||---

The academic year 2021-22 for first year in UG engineering degree courses will start from December 6. Professors have advised students to check last year’s cut-off marks for each branch in the college they choose, tally it with the marks they have obtained in the current CET and then fill up their preference form. Computer Science and IT are once again expected to be the most sought-after branches. Sandeep Meshram, associate professor at the College of Engineering Pune, said, “The state CET cell publishes last year's cut-off marks of all colleges. It is important to check that, tally it with the CET score you have obtained and then apply. Generally even within a college, the cutoff scores for computer science will be high. So, it is very important to check the preferred branch's CET score and then apply.” Another professor at an engineering college said that students should also look at the placement data of the colleges they wish to apply to. “Many colleges give authentic information on their website. Then again, there are some who do not. So, it is always better to find someone studying in the college to gain a better understanding of how the facilities are in the institute. In the age of the internet, you can always post a question or read reviews of almost everything,” he said. Students can register their applications online and upload their documents from November 2 to November 18, 5pm while the document verification and confirmation of application form will be done till November 20. During scrutiny, if no error is found, the status and confirmation acknowledgement is made available in the students’ login id. If an error is found, they are intimated to candidates in his/her login. When an error is found, candidates are required to edit and re-submit the application for e-scrutiny through his/her login. Meanwhile, students who opt for physical scrutiny need to visit the facilitation centre selected by them online along with the required documents in the allotted time slot. After verification and confirmation of application form, the centre issues the acknowledgement. Meanwhile, NRIs and such candidates should send the print of online filled and submitted application form and copy of the uploaded documents by hand/speedpost/courier for verification & confirmation to the office of Director of Sardar Patel College of Engineering. The provisional merit list will be displayed on November 22 after which the students will be given two days from November 23 to raise any grievance about correction required in the data through his or her login. The application of such candidates will then be made available in his or her login for rectification. Candidates also need to upload the requisite documents to substantiate the claim for any correction. The status of acceptance or rejection of grievance raised by the candidate shall be available in their login. Those candidates who had selected physical scrutiny mode need to visit their facilitation centre for resolving the grievances.

---||Lucknow||Ayodhya to be largest tourism spot in world: Union minister||LUCKNOW: Union minister for culture and tourism GK Redddy said Lord Ram was revered not just in India but also in Buddhist and Islamic countries and the central and state governments were working to develop Ayodhya as the largest tourist destination in the world. “By 2030 not less than 5 crore people would be visiting the temple town annually,” he said. Speaking as the chief guest at the Deepotsav on Wednesday, the minister, who gave his address in Hindi, pointed out that while he hailed from Hyderabad, he made the effort to speak in the language as Hinduism and Hindi connected him with the rest of the people. Calling August 5, 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the temple, a historic day for the country, he thanked the Ram Temple Trust for making Ram Temple a ‘Rashtriya Temple’. “Crores of families have been linked with this project and this temple will belong to every person. Ayodhya will become a huge tourist spot with better roads and infrastructure and an international airport will connect it with the world,” he said. The minister said that the deepotsav celebrations were a proud testament of Indian traditions and showed the deep love and respect for Lord Ram. The 12 lakh diyas that have been lit in Ayodhya on Thursday symbolised an ‘akhand deep’ for not just India but provided light to the entire world. “Lord Ram is a hero for every person. After completing 14 years in exile, he returned to Ayodhya amid massive celebrations. I can say with confidence that the deepotsav organised by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is of the same scale as the deepotsav organised in Lord Ram’s welcome. With the lighting of 12 lakh diyas, the world is getting Lord Ram’s message,” he said. He said the CM was working on Lord Rama’s ideals to establish Ram Rajya in UP. He added that the government was ruling without any bias and people were free from any kind of fear. “It is because of his efforts and the vision of Modi ji that Ayodhya is being developed with a new vision and the construction of the Ram Temple has started here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-to-be-largest-tourism-spot-in-world/articleshow/87517539.cms||Neha Lalchandani

It will now begin on November 21, stretch over 50 days and conclude on January 10. The second phase would also be launched from a temple, which one was yet to be decided but most likely to be Jogulamba Gadwal shrine, party sources said. Sanjay had started the first phase from Bhaygalakshmi temple in Charminar. “People have taught the TRS a lesson. They wanted to win on lies and misusing power,” Sanjay stated on Wednesday. Apart from galvanising the cadre, the yatra would also be focussing on bringing in leaders from other parties, especially TRS, into the saffron fold. “Now that we have won the high-stakes poll, many Congress leaders are also looking at us,” a senior leader claimed. Sanjay also received a call from Union home minister Amit Shah following the Huzurabad victory and party sources said the national leadership would be looking to use the padayatra to strengthen BJP in regions where it was very weak. “The attitude is joyous now. We have a lot of work to do and it will show in the padayatra,” said a top leader closely associated with organising the padayatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-prepones-yatra-2nd-leg-to-build-on-win/articleshow/87516020.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Agra||TIMES IMPACT: Sans power since Independence, UP village to light up for 1st time in 75 yrs||Agra: The darkness of village Tulai Ka Nagla in UP's Etah will finally, after 75 years, dissolve into oblivion. The state government has now announced that it will be electrified within the next two months. The declaration came two days after TOI reported about Tulai Ka Nagla's umpteenth ''dark Diwali", with villagers complaining to this correspondent that their petition for power has been pending for over 60 years. UP power minister Shrikant Sharma said that the village has been included in the newly launched 'Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme' of the Centre and that action is being taken to light it up. Managing director of state government-owned discom Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (DVVNL) conducted a meeting with the district magistrate and electricity department officials to work out a plan to bring power supply to perhaps one of India's last dark patches. The Centre had claimed total electrification and last-mile delivery of electricity in every nook and corner of the country back in 2018. Electricity department officials said each house in the village will be lit within the next two months. The process of setting up electricity poles will begin after Diwali. Meanwhile, the local administration made arrangements to light up the village during Diwali so that residents do not have to celebrate a "black festival" ever again. DVVNL MD Amit Kishore said, “Work for electrification of Tulai ka Nagla has begun. The superintendent engineer of Etah has been asked to prepare a work plan. We will ensure that it is completed in a time-bound manner.” District magistrate of Etah, Ankit Kumar Agrawal, told TOI: “A team, led by the sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj and consisting of electricity department officials, was sent to the village to assess the on-ground situation. Electrification will be done on a priority basis. I have also ordered temporary arrangements for illumination so that villagers can celebrate the festival of lights.” Sub-divisional magistrate of Aliganj, Manvendra Singh, said that a generator was brought in and lights installed on the main road of the village. He added that the generator can, for now, also be used by residents to illuminate their homes. This arrangement will remain in place for a week. He said that the state's non-conventional energy development agency has been asked to provide solar lights for the villagers. The village, with a population of about 300, has over 30 houses without an electric bulb. Residents have to travel a distance of 2 km to Raja Ka Rampur just to do basic tasks such as charging mobile phones. Students are unable to attend online classes and use candles to study in the evening, and women, every single day, prepare dinner before the sun sets. Thanking TOI for highlighting the decades-old plight of the village, Rajaram, a resident who claims to be 100 years old, said, “Since the past several decades, we have been trying to reach out to public representatives and local authorities. Years passed and governments changed, but we remained in darkness. Today (Wednesday), senior officials came to the village for the first time and assured us that each home will be electrified. We have no words to express our happiness. It will be a very happy Diwali for us this time.” Resident Ranjana Shakya said, “We have got our biggest Diwali gift in 60 years, maybe more. Village roads are being illuminated for the first time. The SDM has informed us that we will be getting electricity within the next two months. This will help students. After sunset, we will not have to survive on candles, diyas, and torches. We have made plans to celebrate big this year. Residents who had migrated out of the village because of the lack of power supply are also willing to return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/times-impact-sans-power-since-independence-up-village-to-light-up-for-1st-time-in-75-yrs/articleshow/87514930.cms||Deepak Lavania

The minister conducted a meeting with the MSEDCL officials and asked them to reinstate the power supply to the villages till Diwali-end and give some time to the farmers to settle their dues. After the meeting, the minister said: “The MSEDCL disconnecting power supply to streetlights for non-payment of dues is an injustice to the farmers. I have directed the authorities to ensure that they reconnect the power connections at least till the end of the Diwali festival.” The minister also said that this is a time when the farmers need power for agricultural purposes. “The heavy rain and cyclone have battered the farmers. Those who survived this wrath need power for harvest and post-harvest activities. If the power supply is disconnected now, it could cause huge losses to the farmers and they would not be able to settle the dues,” Pawar said. The minister also raised the issue of the ‘average’ bills being delivered to the agricultural consumers. “When the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has already ordered the company to not deliver average bills, we wonder why the MSEDCL is continuing this practice? The company should, at once, provide metered bills to the agricultural consumer,” she added. MSEDCL superintendent engineer D H Padalkar stated the MSEDCL had received orders from the state government regarding the reconnection of power supply to streetlights across all the gram panchayats. “The power supply to streetlights had been cut at about 500-plus gram panchayats across Nashik district, but after the government orders, we reconnected them. If some are still waiting for reconnections, we will expedite the matter,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msedcl-told-to-restart-power-supply-to-villages/articleshow/87514914.cms||Abhilash Botekar

It has also suggested closure of the roads for heavy vehicles at the time of construction of the proposed flyover between 10pm and 6 am to ensure less traffic congestion. The work is a part of the third Metro line from Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to be executed by Tata-Siemens. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, who is also the chairman of Pumta, told TOI on Wednesday that agencies had been directed to work on the proposals and issue necessary orders to ensure smooth traffic movement. “They should do so in the next 8-10 days for the work to commence this month,” he said. A PMRDA official said the detailed plan had been approved for the traffic movement. “If the suggestions are implemented with the two routes and additional DP roads, citizens will not be inconvenienced. The plan has been cleared by Pumta and the police are expected to issue orders after Diwali. The PMRDA will help in overall coordination with all stakeholders,” the official said. “The construction is expected to start after Diwali and the work of the flyover will start after the necessary orders are issued,” added the official. The Pumta’s suggestion included two circular routes proposed by the PMRDA. The first is from Senapati Bapat Chowk (Ganeshkhind Road) to Dhotre Path, Vitthalrao Tukaram Bhosale Chowk, Senapati Bapat Road and Senapati Bapat Chowk (Ganeshkhind Road). The second is from University Chowk to Pashan Road, Abhimanshri Road, Baner Road and University road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pumta-okays-2-circular-routes-for-traffic-ease-during-flyover-work/articleshow/87516042.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The affidavit also refers to 101 irrelevant documents, including copies of previous petitions, that had been relied upon to suggest that the officials are engaged in mass scale wrongdoing and misappropriation of funds.“The petitioner has a chequered career in filing petitions in public interest. While the petitioner claims that pursuant to some previous petitions FIRs came to be lodged against the concerned government officials, there is at least one order passed on his previous petition where the court was constrained to impose costs on the petitioner for the reckless invocation of the jurisdiction,” observed the judges.The judges said that in the present case when this court sought to indicate the best in support of his allegations of corruption, the petitioner’s counsel referred to the purchase of some material at a cost of about Rs 4,400 per unit by some of the authorities, while the same was available on an e-commerce site at nearly half the price.The judges observed that the price at which any product is available online may not be a proper yardstick to assess whether there has been any wrongdoing in the acquisition of a similar product by a government body.“It is nobody’s case that the government officials are permitted to obtain products online, where the quality, quantity and the availability may not be ascertained beforehand. Though there is also an online portal for government entities to buy therefrom, which is supported by the Union government, not all state governments subscribe to such online purchase methods,” observed the judges.Taking into account that the allegations are vague and unsubstantiated with no material in support, the judges disposed it without imposing any cost on the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-cautions-regular-petitioner-to-exercise-restraint-while-filing-pleas/articleshow/87516901.cms||Kaushik Kannan

He requested people to practise utmost care. “Covid cases are low and people are flocking to the markets. But, there are many people who are not following norms and not wearing masks,” Kejriwal said at a press conference and urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The CM also asked people to check stagnant water in and around homes and pour it out to fight dengue. Kejriwal with his cabinet ministers will be celebrating ‘Dilli Ki Diwali’ at 7pm on Thursday. “When all the 2 crore people of Delhi together pray for the well-being and prosperity of our family then the atmosphere will be filled with positivity and peace. The programme will be telecast live on various TV channels and the internet. I invite everyone to join us from their homes in this initiative,” the CM said. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, meanwhile, said the Kejriwal government was working day and night to reduce pollution but some people were trying to weaken the campaign against pollution by linking firecrackers with religion for their political ambition. Rai appealed to all political parties to not play with the lives of Delhiites for political gains and said that “Diwali is celebrated with lamps, not with firecrackers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-forget-covid-hasnt-gone-yet-cm/articleshow/87516902.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya: Ramayana carnival rolls out with glimpses of ‘Treta Yug’, Lord’s life||AYODHYA: The ‘shobha yatra’ or grand procession of Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya rolled out from Saket Degree College premises and wound its way through the temple town to conclude at Ram Katha Park on Wednesday. Eleven tableaux in the carnival, flagged off by deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, portrayed the ‘Treta Yug’ or the life and time of Lord Ram. With artistes from different parts of the country and SAARC nations performing in the ‘shobha yatra’, it was a cultural potpourri on the streets with Ram being the binding theme. It took five hours for the procession to complete the 5km stretch from the college to Ram Katha Park. Mini trucks moulded into ‘Ram Raths’ had pictorial depictions of the Lord’s birth, his ‘swayamvar’ with Sita, his marriage and 14-year exile, his meeting with Shabri, Ravan’s abduction of Sita and the epic battle in Lanka to the Lord’s return from exile and his coronation in Ayodhya. All these aspects were translated into dance-and-drama extravaganza by cultural troupes. Devotees lining the streets showered petals and paid obeisance to the divine protagonists. The procession also provided glimpses from ‘Kamna Yagya’, the gurukul days of Ram and his brothers, Ahilya’s liberation from a curse and her salvation through Ram and torching of Lanka by Lord Hanuman. Folk artists walking with the tableaux captivated hearts with dance and music. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said, “The government has taken all steps to transform Ayodhya into a top religious destination. 'Ram Rajya' has returned to Ayodhya and those who questioned the existence of Ram are now queuing up to offer prayers to Ram Lalla.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ramayana-carnival-rolls-out-with-glimpses-of-treta-yug-lords-life/articleshow/87517579.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Kochi||SC quashes Kerala HC order discharging Roopesh||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has quashed the Kerala High Court order which discharged Roopesh, an accused arrested for his alleged Maoist links, for the purported offences including sedition and under the provisions of the anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in three cases. Dealing with the appeals filed by Kerala and others, the apex court said the high court’s September 2019 order was passed by a single judge which can be said to be “absolutely contrary” to the statutory provision under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act and the law laid down earlier by the top court. A bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna was told by senior advocate Maninder Singh, who was appearing for the state, that revision petitions filed by Roopesh in the high court against the order of a special court refusing to discharge him for these offences ought to have been heard by a division bench as mandated under sub-section (2) of Section 21 of the NIA Act. “In view of the above, all these appeals succeed and the common impugned judgment and order passed by the high court... discharging the accused is hereby quashed and set aside and the matters are remanded to the high court to decide the revision petition... afresh by the division bench in accordance with law and on merits,” the bench said in its October 29 order. The top court said the revision petitions be decided and disposed of by a division bench of the high court at the earliest and preferably, within six months from the date of receipt of its order. The high court had allowed the revision petitions filed by the accused, who was arrested in December 2015, and discharged him for the alleged offences under Sections 20 and 38 of the UAPA and under section 124-A (sedition) of the IPC. While Section 20 of the UAPA deals with punishment for being member of terrorist organisation, Section 38 of the anti-terror law pertains to offences relating to membership of a terror outfit. The apex court, in its order, made clear that it has not expressed anything on merits in favour of either parties. “It goes without saying that all the contentions/ defences, which may be available to the respective parties are kept open to be considered by the division bench of the high court…,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sc-quashes-hc-order-discharging-roopesh/articleshow/87516089.cms||---

The minor boy told the cops that his father Sursing (50) used to get drunk and create a ruckus. The boy also said that his father used to beat him and other family members. On November 1 too, Rathwa, instead of making purchases for Diwali, splurged the money on getting drunk. Later, his father passed out on a village road after he had one too many, the boy told the cops. When the boy and his maternal uncle, Shankar Kikeriya, got to know about Rathwa’s condition, they went to pick him up. But after finding out that he had spent all the money on liquor, the two got angry and decided to get rid of him. They bludgeoned Rathwa to death with a heavy stone. The duo left the blood-stained stone near the body, got back home and pretended to be normal. Later, locals saw his father lying in the pool of blood and informed his family members. He was even taken to a hospital in Gondal where doctors declared him dead before admission. Initially, police did not find any leads or any motive for the crime. But later they became suspicious about the boy and questioned him. During questioning, the boy broke down and spilled the beans. On Tuesday, the boy was detained and Kikeriya was arrested. Police said that Kikeriya is a native of Madhya Pradesh and Rathwa hailed from Dahod and they used to work as farm labourers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/minor-kills-father-for-drunken-fracas/articleshow/87514968.cms||---

The reports appearing in a section of the media about property attachment are incorrect and contradictory to facts,” Patil said in a statement. Patil however said, “The I-T department has sought clarification on certain issues. We will reply to that letter. We will take whatever legal and administrative action (is) required.” According to reports, the properties attached included an office of Pawar’s son Parth. The NCP has strongly criticized the I-T action, saying it is politically motivated and an attempt to destabilize the MVA government. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said no property was benami. “We have reasons to believe that the I-T action is an attempt to destabilize the democratically elected government. There is no merit in the decisions taken by the I-T department. Ajit Pawar will take recourse to legal action,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-properties-of-ajit-pawar-attached-says-his-counsel/articleshow/87516940.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops get cracking to put a stop to sale of banned fireworks||Kolkata: Hours after TOI reported how cracker sellers were displaying candles, diyas and sanitizer on the racks and selling banned crackers in the garb of flowers at Burrabazar, police officers made multiple raids at the market on Wednesday, checking beneath the items on display and posting personnel outside cracker shops. By 3.30pm, the cops had rounded up five women who had come all the way from Bongaon and seized tonnes of banned firecrackers. “We had kept our men on the lookout for uniformed cops. But they came in plainclothes, posing as customers,” wailed one of these women who started running, leaving behind the firecrackers in a desperate effort to flee the police. “We are taking all necessary measures possible to prevent sale of crackers in these areas. We are conducting surprise checks and have been regularly holding meetings with representatives of the market committees and the sellers,” said Rupesh Kumar, the deputy commissioner (central) of Kolkata Police, furnishing the huge seizures made in the past 48 hours. “The cops have become extremely active and all traders in our area have been told that action will be taken even against those who would support cracker sales this year. Hence, most shops that had been selling crackers till Tuesday in a clandestine manner didn’t try the same on Wednesday,” said a trader in the market. At Gariahat’s Mandeville Gardens, the cops went around putting up “No firecracker (only green ones allowed)” placards across high-rises. “Those buying illegal crackers are equally liable before the law,” announced an officer over the microphone. He then proceeded to show how to verify that the crackers bought by citizens are actually green. “Remember there is a Covid patient near you. Act responsibly,” he urged. At Ramani Chatterjee Street near Singhi Park, one of the biggest stockists in the city met the area cops. “I have not even tried renewing my licence this year. I have no clue where to procure green crackers,” he told cops who noted down his response. At Natunhat, which is the Kolkata Police border with Bengal police (under Sarsuna police station) and falls on the road to Nungi, it was a queer story. “We have set up the main naka on the main road. This is a 24-hour naka set up since Monday. But those in bikes were taking various bylanes to bypass the naka. We checked the temporary shops selling diyas after wondering why so many were operational all of a sudden. This police station alone has now seized 200kg illegal firecrackers,” said an officer from Behala division. In Bidhannagar commissionerate areas, illegal crackers were seized and five were arrested from Chhainabhi, New Town, Rajarhat and Narayanpur areas in the past 72 hours. Similar seizures were made in the Jadavpur division of Kolkata Police. Among the arrested is a chicken seller who had stocked over 50kg of firecrackers, including chocolate bombs and shells. “The man had been selling firecrackers under the garb of the chicken shop,” said an officer. All the arrested men were booked under Explosives Act and IPC sections dealing with disobedience to court order. Similar checks and awareness campaigns continued outside Sealdah and Ultadanga railway stations and at all the bordering areas of the city. A sizable amount of seizures were reported from the bordering areas of South 24 Parganas. “We have stepped up our vigil further in the run-up to Kali puja. Overnight raids and checks will also be conducted through Tuesday night to prevent transportation of banned crackers,” said SP (Baruipur) Vaibhab Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-get-cracking-to-put-a-stop-to-sale-of-banned-fireworks/articleshow/87516075.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||Farm fires down 51% in 2021; biodecomposers, other measures start showing impact, finds air commission||NEW DELHI: Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) has said that there has been a reduction of about 51.4% in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and eight NCR districts of UP this year compared with the corresponding period of 2020. Enforcement agencies have so far inspected 8,575 of the total reported sites in Punjab, Haryana and NCR districts of UP and fines of about Rs 58 lakh, as environmental compensation, have been imposed. During the current paddy harvesting season, CAQM has been actively monitoring paddy residue burning events from September 15, 2021 onwards in Punjab, Haryana and NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and Delhi. The commission said fire counts had come down from 43,918 in 2020 to 21,364 in 2021 during the period from September 15 to November 2. “Concerted efforts are being taken by the state governments, departments and various other stakeholders towards better in situ management of crop residue through the use of CRM machinery, PUSA bio-decomposers and facilitating various options for ex situ utilisation of paddy straw, besides large number of IEC activities, educational campaigns, awareness camps and publicity through print, electronic and social media,” said CAQM in a statement. According to CAQM, between October 27 and November 2, only 12,853 active cases were recorded as against 23,628 cases during the same period in 2020, thus exhibiting a reduction of 10,775 cases (about 45.6%). The major hotspots of paddy residue burning in the state of Punjab are Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Firozpur, Patiala, Ludhiana and Kapurthala. Similarly, the major hotspots in Haryana are Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Ambala and Jind. “Harvesting is on its peak and the state governments are taking necessary steps as per the plan of action,” said the panel. The commission conducted a meeting on Tuesday with special focus on effective implementation of the framework and action plan by states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fires-down-51-in-2021-biodecomposers-other-measures-start-showing-impact-finds-air-commission/articleshow/87516942.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: In majority of booths in Huzurabad, Congress vote tally was in single digits||HYDERABAD: The Congress failed to get double digit votes in a majority of polling booths in Huzurabad Assembly constituency. Of the 300-plus polling booths, the grand old party got single digit votes, i.e. less than 10 votes, in more than 50 per cent of the polling stations. The party’s humiliating defeat can be gauged from the fact that it scored a duck in four polling stations. Not a single vote was polled for the Congress in the polling booths located in Lasmakkapalli (polling booth no 107), Gundedu (249), Laxmipur (273) and Guniparthi (281). Lasmakkapalli is in Veenavanka, the home turf of TRS leader P Kaushik Reddy, who defected from Congress to TRS before the elections. Only two votes each were polled in Venkateswarapalli (polling booth 247) Marripally Gudem (252), Nagampet (151), Shayampet (154), Vilasagar (135), Dharmarajpalli (71). As per the polling booth-wise votes data released by the district election officials, the Congress did not cross the 50 votes mark in any of the 300-plus polling booths. These polling booths are located in all the five mandals of Huzurabad constituency. Political analysts said a majority of the Congress vote share, which was over 34 per cent in 2018 polls, shifted to Eatala Rajender and BJP in the by-poll to Huzurabad constituency. The reasons are many including that the contest was mainly between TRS and BJP, Congress delayed announcing its candidate, Balmoor Venkat was a non-local to Huzurabad segment, people realised Congress had no chance of winning, and Eatala had a huge sympathy wave. Congress campaign which started late, was hardly visible. Venkat’s appeal to students and unemployed to defeat TRS, BJP also failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-majority-of-booths-cong-vote-tally-was-in-single-digits/articleshow/87516080.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Engg admissions kick off in state, classes start on Dec 6||Pune: The online centralised admission process to the first year of undergraduate courses in engineering degree started on Tuesday in the state and will continue till mid-December, said a notification released by the state common entrance test cell (CET cell) on Tuesday. The academic year 2021-22 for first-year UG engineering degree courses will start from December 6. Professors have advised students to check last year’s cut-off for each branch in the college they choose, tally it with the marks they have obtained in the current CET and then fill their preference form. Computer science and IT are once again expected to be the most sought-after branches. Sandeep Meshram, associate professor at the College of Engineering Pune, said, “The state CET cell publishes last year's cut-off marks of all colleges. It is important to check that, tally it with the CET score you have obtained and then apply. Generally, even within a college, the cut-off scores for computer science will be high. So, it is very important to check the preferred branch's CET score and then apply.” Another professor at an engineering college said students should also look at the placement data of the colleges they wish to apply to. “Many colleges give authentic information on their website. Then again, there are some that do not. So, it is always better to find someone studying in the college to gain a better understanding of the facilities at the institute. In the age of the internet, you can always post a question or read reviews of almost everything,” he said. Students can register applications online and upload theeir documents from November 2 to 18, 5pm, while the document verification and confirmation of application forms will be done till November 20. During scrutiny, if no error is found, the status and confirmation acknowledgement is made available in the students’ login id. If an error is found, it is intimated to candidates in his or her login. When an error is found, candidates are required to edit and re-submit the application for e-scrutiny through own login. Students who opt for physical scrutiny need to visit the facilitation centre selected by them online along with the required documents in the allotted time slot. After verification and confirmation of the application form, the centre issues the acknowledgement.  NRIs and such candidates should send the print of online filled and submitted application form and copy of uploaded documents by hand, speed post or courier for verification and confirmation to the office of the Director of Sardar Patel College of Engineering. The provisional merit list will be displayed on November 22, after which students will be given two days from November 23 to raise any grievance about correction required in the data through his or her login.

The sharpshooter has been identified as Raju Singh, but his accomplice, Golu, managed to escape. Police have announced a reward of Rs 25,000 to anyone for information on the absconding criminal. Kamal Sharma, the hsband of Priya, is on the run, said police, adding that he has also been booked for murder. The motive behind the crime seems to be a marital dispute between the couple, said an officer involved in the investigation. A day before the crime, Priya had filed a dowry case against her husband at Chandpur police station. Bijnor superintendent of police (SP), Dharamveer Singh, said, "During a routine checking of vehicles on Tuesday night, a police team signalled two men on a bike to stop but they tried to escape." "When policemen tried to intercept them, the bikers opened fire at the cops, who retaliated. Accused Raju, 29, who hails from Khadana village under Majhola police station area of Moradabad, sustained bullet injuries on his leg. His accomplice, Golu, of Kashiram colony in Moradabad, managed to escape. A police constable, Monu Kumar, also received bullet injuries on his hand." The SP added: "There are a dozen cases registered against Raju. He admitted before police that he, along with Golu, shot Priya dead. Raju claimed they were hired by Kamal Sharma and given Rs 5.5 lakh for the crime."

---||Kolkata||97% say crackers toxic for air: Survey||Kolkata: A survey conducted to assess the citizens’ perception on the fireworks bar revealed an overwhelming 60% people were in favour of a complete ban compared to 35% citizens in the survey conducted last year. Significantly, 97% of the citizens agreed that firecrackers are harmful for air quality and 88% agreed that air pollution increases after Diwali. The survey further highlighted that citizens were sensitive towards the issue of the environment but also wanted to celebrate during the festive period. The survey conducted by SwitchON, an environmental pressure group, in association with Bidhannagar and Howrah City Police, covered known fireworks hot spots. It was part of the awareness drive against the spike of pollution during Diwali-Kali Puja festive period. The drive began from Maidan Haat, moving along Shibpur Bazar, Chatterjee Hat-Indoor Stadium, Ramrajatala bus stand and came to an end at Kadamtala Bazar in the Howrah region. In Bidhannagar, it covered all the major markets in blocks like CA, BD, GD, CK, IA, IB, FD, EC, BJ, Boishakhi and AE. Howrah City police deputy commissioner (HQ) Dyutiman Bhattacharya told citizens: "Let this Diwali be full of lights. Let this Diwali be full of happiness. Let this Diwali be sound-free and pollution-free." SwitchON Foundation co-founder Vinay Jaju said: “Large-scale awareness campaigns on all major sources of pollution like vehicles and firecrackers need to be taken up and ensure the restrictions are implemented. The government has started to bring in important policy shifts, but all citizens need to understand air pollution is a health emergency and needs necessary changes to their lifestyle.” A statewide survey was also conducted to understand the perception of firecrackers. The report provided with very important insights necessary for policy recommendations in adopting a low-emission lifestyle alongside exploring the possibilities of alternative sustainable livelihood choices for people. It also came to light that most of the respondents knew about the existence of green crackers but only 29% knew how to correctly identify them. Interestingly, a majority claimed that green crackers were not popular due to lack of public awareness. When it was asked whether the citizens would be willing to pay a higher price, about 65% of the respondents were willing to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/97-say-crackers-toxic-for-air-survey/articleshow/87516095.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Remark on paddymisinterpreted:Siddipet collector||Hyderabad: A day after the high court took serious note of his reported utterances on sale of paddy seeds, Siddipet collector P Venkatrama Reddy has said he holds the judiciary in highest esteem and that some statements he made at a meeting were “misinterpreted and misconstrued”. In a statement on Wednesday, the collector said a meeting was held on October 25 in the district primarily to educate the public on the perils faced by the farmers in relation to the business of spurious sale of seeds. It was also to discuss on the advantage of alternate farming in the district in view of certain instructions received from Food Corporation of India. The collector said that the sale of spurious seeds has been a serious problem plaguing the farmers in the district and strict measures were warranted to curb it. For indulging in sale of spurious speeds, some shops were sealed and a few cases were also registered. In that context, the dealers were informed not to sell spurious seeds and that strict action would be taken against them. Venkatrama said that it was noticed that the dealers were filing cases against cancellation of licences ‘by suppressing facts before the courts.’ It was noticed that some dealers who were dealing in spurious seeds were also present at the meeting. “Having noticed their presence, I stated that even if such dealers were suppressing the facts and obtaining orders, I would apprise the courts about the correct position and even if orders are granted, we will get the same vacated by stating our stand before the court,” the collector said, giving a clarification on what he exactly said at the meeting. “It is also been projected as though I have uttered certain words which are demeaning the judiciary. I am a responsible officer of the state and have contested numerous cases filed against the state by filing counters and apprising the courts the true and correct facts which sometimes are intentionally suppressed,” the Siddipet district collector said. ...

---||Lucknow||‘Petals, not bullets, to welcome bhakts’||Ayodhya: Reminding people about the firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya during the Ram Temple movement 31 years ago, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said those behind the violence have bowed down before the people’s will. Taking a jibe at the political leaders making a beeline to pay visit to Ayodhya and seek the deity’s blessings, Yogi said, “Most of you present here would remember what happened in the temple town 31 years ago on October 30 and November 2 (1990). Bullets were fired at ram bhakts and kar sevaks... they were subjected to cane charge.” “Chanting Jai Shri Ram or talking about Ram Temple was a crime. But today, those who were behind the firing have bowed before your will. That is the power of the people and democracy,” the CM said in an indirect attack on opposition leaders who paid a visit to Ayodhya recently. “Agar kuchh aur din aap log aise hi chale to agli kar seva ke liye weh aur unke khandaan line pe khade hote dikhai denge… Aap dekhna jab agli kar seva hogi tab goli nahi chalegi… Ram bhakton aur Krishna bhakton pe phool barsaye jayenge (If people remain united and patient for a few more years, a day would come when such leaders and their families would contribute in kar seva. In the next kar seva, volunteers will not have to face bullets. Instead, flower petals will be showered upon them),” he said. He said previous governments had misplaced priorities that nurtured politics of appeasement. “Unhone kabristan ki deewar ke liye dhan diya, magar hum dharm sanskriti aur rashtra utthan ke liye pratibaddh hain,” Yogi said. “Ram is the thread that binds people from different walks of life. Ram has a place for everyone in his heart and that is his real power. He embraced Nishadraj, consumed lovingly the fruits first tasted by Shabari, brought different vanvasis (monkeys and bears) together to become the saviour of wisdom and human race,” the CM said. Stating that Ram embodied jaivik (organic), daivik (divine) and bhautik (physical or material) elements which also reflected in his vision of Ram Rajya, the CM welcomed national and international dignitaries and reiterated that their presence showed that Ram had a universal appeal. Yogi said one should learn patience and dignity from Ram. “Mujhe bhi pata hai ‘Parinda bhi par nahi maar sakta’ ke mayene kya hain… magar aapke dhairya ne aapko vijay dilayi hai… ye wahi dhairya aur maryada hai jo prabhu Shri Ram ke sabse vishesh gun hain,” he said, attributing the grandeur of Ayodhya and the ever-rising scale of its Deepotsav to the patience and persistence displayed by the people and seers of Ayodhya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/petals-not-bullets-to-welcome-bhakts/articleshow/87517622.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Sidhu’s attack, in which he also said disparagingly that he did not want to talk about "chale hue kartoos (empty cartridges)", a reference to Amarinder, came a day after the former Punjab CM had stated in his formal resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi that he intended to make public a list of ministers and MLAs involved in the illegal mining of sand. "Was he sleeping at that time," Sidhu, Amarinder’s bête-noir, said. Sidhu told reporters in Amritsar that Amarinder, advancing in years, had become a "crybaby". Amarinder had mentioned Sidhu as "person with an unstable mind" in his resignation letter, stating that he was sure that the AICC president "must be regretting" appointing him the chief of the party’s Punjab unit. Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring asked what had stopped the former CM from taking action if he knew the names of ministers and MLAs involved with the mining mafia. "This is why I always call him a compromised chief minister," he said, adding that opposition politicians used to tell Congress that Amarinder was functioning on the instructions of BJP and RSS, and that he had already entered into a compromise deal with SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. "This is why there was no action against the drug mafia or sand mafia or transport mafia," said Warring. On Amarinder’s claim of talks with the central government to repeal the new agriculture laws, Warring said, "What kind of magic wand has Capt Amarinder got now that he was not able to get the agriculture laws repealed when he was CM, and now after his ouster he will succeed in doing so?" Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla also challenged Capt Singh to mention the names of legislators involved with the mining mafia. When Amarinder had announced his new political party, "Punjab Lok Congress", on Tuesday, state education and sports minister Pargat Singh had tweeted, "What an irony — @capt_amarinder’s new party is neither for "Punjabis" nor for "Lok" and certainly not "Congress". Sidhu said Amarinder didn’t have the support of municipal councillors. "Even his wife is not with him. He has resigned from Congress, (but) will his wife also resign," said Sidhu. He added that right from the first cabinet meeting he had cautioned Amarinder against the sand and liquor mafia.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Ghatlodia killings were premeditated, say police||AHMEDABAD: When an elderly couple were found with their throats slit at their Ghatlodia flat, ransacked cupboards hinted at a robbery gone wrong. However, police now believe that the double murder was premeditated going by the clues and evidence gathered from the crime scene. On Tuesday night, the couple — Dayanand Shanbaug (90) and his wife Vijayalakshmi Shanbaug (80) — were found murdered at their residence on the third floor of Parasmani Flats. Prima facie, it seemed that robbery was a motive behind the killings. However as investigation progressed, police have found various complexities that rule this out as an open-and-shut case. “Soon after the murder, we called the dog squad but the canine did not track dany scent out of the building. This points to two possibilities. The most likely chance is that the culprit lives in one of the flats. The other is that the dog could not sniff out the culprit’s tracks due to heavy flow of people,” said a senior police officer. The police also noted that there was no sign of resistance at the crime scene. Vijayalakshmi’s body was found seated on the chair while Dayanand lay dead on the bed. “There was a glass of water on a water container and a teacup on a table in the room. No sign of robbery was spotted there,” said another police officer. He said that there are around 150 flats in the bustling locality. “Due to the festival season, there is an increased movement of people. The murder took place around 7pm on Tuesday when most of the people were at home. Various vegetable vendors were making the rounds of the flats in the area but no one saw any unusual movement. None of them spotted anyone entering or leaving the Shanbaugs’s flat hurriedly. This has led us to believe that the culprit is from Parasmani Flats,” said the officer. Police officers, however, are leaving no stone unturned and are checking out all possible angles that could have led to the gruesome killings. A murder case has been registered with Ghatlodia police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ghatlodia-killings-were-premeditated/articleshow/87516104.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 2020 festival AQI was better than 2019’s||KOLKATA: Awareness makes a lot of difference when it comes to keep the environment clean. In 2019, the concentration of particulate matter pollution — PM10 and PM2.5 — in Kolkata rose by 112% and 137%, respectively, on Kali Puja-Diwali nights compared to pre-festive nights. But in 2020, the pandemic taught us lessons the hard way. People valued clean air more than revelry and PM10 and PM2.5 rose by only 22.6% and 53.6%, respectively. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) analysis showed that not only Kolkata, most other cities showed restraint to make it a clean Diwali. Track the pollution level in your cityIn 2019, PM10 rose to 275µg/m3and PM2.5 to 210µg/m3 in Kolkata. The PM10 concentration was almost three times the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) while PM2.5 rose to almost four times the NAAQS standards. But in 2020, PM10 exceeded by 100µg/m3 and PM2.5 by 60µg/m3. TimesViewMaintaining ambient air quality is not the responsibility of government agencies and the judiciary alone; citizens, too, must chip in. Safe and responsible celebrations should be the norm with zero violation of all the rules in place.“The tragic fallout of the pandemic was fresh in the memory of people. Since Covid-19 affected lungs the most, people were afraid not to violate the guidelines. Enforcement became easy as locals often called police to inform who were flouting norms,” said a WBPCB official. On 2020 Diwali day, PM2.5 concentrations were found to increase in six out of eight cities. Only Agra and Bengaluru reported lesser PM2.5 on Diwali day in 2020. Maximum increase was observed in Lucknow (2.1 times), followed by Delhi (1.83 times), Bhopal (1.81 times), Lucknow (1.7 times), Kolkata (1.5 times), Shillong (1.3 times) and Vadodara (1.3 times). Overall, the increase in PM2.5 level across cities were lower than 2019 Diwali. Kolkata recorded 11% reduction on post-Diwali days compared to Diwali day. PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 4.4%. “This lower emission during Kali Puja-Diwali left the air quality much better compared to earlier years,” said a WBPCB scientist. Last year’s improved air quality had a lasting impact in the health sector. “Despite the ongoing pandemic, less people with chronic respiratory distress came to hospitals,” said Arup Haldar, a senior pulmonologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2020-festival-aqi-was-better-than-2019s/articleshow/87516085.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Heeding the apex court order, the state government had banned the manufacture, storage, transportation and sale of joint crackers and fireworks containing barium salts. In Madurai city, traders were seen keeping only permitted varieties of green crackers for sale with a few shops even putting up notices and banners stating that only green crackers are sold according to the Supreme Court order. Ahead of the festival, temporary licensed shops were established in several parts of the district in the past week where people have been crowding for the past two days for last-minute purchase. Customers are also aware about green crackers as many were seen making inquiries before making their purchase. Federation of Tamil Nadu Fireworks Traders general secretary N Elangovan said manufacturers have started to produce green crackers with CSIR-NEERI’s prescribed formulation which reduce emission by 20-30%. He said that joint crackers (laris, walas or series crackers) contribute to a major share of fireworks production. However, after the SC banned joint crackers in 2018, nearly 40% of production has come down. “Despite several restrictions imposed on the fireworks industry over the years, the number of licences obtained by traders for cracker sales during Deepavali has not come down. This is because people won’t stop coming forward to purchase crackers,” he said. Due to strict implementation of the restrictions and frequent inspections by officials, only permitted varieties of green crackers are sold by traders, he added. S Venkatesh, manager of a temporary licensed cracker shop at Mattuthavani, said he has been in the business during Diwali for the past 15 years. Though several restrictions are imposed on sale of crackers, he has been continuing the business every year as there is good demand for crackers in the market during the season. “Just because there is a ban on joint crackers, people will not stop buying. They will definitely opt for other varieties of green crackers which are available,” he said. This year, most people have opted to purchase aerial and fancy varieties of green crackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/greens-the-word-as-fireworks-traders-buyers-embrace-reality/articleshow/87516944.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The court passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Selvam. A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that on a careful consideration of the materials available on record it could be seen that the petitioner had already filed two writ petitions in 2019 for the same relief. The judges said that the second petition was dismissed by a division bench of this court in November 2019. Even while dismissing the petition, the court observed that the earlier notice was issued to the petitioner’s wife and she was not successful in getting the notice set aside. The judges observed that now for the third time, the petitioner has filed a petition challenging the eviction notice. The petitioner cannot be allowed to file writ petitions after writ petitions challenging the eviction notices and hence this court is not inclined to entertain the present writ petition, said the judges. Dismissing the petition, the judges imposed the cost and directed him to pay it to the president of the panchayat within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-imposes-cost-on-petitioner-for-repeated-pleas/articleshow/87516948.cms||---

The startup would be launching in about two months a health tech product that measures 6 vitals such as blood glucose, ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 and temperature non-invasively in less than 60 seconds. “The idea is to create awareness about the body, eating habits and activity to help prevent a host of lifestyle diseases,” said Sunil, CEO of BlueSemi, adding that the USP of the product was that it’s the size of a mobile phone and can be used by multiple users. The product is available for trials at the firm’s Experience Centre at Hyderabad. “Right now it is open by invite only to a known set of influencers in the industry. Soon, we will be setting up Experience Centres at Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai as well,” the BlueSemi CEO added. Sunil said that while Covid-19 has claimed many lives, mortality figures due to the virus were but a blip when compared to lifestyle diseases. “A lot more people die due to diabetes or other chronic health issues such as heart ailments,” he said. Citing Union government’s statistics, Sunil said that in the last year alone Indians on average gained 8 kilos. “Drawing inspiration from Ikigai, the Japanese concept of improving work and life, we started developing this device,” he said. The IIIT-H alumni said that during the pandemic they created the world’s first wireless and contactless thermal scanning device — SENS — which obviates the need for human intervention in checking body temperatures, typically seen in the traditional hand-held thermal guns that are deployed at malls, offices and other public spaces.

---||Chandigarh||Praised in Punjab ex-CM’s letter, Tarlochan Singh Riyasti was killed for mediating in 1980s||JALANDHAR: The only positive mention of a person in Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday is of a former Punjab minister, late Tarlochan Singh Riyasti, as the former CM mentioned his own role in pre-Operation Bluestar negotiations and pointed out that Riyasti was tragically assassinated in April 1984. However, Amarinder got the time of Riyasti’s killing wrong. He was shot and then set on fire along with his driver Mangal Singh near Ludhiana on January 8, 1988. Apart from pre-Bluestar negotiations, Riyasti was also involved in post-1984 negotiations. Riyasti first became a Congress MLA in 1962 and then a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA in late 1960s. However, after he turned against Parkash Singh Badal, during the latter’s first stint as chief minster when Riyasti was a minister, he joined the Congress again. “On the few occasions when I met Captain Amarinder Singh, whether he was in power or out and I told him about myself or some senior politician introduced me to him, he would always give me a lot of affection and would recall my father’s well intended attempts to get issues of Punjab resolved, and which led to his tragic death,” he said. “I have stayed away from politics. My father tried for a peaceful resolution to the situation in Punjab and lost his life in the endeavour,” he said. “He was very close to Indira Gandhi and had warned against Army action at Darbar Sahib. The day the Army action took place, he started wearing a black turban. The PM called him after Operation Bluestar and said he could come to her with a black turban, but he refused; finally, after getting quite a few messages, he went to meet her in Delhi. But, before he could see her, she was killed,” said Bhim Singh, who lives in Bathinda. Riyasti was in his early 60s when he was killed. He was mediating in negotiations between militants and central government representatives. According to the details provided by former Intelligence Bureau joint director late M K Dhar in his book ‘Open Secrets’ and other history books on the period, Riyasti was involved in peace efforts by Sunshil Muni, a Jain acharya who was in touch with the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s close aide Captain Satish Sharma. Dhar also provided account of his own meeting with prominent militants at Bathinda with Riyasti’s help and how the group was taken to Delhi for a “peace meeting” with the PM, which never took place. Dhar also describes that it was agreed that Sharma and director of Intelligence Bureau would meet them, but the arrangement did not please the then Union home minister, Buta Singh. Throwing more light on Buta’s role, Dhar mentioned in the book that after this episode, militants were transported back and another meeting was fixed near Ludhiana in which he was also to participate. He himself backed off after smelling foul play on the part of senior people in Delhi, but Riyasti had no scope to opt out and was left to fend for himself. He went to meet the militants and was burnt to death with his driver in his vehicle by Gurjit Singh, who, according to Dhar, had gone mad over deliberate leakage of his trip to Delhi by some highly placed sources in Delhi. Dhar claimed that “details of the secret visit of the terrorist leaders to Delhi at the invitation of the Prime Minister were leaked out to a few members of the Panthic Committee” and called it “height of treachery” with Rajiv Gandhi and “a small fry like me”. Veteran journalist Sukhdev Singh, who would meet Riyasti often at Chandigarh and recalled details of their interactions vividly, told TOI: “I had warned him some days before his murder that he should abandon mediating negotiations as either side — central agencies or militants — could get him killed. From what he had been telling me and from my own sources, I had this premonition that there was a grave danger to his life. On that day, he had not even taken his own weapon (which he carried for self defence) with him,” said Sukhdev. Senior advocate Manjit Singh Khaira, who represented Riyasti before Chhangani Commission in 1970s, said: “I met him (Riyasti) at MLAs’ hostel and he disclosed a few things at which I shot back saying, ‘Riyasti, you know too much’. I advised him not to meet the militants, but he went ahead,” Khaira said. Other dates wrong tooIn his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh also got a couple of other crucial dates wrong, apart from the one on former minister Tarlochan Singh Riyasti’s assassination. He has mentioned that he resigned from Surjit Singh Barnala’s government when Operation Black Thunder took place in 1988. The operation took place in 1988, but Amarinder resigned on April 30, 1986, along with three other ministers, when police was sent inside Darbar Sahib complex. He remained minister for just seven months. He also got the year of passing Punjab Termination of Agreements Act wrong as he mentioned it in 2005, while he got it passed in 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/praised-in-ex-cms-letter-riyasti-was-killed-for-mediating-in-80s/articleshow/87516950.cms||IP Singh

The traffic accident investigation unit (North) has listed the victim as Rohit alias Abhishek Kumar. Injured Riya was admitted to SMS Hospital before being moved to a private hospital following grievous injuries in the neck and head. According to the investigation officer (IO) Babu Lal Sharma, Rohit had come to Jaipur from Agra for his engagement. He was travelling from Jal Mahal to Mansarover. The car had just passed through Chogan stadium and entered Gangauri Bazar road when a two-wheeler came before Rohit’s car. Rohit veered in the opposite direction to avoid hitting the two-wheeler and stuck a divider. Police said the car had skidded and overturned, possibly due to excessive speed. Two other persons took him to SMS Hospital in a different car. Doctors pronounced him brought dead. His body was moved to the mortuary and a post-mortem was held Wednesday afternoon. Police claimed Rohit’s car was completely wrecked in the accident. Its bonnet was smashed and the roof had flattened too. An FIR was submitted by the victim’s brother to the traffic accident unit (north).

---||Ahmedabad||Drive fails in protecting senior citizens||Ahmedabad: The city police often claim that they conduct drives to protect senior citizens by sending SHE teams to inquire about their well-being and even deliver essentials. However, the recent Ghatlodia double murder and the gruesome killing of another elderly couple in Hebatpur have raised doubts about these claims. Sources in the police said that the Shanbaug couple were not registered as senior citizens with the police. No cop or SHE team has visited them in the recent past. “They lived in one flat and their granddaughter lived in the neighbouring flat. Since the couple lived alone most of the time, they should have been registered with the cops to ensure their safety and security. However, no so such action had been taken to prevent the crime,” said a cop. Earlier, on March 5, Ashok Patel and Jyotsna Patel, residents of Bungalow No-1 in Shantivan Palace Society on Hebatpur Crossroad, were killed by a gang of four at their residence. The police later arrested five people including four executors and one perpetrator. The couple, who lived alone most of the time, was never registered by cops under the senior citizen programme, Suraksha Setu. Given the issues faced by senior citizens coming to police stations and registering themselves, SHE teams in respective city police stations last year were given the duty to approach the elderly and register them. Earlier in 2013, the city police had also launched a digital platform through which senior citizens could register themselves with the police who were supposed to track these vulnerable people. One of the pioneers of the project was the then joint commissioner of police (admin), Sanjay Srivastava, the current city police commissioner. The killings of the elderly couple in Ghatlodia is the third incident of the murder of elders in the city. Before the Hebatpur murder, an 80-year-old woman from Vejalpur, Meena Thakor, a resident of Panch Ghar No Vaas in Vejalpur village, was on February 12 bludgeoned to death at her home where she lived alone. That case remains unsolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drive-fails-in-protecting-senior-citizens/articleshow/87516116.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘Dilli Bazaar’ to give Delhi traders a global platform for their products||NEW DELHI: Delhi will soon have its own e-marketplace that can be used by every small or big entrepreneur for selling their products. The platform has been named ‘Dilli Bazaar’ where all entrepreneurs will be able to showcase and sell their products to anyone, anywhere in the world. Unveiling the plan on Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that ‘Dilli Bazaar’ would be a state-of-the-art pathbreaking portal that would give a global online identity to entrepreneurs of Delhi. Through the portal, shoppers will be able to go on virtual walkthroughs of Delhi’s markets and buy any product from the comfort of their homes. The e-marketplace will contribute to the growth of Delhi’s GDP, tax revenues, economic activities, and global business will come to the city. “The government has taken up an initiative that is going to bring a lot more prosperity to the ventures of Delhi’s traders, businesspersons, industrialists and professionals. We are developing a website called ‘Dilli Bazaar’, wherein each and every entrepreneur of the capital will get to have their own online shop. One will be able to showcase all their products and services on this portal, which will help them reach countless people not just from Delhi or India but also the entire world. Virtual bazaars are being developed on this portal,” the CM said. Kejriwal explained the plan with the example of famous Khan Market. “There will be an online Khan Market on this portal as well. One will be able to go on a virtual walkthrough on this portal and get the feel of the market on their phone or computer itself. Right from Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar markets to the small DDA markets inside colonies, all will be present in a virtual avatar on ‘Dilli Bazaar’,” Kejriwal stated. He further said now even someone sitting in America would be able to buy from shops of Delhi. “This portal is going to bring even the smallest of the businesses of Delhi to a global scale,” the CM said. Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi has taken the lead in project design and conceptualisation and the industry department will execute the project. The e-marketplace also has a business-to-business side to it. “If some businessperson from the UK wants to buy Indian antiques, they can go to our portal, look for the antiques and order in bulk quantities,” Kejriwal said. The local businesses are expected to benefit a lot from the portal. The portal will also make it possible to hold unique online exhibitions, instead of limiting an exhibition to a fixed area and a fixed number of people. It will promote endless opportunities for even the most niche products. “Startups will get a great push in their ventures with exposure to a marketplace like such. I am of the view that this is a one-of-a-kind initiative and there’s no such avenue available across the world yet,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dilli-bazaar-to-give-city-traders-a-global-platform-for-their-products/articleshow/87516966.cms||AlokKNMishra

Like previous years, the convocation will be held at LU’s arts quadrangle in the offline mode where medals would be awarded to 13 meritorious students. The remaining 180 medals will be conferred at the department level. The decision has been taken in view of Covid-19 pandemic. Talking to media persons on Wednesday, LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai said, “Only old medals and one that was constituted by the university will be presented to meritorious students. It’s not possible to award all medals to over 100 high scorers from the stage due to pandemic situation.” “The medals which will be presented include Dr. Chakravarti gold medal, Vice-chancellor gold medal, Chancellor’s gold, silver and bronze medals,” he added.

---||Mumbai||Fuel duty slash: Motorists smirk, pump owners in Maharashtra upset||MUMBAI: While this is some relief during Diwali for motorists and transporters, it is bad news for petrol pump owners. Petrol in Maharashtra, which has one of the highest VAT on excise, could reduce by around Rs6 a litre, and diesel could come down by around Rs12, said fuel pricing experts. They said there was 26% VAT on excise duty, and this should lead to a drop by an extra rupee for petrol, apart from a Rs5 reduction per litre announced by the Centre. Similarly, there should be an around Rs2 VAT reduction for diesel in Maharashtra, apart from Rs10 reduction in excise duty announced by the Centre. Dealer commission will also drop marginally, they said. Exact rates will be declared at pumps on Thursday morning. Petrol pump owners were fuming as oil terminals were shut for two days, and almost all of them purchased three days’ stock. “With rates dropping, we will incur huge losses,” said a petrol pump owner from Ghatkopar, adding that in his case, it was a Rs 4 lakh loss overnight. “We stocked so much fuel, we have to bear the losses now. The government will not compensate us,” he said. The city has 237 petrol pumps and each stocks 40,000-50,000 litres of fuel. Pump owners complained that there has been no increase in dealer commission for four-and-a-half years, which was frustrating. “With fresh losses, we will be disappointed during Diwali although consumers may rejoice,” said another pump owner. On Monday, the 19kg commercial LPG cylinder was hiked by Rs266 in Mumbai while there was no hike in price of domestic LPG cylinder (14.2 kg) which is delivered to households. The domestic cylinder price remains the same at Rs900.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fuel-duty-slash-motorists-smirk-pump-owners-upset/articleshow/87516972.cms||Somit Sen

---||Lucknow||Annapurna idol brought from Canada to be installed at KVT||Lucknow: The Narendra Modi government at the Centre has reclaimed an ancient idol of goddess Annapurna from MacKenzie art Gallery of Regina University in Canada. The idol, which is said to have been stolen from Varanasi nearly 100 years ago, will be handed over to the UP government on November 11 at a grand function in New Delhi, Union culture and tourism minister G Kishan Reddy said on Wednesday. The state government, in turn will organise a massive `Shobha Yatra’, spanning over four days (November 11 to November 14), all the way from Delhi to Varanasi while passing through 17 districts, including Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Lucknow, Kanpur and Ayodhya. The idol will be duly placed at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi after performing a `Pran Pratishtha’ on November 15, which also happens to be an auspicious day of Ekadashi. Reddy said that the idol was received by the ministry of culture on October 15 after concerted efforts of the ministry of external affairs and Archaeological Survey of India. He said that the people of the civil society and seers in Varanasi have been campaigning for reclaiming the idol of Annapurna for a long time. Reddy said that the Indian government had managed to reclaim 55 idols and paintings from abroad since independence, of which 75% have been brought back after 2014 after BJP came to power at the Centre. The minister said that the Centre has identified 157 more idols and paintings which will be brought back from foreign shores, including Belgium, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and UK, after due diplomatic perusal. In fact, nearly 100 of them are in the US alone. “PM Modi has spoken to US president Joe Biden on the issue,” he said. Reddy said the Centre has asked the cultural wings in various embassies across the globe to identify and get hold of the idols, painting and artefacts, which were allegedly misappropriated during the British rule. Yogi said the development marked “endorsement of Indian culture and heritage” on a global platform. “The coming back of Annapurna idol will be of prime importance for Kashi (Varanasi) which is known as one of the oldest cities in the world,” Yogi said, asserting that the goddess holds a special place in the city of lord Vishwanath. Yogi said a host of ministers will be present in Delhi on November 11, which also happens to be Gopashtami (cows are worshipped on the day), when the idol is handed over to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/annapurna-idol-brought-from-canada-to-be-installed-at-kvt/articleshow/87517637.cms||---

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Dead MP 'files' for Rs 1 crore compensation||MEERUT: A man impersonating as two-time Rajya Sabha MP from Janata Party, Prem Manohar -- who died in 2013 – has submitted fake documents to claim Rs 1 crore compensation for 80 bigha land acquired by the authorities for road widening project from the office of the additional district magistrate (ADM), land acquisition. Strangely, all attested documents from tehsildars and other officials are in place. The matter came to light when the administration was all set to release a cheque of Rs 84 lakh, following which district magistrate (DM) K Balaji has ordered a probe. Manohar’s sons confirmed that their father died in 2013 and that they have no idea about the imposter, who is yet to be nabbed. Manohar was a two-time Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, from 1968 to 1974 and then from 1977 to 1980. As per the records of the district administration, he had bought 80 bighas of agricultural land in Samaspur village beside National Highway 119 that goes to Pauri from Meerut. “The administration started acquiring land some months ago for the widening of the highway, and the process is still on. One day, a man identifying himself as Prem Manohar arrived at the district magistrate’s office with all relevant documents and claimed compensation for the acquired land. The man submitted copies of Aadhaar, address proof, voter ID and even a passbook to prove his identity. Along with this, a certificate issued by the Lekhpal identifying the man as Prem Manohar was also submitted,” said an official. As all documents seemed to be in place, the officials concerned started the reimbursement process and a cheque of Rs 84 lakh was prepared. But before the cheque could be released to the claimant, it came to light that the real Prem Manohar was a two-time MP and had died in 2013. The officials then called Manohar’s son, Prashant Kumar, to verify the matter. “We have already shared the required documents with the administration to prove that my father is no more,” Prashant Kumar told TOI. “I have asked the ADM, land acquisition, to investigate the matter and submit his report at the earliest,” said the district magistrate K Balaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-impersonates-dead-mp-to-claim-rs-1cr-for-land-acquisition-probe-ordered/articleshow/87515000.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Special judge arrested on charges of sodomy, 2 accused at large||JAIPUR: The Bharatpur police Wednesday arrested suspended lower court judge Jitendra Singh, 52, for allegedly sodomising a 14-year-old boy. Superintendent of police (SP) Devendra Kumar Bishnoi told TOI that Singh was arrested from Jaipur following legal procedure. The accused was quizzed in Jaipur in the presence of a metropolitan magistrate. Singh has been taken to Bharatpur by a deputy SP (DSP) rank official for further investigation. He was posted as a special judge at the special court dealing with anti-corruption bureau (ACB) cases in Bharatpur. The mother on Sunday had filed an FIR against three persons, including Singh, at Mathura Gate police station of the district. As per the police, the mother alleged that Singh and two of his staff members had been sexually assaulting her son for the past several days. She claimed that the judge had befriended the boy at a club where he played tennis. Sources said that the matter had come to light on October 28, when the judge came to drop the boy and kissed him while the mother was standing outside on the balcony. The woman questioned the boy and he finally revealed his plight. The accused had also threatened the boy and his family with dire consequences. A deputy SP (DSP) of ACB, Parmeshwar Lal Yadav, posted in Bharatpur, has been shunted out after the family named him as one of the persons who had allegedly threatened them. Soon after the FIR was filed at the Mathura Gate police station, a video went viral which showed the judge apologising to the kid and his mother. Police have also constituted teams to arrest Singh’s staffers, Anshul Soni and Rahul Katara. The Rajasthan high court on Monday had deputed a vigilance team to investigate the allegation against the special judge. On Tuesday, the investigating officer (IO) in the case arrived in Jaipur to interrogate Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/spl-judge-arrested-on-charges-of-sodomy-2-accused-at-large/articleshow/87517645.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Teacher who molested girl in SSC exam hall gets 1 year in jail||MUMBAI: Fourteen years after a teacher, who was an examiner during the SSC board exam conducted in 2007, was accused of molesting a 16-year-old student during the Marathi paper, the Vikhroli magistrate’s court convicted and sentenced him to one year rigorous imprisonment. He has also also been fined Rs 5,000. He had initially touched the child’s hand and later sat next to her and put his leg over her thigh. While the survivor remained untraceable, the court relied on the statement of an eyewitness, now a 29-year-old man, who was also a student in the examination hall at Tilak Nagar. Finding Nandkumar Shinde from Chembur guilty, the court said, “There was no fault on the part of the informant [minor]. However, the accused outraged her modesty by putting his leg on the informant’s thigh. This conduct of the accused with the informant [girl] while she was writing examination paper, indicates that he is having errant behaviour…,” the court said. The court refused to let off the accused under the Probation of Offenders Act that provides for a convict to be released on a bond of good behaviour instead of serving a sentence. “The main reason for not extending benefit of probation to the accused under the Probation of Offenders Act is that the present offence is against the woman, which is directly affecting life and right to privacy of the informant,” the court said. Relying on the evidence of witnesses — including the eyewitness and the principal to whom the girl had first complained and the investigating officer, the court said nothing is elicited to disbelieve their evidence. “Nothing is elicited to show that there is any undue influence... that there is enmity between the prosecution witnesses and the accused. Nothing is elicited from the mouth of the prosecution witnesses that they are deposing falsely with intention to falsely implicate the accused,” the court said. In her complaint to the police, the girl had said that she had appeared for her exam on March 16, 2007, between 11.30 am and 1.30 pm. On that day, the accused was assigned duty of the invigilator in her exam hall. During the examination hours, the accused came near her desk and pressed her hand. After some time, the accused sat on her bench and he put his leg on her thigh. The girl then shouted and began to cry. The accused then left.

The board has nearly 3.17 lakh registered construction workers across the state and the disbursement is likely to involve an expenditure of Rs 90 to 100 crore.

The chief minister also asked the sarpanches and councillors both in rural and urban areas to get a maximum number of construction workers registered so that they could be immensely benefited from various welfare schemes being extended by the board from time to time. Channi, who is also the chairman of the board, said that this financial assistance is being extended as the livelihood of these construction workers has been impacted due to Covid pandemic. The state labour minister Sangat Singh Gilzian said that with the considerable improvement in the Covid situation, all out efforts are being made to accelerate the pace of construction activity across the state so as to ensure the livelihood of construction workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-3100-each-for-3-17l-construction-workers-in-punjab-says-cm/articleshow/87516978.cms||---
---||Nagpur||GMCH’s sickle cell detection machine shifted to NMC hosp||Nagpur: Sickle cell investigation and management will be badly affected at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) as the lone high performance liquid chromatographs (HPLC) machine it had has been shifted to NMC’s Pachpaoli Maternity Home. The machine, which plays an important role in preventing sickle cell disease and other blood disorders, was sponsored by CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, under the Prime Minister Health Mission project. Following superannuation of GMCH’s head of paediatric department, Dr Dipty Jain, who is the nodal officer, the project has been moved to the NMC hospital. Dr Jain has been retained as the nodal officer at the new Sickle Cell Research Centre which was inaugurated by Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday. CCMB’s sickle cell branch has sponsored manpower including doctor, technician and social workers. Mahatme SMM Eye Welfare Charitable Trust will look after community outreach activity through different camps like it has been doing for cataract. Experts said a tertiary care centre like GMCH must have its own HPLC machine which costs just around Rs40 to Rs50lakh. The status of centre of excellence which will comprise research sickle cell institute and hospital couldn’t be ascertained as GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta didn’t answer to TOI’s calls. Around 4 acre land has been earmarked for the centre of excellence at GMCH but the project remains on paper till date. Eastern Vidarbha is said to capital of sickle cell disease and GMCH gets patients from all districts in the division. The HPLC machine was set up at GMCH in 2018 and over one lakh patients have been screened. GMCH also offered in-patient department for sickle cell patients which will not be available at NMC’s Pachpaoli centre right away. The NMC centre will only have an OPD and distribute medicines for free. The city has two more HPLC machines, one each at IGGMCH and Daga Hospital, but patients have been unable to benefit adequately. Manpower issues have kept the both machines under-utilized, said officials. The HPLC machine involves two-tier system – screening through blood test and classification of the sickle cell type from newborn to senior citizens. Dr Vinky Rughwani, vice president, Maharashtra Medical Council, said that the NMC research centre will benefit North Nagpur to a great extent as this part of city has maximum sickle cell patients. “Efforts are on to set up the GMCH’s sickle cell institute but it is yet to materilize. Till then at least an HPLC can be procured there,” said Rughwani, who is director of Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Centre.  ‘Take timely medical help’ Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the sickle cell prevalence has increased to such extent that Nagpur and Vidarbha have become capital of the disease. “Citizens are not taking this disease seriously resulting in many getting affected. I appeal to citizens to take timely medical intervention and prevent the spread of the disease,” said Gadkari after inaugurating the new research centre at Pachpaoli on Wednesday. Rajya Sabha member Dr Vikas Mahatme, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, chief scientist of CCMB Giriraj Chandak, former MLA Dr Milind Mane and others were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmchs-sickle-cell-detection-machine-shifted-to-nmc-hosp/articleshow/87516137.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

However, Covid-19 safety measures went for a complete toss and posed a possible threat of rise in cases post Diwali. Thousands of shoppers could be seen on Masi streets especially close to the corner of Vilakkuthoon, South Masi Street and East Masi Street. “The crowd was massive but we could come with both my husband and daughter only on Wednesday. Also on the eve of Diwali, we expected to also shop for clothing and accessories at discounted rates. We usually come every year and the crowd never reduces,” said R Lakshmi Devi, a resident of Shenoy Nagar. However, shoppers also struggled to move around as rain the previous day had left stagnant water and mud in some spots and roads were also damaged in some of the smaller streets. Parking was also a nightmare for shoppers as they had to park at a distance and only pedestrians were allowed in the area. S Rajaram, 56, said that he found it extremely hard to navigate the crowd with his family as shoppers pushed and pulled on each other. “There were few police personnel regulating the crowd but it was chaos with huge number of people. But, still, I guess it is just how it is on Diwali eve,” he added. “Only from this Sunday, our sales started picking up and even then, rains were affecting us greatly. We got good sales and more customers were eager to buy with discounts. Even if the sales are still nowhere close to what we used to sell previously before the Covid-19 pandemic, we are able to at least salvage something of our seasonal business,” said K Prakash, a vendor who sold accessories and clothing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-19-norms-go-up-in-smoke-on-masi-streets/articleshow/87516980.cms||---

B R Priyanka from Avvai corporation GHSS, who scored 414 marks out of 720, is “doubly happy” as she can now pursue either engineering or medicine. “I was not sure how well I would score in NEET, so I had applied for engineering counselling. Under the 7.5% quota I got a seat in Anna University, Chennai. I’ve enrolled for BTech IT, but my first preference has always been medicine. Now I stand a chance to get a seat in a government medical college under the 7.5% quota,” she said. She said she started preparing seriously towards the middle of Class XI. The corporation commissioner gave support for the school by organizing special classes. Apart from E-box coaching, V Poongavanam, headmistress of Avvai corporation school, said classes were specially held for students who wanted to pursue NEET. “They worked hard and got the results. Till the end, we supported as much as possible by holding tests and classes,” she added. Harish Kumar from Elumalai government boys HSS, son of daily wage labourers, scored 373 marks in NEET. “I could only rely on the E-box NEET coaching classes and the support of my school teachers. I started preparing a little late in Class XII. The district-level mock tests conducted just before NEET helped reduce my fear of the exam,” he added. S Ashika Rani from EVR Nagamayar corporation GHSS, who scored 351 marks, had started preparing with the government coaching classes only two months before NEET. “I relied only on the government NEET coaching classes. We had unbelievable support from teachers and were able to clear any doubts at any time,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/neet-toppers-among-govt-school-students-hail-quota-coaching/articleshow/87516975.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

One of the key norms in the bylaw is that all the bulk generators of garbage, including hospitals, hotels, auditoriums, etc., should treat their waste on their own. The draft of the bylaw was presented at the meeting of the health standing committee of Kochi corporation held on Wednesday. “The health standing committee demanded some more time to study the draft bylaw. Then, deliberations will be held at the health standing committee once again. The bylaw will be finalized only after discussion at the corporation council,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf. “The bylaw will streamline the entire waste treatment process right from the primary collection to its transportation to the treatment facility. We plan a system on the lines of those existing in certain cities where the waste management system functions well,” Ashraf said. Some of the members in the health standing committee where the draft bylaw was presented on Wednesday have demanded certain amendments and inclusions in the draft. As per the draft bylaw, Haritha Societies should be constituted for monitoring the waste collection and other activities related to it in each ward. Haritha Karma Sena should be constituted at ward level and its members should collect the garbage from the households in the ward. There should be at least one member for taking care of 100 houses in a ward. A fund for waste disposal will also be constituted. Financial support from the Union and state governments, corporation’s own fund, the amount collected as fine from the offenders, etc. will constitute the fund. These will bring the entire waste collection directly under the corporation. At the same time, there are many grey areas in the draft, including lack of quantum of the penalty to be slapped on those violating the norms. But, Ashraf said the fine will be slapped as per the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 introduced by the government. “There are no provisions in the bylaw for examining the food items, meat, fish, etc. being supplied in the city. The media had reported several incidents of stale and contaminated meat, fish and other food items being sold to the public in the city. So, there should be measures to check the quality of food items being sold in the city,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader, Kochi corporation. The bylaw keeps mum on the method of treating waste. Though the corporation and the state government are planning various projects, including the waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram, for treating municipal waste, the bylaw doesn’t refer to any such facilities. “We are going ahead with the measures to construct a new windrow compost unit at Brahmapuram.,” Ashraf said. “It is the state government which constructs the waste-to-energy plant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-corp-brings-out-draft-waste-management-bylaw/articleshow/87516160.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

As many as 17,379 samples out of 43,663 examined from January 1 till November 2 this year, have tested positive, and over 71% of these cases are limited to seven districts. This year, Punjab has already overtaken the previous record of 15,398 dengue cases in 2017. Among the worst-hit districts, Muktsar has the highest positivity rate of 64.28%. A total of 1,344 samples out of 2,075 have been tested positive in the district and 54.25% of 4,164 samples in Bathinda have been found positive. With 1,540 out of 3,072 samples found infected, the positivity rate stands at 51.04% in Amritsar. The positivity rate in the remaining worst-hit districts is 46.82% in Pathankot, 45.77% in Mohali, 34.64% in Hoshiarpur and 33.78% in Ludhiana. A total of 63 suspected dengue deaths have also been reported so far. Mohali leads the tally with the highest suspected deaths at 31. With Punjab witnessing a record number of dengue cases, the central government has deputed a two-member team of experts for assisting the state government in providing guidance for managing the outbreak of the disease effectively. A separate team has also been sent to the neighbouring state of Haryana. The team comprising officials from the National Centre for Disease Control and National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme is in Punjab and has started assessing the situation. The team will visit districts reporting a high number of cases and will submit its report along with recommendations to the state and central governments. In recent months, Punjab has been reporting more cases of dengue than Covid-19. The analysis of data of the last 14 days - from October 19 till November 2 - reveals that cases of the vector-borne disease were over 22 times higher than the number of people contracting the coronavirus. In the last 14 days, Punjab has reported a total of 8,332 dengue cases – 595 cases on an average daily-- against 375 cases of Covid-19, which translates to 26 cases daily on average. Punjab deputy CM OP Soni, who is also health minister, said the state government is making all efforts to stem the cases by enhancing the testing capacity and slashing the rates of tests to Rs 600. "This year the health department conducted over 40,000 tests, which is the highest number to date," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dengue-positivity-rate-40-in-punjab/articleshow/87516985.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Chandigarh||Power privatisation: Chandigarh to govern STU and SLDC, not private operator||CHANDIGARH: While power privatisation process is on, the UT administration will retain the state transmission utility (STU) and the state load dispatch centre (SLDC). The STU will be responsible for smooth transmission of power and the SLDC will be the main body to ensure integrated operation of the power system. It was discussed during the review meeting chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal. Recently, the ministry had rejected Chandigarh administration’s view that the STU and SLDC be taken over by a private operator. The ministry had clearly directed UT that as per the Electricity Act, both need to be governed by a government authority. After approval from Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit, the UT administration had submitted their reply to the ministry of home affairs (MHA) in connection with power privatisation project. In September, the MHA had sought some clarification from the administration on the cabinet note that was sent by the administration to the MHA. In the three-page note sent by the MHA, it had asked the UT to provide the details of assets to be shifted after privatisation and retained by the Chandigarh administration, current revenue of the department, employees` strength, performance, liabilities, provision of formation of trust, details of liabilities of employees, infrastructure strength, provision of the Electricity Act, 2003, privatization stage of other UTs and features of transfer scheme. On September 24, after the approval of former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, the UT administration had sent the cabinet note to the MHA. Recently, the UT’s empowered committee of power privatisation under the chairmanship of UT adviser Dharam Pal had approved Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution’s highest bid for the privatisation of the electricity department with Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs174 crore. The Chandigarh administration on August 5 had informed the Punjab and Haryana high court that the process to get cabinet nod for UT’s power privatisation project would take 2-3 months more and submited that the petition challenging privatisation project was premature. Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution was the highest bidder for the privatisation of the electricity department with Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs174 crore, defeating giants like Tata and the Adani group. The company is a subsidiary of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation Ltd, a flagship of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. After relief from the Supreme Court, the administration had recently speeded up the project. In June, the apex court had stayed the Punjab and Haryana high court’s May 28 order of staying the privatisation process on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union. The UT had then moved the Supreme Court. Recently, the administration had opened technical bids of all seven companies and submitted the case to the technical bids evaluation committee. The UT was planning to open the bids in the first week of June, but the union had moved the high court. The UT engineering department had issued notice on November 9, 2020, and invited bids for distribution licence in Chandigarh. The bids closed on February 8. On March 8, the UT had issued an amendment to the bid document and extended the bidding date to March 18. The amendment also provided an opportunity to new bidders to submit their bids and allowed the existing bidders to modify theirs. 2.47 lakh power consumers in city The electricity department caters to 2.47 lakh consumers divided into nine categories. According to official figures, of the total consumers, 2.14 lakh are domestic, which accounts to more than 87% of total consumers. The remaining 23% belong to other categories like commercial, small power, medium supply, large supply, bulk supply, public lighting, agriculture power and temporary supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-privatisation-chandigarh-to-govern-stu-and-sldc-not-private-operator/articleshow/87517007.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The ban on bursting polluting crackers will prevent the emission of harmful gases and protect the lungs of Kolkatans, the experts pointed out. It will also make a positive difference during the pandemic since Covid, like cracker-generated gases, affects the lungs. The ban comes at the right juncture when a large number of people in the city are suffering from mild and asymptomatic Covid, which might be aggravated by pollutants, felt Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Cracker emission can turn many of these patients serious by affecting their lungs. Also, there is a significant number of people suffering from Covid for long and they remain vulnerable to lung ailments that could be fatal. That apart, we are going through the period of season-change when lungs remain mildly affected and vulnerable. An onslaught of cracker-produced gases could make us more vulnerable to Covid,” said Sarkar. Apart from polluting the environment and contributing to global warming, crackers generate toxic gases that have both short-term and long-term impacts on lungs, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Gases like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and potassium nitrate are commonly generated from most of the crackers and they have a double impact on lungs. First, they cause irritation of the airways and also narrow down the airway passage, leading to severe breathing distress. This affects the patients who have an existing lung ailment as well as those who haven’t. That is why, we see a five-six times spurt in the number of patients seeking help for lung-disorders during this time of the year,” said Dhar. According to a recent study by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, 70% of Kolkata’s population suffer from pollution-induced respiratory disorders. More severe bouts of asthma attacks were an important indicator of the rising intensity of pollution-induced ailments, felt consultant Arindam Biswas. It confirmed that pollution was infiltrating the lungs more frequently now and it got more frequent and harmful after Diwali, he said. “Over the last five winters, asthma patients in Kolkata have had repeated attacks. Such repeated attacks have made them depend on medication, which will definitely shorten their life-span. The same holds true for COPD patients and even those with a cardiac condition since the lung and the heart are closely related,” said Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cracker-ban-to-protect-lungs-say-experts/articleshow/87516165.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Nagpur||Pollution due to crackers can adversely impact health of Covid recovered: Docs||Nagpur: Diwali crackers can have adverse impact on the health of those recovered from Covid-19, caution doctors. With their lungs already scarred from the disease, exposure to toxic smoke can lead to severe outcomes, including decreased lung function.According to interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat, people who have had Covid-19 are at a major risk from air pollution caused due to burning of crackers. “Most patients who have suffered from this disease have either compromised or reduced lung function. During Diwali, there is an immense increase in particulate matter and other volatile organic compounds in the ambient air. When exposed to this, those recovered from Covid-19 are prone to cough, difficulty in breathing, and might also experience severe respiratory ailments,” said Arbat.Citing a recent study which found that level of sulphur dioxide during three days of Diwali was 200 times more than the safe permissible limit given, chief pulmonologist and secretary of the Indian Chest Society, Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, said, “Crackers have harmful air pollutants and gaseous matter like carbon monoxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide .They cause irritation to respiratory tract lining (mucosal layer) causing cough, excessive sputum production and swelling inside wind pipes. This is especially dangerous not just for asthma and allergy patients but now also for Covid recovered. It’s prudent that these patients stay indoors during the time fire crackers smog is lingering in the air.”The expert advised influenza vaccine to be taken before Diwali every year for all and pneumococcal vaccine for those above 50 years and for below 50 years who are diabetic, have renal problem or Covid recovered. “These crackers additionally contain charcoal to burn fine particles of PM2.5 which enter in deeper tissue of lungs and even in blood circulation. Burning a single fulzadi, anar produces smoke equivalent to 200 cigarettes,” said Dr Swarnarkar.The expert feels that shifting to electronic fire crackers is a healthier way out. “They are now available in market and create sound and light like crackers but do not emit smoke,” he said.Suggesting that while Diwali is a good opportunity to relieve the pandemic stress, Dr Arbat stated that people should not risk their health at the cost of celebrations. “Last year, we saw a lot of post-Covid patients facing difficulty from air pollution caused by crackers. They need to take all precautions to stay healthy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pollution-due-to-crackers-can-adversely-impact-health-of-covid-recovered-docs/articleshow/87515040.cms||Manka Behl

---||Kolkata||No entry to Kali Puja pandals like last year: Calcutta HC||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday said the restrictions on public entry into pandals that were in place during last year’s Kali Puja would continue to be in force this year as well. Only a limited number of fully vaccinated people would be allowed to enter at a time. The bench, however, clarified that being fully vaccinated should not be viewed as a licence to enter pandals. The vacation bench of Justice Rajashekhar Mantha and Justice Keshang Doma Bhutia said all Covid restrictions as per the court orders issued on November 5, 2020 before last year’s Kali Puja and October 7, 2021, before Durga Puja this year, would be in place during the ensuing festivals — Kali Puja, Jagaddhatri Puja and Kartik Puja. Pandals would continue to be no-entry zones for visitors. The court order allowed a limited number of people entry to the pandals at any given point of time. For small pandals, where the covered area is 150sqm, only 10 persons will be allowed at a time. In pandals that are bigger, with a covered area measuring between 150sqm and 300sqm, 15 persons can enter at a time. For pandals that are beyond 300m, 45 persons have been allowed entry at any given point of time. The bench, while stating that all those allowed entry into pandals were required to be fully vaccinated also said that being fully vaccinated did not give people the right to enter pandals. The judges’ remarks follow the concern expressed by the court earlier about similar restrictions being flouted during Durga Puja. While several Durga Puja pandals witnessed crowding, the Sreebhumi Sporting Puja at Lake Town came in for special attention due to the huge crowds it attracted. Bidhannagar Commissionerate had to finally shut down entry to it from Nabami. Enforcing restrictions during Kali Puja is less challenging than Durga Puja as pandals are traditionally open. However, there are certain stretches, like Amherst Street, Keshab Sen Street, Ganesh Chandra Avenue, SN Banerjee Road, Beliaghata-Kankurgachhi, Motilal Nehru Road, Ramesh Mitra Road, Chetla-Kalighat, Tollygunge-Kudghat belt, which get very crowded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-entry-to-kali-puja-pandals-like-last-yr-hc/articleshow/87516162.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The incident came to light when the girl, who was nine months pregnant was admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) for delivery. The hospital alerted the police, following which a rural welfare officer for women, Karuppayee, met the girl. Inquiry revealed that the girl and the accused were in a relationship for three years. He had also raped her multiple times. The girl, who became pregnant, got married to him on June 16, 2021, with the consent of both their parents. A case was registered by the T Kallupatti police against the accused and both parents under various sections of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Police said that while the 21-year-old has been arrested and remanded in judicial custody, his parents and the girl’s parents were absconding. “Child marriages and teen pregnancy greatly affects the future of a girl child whether parents consent to it or not. They are unable to pursue education and drop out from school. The girl also suffers immense physical and mental distress as she has a baby to take care of when she herself is a child,” said B Pandiaraja, member, child welfare committee (CWC), Madurai district. Public have been urged to alert the police if they come across any instances or information on child marriages.

---||India||Govt panel: Use STBs to get universal TRP data||NEW DELHI: The four-member committee appointed by the government in November 2020 to review the ‘Guidelines on Television Rating Agencies in India’ year has recommended that it should be made mandatory to universalise collection of viewership information by using the ‘Return Path Data’ (RPD) technology. Led by Prasar Bharati chief executive Shashi Shekhar Vempati, the committee was appointed in the backdrop of the ‘TRP Scam’ unearthed by the Mumbai police in October 2020, which pointed to the “fraudulent” manipulation of Television Rating Points (TRPs) by three channels – Republic TV, Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema. The report, which was shared with the Broadcast Audience Research Council India (BARC India) and all broadcaster associations on Monday, acknowledges that there has been a broad consensus among most stakeholders in favour of leveraging RPD capabilities. Observing that the review of the Television Ratings System in India was undertaken during a period of “immense change within the media sector” and at a juncture “when the integrity of the ratings system has come under critical public scrutiny”, the committee recommended increasing competitiveness in the TV ratings space, putting in place a “specialised regulatory mechanism”, and increasing the base for TV ratings in India in line with global benchmarks. “As a first step, the committee recommends that provision for RPD be made a mandatory capability of all future Set Top Boxes (STBs) deployed by Distributor Platform Operators so that RPD becomes a ubiquitous capability on par with encryption, conditional access and other such mandatory STB level capabilities,” the report said. It added, “Further, all collection of viewership data by DPOs should be governed by privacy norms prescribed by the government/regulator. Additionally, the sale or sharing of such viewership data by the DPOs should be governed by the guidelines for TV rating systems.” Recommending to BARC the integration of existing RPD data within 6 months, the committee also batted for setting up a joint industry working group comprising stakeholders and independent experts to “specify the norms for an industry-wide RPD mandate, to codify privacy protection, and to govern the sale/sharing of RPD data in a transparent manner.” Taking “senior note” of the “unhealthy business practises that have been incentivised by frequent release of TV ratings”, the committee asserted the need to “eliminate” perverse incentives resulting from frequent reporting of TV ratings and said the industry must come together to devise “acceptable business practises to ensure healthy competition”, the responsibility of which “ought to be shouldered by the industry stakeholders bodies within a strict timeframe given the urgency and criticality to restore faith in ratings”. “The government may consider temporarily suspending the license to BARC India after suitably amending guidelines and issuing necessary directions to BARC India. The temporary suspension may be limited to the period till BARC India,” the report said. Significantly, the committee favoured healthy competition and recommended that the government should develop multiple rating agencies in competition to BARC India, apart from pushing for the creation of a specialised media ratings regulator “drawing on the experiences of SEBI in regulating credit rating agencies and of the experience of the Media Ratings Council in the United States.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-panel-use-stbs-to-get-universal-trp-data/articleshow/87518562.cms||Swati Mathur

Despite the stringent rule, hundreds of firecracker shops have cropped up across the city.The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department has issued NOCs to only 665 firecracker shops set up in concrete buildings, subject to strict adherence to 14-odd terms and conditions.NMC’s chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake, said temporary shops should get a licence before sales, but they should have a roof. “Selling firecrackers from makeshift shops are not allowed in the city,” he said. Shops in concrete building need to have proper entrance and fire exit. In addition, shops should be at a safe distance from congested areas. Fire safety measures like having a fire extinguisher are mandatory.On eve of Diwali, TOI found blatant violation of the rules in markets across the city as temporary stalls have sprung up everywhere.At bustling areas including Sadar, Zingabai Takli, Gandhibagh, Itwari, Mahal, Sakkardara, Pachpaoli and Indora, makeshift stalls have sprung up on footpaths with a huge stock of firecrackers. There were no fire extinguishers or safety mechanisms. Merely a ‘No Smoking’ sign could be seen.No permissions have been granted for setting up temporary shops across the city, as per the fire department.A senior officer from the department said they could only check firefighting arrangements. “It is the duty of NMC’s anti-encroachment department of 10 zones to take action against such shops,” he said.The officer claimed that the department has already informed the anti-encroachment department about the violations.Assistant municipal commissioner (enforcement department) Ashok Patil was not available for comments. These are not isolated cases. In almost every market, makeshift stalls, some dangerously close to other shops, can be seen. TOI even spotted firecrackers being sold on push carts, creating a fire hazard.Thre are many temporary shops on a small stretch of less than 500 metre on Zingabai Takli road. Many such shops have not installed fire extinguishers or kept sand, as a precaution in case of a fire.The NOCs also revealed that the highest number of firecracker shops have been set up in south Nagpur. Sakkardara fire station has issued 134 NOCs, followed by Trimurti Nagar (95), Sugat Nagar (83), Civil Lines (82), Narendra Nagar (76), Kalamna (60), Lakadganj (58), Ganjipeth (45) and Cotton Market (32).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/makeshift-firecracker-shops-set-up-in-violation-of-norms-a-ticking-bomb/articleshow/87515050.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Now, Pench field director Ravikiran Govekar has been shifted to Mantralaya as joint secretary.On October 25, the government shunted out Ramgaonkar to the forest ministry as joint secretary without any specific reason. He had joined Tadoba on August 13, 2020, and had hardly completed one year. Most of the tenure was marred by Covid-19 restrictions. He was transferred at a time when the wildlife management works had gained momentum.On Wednesday late evening, the state issued fresh orders and posted Govekar as chief conservator of forest (CCF) at Mantralaya. He has been asked to take over the new posting immediately. Posting Govekar to Mumbai would mean the loss of a wildlife-rich experienced officer who worked in Gadchiroli, Tadoba, NNTR, and also at the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). He was also the state’s nodal officer for the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018 and had participated in the training session for AITE-2022 recently.On August 2, 2021, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav had written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking support for the tiger estimation exercise.Yadav has said that “to accomplish the exercise effectively, it is prudent to ensure participation of officials and forest frontline staff across tiger bearing areas in the state. Transfer and postings in tiger reserves and protected areas during the period may also be avoided at all levels.”Though Govekar has completed his tenure at Pench, the MoEFCC yardstick also applies to him as he has a key role to play in the 2022 estimation.Principal secretary (forest) B Venu Gopal Reddy did not respond to TOI when asked for confirmation about Govekar’s transfer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tatr-field-director-retained-but-pench-fd-govekar-shifted/articleshow/87515056.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Hand sanitizers will be provided at the pandal. We are also requesting 2m social distance. Our open-air pandal at the Slough Cricket Club reduces the risk of contagion,” Bhattacharjee said.Croydon Bengali Connection, too, has returned to its Kali Puja at Bedford Hall in South London after a year’s gap. “After a long fight with Covid, life in London is slowly returning to what we knew as normal. But Covid is still not gone. We are restricting the number of visitors by opening the event on invitation only and ensuring the venue can support distancing guidelines as laid out by the UK government,” said a member.Kali Puja is being celebrated in San Francisco Bay Area as well, at the Fremont Kalibari, which has a permanent deity inspired by Bengal’s Dakshineshwar Bhabatarini idol. “It’s the most popular Kali Puja in the US. Last year, general devotees could not attend due to night curfew. But this year, things are back to normal,” said San Francisco resident Gourav Roy.For Adda, this year’s Puja is special because it is its fifth one. The theme is Barasat, with the lighting and décor resembling Bengal’s Kali Puja hub in the North 24-Paraganas district headquarters. The Slough pandal will have beautiful chandeliers; the street and trees will be lit up. On the cards is an elaborate firecracker show.Apart from lighting, the other attraction there is the “food of harmony”. Apart from heritage Bengali delicacies, the platter will include kochi pathar jhol, dished out by LoveKati from India. Alongside it, Dhaka’s ITS Convenient Food Hall will serve Chittagong’s famous mejwani mangsho and desserts like Dhakai chomchom and Jessore’s nolen gurer payesh. Bhattacharjee said, “The cuisines from both Bengals will spread the message of camaraderie and unity among the community in the wake of the Bangladesh unrest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pujas-abroad-back-after-covid-break/articleshow/87516171.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Blood samples of driver Abdul Rahman, who is recovering in ICU in a city hospital, and the fourth passenger Mohammed Ashique, who continues to be in the ventilator with severe injuries, have been taken and sent for testing. Also, the police have collected the CCTV visuals from the hotel in Fort Kochi, where four of them have attended a function. The CCTV footages from various cameras along the road from Fort Kochi to the spot where the accident occurred too have been collected to verify whether the car was speeding. Meanwhile, police team visited the police surgeon at Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, where the postmortems of Ansi and Anjana were held. Though the autopsy reports are yet to be handed over, police sources said that the multiple injuries suffered by the women during the accident were the cause of death. “Whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol is being checked and we are waiting for the blood test report. Though Rahman is out of danger and recuperating, we are yet to take his statements,” said a police source. The police will also take the statements of the family members of the four passengers to confirm where they were headed after the function. “Though it is learnt that they were heading to Thrissur it is not confirmed. Statements of family members are yet to be taken as we thought it would not be ideal now. What exactly happened would be clear only after we take the statements of the driver,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vyttila-mishap-cops-collect-blood-samples-of-car-driver/articleshow/87516181.cms||---
---||Delhi||SDMC to conduct safety audit of all automated parking facilities in Delhi||NEW DELHI: An internal report of South Delhi Municipal Corporation says that a safety audit of all automated parking facilities will be carried out following the dislocation of a pallet at the multilevel puzzle parking lot in Green Park on Tuesday. According to the report compiled by senior SDMC officials, a Mumbai-based elevator manufacturing company that constructed the Green Park facility is also responsible for operation and maintenance of the parking lot. An official said, “The company is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the tower parking at Green Park for five years and has full responsibility for scheduled inspections of various components of the parking system, including the lift.” A civic official revealed, “The incident occurred while carrying out routine service operation of the parking system. One pallet that holds the parked cars was dislocated from the home position and fell on the lift portion along with two empty pallets,” an official said. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said, “A safety audit was carried out at Green Park three months ago and the report said everything was fine. This incident occurred because of some technical problem. I have directed officials to submit the findings of an inquiry within 10 days. In a swift response, SDMC’s technical team reached the parking facility and restored the operations.” TimesViewThe parking facility was inaugurated last November, barely a year ago. An investigation of the collapse must look into all angles to find out how something like this could have happened.According to another SDMC official, the facility was opened partially for the public on Wednesday. “As of now, tower 1 and 2 are operational and open for use. The two other towers are operational, but the public will be allowed to use those only after a full inspection of the system,” the official said. The parking affected was Delhi’s first fully automated tower car parking lot, which was thrown open for public use on November 25 last year. The parking is designed in a way to keep human interference in slotting parks minimal. So once a vehicle is placed in the lift, it is taken to a vacant available slot and placed on the pallet there automatically. These activities are controlled mechanically through an automated system. Built at the cost of more than Rs 18 crore, the idea was to maximise parking capacity on a limited plot. The parking is 878 sq metres and accommodates 136 cars at a time on 17 floors in each tower. There are four towers at the complex. The incident occurred in one of the towers and damaged a few vehicles parked there. The south corporation had planned to open a few other similar facilities, one in Lajpat Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-conduct-safety-audit-of-all-automated-parking-facilities/articleshow/87517018.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Crowd curbs at Kalighat, Dakshineswar & Belur Math||KOLKATA: Dakshineswar Temple will remain open for 24 hours from 5am on Thursday to 5am on Friday as thousands of devotees are expected to turn up on the temple’s premises to offer their pujas to Ma Bhabatarini for Kali Puja. While restrictions on timings will not be there at Dakshineswar, restricted entry timings will be maintained at Kalighat and Belur Math. The temple committee at Kalighat announced that 10 people will be allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum at a time, maintaining distancing. The temple has sought special assistance from the Kalighat police station to control crowd on Thursday. “Ours is not a Kali Puja but traditionally we have the Mahalakshmi Puja on the night of Kali Puja. Last year the situation was grim but this year we are on a steadier footing. So, we will allow restricted numbers inside the garba griha,” said Kalyan Haldar, treasurer of the committee. Restricted temple timings from 6am to 1pm and then again from 4pm to 8pm will be maintained. “However, looking at the situation, we might extend the closing time by an hour,” Haldar added. Dakshineswar Temple trustees have restricted movement into Panchavati gardens but have allowed people to bathe at the ghat. However, police arrangements have been made so that there is no crowding at the ghat and no one lingers there beyond a few minutes. “We have appealed to the devotees not to loiter into Panchavati and play pranks with fireworks there, which is a regular offence. Cops will help us with this,” said Kushal Chowdhury, trustee. Devotees will have to wear masks and sanitise their hands before they walk in. No flowers will be allowed inside but dry prasad can be offered. The gates of Belur Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, will remain open to devotees on Thursday since the puja will happen only at night. The restricted timings that are being followed now will be maintained. No one will be allowed to sit or lay prostrate to offer ‘pranaam’ and no touching of feet of the monks will be allowed. The puja will happen from 9:30 pm to 4:30 am following old traditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crowd-curbs-at-kalighat-dakshineswar-belur-math/articleshow/87516178.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kochi||Despite ailment, she brings smiles to cancer patients||KOCHI: A degenerative ailment could not dissuade her from doing her bit in bringing smiles on the faces of cancer survivors. Padmapriya P Menon of Tripunithura, who is suffering from cerebral palsy and kyphosis associated with it, has been donating her hair for cancer patients since 2015, when she was studying at St Teresa’s College, Ernakulam. Now, she is all set to donate her locks of hair to Cancerve, a society with cancer survivors as members, on Thursday. “When I got the opportunity to donate my hair in 2015, I discussed it with my father, who wholeheartedly supported me. I love to donate my long hair for making wig for cancer survivors, as long as possible. When I first donated the locks, it was around 32 inches long,” says the 27-year-old, who has difficulty in speaking. Since then she has been donating locks of hair every two years when it grows to 18 inches. She has the complete support of her relatives. Canserve treasurer Ambika Chandranpillai says Padma is the only differently-abled individual donating locks to the society regularly. “Padmapriya was the first to come forward to donate hair when we started the Locks for Help campaign at St Teresa’s College in 2015. She is very passionate to donate her locks. Though we donate hair for cancer survivors, we do not encourage using wig. Our aim is to encourage cancer patients face the disease without fear,” says Ambika. Daughter of Jancy and late Padmakumar P Menon, Padmapriya wishes to continue her studies. “I am getting many job offers. I love to work. But my mother does not allow me to go to work,” says Padmapriya, who has competed her postgraduation in history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-ailment-she-brings-smiles-to-cancer-patients/articleshow/87516174.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||OF FOOD, FAMILY & FIRECRACKERS||TOI readers share their fondest Diwali memories and tell us how the festival of lights – among many other things – is a celebration of life. For most, it is also the time to reconnect with family, friends, and neighbours, who often take a backseat during the rest of the year because of busy work schedules or other commitments. Here’s wishing all our readers a very happy and safe Diwali… For me, Diwali is the time to remove that darkness from our minds and uphold the ethos of Indian traditions at large. It is the time to remind ourselves of the internal diyas lit within us, which can never be put out. It is the time to tell ourselves that we, the young Indians, are the future of this country and the inspiration that we have imbibed from our ancestors should not fizzle out as the years pass by. On this day, I hope we all take a moment to soak in the rich culture and heritage of India and the inherent good in all of us. — Anup Kumar ThatiDiwali is the time to celebrate love, affection, kindness, compassion, empathy, care, and concern for all living beings (not just human beings) including the environment. This festival of lights is not just about decorative pieces and earthen lamps, it is also about ‘lighting’ up our soul with divine energy and illuminating our mind and heart so that we can spread positivity in the entire universe and bring peace and harmony. — Dr M S Krishna KumarPersonally, I love this festival. The joy of meeting friends and relatives and sharing the day with homemade sweets, is inexplicable. Apart from its ethereal nature, the festival is intertwined with economics. No other festival gives such employment opportunities as this. It is a source of livelihood for many people and source of income generation for the country. It is a festival for all, irrespective of age, and gives everybody an opportunity to indulge and enjoy.— Dr V TaramathiThamasoma Jyotirgamaya' -- may the light remove the darkness. It is the absence of light that causes darkness and like any other day, even on Diwali, I would strive to create a pleasant atmosphere among people around me. There will be lights – an expression of tranquility – to ward off all negativities. The last year or more has been tough for all of us because of the pandemic. I hope Diwali marks the beginning of a new world that is free of all the bad that has happened in the past. — Anand MenonDiwali reminds me of my earlier times when we, as children, used to wake up at our uncle's house, take an oil bath, wear new clothes and take blessings of our grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts. Since we were staying in Chennai then, a variety of sweets and savouries of both Telugu and Tamil traditions were prepared in our house. The attraction, though, was the Diwali Lehyam, a medicinal jam type dish prepared by our grandmother. It was one of our favourites. After that there was lakshmi pooja and day-long bursting of firecrackers with relatives and friends. Surely, those childhood days can never be revived. — C K Vinaya ChandraFor me, the essence of Diwali lies in the sloka, tamaso ma jyotirgamaya, which means ‘lead me from darkness to light’. Just as this saying, we too must light the lamp of happiness, the lamp of prosperity and the lamp of knowledge to dispel sorrow, poverty as well as disease. — Philip JoshuaDiwali is a special day for me as I was born on this day. The day is marked with holding a lakshmi pooja at home and friends and relatives pouring in with wishes – both for Diwali and my birthday. Since my childhood, I've got special treatment at home on this day and this year, I hope, will be no different. I also hope to spend time when neighbours as our busy schedules often leave us with little time to interact. — Rama DeviDiwali means different things to different people. For some, it marks the coming back to culture by lending an ear to various mythical stories while for others, it brings happiness home with a newborn. In the Telugu states, it is believed that the day marks the end of Narakasura by the goddess who reincarnated as Satyabhama (Krishna’s wife). This is celebrated as Narka Chaturthi in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and hence we celebrate Diwali as a festival of lights.— Thaneesh ParnaFor me Diwali is unique and special. It is the only day when all members of our family gather at one place and cherish the moment. It is a day when we perform lakshmi pooja, my brother and I help our mom with making sweets, we get new clothes and indulge in all things pleasurable. I still remember how, as a child, I used to steal money from my dad's pocket so that I could buy more crackers. While I do not do that now, I still get curious to find out what my brother has bought me as a Diwali gift. — Ganji Navya VenkatThis is the time of the year when I declutter my mind and wash out as much of the toxicity and negativity as possible. I chose this festival to eradicate frustration, ugliness and all other such things from my inner world to make space for positive things. I also cultivate my heart with happiness, love and forgiveness so that I can connect with God. — Priyanka SarkarDiwali is a celebration and a feast of lights worth watching by all. While crackers have always been an integral part of this festival, over time, cracker manufacturing units have started making horrible sound-producing goods that are dangerous for the health of elders and young people. Different chemicals are used in producing these that also deteriorate the air quality. Such is the case that even the Supreme Court has now issued strict orders against the use of these firecrackers. So, this Diwali, I want people to be mindful and celebrate this beautiful festival with green crackers only. —Katuru Durga prasad RaoIt is Diwali time, This festival is very prime. I celebrate Diwali, With my friends and family. Diwali is the festival of lights, Towards the town it becomes a very bright site. I eat sweets and wear new clothes, I burn off my bad habits and take new oaths. I meet new people and give them gifts, Because of this humanity lives. To make these rituals live forever, I need to learn everything from my mother. If we don’t learn all of this, The future of India will miss the bliss. May Diwali be bright forever, Hope this charm remains forever. — Bhavya MahipalThe spirit of Diwali is strongly etched in my mind as a festival of joy since childhood. I eagerly waited for it, along with my sisters, as our father came home with gifts along with a box of sweets. Unwrapping the gift used to be a moment of great joy. Now, I have taken up that habit and gift others on Diwali. My happiness always multiplies when I bring a smile to others. Cleaning up my home is the most dreaded part in my entire preparation for the festival but now my kids help me with it. I am eagerly waiting to celebrate it this year -- free from apprehensions and fear. I am hoping for it to be a maskfree Diwali where every smile is translucent and pure, shining bright through the hearts of my near and dear ones. — D Kanthi Sudha||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/of-food-family-firecrackers/articleshow/87516238.cms||---

While textile stores and fancy stores were overcrowded, those selling electronic appliances, mobile phones, furniture and jewellery also witnessed good sales. The stretch connecting Town Hall Road and Oppanakara Street was closed for traffic as a large number of shoppers visited shops from morning. Several makeshift shops were set up on stretches of commercial hubs. Oppanakara Street was packed throughout the day. Mill Road, 100 Feet Road, Gandhipuram 5, 6 and 7 streets, Oppanakara Street, Ramamurthy Road, Saramedu Salai, NP Itteri Road, Ellaithottam Junction and Thudiyalur Junction were also crowded. Sowripalayam resident S Karthiga, who visited Cross Cut Road with her two kids, said that her shopping plan was delayed. “My husband got his salary only on Tuesday. Otherwise, we would have completed the shopping early. I am yet to buy crackers and plan to buy them on the way home,” she told TOI. Cracker shops saw good footfall. V Rajesh, a resident of Nanjundapuram, said he had purchased a box of crackers a few days ago. He returned to the shop to buy sparklers on Wednesday evening. Snacks and sweets were also in great demand. People snapped up sweets made of jaggery and palm jaggery as they are healthier than those made of regular refined sugar. People also thronged the flower market. A large number of police personnel were deployed at crowded areas to enhance visible policing and to keep away anti-social elements. The city corporation had set up temporary vaccination camps in crowded areas for the benefit of unvaccinated people. Frequent announcements were made through public announcement systems to urge people to make use of the facility. A health official of the city corporation said that teams formed to check crowds in commercial areas did their part to ensure mask compliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shoppers-choke-streets-for-diwali-purchase/articleshow/87517028.cms||V Devanathan

For crooning bars in Esplanade and Chandni, the extended weekend has rekindled hope of good business. “Even after bars were allowed to reopen, we were not allowed to perform. Many old customers have stopped coming. Diwali is a good occasion for some business,” said the owner of a crooning bar in Chandni. Every year, there is a lull in sales after Durga Puja and business starts picking up around Diwali, and continues till the end of the year. The government doesn’t levy fees till the midnight threshold, after which a certain amount has to be paid for every extended hour. The government has also lifted night restrictions from November 2 to November 5. “We plan to remain open till midnight on Diwali.After Durga Puja, there is a lull in business for over two weeks and it is only around Diwali that it starts picking up. Business has been so bad since March 2020 that we need to compensate,” said the owner of a bar on Park Street. Food-and-beverage outlets are expecting high footfall till Sunday. Stretches around these bars have been decorated and many owners will organise small Pujas in their offices on Thursday. Several business establishments remain shut a day after Diwali, providing a four-day period for people to go out with family and friends. “Though it is a family-oriented festival, old customers still come in. Many also order takeaway,” said Sandeep Sehgal of Broadway Hotel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eye-on-biz-boost-crooning-bars-to-stay-open-till-diwali-midnight/articleshow/87516191.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Pungati said there are over 60 families in his village where he is the first one to take up the science stream. The teenager is happy that he will now be pursuing medical education.He who belongs to ‘Mariya Gond’, a particularly vulnerable tribal group in the state. He lost his mother four years ago. His younger brother is studying in Std X. The student decided to become a doctor after scoring 92% in Std X board exams in 2019.Another tribal student, Sawan Shilaskar (21) from a small village called Ghota in Dahrni taluka of Melghat in Amaravati district, has scored 294 out of 720 in NEET.The journey was tough for both the students due to their limited means, but they saw a ray of hope after coming to know about free coaching classes taken up by MBBS students and doctors in Pune through an NGO called Lift For Upliftment (LFU), founded by students and alumni of the B J Medical College there. “The LFU operates for underprivileged and marginalised students, who do not have access to private coaching,” said its co-founder Dr Ketan Deshmukh.Pungati attended the free coaching classes daily prior to the Covid -19-induced lockdown, and was later forced to attend virtual classes from an ashram school in Hemalkasa in Gadchiroli due to the lack of internet and phone connectivity in his village. Shilaskar, whose father works on someone else’s land and has a meagre earning, came to know about the free coaching classes from his seniors. He mostly studied for NEET from his village with the guidance from LFU mentors online. Deshmukh said they have a special batch named ‘Ulgulaan’ for Melghat students since 2017. “Majority of the mentors at LFU are senior medical students. This year 25 of our students, including three from the tribal regions of Maharashtra, will be taking admissions in medical colleges. Many of those who have received training at the LFU are now studying in medical colleges and some have joined us as teaching faculty,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Dum Dum pandal sets up galleries to showcase Kolkata’s football heritage||Kolkata: Football and the festive season remain two of the most loved passions in Kolkata, and a club in Dum Dum has merged the two to recreate the history of the city’s favourite sport through eight galleries at its Kali Puja pandal. Milan Sangha has come up with one gallery each on the city’s three big clubs — Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammmedan Sporting. It has also set up separate exhibits on the IFA, on footballers from other states who made a mark on the Kolkata Maidan and foreign footballers who made the city their home.There is another gallery on foreign players who visited Kolkata over the last 100 years and another, titled ‘Rajneeti O Football’, depicts the role played by politicians in football over the years.“While most football fans are aware of the big clubs and their performances, not much is known about those who came from other states and turned into stars here. Balaram, Venkatesh, Saleh, Thangaraj — to name a few. Also, the history and the early days of our favourite clubs are not known to the younger generation. Their struggle and early successes are inspiring,” said football historian and statistician Gautam Roy, who wrote the texts for the galleries.He added that several political leaders had played a key role in Kolkata football. “In the 1950s, Bidhan Chandra Roy had once asked the IFA to change the names of the big three clubs. Another politician intervened and stopped the move. We all know how involved Priyaranjan Das Munshi was in football and headed the AIFF. Recently, it was chief minister Mamata Banerjee who arranged a sponsor for East Bengal club allowing it to play the ISL,” said Roy.Milan Sangha secretary Amit Ganguly said, “Pandal-hoppers have rarely come across sport at a pandal. But they are loving it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dum-dum-pandal-sets-up-galleries-to-showcase-kolkatas-football-heritage/articleshow/87516184.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kochi||Wild elephants trigger scare at Ayyampuzha||Kochi: Two persons, including a forest staff, got injured while running for cover on seeing a herd of seven wild elephants at Ayyampuzha panchayat on Wednesday. A worker at Kallala estate of Plantation Corporation of Kerala Ltd got injured when he fell on the road while running and beat forest officer Ibnusha M Abdulla suffered injuries on his leg. Another forest officer had a narrow escape when he fell on creepers when an elephant chased him. Sources said the situation on Wednesday morning was such scary that forest officers had to spend around Rs 6,000 on fire crackers, which were used to chase away the herd. Currently, officers patrol the area in two vehicles as the herd has not crossed FIT Road to enter the forest limit. “Normally this herd used to come up to the premises of Kannimangalam temple. They are usually seen in Malayattoor Kurisumudi area. Local people say that no wild elephant has reached the Kadukunlangara-Pattipara area in the past 40 years,” said an officer. Wild elephants reached Yukkali Kannimangalam Junction last year, after a gap of 20 years. The elephants, which were first spotted in a pineapple cultivated area, roamed around for 35 days. Sources said the area witnessed a drastic shift in cultivation of crops over the past few years,” said a source. Coconut, rambutan, plantain and other crops have replaced cashew trees in the area. Ayyampuzha panchayat president Jomon C U said farmers in 10 acres suffered huge financial loss as the herd wiped out crops in the entire area. “A farmer lost 600 coconut trees in his land.

The survey was launched in the second half of October in which 26,152 teams of the health department are taking part and visiting houses. “So far, the health teams inspected more than 44 lakh houses in the state and found larvae in 1.18 lakh containers,” said Vaibhav Galriya, secretary (health) at the review meeting held under the chairmanship of chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday. The health department has also devised a strategy for conducting intensified anti-larvae activities which are at high risk of spreading vector-borne diseases. “In districts, where more than 5% houses have larvae of mosquitoes, anti-larvae activities will be intensified,” said Galriya. The health department has so far found four districts which need intensified anti-larvae activities. These are Jaipur, Bharatpur, Dholpur and Bikaner. These four districts are at higher risk of spreading dengue. Dengue cases have also been found in Jodhpur and Kota in increased numbers and the health department has decided to intensify the anti-larvae activities in these districts as well. The health department has directed officials to conduct survey of 50 houses daily by each team. Health department is also making use of 1,171 functional fogging machines across the state. District collectors have been directed to make use of the fogging machines effectively by identifying high risk areas in their respective districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mosquito-larvae-found-in-1l-vessels-as-dengue-cases-rise/articleshow/87517658.cms||---

Cops believe the vehicle was bought using the extortion money as accused Arif Ghanchi (27) works as a mechanic at an automobile garage, and Yusuf Ghanchi (36) is the owner of a tea stall. The two had bought the BMW recently. “Yusuf runs a tea stall and Arif works at an automobile garage. With such profiles, it is unlikely that they could buy such a high-end car,” said DCP (Zone-7) Premsukh Delu, adding that as they had bought the car with extortion money, the vehicle was seized. Delu said that the duo extorted money from various persons using several tricks. In one of the cases, they promised to get a man the licence to run a packaging unit for which they took Rs 3.50 lakh from him. In all, they got Rs 31.50 lakh from the trader by by threatening to implicate him in a false police case. Using such tactics, they extorted money from various traders and shopkeepers in Sarkhej area of the city.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Sonarpur man held for JMB link||SONARPUR: The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday night arrested 50-year-old Abdul Mannan for his alleged links with the terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). Mannan, a resident of Atghara, Subhasgram, in Sonarpur was arrested in connection to an ongoing investigation of radicalisation of the youth by the JMB. According to sources, Mannan alias Bachu has ancestral links with Bangladesh’s Barisal. He has been living at Atghara for four years at a rented accommodation. “The case relates to conspiracy of online radicalisation and recruitment of vulnerable Muslim youths by JMB/AQIS (Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent) in India and Bangladesh. The NIA had registered the case on August 6, 2021. Till now, five accused have been arrested,” the agency said in a statement. Searches at Mannan’s residence led to the seizure of electronic devices, fake Indian voter ID cards, Aadhaar cards and other papers used to create identification documents. “The accused was involved in arranging fake Indian identity documents for the terrorists of JMB who had illegally entered India,” the NIA said. In July, Kolkata Police Special Task Force arrested three Bangladeshi nationals — Sk Shabbir, Joseph and Rabiul Islam — who had illegally entered India and were members of a terrorist organisation. They had allegedly hatched a conspiracy with associates to wage war by recruiting and motivating vulnerable Muslim youths against Indian government. They had also tried to establish a ‘Caliphate’ in Bangladesh by removing the democratically elected government and were allegedly propagating their ideology by following, sending and sharing Jihadi texts, posts and videos via a Facebook profile under ‘Sekh Sabbir’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sonarpur-man-held-for-jmb-link/articleshow/87516202.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Like Covid’s delta, dengue’s DEN-2 serotype causing serious health woes||JAIPUR: A specific serotype of dengue virus — DEN-2 — which is known for causing more complications, is taking a toll on the health of people. “Just like Covid’s Delta variant which was causing more complications in comparison to the first wave, the DEN-2 serotype is known for causing more complication as it has tendencies of causing bleeding. According to WHO, DEN 2 is circulating in our country,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, at a review of seasonal diseases heading by chief minister Ashok Gehlot here on Wednesday. He was attending the review meeting as an expert, who advised doctors across the state to identify the symptoms of dengue early and to start treatment according to the protocol to prevent morbidity and mortality. “If a patient complaints of sudden fever up to 104°F, rashes, facial flush, hepatomegaly, non-specific constitutional symptoms, severe muscle aches, retro-orbital pain, the patients should get treatment as a case of dengue-like illness without waiting for dengue positive report. DEN-2 damages liver and patients complain of vomiting,” said Dr Bhandari. In some patients, complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is reported which often occurs with defervesence of fever. DHF has hemorrhagic tendencies include positive tourniquet test dengue, bleeding, thrombocytopenia and evidence of plasma leak. “Such cases require immediate treatment,” said Dr Bhandari. Experts pointed out that if a patient has difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and less than 20°F, increase in heart beat along with fever, such patients should require immediate treatment as they have risk of dengue shock syndrome. First five days of onset of fever is crucial in such cases and proper monitoring is required. Doctors said management of dengue depends upon warning sign. “In OPD, there is a rush of patients. So doctors should decide which patient should be treated on priority basis. Those patients who are coming with warning signs should be kept under close observation and they should get admitted,” Dr Sudhir Mehta, SMS Hospital. SMS Hospital’s Dr Abhishek Agarwal said, “DEN-2 serotype causes serious illness such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Doctors should not depend on rapid card test and they should not wait for authentic test report for providing treatment for dengue. In some cases, platelet count remains normal but they they may have bleeding tendencies. So, doctors should not solely depend on platelet count.” Dr Raman Sharma, Dr RK Gupta and Dr Manish Sharma also presented their suggestions on dengue treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/like-covids-delta-dengues-den-2-serotype-causing-serious-health-woes/articleshow/87517665.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Sex workers reject Diwali gifts from cops||Nagpur: ‘Diwali milan’, organised by the police in the red light area of Ganga Jamuna, faced opposition from sex workers for whom the police had organized the programme on Tuesday.The programme had to be wrapped up hurriedly after the women started reiterating their demand that cops allow sex work there and lift restrictions on engaging customers.On Wednesday, sub-inspector Disha Patil once again visited Ganga Jamuna with some festive gifts to distribute them among the sex workers and their children. While some sex workers stayed away, some women came forward to accept them. Social activist Nutan Rewatkar, who accompanied Patil, said cops had donated from their pocket to arrange new clothes and ration kits.Since August 11 this year, CP Amitesh Kumar has prohibited commercial sex work in Ganga Jamuna putting a question mark on the livelihood of the 2,000- 3,000 sex workers there.The decision faced stiff opposition from a section of activists, who have been crusading for the struggling sex workers.On Tuesday, Lakadganj police had organized a ‘Diwali milan’ programme to distribute sarees, ration and other gifts to the women and their children.As soon as the programme started, a section of the sex workers started raucous protest demanding lifting of the curbs leaving the senior cops like additional CP Navinchandra Reddy, zonal DCP Lohit Matani, senior inspector Parag Pote and others in a fix.A sex worker said the cops cannot justify their action of keeping us away from livelihood for the last three months and then offering us festive gifts. “Most of the women did not take anything from the cops. Handful few accepted it, but those do not belong to our core group which is united against the police action,” she said.According to an eye-witness, some children did accept gifts from the cops, but later returned them after their mothers came to know about it.Senior inspector Pote of Lakadganj police station denied any strong opposition. “Only a handful of women were voicing their angst against the police, but most had wilfully accepted our gesture. At the end, we ran out of gifts and ration kits, and now plan to distribute it again so that more women and their children can be reached,” said Pote, adding some women were inciting others against police, but the majority was in our favour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sex-workers-reject-diwali-gifts-from-cops/articleshow/87515090.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||INFECTED WITH WORRY, INJECTED WITH SPIRIT||The virus may have begun loosening its vice-like grip on our bodies, but it continues to hold captive our minds. Panellists at this month’s TOI Debate — each representing a different faith — discuss how they plan to infuse gaiety while ensuring safety in their festive celebrationsYet another Covid-marred year nears its end. Another festive season beckons. Celebration and caution are often perceived to be inversely related, but that need not always be the case. As academic Perveen Cassad from the Zoroastrian community put it, “The essence of a festival lies not in the way it is celebrated, but in the fact that it is celebrated.” Sustenance of festive spirit notwithstanding, the inability to meet and greet rankles. Representing the Sikh community, entrepreneur Ravleen Singh Khurana said, “Diwali parties have dwindled. The flurry of soirees in the fortnight preceding the festival is now down to a trickle.” Even in the ones that are happening, people are not participating with the same zeal as before, said Khurana. “Everyone is circumspect and staying at arm’s length. Hugging has given way to handshaking. Celebrations have gone online, but emotions can’t be transmitted digitally,” he said. Cassad misses visiting places of worship the most. “You can pray at home, but the effect of entering that positive atmosphere — gathering there, meeting your community — is something else,” she said. Harsha Vekhande from the Jain community said digitalized version of the annual Paryushan event was a success. “Be it bhajans, pooja, recitation of hymns or religious discourse, everything was available at the click of a button,” she stated. In the Buddhist faith, said senior academic Vilas Tabhane, group prayers gave way to household prayers. “The rituals remain the same and the academic teachings still continue, albeit at home,” he explained. As public gatherings bear tremendous importance in Islam, Covid-19 curbs dented devotees’ fervour, said social activist Tanveer Mirza. “Friday namaz and Haj are just two of the many events that used to be attended in large numbers; iftar parties during Ramzan used to be an excuse to socialize. The pandemic hindered all our mingling. Our subconscious now tells us to steer clear of such get-togethers,” he lamented. In humanity’s bid to maintain Covid distancing, Mirza added, we inadvertently adopted ‘social’ distancing, and the interpersonal distance grew. “Woh apnapan nahin raha (the feeling of closeness has gone missing),” he said. The second wave made a huge psychological impact on how the Christian community celebrates its festivals, said Markmanish Hirekan. “People were relatively carefree earlier, but they will now act with restraint,” he said. Academic Mrunalini Dasture said Hindus usually look forward to Diwali festivities as a five-day affair, with visits to a different set of relatives on each day, but this time around both — the hosts and guests — are anxious about such plans. “There is no change in rituals, but the fellow feeling is not there. The altered circumstances have altered our mindset,” said Dasture. In addition to religious festivals, community events have taken a hit too. Cassad said Navjote (ritual for an individual’s induction into Zoroastrianism) ceremonies, which are “as good as a wedding” for the community, were conspicuous by their absence. “There have been none in Nagpur so far, and we are keeping our fingers crossed that the three ceremonies slated in December materialize,” she said. Khurana said the Sunday langars (community kitchen serving free meals) at gurudwaras were missed. “We started delivering food packets to the needy instead, which encapsulates the essence of that activity,” he added. Mirza said children and the elderly too were bearing the brunt of restrictions. “As it is, kids are grappling with online classes. Apart from school, festivals used to be an opportunity for them to meet their near and dear ones. While middle-aged people still step out every now and then, the younger ones and seniors are being deprived of that togetherness,” he added. Mirza further said ijtemas (Islamic congregations) generally organized to propagate Prophet Muhammad’s teachings had completely stopped. Vekhande said knowledge-sharing sessions were now being conducted in Jain homes (instead of temples) to alleviate the situation. Like for every other sphere of life, the panellists agreed that religion too will have to forge a new path amid the ‘new normal’. “People now surf the Internet to listen to Golden Temple kirtans from all over the globe. Online is the way ahead,” Khurana said. He added that the Sikh tenet of seva (service) will hold the community in good stead in the future. “To truly commemorate Guru Nanak’s teachings, one must practise seva. The scope to serve is unprecedented in a pandemic, be it through oxygen langars or distributing food,” he said. Cassad reiterated the role of digital media in connecting people. “We could never attend funerals or marriages in other parts of the world earlier. In the post-pandemic online era, we can,” she said. In addition to celebrating together digitally, Tabhane said the pandemic has taught people to pay homage online. Vekhande added, “Lots of devotees from the present generation are moving to different parts of world for professional and personal reasons. They can connect from anywhere now. This should be continued even after the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/infected-with-worry-injected-with-spirit/articleshow/87516214.cms||---

Addressing a review meet here on Wednesday, Gehlot said, “Why do we need to hide dengue death figures? If doctors show carelessness, it will automatically come to light. During the Covid first and second waves too, we had said that we did not have any tradition of hiding figures,” said Gehlot. “Some newspapers have published that the figures were deliberately suppressed. We don’t have to hide anything. More the figures are accurate, more will be the effectiveness of the disease management. On the basis of the figures, government takes decisions. On the basis of the figures, steps at the local level are figured, even budget sorted and even key decisions are taken,” said Gehlot. Citing examples, the chief minister said, "We have a complaint with the Centre for hiding the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) before 2019 elections because the figures of unemployment were against them. It drew a lot of criticism and lot of articles were published." He said how would experts plan the future if figures remain hidden. Gehlot said it was for the first time that he heard about dengue spreading at such a large scale. tnn "Doctors kept telling me that it is for the first time that dengue attacked the state at that level. In UP’s Firozabad, when it was first reported this year, 70 people had died. Since then, the Rajasthan government decided to take preventive measures in advance," said Gehlot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dont-conceal-figures-gehlot/articleshow/87517676.cms||---

The culprits must be punished, AAP functionaries demanded on Wednesday. MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said that before the assembly elections, the parking was hurriedly inaugurated in January 2020 by Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, and the 17-storey facility was made without a safety audit in the densely populated area of Green Park. At a press conference, also addressed by MLAs Atishi and Somnath Bharti, Atishi claimed that the incident was clear proof of BJP’s corruption. It must be investigated which contractor and officer were given the responsibility of its construction and what their link is with BJP functionaries, Atishi demanded. Bharadwaj said Rs 19 crore was spent in building the facility at a place where it was not much needed and the complex wasn’t even being used properly. Since no one was willing to park there, the surface-level parking charges were increased, the MLA said. Atishi also alleged, “The corporation was fulfilling its responsibility of providing parking space by building structures in areas that didn’t need them and even these buildings were of such a poor quality that within a year, the structure fell apart.” She demanded, “All those present at the inauguration need to answer why this structure could not even last a year.” Bharti demanded that an independent investigation under the Supreme Court be conducted. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP functionaries had crossed all limits in making baseless allegations. “The Green Park parking is operational, and it only faced a mechanical breakdown that was rectified in less than half a day. They should have checked facts before levelling false allegations and should now come forward to apologise to the South corporation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parking-lot-opened-hurriedly-with-polls-in-mind-alleges-aap/articleshow/87517042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Suman Devi, an earthen lamp seller at Chaura Raasta, said. "Earlier, customers used to purchase 500 to 1,000 diyas at a time. Now, I start feeling lucky if I get to sell even 100." Another diya seller, Kishore Kumar from Johri market, said people were not keen on putting oil or ghee in the diyas. He said, "It is a tedious job to prepare diyas for Diwali. Instead of earthen lamps, wax diyas are feasible. They even come in attractive shapes which woo customers." With low demand, diya-makers are not doing well financially. Mahesh Kumhar, a diya maker from a nearby village, said his wares were not doing as well as they used to."Earlier, electric lights had impacted our business. But with different types of candles, people now have options. Moreover, earthen lamps are expensive as compared to wax diyas. Due to transportation and making charges, now 100 diyas cost Rs 100. You can get better wax diyas at lesser prices," said Kumhar. In different corners of the Walled City and other markets of Jaipur, diya sellers have set up their shops. According to traders, with the decline in Covid cases, the business is picking up as people are venturing out of their houses. The earthen lamps or diyas will be needed for the Lakshmi Puja during Diwali, but most of traders think the future is grim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/earthen-lamp-sales-dip-due-to-cheaper-options-in-market/articleshow/87517684.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

From seeing him with severe burns to now leading a normal life, it gives me a lot of satisfaction,” says Dr Reddy who spends most Diwalis not with his wife and a 12-year-old daughter but with their patients. “As a critical care doctor, I cannot celebrate Diwali when I know there are sick patients in the ICU who need me more. Taking care of those patients gives me more happiness than anything else,” says Dr Reddy. In his 11 years with Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills he has spent only five Diwalis at home. NAME: Geedi VasaviJOB: Sub-InspectorWhen the rest of the world steps out in all their finery to celebrate with family and friends, Geedi Vasavi will most likely be sitting at her desk, dressed in her khakis – perhaps with not a soul around. She could also be patrolling around town to ensure it’s a safe night of celebration for others. Sounds depressing? Not to this sub-inspector from Banjara Hills who puts her work before everything else. “This is the life I have chosen for myself, and I am very content. I have trained hard to maintain law and order – so that people in my jurisdiction can be at peace -- and that responsibility is more important than everything else; even festivals,” says the young officer who has been in service for little over two years now. Also, there are always those kind souls walking into the police station with wishes and goodies. “Last year too I was on duty on Diwali day. There were many civilians who came with food and shared their joy with us. That’s the best gift someone in my line of work can ask for,” adds Vasani reminiscing those days with her family in Mahbubnagar when Diwali was about getting together for Lakshmi puja, food and meet-up with relatives. NAME: P GovindJOB: Leading firemanFor the last 11 years, P Govind’s Diwali routine has been much the same. “I leave home in the morning on Diwali day and come back only the next morning,” the 41-year-old leading fireman from Moulali fire station says. He is among the thousands of fire-fighters in the city who proudly don their uniform on Diwali day and stay ready to attend to emergency calls. “I feel it is my duty to help people, rescue lives and save properties. I only hope to have fewer accidents every year,” says Govind who has witnessed many minor and major fire accidents in the last one decade. He vividly remembers a fire that broke out in an industrial area in 2013. “In a tyre company, the security guards had lit some diyas in their cabin left by late evening. Due to movement of some rats, the diyas fell inside the cabin and led to a massive fire. While there was no loss of life, it led to serious loss of property,” recalls Govind. So, does he miss his wife and 10-year-old son on this day? “I do. And if I manage to find some time during my duty hours, I make a video call for a few minutes to them,” he adds. NAME: Bijoy PadhihariJOB: Senior CaptainAmid the pandemic in 2020, he spent Diwali in Khammam setting up a kitchen for an entrepreneur. This year, he will be waiting tables and running his team at the AnTeRa Kitchen & Bar in Jubilee Hills. “I have spent the last many Diwalis working – first serving on a cruise and then a star hotel in Hyderabad,” 25-year-old Bijoy Padhihari from Odisha says, sans any strain of unhappiness. “It is great to see people come out and enjoy a hearty meal that we serve them. Also, the guests and hotel staff, wherever I have worked, have been very kind and thoughtful. There have always been celebrations at the end of the workday with food and firecrackers. So, even though I miss being home with my parents and sisters for the festival, I never feel left out or lonely,” says Bijoy who might be putting in about nine-hours of work this Diwali. About home, he remembers the day being spent making sweets, sitting down for puja and then getting together for some fireworks. “Now, this is my home away from home and I try to make the most of it,” he adds.

In my opinion, even in his absence, the commission will continue to probe into the charges levelled by him against then home minister Anil Deshmukh. Since, Singh has refused to appear before the commission, it will examine Deshmukh, dismissed API Sachin Waze, Sanjay Palande and others as per the provisions of the commission of inquiry Act,’’ a senior lawyer said. TOI was the first to report on October 23 on the affidavit filed by Singh, who has not responded to several summons and is believed to be untraceable. The lawyer made it clear it does not mean Singh has withdrawn his complaint. “He will not appear before the commission and cross examine any of the witnesses,” he said. Mahesh Panchal, the constituted attorney, had told the commission on October 13: “Since all that was required to be disclosed had been disclosed by Param Bir Singh to the CM and the Supreme Court has taken note of the same, he has nothing more to add than what has been stated in his letter dated March 20 addressed to the CM.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-has-no-more-proof-to-offer-probe-to-continue/articleshow/87517049.cms||---

---||Delhi||Kerala board: Plea against DU move to consider only XII marks||New Delhi: Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) has approached Delhi High Court challenging the varsity’s decision to consider only XII standard marks for admission of students from Kerala state board, which determines the grades by combining marks of classes XI and XII. Justice Prateek Jalan asked the counsel for DUSU to satisfy the court on the union’s locus standi in filing this petition on the next date of hearing on November 10. As the counsel for the university was not present at the hearing, the court asked DUSU counsel Ashish Dixit to serve the petition copy to him. DUSU, in its plea, said it was approaching the high court against the “arbitrary, irrational and unfair conduct” of authorities, which have violated the fundamental and legal rights of innumerable students. It said that in terms of the consistent policy, certain state boards including Directorate of General Education (Higher Secondary Wing), Government of Kerala, gives combined marks of both XI and XII standard on the mark sheets. The policy explicitly states that to determine grades of students, combined marks of both XI and XII shall be considered, it said. The petition, filed through advocate Ashish Dixit, said DU for several years correspondingly incorporated provision in admission bulletin stating that in cases where state boards publish marks of both XI and XII standard, merit of students shall be determined on the basis of such consolidated mark sheets. “The respondent no. 2 (DU) has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided in its admission process of 2021-2022 that students would only be required to fill marks of XII standard. When the admissions began for the sessions 2021-2022, the colleges raised and conveyed objections with regard to mark sheets containing marks of both XI and XII,” it said. The plea added that initially, the university directed that such cases be kept on hold, however, within a few hours, the admissions office of DU circulated an email to colleges asserting that the Admission Advisory Committee has decided that only marks of XII standard shall be considered.

The pre-Diwali announcement came as a massive relief for people with petrol prices having touched a high of Rs 106.96 per litre in UP on Wednesday and diesel at Rs 98.91 per litre. From Thursday, petrol will be available at Rs 94.96 per litre and diesel at Rs 86.91 per litre. Recently, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had held a few meetings to discuss the possibility of reducing VAT on fuel but discussions remained inconclusive. Senior officials said the matter had been under consideration and it was decided that the government would wait till the Centre takes a call on the matter. “The Centre has reduced the cost of petrol by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 10 per litre. UP has slashed taxes by Rs 7 per litre on petrol and Rs 2 per litre on diesel, effectively bringing down the price of both by Rs 12 per litre,” a government spokesperson said. Another government official said the decision to slash VAT on fuel was held back leaving for the Centre to take a decision first.  “There was pressure on states to bring down prices even further in view of the continuous rise over the last several months. More states are likely to announce cuts over the next few days,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/petrol-diesel-to-be-cheaper-by-rs-12-from-today/articleshow/87517690.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Women drive scooter boom after Covid curbs mobility||VISAKHAPATNAM: Driven by various reasons including the Covid-19 pandemic, more and more women are getting behind the wheel in Visakhapatnam district. Unlike in the past when women shied away from driving, students, professionals, and homemakers are now taking the driver’s seat mainly due to convenience. In the past three years, around 1.36 lakh driving licences were issued in Vizag and of them, over 70,000 were given to women. The number of women securing driving licences (DL) is on the rise as people look for safe travelling options in the backdrop of the pandemic. This has pushed the sales of two-wheelers. Working women prefer their own two-wheelers to public transport. Speaking to TOI, deputy transport commissioner (Vizag), GC Raja Ratnam said as Vizag city is a cosmopolitan, socio-cultural hub, there has been an increase in the number of women seeking driving licences. Gearless vehicles and Covid-19 travel curbs fuelled the trend. The number of women with a DL in Vizag increased by 30 to 40 per cent in the past few years mainly because of the jump in the number of working women, he added. “Around five years ago, over 40,000 women had a DL in Vizag city. That time girls (students) were reluctant to obtain a licence and their parents were not supportive. Now, the trend has changed and a good number of women are coming forward to obtain a DL,” officials in the transport department observed. The hassles of the public transportation system and the Covid-19 restrictions have forced many women to go for gearless two-wheelers. “My husband is working in the medical and health sector and I can’t rely on him when it comes to going to my workplace or shopping. I used to wait for him earlier and I struggled to travel using public transport. Finally, I took a licence and bought a scooty. Now life has become easier and I can reach my school on time, said NH Mani, a teacher in Vizag city. ADCP (Traffic), Vizag, Ch Adinarayana said women riders are generally more cautious than their male counterparts. “Hardly two to four per cent of women motorists are found to be violating traffic norms such as non-wearing of helmets, wrong parking and other offences,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/women-drive-scooter-boom-after-covid-curbs-mobility/articleshow/87515110.cms||Nalla.Babu

Decorative items such as wall-hangings, curtains, fairy lights, Jaipuri shoes and diyas are in great demand. Several shopkeepers are even providing home delivery. They are sending photos of the items along with the prices via WhatsApp and they are delivering approved items to people’s houses. Vicky Chelani, secretary of Bapu Market Traders Association, said, "We are delivering within the city. Many people avoid coming to the Walled City due to traffic. So, we provide the designs of salwars and kurtas through WhatsApp and get orders." Sellers of Diwali puja items have set up their stalls on the roadside. They said the sale was good this year, but it will take time to match up to the pre-pandemic era. Kishan Lal, who sells kheel, batashe and stickers of Lakshmi-Ganesh, said sales were slowly picking up. "After more than a year, people are venturing out of their houses and purchasing. I sell all pooja products and my routine customers are beginning to come," said Kishan Lal. Jaipur Vyapar Mandal president Subhash Goyal said they were expecting good tourism in the city after Diwali. "Almost all hotels are booked and if the number of tourists will increase, sales too will. Hawa Mahal, Johri market and Bapu Market are dependent on tourism revenue."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-hope-for-a-cracking-diwali-as-covid-abates/articleshow/87517687.cms||---

The historic legislation is co-sponsored by a number of lawmakers including Indian-American Congresswoman Raja Krishnamoorthi, Krishnamoorthi has also introduced a resolution in the US Congress recognising the religious and historical significance of Diwali. Maloney said that Diwali this year symbolises the nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of Covid-19. “I am very proud to celebrate with you the victory of light over darkness, the triumph of good over evil and the pursuit of knowledge over ignorance as we do every day. It is truly appropriate that Diwali this year symbolises our nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of Covid-19 and the terrible effects that Democrat depended on the people of our nation,” she said. “Celebrations like Diwali speak to the core of what we all desire for our nation to be a beacon of happiness, healing, learning and light and uncertain times. My colleagues, Indian-American community leaders and I believe that there is no better time to enshrine Diwali as a federal holiday than in the wake of this terrible dark pandemic,” Maloney said. Powerful Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, supported the legislation. “This is something that should be shared with all of us In American society. It's a good day, because we're talking about light over darkness. And that's what this is about,” Meeks said. The House Foreign Affairs Committee will be supporting this and advocating and moving forward with this great bill, he said. Krishnamoorthi said: “On this holiday of Diwali, we should say, be the light you wish to see in the world. Be the light in your community that is needed to dispel the darkness. Be the light in this community that brings hope to the hopeless. Let us be the light that helps the last, the least and the last.” “That is what Diwali is about. And that is why Diwali needs to be a federal holiday,” Krishnamoorthi said, adding that Diwali is also about celebrating Indian-Americans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/diwali-day-act-introduced-in-us-congress-to-declare-festival-of-lights-as-federal-holiday/articleshow/87518584.cms||---

Unlike last year when there was no opportunity for the inmates to make candles owing to the Covid-induced restrictions, children have prepared over 4,000 of them this Diwali. Adding gloss to the happy faces, visitors from social organisations, educational institutions, women’s groups and families will visit the home on Thursday to celebrate Diwali with the inmates by distributing sweets and lighting diyas. “There was no candle-making in 2020 besides no visitor was allowed entry due to which the excitement and happiness was missing during last Diwali,” said Sister Philomena, in-charge of Cheshire Home, Sundernagar. Institutions like XITE College, Gamhari, XLRI School of Management, a few women’s groups and six city-based families have placed orders for the candles, while they would also be celebrating the festival with the children. “Guests are arriving to collect the candles which they ordered and several are carrying sweets and crackers to celebrate the festival with our children,” noted Sr Philomena. She said no corporate house, bank or commercial institution placed orders for candles this Diwali unlike previous years. “The organisations might have thought that we are not taking orders for candles owing to Covid,” the home in-charge said. Decked up with colourful lights, decorative items and Rangoli, Cheshire Home inmates said this year Diwali is going to be joyful. “Celebrations would be muted but preparations have started. We are happy and excited,” said Anita, an inmate. Gabriela, an inmate with 40 per cent mental disability, who was proactively involved in making candles, is happy that the product found buyers. For Diwali, inmates have planned special prayers to implore the Almighty to wipe out the coronavirus pandemic and usher in the good old days. “Cheshire Home prays for the good old days to return fast. We hope our prayers would be answered,” Sr Philomena said. Philanthropist Pappu Sardar, a regular visitor to Cheshire Home, said Diwali and Christmas are two important occasions that the inmates are excited about. “Delighted to know that Diwali enthusiasm has gripped Cheshire Home. Need to be careful in our celebration as Covid has not gone yet,” said Sardar, who is popular as a fan of actor Madhuri Dixit Nene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/diwali-cheer-at-cheshire-home/articleshow/87515714.cms||B Sridhar

His remark comes in the backdrop of the state government allegedly not showing any interest in setting up a proposed Sainik school in Godda district ‘despite the Centre pushing for it’. In May 2018, the former BJP-led government had requested the Centre for sanctioning of another Sainik school at Thakurgangti block in Godda, in addition to the one that exists in Koderma district. Recently, Dubey allegedly received a letter from Union defence minister Rajnath Singh in response to the former’s query about the Sainik school in his constituency. In the letter, it was stated that the state government did not respond to at least half a dozen letters sent by his ministry in this regard. “I got a letter from Singh’s office on October 27 in response to my query raised in Lok Sabha in August this year in which it was said that the defence ministry is yet to receive any reply from the state government for executing a memorandum of agreement to confirm the necessary financial commitment, including construction of buildings and other infrastructural facilities, for the school,” Dubey said. He added, “Since 2019, the Centre wrote to the state several times but it hasn’t received any reply yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dubey-slams-govt-for-not-setting-up-godda-school/articleshow/87515795.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He gave his consent and urged his granddaughters to finish the unfinished works of their father (Durga),” Sita told a news portal on Wednesday. On Tuesday, DSS president Vijayshree penned an open letter to her chacha (uncle) Hemant and pressed for honour and recognition for the statehood movement's activists on this year's statehood day (November 15). "Statehood movement's activists have been waiting for long for their due recognition. Many have died. I urge that the government provide them with commemorative plaques, certificates of recognition and pension on the occasion of statehood day," the letter read. The incumbent Hemant Soren government earlier this year constituted a three-member committee to screen the authenticity of close to 5,000 applications which were received by the previous panel. The state cabinet had in February approved a proposal to hike the monthly pension of those who were part of a separate statehood movement and served jail term in between three months and over 6 years. Under the new slabs, those who served jail terms up to three months will receive a monthly pension of Rs 3,500, while those who served jail terms up to five years will get Rs 5,000. Those who served more than six years in jail will get Rs 7,000 each month.  That apart, the kin of those, who were in jail or suffered physical handicap of 40% or more during their jail term, will be eligible for direct recruitment in grade III and IV jobs of the state government as per their educational qualifications or through 5% reservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/new-outfit-durga-soren-sena-has-shibus-consent-sita/articleshow/87515771.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Jharkhand, tribal artisans, mostly women in different Adivasi-dominated pockets since ages, are engaged in crafting daily decorative items but were often starved of right market and exposure. The Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS), which works on livelihood promotion by engaging women in a host of activities through capacity building, has stepped up efforts to provide dedicated markets to them. On Tuesday, JSLPS formally announced the jewellery brand on the occasion of Dhanteras to sell different kinds of jewellery made by the women self-help groups and patronised by Palash Mart, JSLPS’s flagship stores launched last year. Officials said Palash Mart at JSLPS’s Hehal office has begun sale since the launch and the products will soon be put up at its other units. JSLPS’s CEO Nancy Sahay said Adiva is an addition to the product diversity undertaken by them to upgrade offerings at Palash Mmart. “JSLPS mostly works with generating livelihoods at the grassroots through different interventions. One of the shining features of our job is also to work towards women empowerment. Adiva is in addition to the bouquet of items which will now be available at Palash Marts,” she said, adding that tribal women in different parts of the state have long been making traditional jewelry using different motifs. “Putting them under a brand name will provide them greater visibility and market reach,” she said. Another official said the jewellery collection ranges from bracelets to chains, bangles, earrings among others. “They are made of brass, bellmetal and other natural motifs used by the tribals in their daily use,” he said, adding that the prices range from Rs 100 and above. Hailing the move, an artisan, Yashoda Devi of Khunti, who is associated with JSLPS, said, “We now hope that our products will get proper markets and price. Most importantly, it will also help proper conservation of the indigenous art form of jewellery making.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-unveils-adiva-its-own-tribal-jewellery-brand/articleshow/87515661.cms||ASRP Mukesh

State health minister Banna Gupta along with deputy commissioners of eight districts which have lagged behind in vaccination coverage joined the virtual meeting with the Prime Minister. Talking to TOI, Gupta said, “We have made satisfactory progress in vaccination drive against all odds and we are committed to improve it. We are hopeful that will be able to cross 90% vaccination of first dosage by November end.” Asked why Jharkhand is lagging behind the national coverage by 14% Gupta said, “We have had irregular supply of vaccine doses in the early days as a result of which many a time our vaccination programmes were suspended. However, our teams have really worked hard and now that we have enough doses we will ensure that we are able to extend the coverage.” Eight districts which were identified as low performers in Jharkhand included Deoghar, Garhwa, Giridih, Godda, Latehar, Pakur, Sahebganj and West Singhbhum and the respective deputy commissioners also attended the meeting and presented the challenges which led to less coverage and their plans to improve the figures. According to the state health department vaccination data (till November 2), Garhwa was the worst-performing district among the eight with coverage of a mere 47.78% first dose and 15.99% second dose. Pakur was the best performing among the eight districts with 58.09% first dose and 17.11% second dose administration. Garhwa DC Rajesh Pathak said, “The vaccination coverage in district suffered for lack of awareness, large migratory population and rainy season as the teams couldn’t reach the far-flung areas. However, we are going to cover the areas in multi-modal way which include Har Ghar Dastak programme and tika express vans.” Pakur DC Varun Ranjan said the vaccination coverage was satisfactory and they weren’t able to organise mass vaccination drives because of irregular supply of doses. Now that they have enough vaccines, they are already running mass vaccination drives which has led to an increase of 2% from existing data as it stands at 60% on Wednesday. “Our teams have been able to vaccinate more than 20,000 in the last three days,” he said. Cumulatively Jharkhand has administered 2,07,99,296 doses of which 1,50,12,617 have received the first dose while 57,12,617 have got the second. These have been administered across 7,045 vaccination centres of which 6,729 are government-run and 316 are private.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rain-erratic-supply-of-dose-and-festivals-blamed-for-poor-vax-coverage-in-jharkhand/articleshow/87515673.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The yellow metal prices have gone down by Rs450 a tola in the local market, with silver taking a bigger hit of Rs2,800 a kg. On Wednesday morning, gold was at Rs49,050 a tola and silver Rs64,200 a kg. By evening, gold rates further slid by Rs50, reaching Rs49,000 a tola. On the other hand, there was improvement of over Rs1,500-odd in silver prices, which still ended on the lower side. The rates are compiled by the Nagpur Sarafa Association, a local jewellers’ guild. The fall in prices comes after Dhanteras, considered an auspicious day to buy gold by the Indian retail consumers. However, even as customers hope that the rates may go up during the festive season, both gold and silver have become cheaper. Traders say despite much of the retail buying in the country, the Indian demand does not move the market. The rates have gone up in anticipation of the US Fed meet over tapering of bond-buying. Nilesh Rathi, an independent observer of the bullion market, said US Fed is expected to taper its bond purchases. This means the government buying of bonds may reduce, which in turn may make the securities costlier. Gold rates are inversely related to this. Rajesh Thakkar, a wholesaler from Akola, said likelihood of Fed rate hike is expected to make bonds more attractive than bullion. This would lead to funds shift to the securities from yellow metal in the global market. This brings down gold prices. Last year, the rates had gone up following Dhanteras, but the year before, the prices were down. This is part of the fluctuations in the international market, said Nitin Khandelwal, a bullion trader from Akola. Pawan Rokde, a jeweller in Hingna, said after Dhanteras, further retail buying is expected for the marriage season, which would last till June-July. Few takers despite surplus liquidity with pvt lenders Amid businesses appearing to normalize post Covid, private financiers in the city say the market is left with surplus liquidity. At present, private financing rates are in the range of 10.5% to 12%, excluding brokerage. In the normal course, the rates are in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. The brokerage charges range from 0.6% to 1.2% and even 1.8% at times. Private lending or Hundis are a parallel banking system used by the traders. The rates are low because the financiers have funds to lend, but there are not many takers. Funds are taken by the traders to meet working capital requirements. Considering the uncertain market situation, even businessmen are vary of building up inventory leading to a low demand for funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-after-dhanteras-gold-and-silver-slide/articleshow/87516270.cms||Shishir Arya

No entry in govt offices, no pay for staff||NAGPUR: Targeting 100% coverage by this month end, district collector Vimala R on Wednesday literally made vaccination compulsory for gaining entry into government establishments, attending in-person classes in senior colleges and availing benefits of different schemes. Directives have also been issued to withhold salaries of unvaccinated government employees. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) too is likely to issue a impose similar conditions. Till November 2, 81.79% eligible persons have taken the first dose and 39.97% their second dose in the district. Vimala told TOI that an order to this effect will be issued on Monday. The resident deputy collector has already issued a letter to departments regarding the decision,” she said. The decision was taken following a meeting of district and civic officials with chief minister Uddav Thackeray on Tuesday. “Other districts too have taken similar decisions. Now, only 20% eligible citizens are yet to take the first dose in Nagpur district,” she said. Citizens who haven’t taken their second dose even after a gap of 84 days too shall be barred entry in government offices, a statement issued by district information office read. Those vaccinated with the first dose and yet to complete 84 days, as required for Covishield jab, are exempted from the diktat. “The measure is like an incentive to get people vaccinated. Private establishments too should make it compulsory,” Vimala said. On the eve of Diwali, the collector also released a video advising citizens to exercise caution as the threat of Covid is still not over. “New cases are still surfacing daily in the district. We need to keep using mask. I am fully vaccinated. Now, I am initiating this campaign. Unvaccinated people will not be allowed in my office from now on. I have also asked all government employees coming in contact with public to be fully vaccinated,” she said. The decision was announced following a meeting of department heads of all central, state governments, semi-government establishments at Bachat Bhavan on Wednesday. It was attended by the collector, ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, divisional deputy commissioner Ankush Kedar, civil surgeon Devendra Paturkar, district health officer Deepak Selokar, and additional district collector Yogesh Pandey. The release also stated that the second dose is mandatory for employees to attend any government meeting, availing benefits of government schemes, health services, government and private hospitals. The administration should made it compulsory for students above 18 to be vaccinated for attending in-person classes or participation in college activities, the release stated. Private establishments too have been advised to ensure vaccination while hiring and also of those already working with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-jabbed-no-entry-in-govt-offices-no-pay-for-staff/articleshow/87516303.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The driver and his assistant, who were allegedly transporting the crackers from Rajasthan, have been arrested, police said. The sale and burning of firecrackers have been banned both in the capital and in NCR cities because of high pollution levels but, as reported by TOI on Wednesday, its sales continued in the black market with orders being taken online and being delivered to local dealers and even to homes of individuals. According to police, the Sector 10 crime unit had received a tip-off that a truck loaded with firecrackers was parked in the Shivaji Nagar area. On reaching the spot, however, the cops found the truck was carrying grocery items. “We had credible information but did not have details like the vehicle’s registration number and its make. So, we searched the area and checked all the loaded trucks in the vicinity and finally spotted one parked near a godown. On checking, we found the vehicle was loaded with over 500 kg firecrackers packed in plastic bags. The entire truck was covered with a plastic sheet,” a police officer said. Assistant commissioner of police (crime) Preet Pal Sagwan told TOI that the consignment was to be delivered at five different locations in Delhi. “The accused had planned to cross into the capital after midnight. As the sale of crackers is banned in Delhi-NCR, people have resorted to smuggling them from nearby districts and states,” the ACP said, adding that the police were trying to find out if the supplier had a valid licence to sell and supply firecrackers. A case has been also registered under IPC Section 188 (disobedience to an order lawfully promulgated by a public servant) and The Explosives Act at Shivaji Nagar police station. After the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) imposed a “complete ban” on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers till January 1, 2022, the Haryana government on October 31 imposed similar restrictions in its 14 districts that come under the National Capital Region (NCR), including Gurugram, to combat rising air pollution. All police stations across Gurugram have been directed to crack down illegal sale and burning of firecrackers on Diwali. Teams from respective police stations have also been directed to make rounds in areas under their jurisdiction during the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/truck-headed-to-delhi-with-500kg-crackers-seized-in-gurgaon-two-arrested/articleshow/87517871.cms||---

The reports appearing in a section of the media about property attachment are incorrect and contradictory to facts,” he said in a statement. “The I-T department has sought clarification on certain issues. We will reply to that letter. We will take whatever legal and administrative action (is) required,” he added. As per reports, the properties attached included an office of Pawar’s son Parth. NCP has strongly criticised the I-T action, saying it is politically motivated and an attempt to destabilise the MVA government.

---||Goa||Goa: Paddy farmers rue losses due to post-monsoon rainfall||PANAJI: Freshly harvested paddy and budding mango flowers are facing the brunt of the off-season showers. The post-monsoon showers came in short intense spells at some places like Bardez and Tiswadi while agricultural farms in Sattari experienced continuous heavy rainfall for nearly two hours on Monday night. “It’s been overcast in Sattari from the past few days and this has especially damaged the rice that was kept for drying post-harvest. We have lost most of the standing crop and will have to discard it and perhaps mulch it to make manure,” a Sattari-based farmer said. The India meteorological department (IMD) had warned of a low-pressure area over the Lakshadweep adjoining southeast Arabian Sea. It is likely to move north northwestwards and become more marked during the next three days. This system is likely to increase rainfall and thunderstorm activity accompanied with lightning. Though winter has not officially set in, some farms are already seeing early mango flowering. The crop needs enough stress in the winters to facilitate flowering. “It should ideally stop raining in October for the winter crops to flourish. However, we are in November and it is still raining. Though the early flowers may get affected, we can hope for them to reflower once winter properly sets in. If it flowers again by January, I shall get my crop by May. However, if it is later, the crop will stretch through the monsoons like it did this year,” farmer Nestor Rangel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/paddy-farmers-rue-losses-due-to-post-monsoon-rainfall/articleshow/87516657.cms||Nida Sayed

The awareness it kindled eventually landed her a spot as the youngest finalist for the inaugural Earthshot Prize launched by Britain’s Prince William in October last year. “My generation will live to see the consequences of our actions today. You are deciding whether or not we will have a chance to live in an inhabitable world, whether or not we are worth fighting for, worth supporting,” the 15-year-old from Tiruvannamalai told world leaders at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, at Glasgow on Tuesday. What got her there was Iron-Max, a mobile ironing cart she designed that uses solar energy instead of charcoal. This story began when she was 12 and walking home from school. Along the way, she saw a man discard a heap of burnt charcoal he had used for ironing clothes. She spotted several more ironing carts, and began to wonder, just how much pollution the manufacture and use of charcoal caused. There are an estimated 10 million ironing carts in India using charcoal, according to the government. “I spent hours after school researching and reading online and after six months came up with the plan for the solar ironing cart.

As many as 180 farmers were affected after their fields got submerged due to the alleged haphazard highway expansion work along the Green Park stretch. Only 11 have received Rs 5,000 each from Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, so far. Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza and his counterpart from Saligao, Jayesh Salgaonkar, had conducted an inspection when part of Guirim went under water. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had subsequently met the farmers and assured them that they would be compensated for crop damage, they said. The Guirim panchayat had even written to the chief minister about the need for compensation to the affected farmers. Panch Sunny Nanodkar said the panchayat had apprised the chief minister and the local MLA about the flooding along the Green Park stretch due to the expansion of the national highway. It was also alleged that the cross-drain had been clogged with construction material. “This led to flooding and crop damage in the wards of Guirim, Servem, Vancio, and Kumyamorod,” Fondu Naik, a farmer, said. Ramesh Lingudkar, another farmer, alleged that there was discrimination where doling out compensation was concerned. “I have spoken to the zilla panchayat member, but he is only giving assurances. Cheques were given only to those affected farmers who support the ruling party,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/most-guirim-farmers-yet-to-be-compensated-for-crop-damage/articleshow/87516694.cms||---

Stating that the festival of light, celebrated throughout the country with gaiety and enthusiasm irrespective of caste, creed or religion, reinforces India’s spirit of unity. Hailing its spirit of victory of truth over evil, Pillai urged people to work to protect the country’s sovereignty. “For the unity of people, for the integrity of the nation and for maintaining and protecting the sovereignty of the nation, I am requesting all Indians to be one. Raj Bhavan will also make more and more effort towards this process,” Pillai said. The governor, who has started an outreach program called Deepavali Milan, said that he aims to give more aid to underprivileged people. Pillai hosted a reception for children from orphanages and shelter homes and is scheduled to hold a similar reception on Friday for patients undergoing dialysis and persons with HIV. Further, he said that since a governor is an appointed constitutional post, he would strive to maintain “cordial relations with all political parties”. “Cordial relations between the ruling government and Raj Bhavan is the need of the hour. I will stick to that. I will not interfere in any politics,” he said when asked about the current state government. “Let the people decide on the Pramod Sawant government.” Pillai also expressed his desire to make the Raj Bhavan more accessible to all. “Even small political parties are requesting an appointment and as far as possible, I have not denied an appointment to any of the applicants and not just political parties. I will try my level best to have proper contact with the people.

---||India||Emissions in 2021 set to rebound to pre-Covid levels, projects study||GLASGOW: Global carbon emissions in 2021 are set to rebound close to pre-Covid levels and a further rise next year cannot be ruled out if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use is stable, show the findings of the Global Carbon Project – a widely recognised international research project. Among the top four major emitters, China is projected to emit the most followed by the US, EU (27 nations) and India. Though the percentage growth is projected to be the highest in India this year, the country will still be in fourth position in absolute terms. The report comes even as climate negotiators from over 190 countries are grappling with working out a common plan of action, including finalising rules for carbon market, to contain overall emission. The report, released on the sidelines of the ongoing UN Climate Conference (COP26) on Thursday, shows though the carbon emissions globally dropped by 5.4% in 2020 amid Covid lockdowns, they are now projected to increase by 4.9% this year (4.1% to 5.7%) to 36.4 billion tonnes in total. Coal and gas use is growing more in 2021 than they fell in 2020. Emissions from coal use in 2021 are projected to be above their 2019 levels but still below their peak in 2014. Emissions in the US and EU appear to be returning to pre-Covid trends of decreasing CO2 emissions. However, their emissions are higher than India in absolute terms. For the rest of the world taken as a whole, fossil CO2 emissions remain below 2019 levels. The findings come as negotiators have also started discussing finer points of carbon markets (Article 6 of the Paris Agreement) so that its rules can be framed at COP26 for implementation. A new draft text on Article 6 was released on Monday. Though the carbon market is considered a tool to deal with the emission issue of big emitters, diverging views remain on issues with negotiators figuring out how to go about trading in 'carbon credits' which could actually help developing countries in the fast depleting carbon space scenario. “The rapid rebound in emissions as economies recover from the pandemic reinforces the need for immediate global action on climate change,” said Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter's Global Systems Institute who led the study. To have a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, 1.7°C and 2°C, the researchers estimate the remaining “carbon budget” has now shrunk to 420 billion tonnes, 770 billion tonnes and 1,270 billion tonnes respectively – equivalent to 11, 20 and 32 years from the beginning of 2022. “Reaching ‘net zero’ CO2 emissions by 2050 entails cutting global CO2 emissions by about 1.4 billion tonnes each year on average. Emissions fell by 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020 – so, to achieve ‘net zero’ by 2050, we must cut emissions every year by an amount comparable to that seen during Covid. This highlights the scale of the action that is now required, and hence the importance of the COP26 discussions,” said Friedlingstein. The study shows that total global emissions have remained relatively constant in the last decade, averaging 39.7 billion tonnes CO2. Removals of emissions by forests and soils have grown in the last two decades while emissions by deforestation and other land-use changes remained relatively stable, suggesting a recent decline in net emissions from land-use change. “Based on the findings, atmospheric CO2 concentration is projected to increase by 2.0 ppm in 2021 to reach 415 ppm averaged over the year, a lower growth compared to recent years due to La Nina conditions in 2021,” said the study. The Global Carbon Project is an international research project within the Future Earth research initiative on global sustainability, and a research partner of the World Climate Research Programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/emissions-in-2021-set-to-rebound-to-pre-covid-levels-projects-study/articleshow/87518727.cms||Vishwa Mohan

A wet Diwali is likely due to the influence of a low pressure which has moved to Arabian Sea and trough or an elongated region of low pressure over the Tamil Nadu coast. While moderate rainfall is likely over most of TN, IMD has also forecast heavy rain over west TN and delta districts due to the system hovering over the west of the Indian peninsula. IMD forecast generally cloudy skies over the city for the next 48 hours and said maximum and minimum temperature will be around 29C and 25C. "There may be some rain early in the morning or at night. During the day, there could be very short spells on and off," an official said. The rain could be triggered by a low pressure area, which lies over Lakshadweep and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea with an associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 4.5km above mean sea level. A trough at mean sea level from Comorin area and neighbourhood to west-central Bay of Bengal off the south Andhra Pradesh coast across Gulf of Mannar and the Tamil Nadu coast also persists. On Wednesday, the city woke up to sharp spells with intensity reducing over the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/moderate-rain-cloudy-skies-likely-today-in-tamil-nadu-imd/articleshow/87518818.cms||---

---||Goa||Part of Ribandar causeway side wall gives way||PANAJI: A half-meter long side section of the Portuguese-era Ribandar causeway collapsed on Wednesday evening. Even though a small portion was affected, the North Goa collector’s office issued instructions to divert traffic as a precaution for the safety of commuters. Traffic personnel were posted to monitor flow of vehicles at the site, while PWD officials said that the repair work would be taken up by 8.30am on Thursday and that work is expected to be completed within 24 hours. The historic Ponte de Linhares (Linhares bridge) was constructed by the Portuguese to link Panaji to Old Goa via the village of Ribander. And the 383-year-old bridge still continues to serve as a useful link. The bridge was once considered the longest bridge in Asia, and is perhaps India’s oldest. Built in 1634 for horse-drawn carriages, it has withstood the devastation of time and is today used by all kinds of traffic, including buses. As part of the move to promote pedestrianisation and protect the Portuguese-built structure, the state government in 2017 mooted the proposal to close the Ponte de Linhares bridge, or Ribandar causeway, for traffic permanently. The proposal was part of the Smart City Mission. Officials say the bridge can survive a few more years if traffic is phased out or brought to a complete stop. In 2016, North Goa collector Nila Mohanan had declared the bridge unsafe for heavy traffic and had notified that traffic had to be stopped, PWD officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/part-of-ribandar-causeway-side-wall-gives-way/articleshow/87517023.cms||---
---||Goa||Illegal fish sale to be stopped at Vasco||VASCO: Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) has directed Vasco police to halt illegal sale of fish in the vicinity of Vasco. Chief officer of MMC Jayant Tari had assured traditional fish vendors of Vasco that he will ban all illegal fish selling points, including wholesalers in Vasco. In a written order to the the Vasco police inspector, MMC has stated that, “It has been given to the notice of the undersigned that many persons are engaged in storage and sale of fish in the MMC jurisdiction within 1km of the existing municipal fish market.” The order pointed out such activity is illegal under Section 252 of the Goa Daman and Diu Municipalities Act, 1968 and in terms of Bye-Law 2 [ii] of the storage or sale of flesh or fish bye-laws, 1971. “The traditional fish vendors have strictly demanded this illegal sale to be banned. Provision under the Municipality Act too speaks of the same. We have instructed our assistant municipal inspectors to start taking action if they find such sale of fish despite our orders,” Tari told TOI. The demand was made by traditional fish vendors when MMC authorities had asked them to shift to a temporary shed as a new market is proposed to be constructed. The vendors’ contention was that if they shift, many others will indulge in illegal sale of fish at several points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/illegal-fish-sale-to-be-stopped-at-vasco/articleshow/87517039.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Need plan to ensure gram sabhas are held regularly’||Panaji: Directorate of panchayats needs to put in place a monitoring system to ensure that village panchayats organise frequent gram sabhas and village-level committees function properly, said GoaCan. GoaCan co-ordinator Roland Martins has also urged locals to participate in gram sabhas and ensure the completion of the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP). “It may be noted that many village panchayats across Goa have not held the gram sabhas for nearly two years citing various reasons, including the pandemic. This had resulted in the non-functioning of various committees at the panchayat level, had affected the transparency and accountability of these bodies, and, most importantly, it had slowed down the implementation of the GPDP,” said Martins. It is mandatory for every village panchayat to hold gram sabhas on any Sunday of January, April, July and October. GoaCan has welcomed the decision of the directorate of panchayats to schedule all the pending gram sabhas in November. “The schedule issued by the respective block development officers for the holding of the gram sabhas on the three Sundays of November is an important step in the right direction,” said Martins. GoaCan is encouraging citizens to check the functioning of committees at the panchayat level such as the village water and sanitation committee , road safety and traffic management committee, biodiversity management committee, village child committee and the village health, sanitation and nutrition committee . A special effort is being made to activate the village development committee so that the GPDP is properly prepared. “GoaCan is of the opinion that such a situation that has developed across the various talukas of Goa is a wake up call for the directorate of panchayats to put in place a monitoring system for the holding of gram sabha meetings, so that this is not repeated in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-plan-to-ensure-gram-sabhas-are-held-regularly/articleshow/87517046.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Serve & protect: Cops too ready for Diwali||During the subdued Diwali in 2020, necessitated by the pandemic, law enforcement agencies were forced to divert personnel to Covid duty. This year though, with festivities in full swing, the police and fire department return to their usual Diwali duties. The men and women in khaki will have their work cut out for them, having to deal with the usual Diwali emergencies and issues under the cloud of the lingering virus. However, the top brass is confident of smooth sailing. Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) director DGP Karan Singha instructed officials to assign their contingent including the emergency vehicles at 1,000 strategic locations. Water tankers will also be kept on standby and these vehicles will be diverted to emergency situations and places in need. “At least 200 fire personnel and 20 fire tender drivers who are swift behind the wheel have been brought to Chennai to attend the emergency fire calls. At least two police personnel are assigned in the fire control room and two fire personnel are assigned at the police control room to transfer emergency calls and reduce response time.” a senior TNFRS official said. Staff have been trained to reach a fire accident spot within 10 minutes in urban and 20 minutes in rural areas. DGP Sylendra Babu appealed to the public to inform the local police station if they are leaving to their hometowns for Diwali so police can assign personnel for patrol to keep an eye on locked houses. “Crime wing police personnel are to keep a tab on serial offenders who surface during the festival season and night vigil will also be increased,” said a senior officer. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) too has intensified checks on trains to prevent people from carrying crackers. Checks were conducted at Chennai Egmore, Central and Tambaram railway stations as passengers were expected to carry fireworks on trains. Dog squads were used and a few dog squads and personnel also travelled on trains to the southern routes to keep watch. RPF’s divisional security commissioner, Chennai division, Senthil said checks will continue for the next two days. “Incoming trains are also being checked because it has come to (the authorities’) notice that a lot of people tend to bring crackers by trains from Sivakasi to Chennai,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/serve-protect-cops-too-ready-for-diwali/articleshow/87518839.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Day after bypoll results, TMC calls for equal status of all oppn parties||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien de-escalated the pitch against Congress a day after his party’s landslide win in four assembly bypolls in Bengal and called for a change in the “mindset” of uniting against BJP. Without naming Congress, the Trinamool leader said all that he expected was an equal status for all opposition partners. “The mindset has to change – we are equal partners in the opposition. Let’s work together on this, rather than talk down to us. There is no need to fight. Our single goal is to defeat BJP,” Derek said on Wednesday, a day after Trinamool chief and chief minister Mamata Banerjee led a strident attack against Congress while inaugurating a Kali Puja in central Kolkata. Trinamool leaders changed gears after Congress did well in bypolls to BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh, which was no less than Trinamool’s victory in Bengal bypolls; the grand old party also retained its seats in Maharashtra and Rajasthan, sending out signal that it too could fight BJP. Derek, also Trinamool’s national spokesperson, broached the “equal status” issue with an eye on how opposition unity against BJP would play out. On earlier occasions, as in 2018, when the Congress Working Committee had announced Rahul Gandhi as the opposition’s “PM face” for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had opposed such unilateral announcement and said the PM face would be decided in a meeting of opposition parties. Later, the Trinamool chief had taken the initiative for an opposition rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds, where Congress sent Mallikarjun Kharge as its representative. The Congress brass didn’t attend the meeting. A triumphant Trinamool, after its decisive victory against BJP in the Bengal assembly polls earlier this year and subsequent five bypolls, is confident of winning most seats from the state and is making forays into other states to maximize its tally in the Lok Sabha polls. Banerjee criticized Congress on many occasions but didn’t burn bridges with the party. Trinamool leaders do not want to weaken the anti-BJP platform. They want Congress to treat Trinamool as “equal partners” instead of expecting it to play second fiddle in the fight against BJP. Trinamool leaders are averse to the “talk down” approach that Congress had adopted in its interaction with partners. Banerjee, a political veteran, is not willing to follow a predetermined Congress script for the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-after-bypoll-results-tmc-calls-for-equal-status-of-all-oppn-parties/articleshow/87517063.cms||---
---||Kolkata||TMC to contest all 51 seats in Agartala municipal elections||Kolkata: Fifty-one Trinamool Congress candidates, including 27 women, on Wednesday filed their nominations for the Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC) elections. This is the party’s first attempt to contest a civic poll outside Bengal. TMC nominated more women than required — AMC has 25 seats reserved for women — fielding two candidates in general seats. Twenty civic bodies, including AMC, will be going to polls on November 25. The party has decided to contest only AMC. Wednesday was the last day of filing nominations. The results will be declared on November 28. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev led a huge rally with candidates and party workers before filing nominations. She later said: “We will be contesting all 51 seats in the Agartala Municipal Corporation elections. We have given nominations to deserving people who will work for people. With the inspiration of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and our leader Abhishek Banerjee, if voted to power, we will implement pro-people schemes in Agartala.” Trinamool, in a statement, said: “We salute the courage and commitment shown by all the candidates to fight for the rights of the people of Tripura and extend our wholehearted support to their fight against oppressive forces. Wishing them the very best.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-to-contest-all-51-seats-in-agartala-municipal-elections/articleshow/87517105.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal keen on polls to 3 civic bodies on Dec 19||Kolkata: The Bengal government is keen to have elections to three municipal corporations — Kolkata, Bidhannagar and Howrah — on December 19. The urban development department had suggested this date and wanted the counting held on December 22. The government has also advised polls to all 112 municipalities where elections are long pending. The State Election Commission (SEC) has sought the government’s permission to conduct elections to Kolkata, Howrah and Bidhannagar in December, and the relevant notification might be issued after Kali Puja. By January 2022, elections to all civic bodies would be completed, an official said. The SEC, an official said, was willing to wrap up the elections to Kolkata, Bidhannagar and Howrah civic bodies before Christmas. To conduct the polls, SEC has asked the finance department for funds sanction as these would cost around Rs 200 crore. The SEC needs to take care of police arrangements and follow Covid safety protocol that will require additional manpower, an official said. There are apprehensions that the opposition might move court for central force deployment, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-keen-on-polls-to-3-civic-bodies-on-dec-19/articleshow/87517093.cms||---
