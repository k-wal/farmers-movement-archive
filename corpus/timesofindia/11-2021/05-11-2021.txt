PRC officials have warned US officials to not interfere with the PRC’s relationship with India,” the department of defense told the US Congress on Wednesday. The Pentagon regularly reports to the Congress on the Indo-Chinese military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The department has categorically said China is indulging in aggressive and coercive behaviour with its neighbours, India in particular. The Pentagon said despite the ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, China has continued “taking incremental and tactical actions” to press its claims at the LAC. "In 2020, China built a large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the Chinese Tibet Autonomous Region and India’s Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC. These and other infrastructure development efforts along India-China have been a source of consternation in the Indian government,” the Pentagon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pentagon-report-china-trying-to-push-territorial-claim-with-india/articleshow/87529384.cms||---

---||India||HC: High time men made way for women to lead grassroot bodies||BENGALURU: It is high time men made way for women to lead grassroots institutions like gram panchayats to achieve the constitutional goal of empowerment, the Karnataka high court has said. The call came while dismissing a petition challenging the decision to reserve the post of the head of Konaje gram panchayat (GP) in Mangaluru taluk in Dakshina Kannada district in favour of scheduled castes (woman). “It is, in fact, a vindication of empowerment of women in grassroots politics. The case at hand is a clear step towards the fruition of the dreams of the father of the nation with regard to village-level governance and participation of women in such governance,” Justice M Nagaprasanna stated. The judge also pointed out the 73rd amendment to the Constitution, which was a step towards self-governance at grassroots level, but equal right had not come about yet. “This is a classic case where empowerment of the hitherto under-powered has emerged in all vigour at grassroots level. The challenge is made by one of the petitioners who is a scheduled caste man. If it were to be contrary to law, it would have been a different circumstance altogether, while it is not,” the judge noted in his order while dismissing the petition filed by Ravi and Ramakrishna K Pattori, two elected members of Konaje village panchayat. The petitioners, among whom Ravi is an SC candidate, had sought for directions to reserve the post of adhyaksha of their village panchayat as SC (general) instead of SC (woman). Their argument was that there’s already a scheduled caste member out of the 12 elected members in the GP. However, the State Election Commission had informed the court that incidentally, women have emerged victorious in all the reserved seats of the GPs in Mangaluru taluk and that cannot be grounds for the petitioners to contend that offices of chairperson and vice-chairperson of Konaje GP cannot be reserved in favour of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-high-time-men-made-way-for-women-to-lead-grassroots-bodies/articleshow/87529712.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||India||Surgical strike showed Army’s capabilities: PM||SRINAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the 2016 surgical strike on terror launchpads across the LoC displayed the Army’s capabilities and that he himself monitored the operation till the last soldier’s return. “I was constantly on the phone at the time of the surgical strike. I wanted to ensure that each soldier returned safely. All the soldiers who carried out the surgical strike made me feel proud by returning to their unit safely,” said Modi, who celebrated Diwali with jawans in Nowshera in Rajouri, Jammu, as a morale-boosting gesture. He said many attempts have been made since the surgical strike to disrupt peace in Jammu and Kashmir. “But our forces kept their morale high and thwarted all such moves by giving a befitting reply.” The PM said while the country celebrates Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav to mark 75 years of Independence, the government has set new targets and challenges for itself, with emphasis on being more self reliant. “There was a time when our forces were fully dependent on foreign arms. Even our soldiers would wait for spare parts of defence equipment from foreign countries. It would take years to receive such consignments. The army officer who would sign the procurement deal had to wait till his retirement to receive the same,” he said. Asserting that times have now changed, he said, “Today, 65% of the defence budget is being spent within the country to manufacture such equipment. We now manufacture Arjun tanks and Tejas aircraft within the country. More than 200 items, including spare parts and other equipment, are being made in India itself,” he said. “This way, we have reduced our dependence on foreign arms.” The PM expressed happiness over expansion of women’s roles in the defence sector. Along with opening up permanent commission, NDA, National Military School, National Indian Military College for women, he recalled his Independence Day announcement of opening up Sainik Schools for girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/surgical-strike-showed-armys-capabilities-pm/articleshow/87529819.cms||M Saleem Pandit

However, last mile connectivity will continue to be a tough task to ensure maximum coverage of first and second dose, stated an official. “There is absolutely no shortage of vaccines for the proposed month-long door to door vaccination drive as the production is as per the target. Vaccine availability is no longer an issue since September. The issue is to ensure maximum coverage at the earliest,” stated National task force member Dr NK Arora. While Covishield doses almost comprise 90% of the share, Bharat Biotech too is scaling up their production of Covaxin and the country will see Zy-CoV-D too join the stockpile this month with about an additional 1 crore doses expected. The month of January is expected to see three more vaccine from Biological E, Novovax and Genova Biopharma being added. Dr Arora explained that the “last mile” coverage will definitely be a tough task as it would have to ensure coverage of beneficiaries from difficult terrains, daily wage workers who have been unable to reach their vaccination centres in fear of loss of pay or those who are vaccine hesitant and the door to door vaccination is to keep the momentum of vaccination as it had started in January. “The door to door vaccination to complete the last mile of covering 20% for the first dose is taken from the polio drive. We are starting it as a month-long drive and it will be followed up by another month if required,’ he told TOI. The strategy will however be the same to ensure that no one is left out, he shared. There are currently 134 million beneficiaries, who have not taken their second shot even after the prescribed interval, as per the government data. As much as 77% of the eligible population in India has been vaccinated against Covid-19 with the first dose, and 32% of the population has received both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-vaccination-no-shortage-for-door-to-door-drive/articleshow/87529929.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Later, Singh told mediapersons that Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh will also appear before the ED. Hrishikesh, an accused in the case, had been evading questioning by the ED for months despite several summons. Deshmukh too had avoided five summons and appeared before the ED office on Monday unannounced after both the Bombay high court and Supreme Court refused to grant him relief. The ED had arrested Deshmukh early Tuesday stating that he was not cooperating in the probe during the questioning. The same day, he was produced before a special holiday court, which remanded him into ED custody till Saturday. On Thursday morning, ED officials took Deshmukh to a government hospital for routine medical examination and brought him back to their Ballard Estate office around 1.30pm. Half an hour later, they started questioning Deshmukh, which went on till 6pm. The ED is investigating the money-laundering case based on the CBI FIR where former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh had asked now-dismissed API Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. The ED remand stated that Deshmukh, by virtue of his position as state home minister, received around Rs 4.7 crore. Deshmukh’s CA, Sudhir Baheti, told the ED he had introduced Delhi-based hawala operators to Hrishikesh to legitimize the cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anil-deshmukh-questioned-son-to-appear-before-ed-too/articleshow/87530102.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||India||Sectors vulnerable to terrorist funding, laundering under lens||NEW DELHI: A national risk assessment (NRA) is currently underway in which central agencies, including the Reserve Bank of India, have been tasked with evaluating sectors that are vulnerable to money laundering and terror financing. The exercise has begun just ahead of India’s mutual evaluation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris based inter-governmental body that had recently retained Pakistan on its ‘Grey List’ following its non-compliance in taking actions against banned terrorist outfits and UN-designated terrorists, denying them access to its financial institutions and banks. India’s own FATF assessment has been pending since 2019 and postponed twice. An internal assessment earlier had found lack of convictions in a large number of cases related to money laundering. Following this, the government had asked the ED and CBI to file chargesheets in a time-bound manner and ensure convictions in cases where prosecution complaints have been filed. The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), an arm of the finance ministry, has been closely coordinating with all the intelligence and enforcement agencies, including the RBI, to further improve the inter-agency cooperation and boost actions against suspicious entities engaged in money laundering. The real estate and gems and jewellery sectors in particular are more prone to money laundering and have been high on the government’s agenda to prevent organised crime syndicates using its financial institutions to launder money and endanger the economy. Lakhs of shell firms have been deregistered by the government in the last few years after they were found engaged in money laundering with no real business activity involved. The department of revenue in the finance ministry is the designated department to conduct NRA on money laundering and terror financing. According to sources, India’s mutual evaluation of the FATF has been postponed to sometime around May 2022. Another area of concern for the Centre is the access of some terror outfits to international finances coming through the non-profit organisations, particularly in the northeastern states and J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sectors-vulnerable-to-terrorist-funding-laundering-under-lens/articleshow/87530226.cms||Pradeep Thakur

TOI had reported about the Goalganj tragedy in its Thursday edition. Eight persons died on Thursday after allegedly consuming hooch in Telhua village at Bettiah, the headquarters of West Champaran district, while the toll in the Gopalganj incident climbed to 16 on Thursday with six more deaths being confirmed by the district authorities.

Bihar minister Janak Ram rushed to Gopalganj. He later told reporters: “I have visited the houses of persons who died allegedly because of consuming spurious liquor. It could be a conspiracy to defame the NDA government.” Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said “Some people have died under mysterious circumstances in Muhammadpur village in the district in the last two days. The cause of their death cannot be confirmed as autopsy reports are still awaited. Three teams are probing the case.” Some of the bodies have been cremated by their families, the police said.

The scheme was launched in February 2021 and since then 28,848 people have been sanctioned the old-age pension. Before this, it was implemented in Udupi and Magadi taluks. "This is a first-of-its-kind programme in the entire country. After seeing aged people, especially elderly women, struggling to enrol for the pension, we decided to bring this programme. I am glad that so many people have benefitted. We are extending this initiative to all social security schemes," said revenue minister R Ashoka. The state government provides pensions for elderly persons from BPL families. While people aged between 64 and 65 will get a monthly pension of Rs 600, those above 65 years will get Rs 1,000-1,200 under the Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme and the Sandhya Suraksha Scheme. In all, there are over 58 lakh such beneficiaries. According to Satish Kumar, director of social security schemes, the e-governance department which has an Aadhaar database of all BPL families, will send the details of people who have crossed 60 years but are not covered under the pension scheme to the revenue department every second week. The details will then be sent to the gram panchayats and local bodies. In addition to the Suo Motu Inclusion, beneficiaries can also submit applications on their own through gram panchayats and Nada Kacheris and Atal Janasnehi Kendras. The success of this initiative has made the department extend it to other pension schemes too. “We plan to bring a widow pension and Mythri scheme, which provides a pension for transgender people, under this initiative. We are working on it,” he said. The department has also started the annual physical verification of beneficiaries for social security schemes since February and till now it has cancelled the pensions of 71,463 fake beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/about-30k-aged-people-get-suo-motu-pension/articleshow/87530374.cms||Anil Gejji

Only a handful of cases have been reported at the city’s eye hospitals. A nine-year-old boy from Basavanagudi was brought to Minto Ophthalmic Institute on Thursday morning with an eye injury and facial burns and swelling of the eyelid. It was treated as a simple injury and no hospitalisation was required. That was the second case of eye injury related to crackers seen in the hospital in the last four days. On Thursday, a six-year-old boy from Doddathalasandra on the outskirts of Bengaluru was brought to Minto hospital with a cracker injury in his left eye. "He was a bystander hit by a flower pot. The boy was treated and sent home," said Minto authorities. On Monday, a 10-year-old boy from Padarayanapura was treated as an outpatient. In 2020, the hospital had treated 16 children and a total 31 cases of eye injuries caused by cracker mishaps. Three patients had lost vision in one eye, including a two-year-old boy. Compared to previous years, the number of cracker eye injury cases are less, say doctors. At Dr Agarwal Eye Hospitals, Banashankari, a 13-year-old boy was treated for a left-eye injury caused by a cracker. The boy, Chikkalasandra, was riding pillion on a two-wheeler when the mishap happened. The boy did not require admission, said hospital authorities. No eye injuries due to cracker burst was reported at private hospitals such as Shekar Eye Hospital in JP Nagar and Narayana Netralaya on Thursday, as of 8 pm. At Naranaya Netralaya, two paediatric cases and one adult injured with cracker burst were treated at the outpatient unit on Wednesday. “None of them had sight threatening injuries,” said hospital authorities. Dr Rajashekar YL, who heads the Shekar Eye Hospital, said that in the last 4-5 years, there has been a steady decrease in the number of cracker-related eye injuries. “This is mainly due to increased awareness among the public and effective communication through media,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-hosps-see-sharp-decline-in-firecracker-eye-injuries/articleshow/87530375.cms||---

Sriki, who was finally arrested last year and booked for hacking into gaming portals, is Accused No. 8 in the attempt-to-murder case in which a city MLA’s son and others attacked a businessman’s son. Sriki evaded arrest for six months and surfaced after a local court granted him anticipatory bail. Fellow accused in the hacking case Robin Khandelwal sheltered Sriki at his residence when he was on the run. “Later, Khandelwal paid Rs 11.8 lakh to charter a private jet to fly Sriki,” the chargesheet reads, but is silent where he was flown. Sriki’s exploits are outlined in the chargesheet submitted by Central Crime Branch to a local court and also has details about other accused — Khandelwal, Suneesh Hegde, Prasidh Shetty and Sujay Raj. While Khandelwal is from Kolkata, all others are from Bengaluru.

Sriki and Suneesh Hegde extorted Rs 50 lakh from the owner of a gaming website after calling him to Goa. Sriki succeeded not only in making the website defunct, but also stole its data and threatened the owner he’d destroy it. Sriki, who received bitcoins from owners of other websites he had hacked, transferred them to Khandelwal’s account and received cash through hawala from him. “Knowing that prime accused Sriki would hack into websites, the other accused decided to use Sriki for hacking different websites and extorting money from their owners. The accused would accommodate Sriki in posh star hotels as well as resorts in different parts of the state and places like Goa, where Sriki would sit for months together and hack sites,” the chargesheet reads. The chargesheet explains how Sriki hacked into card gaming websites and pied on cards of other players as well as cards arranged in the fray. The other accused would easily won online card games and earned quick money. However, the chargesheet said another accused, Hemanth Muddappa, has been left out since there was no evidence.

Sriki was arrested in November 2020 for sourcing drugs through the darknet using bitcoins. Police said Sriki had hacked government websites as well, including the e-procurement portal, siphoning off crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hacker-sriki-got-pvt-jet-to-evade-police/articleshow/87530377.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

On October 17, he approached the ACB and filed a complaint against Raghavendra, alleging he was demanding the remaining Rs 2 lakh. The ACB officials took up a case and laid a trap. They arrested Raghavendra and a third party, identified as Raghavendra Nayaka, in the inspector chamber. The defence counsel contended that Raghavendra had spent more than 40 days in jail and the probe had been completed except getting the FSL report. It was also contended that Shivashankar had filed a similar case against the previous inspector — Yeshwanth — of the same station and he had a habit of filing false cases against police. The defence counsel also contended that Shivashankar claimed to have paid Rs 4 lakh as bribe to Raghavendra on September 1 and could have filed a complaint within seven days, but he did not do so and approached ACB only 17 days later. Judge K Natarajan granted conditional bail to Raghavendra on October 29. Raghavendra was asked to execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs 2 lakh with two sureties. He was directed not to tamper with the prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly, not indulge in similar offences, not cause any delay in the trial and appear before the investigating officer every Monday between 10am and 4pm, for a period of three months or till filing of the chargesheet, whichever is earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inspector-gets-bail-after-40-days-in-jail/articleshow/87530381.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Personalised hampers in vogue this Deepavali||BENGALURU: Bengalureans are getting creative with Deepavali gifts this year. Personalised hampers comprising handmade diyas, homemade sweets, dry fruits, and even silver objects are among the several ideas that people are embracing. Shiietal Shah, a voice-over artist, told TOI that the idea to curate her own gift hampers for family and friends started last year with the pandemic and limited shopping options. “At that time, my sister-in-law, Twinkle Shah, came up with handmade diyas for which she used old CDs. She covered them with zari laces, beads and kept tealight candles in the middle. We blended these with a few homemade sweets and dry fruits, made simple hampers and gifted them to near and dear ones,” said the Malleswaram resident, adding that the hampers were an instant hit with everyone and this encouraged the two to curate more of them this year with a combination of homemade sweets, namkeens, dry fruit chocolates, and earthen diyas. “We believe in giving a personal touch to Deepavali gifts, rather than simply picking up items from a mall and packaging them,” added Shah. A favourite hamper of hers is the one she created for her best friend Roopa Sanghvi. “I placed in it an ethnic dupatta, a wind chime, Gujarati sweets and diyas. The theme was gold, so it had golden packing, boxes, tissue and laces,” she explained. Shiietal said the wholesale market in Chickpet is her one-stop destination for all accessories. “I pick up zip-lock bags, gift paper bags, zari laces, cane baskets, etc., from there. Nowadays, amazing handmade ethnic accessories are in trend,” she added. Like Shiietal, several Bengalureans are opting for creative gifts. This year, Harini B, a homemaker, curated a hamper made of homemade kaju katli pieces, earthen diyas, a small idol of Lord Ganesha and another piece of personalised gift. “The hamper will stand out from the boxes of sweets we gift every year and will feel personal,” she said. Her 14-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son helped her with the wrapping and designs, something that turned into a bonding exercise for the family. For Sameer Makhija, a businessman, the idea of curated hampers came to mind when he realised his uncles and aunts would enjoy sugar-free sweets and other goodies that are not part of the usual readymade Deepavali hampers. “While my father likes sweets from one store, my uncle likes another brand – I travel across the city picking up what they like and created hampers with their favourites. I keep their health in mind too,” the Sanjaynagar resident said. “Deepavali is about spreading joy. These hampers are like personalised baskets of joy,” summed up Makhija.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/personalised-hampers-in-vogue-this-deepavali/articleshow/87530383.cms||Farheen Hussain

Anjali, an alumnus of Vidyashilp Academy, Amber Valley, and Vidyaniketan School, joined the university in 2013. She was interning in a 60,000-acre farm in New Zealand as part of her course in 2016 when the car she was in, along with three friends, turned turtle after the driver lost control of it. Anjali, who was in the middle seat, with no seat belt was hurtled out of the car and her head hit a rock. With no mobile connectivity, two of her friends had to run for over 20 km to make a phone call to get help. She had critical head injuries -- a broken neck with two vertebrae snapped, an artery severed on the neck, a pelvic bone fractured. She lay in harsh sub-zero temperatures for over five hours before medical help arrived. “Initially the doctors said she would not survive. Then, they said even if she did, she will not walk. We flew to NZ and stayed with Anjali in the ICU for over 35 days, praying for a miracle. The prayers were answered and she lived,” said Rajan Warrier, her businessman-father from Bengaluru. “The next battle was to get her back to normal and walking. She was transferred to the rehab in Melbourne, where we kept on instilling the principles of visualisation and affirmation into Anjali. In spite of all the doomsday projections, we could bring Anjali back home to Bengaluru, walking on her own feet within six months,” Rajan said. Her mother, Prabha, recalled that the rehabilitation period was the toughest. “Her long-term memory was intact but she had suffered short-term memory loss. So here is a 23-year-old, whose brain had shrunk to that of a 3- or 4-year-old, learning everything again, the brain taking time to process things,” she said. “For me, there was no trauma then,” Anjali said. “I was not in pain. I could not remember anything of the accident. I finally felt waking up three months later in the rehab in Melbourne. That is when I slowly started processing things,” she said. After trying to join the university in 2017, Anjali finally started full time in 2019. “What has happened has happened. I realised every day is a new day. I decided to take one day at a time. I worked hard, harder than ever. It was my hard work and expectancy that helped me. I am so grateful to my family for standing by me,” she said. “A lot of people did not believe I could make it. But I could not remember anything that people were saying. So it actually did not affect me,” she said. “Being a vet was all that I wanted to do. We always had dogs and cats at home. A close family friend who stayed with us was a vet. His clinic was on the ground floor of the house. Every time we came back from school, we used to spend our evenings in the clinic. So this is a dream come true for me,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-girl-battles-near-fatal-accident-set-to-graduate-as-vet/articleshow/87530385.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Gravel stones, construction material and ditches occupy nearly 2ft width of the road, slowing down traffic during peak hours. Motorists also face the risk of skidding on gravel and falling into ditches in the absence of barricades. Shivanna C, an autorickshaw driver, said, “Considering that many people in the city still use high -beam lights, it becomes very difficult to notice things on the road. Once the vehicle gets on a gravel-littered stretch and one applies brake, not only will the vehicle skid but those coming behind will also have a tough time in applying brakes. It is best to barricade the stretch until the work is done.” Frequent road users have found that works on this stretch have led to an increase in traffic jams since late October. Varun S, who uses the road on a regular basis, said, “I travel on the stretch every day to office. The three-lane carriageway has reduced to two and the road gets blocked as there is a bus stop on the same stretch. Buses stop abruptly in the middle of the road, leading to snarls. In addition to this, there are no safety precautions in place on the entire stretch where the civil work is happening.” BBMP officials said Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited had dug up up the road at several places for laying underground cables nearly three months ago. “KPTCL has completed its work and the Palike is restoring the road. We are waiting for the rain to start asphalting the road,” they said. The officials, however, claimed that they had barricaded the stretch, but the barricades are removed only when the work is being carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ongoing-civil-works-renderrides-on-orr-stretch-risky/articleshow/87530390.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

In the last five days, families of 15 deceased persons donated a total of 30 corneas, said Dr Bhujang Shetty, chairman, Narayana Netralaya. Besides, more than 1,000 people visited the bank to pledge their eyes. “The hospital has been witnessing a rush for filing eye-pledge declarations and we have made queues. This happened in the last five days, after Puneeth’s corneas were donated and transplanted to four people,” said Dr Shetty. The eye bank had seen families of 1,614 deceased people donating corneas in 2019, which reduced to 575 in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2021, till November, 4,752 families came forward for donation, of which 30 were after October 29. After Puneeth was declared dead on October 29, Dr Shetty got a call from his elder brother Raghavendra Rajkumar about the family willing to donate his eyes. The staff at the eye bank, associated with Narayana Netralaya, rushed in an ambulance to the private hospital where Puneeth was last treated and his corneas were harvested. On October 30, through a unique procedure, Puneeth’s two corneas were sliced into four, which resulted in four needy patients regaining vision. That was the first time the hospital had conducted four corneal transplants from one deceased donor, which was widely publicised in the media. The superior layer of the cornea was transplanted to two patients who had superficial corneal disease. Only the deeper layer was transplanted to two other patients with endothelial or deep corneal layer disease.  Dr Shetty said the eye donation and pledging which had dipped during the peak of the pandemic, are now picking pace. “This is the first time we are seeing a huge response after corneal donation from one deceased donor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/eye-bank-sees-spike-in-donation-pledges-post-puneeths-death/articleshow/87530393.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Police identified the accused as Bhavani Rao More. A case of extortion and cheating has been registered against More based on a complaint filed by Suresh B.According to sources, Suresh filed a complaint with home minister Araga Jnanendra against More and CCB police arrested him on Thursday. Later, he was handed over to Cubbon Park police. Suresh stated in his complaint that the city police commissioner directed to close all bars where women served in the city 15 days ago and they opened two days later. More learnt about it and approached Suresh on October 23. More claimed that he was an active BJP worker and had contact with political leaders. He assured Suresh that he would make arrangements not to close women-serviced bars with the help of the home minister. Suresh took time to discuss the issue with the office-bearers of his association. Suresh, accompanied by Javaregowda and Santosh Rai of the association, again met More on October 26. They collected over Rs 1.2 crore from 44 members of the association and gave it to More on October 30. The trio, however, learnt that More was not doing any work he had committed to do and demanded that he return their money. More returned Rs 1 crore to Suresh and refused to give the remaining Rs 25 lakh saying it was his service charge. He threatened Suresh that he would ensure that all bars where women served are closed if they demanded Rs 25 lakh back. Suresh approached the home minister and complained against More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smogga-man-cons-bar-owners-assn-of-25l/articleshow/87530397.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||AI is transforming X-rays, MRIs, says Philips exec||Bengaluru: Smartphones today enable ordinary users to take the kinds of pictures that were previously possibly only by experts using DSLR cameras. They use powerful AI processors that are able to quickly and automatically recognise different objects in the frame, and apply specific camera settings tailored to the subject matter. They improve images by reducing motion blur, adding simulated depth of field, and improving colour, contrast and light range.Similar techniques are now being used in X-rays and MRI scans, so that even less trained or untrained medical staff can take these images, do them faster, and enable a machine to be used for more people in a day. That’s some of the cutting edge work that the Philips Innovation Campus (PIC) in Bengaluru, which just completed 25 years, is currently involved in. “MRIs can be so claustrophobic. Now think about a scenario where these scans can be performed 50% faster, with the same image quality. That is the power that AI brings,” says Kalavathi G V, head of PIC. MRIs often require patients to hold their breath, but that’s not easy for those with vascular issues. The AI systems enable shorter breath holds. Kalavathi says the software predicts if something is going to go wrong with the scan, enabling quick corrections. Similarly, PIC has helped develop what Philips calls the Radiology Smart Assistant, an AI-based solution that improves acquisition accuracy and reduces operational inefficiencies in X-ray through constant feedback at the point of image acquisition. “If the technician is not experienced, he might not get the image in the right way. Because of AI, it has changed the way you scan,” Kalavathi says. “It has reduced the time, reduced the stress, and reduced the costs.”The Bengaluru research team also optimised the processing speed and performance of what’s called B-line detection algorithms on smaller ultrasound devices that are used at the bedside. B-lines in ultrasound images are an indication for many diseases/conditions including pneumonia, pleural effusions, and bronchiolitis. The traditional way is for the user to perform the scan and interpret the images. This needs expertise. But with AI-based algorithms, the identification and quantification of B-Lines is made easier.Kalavathi says PIC, which now has 4,500 people, has established itself as a very strong software powerhouse for Philips, and has over the past few years been increasingly shifting gears to becoming an end-to-end digital solutions leader for the Dutch company. “It goes with the solution transformation that we are driving at Philips. When you make products, you sell it to the customer, it is more of a transaction. But when you talk about a solution, you become one with the customer. The customer is at the centre of everything that we do, we call it the need seeker mindset, that is the mindset that we are trying to change across the board. This involves starting from understanding the customer pain points to co-creating the solution,” she says.A successful solution developed is what’s called Mobile Obstetrics Monitoring (MOM). It’s a software solution that allows community healthcare workers to perform antenatal risk stratification and assess a patient’s pregnancy progress via a mobile device. “It is an intelligent algorithm in the mobile. We did a pilot in Shorapur taluk in Yadgir district in Karnataka in 2017. Over 1,500 pregnant women were enrolled. The mortality rate was very high in the district, but by using this solution, we were able to achieve zero maternal mortality,” Kalavathi says, adding that they are in talks with the government to scale it up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-is-transforming-x-rays-mris-says-philips-exec/articleshow/87530400.cms||---

The latest data on infant mortality rate (IMR) for 2019 released by the census office indicates the poor quality of maternal and child health services in rural areas as well as limited access to these. The IMR of urban India is 20 (20 babies below one year dying out of every 1,000 babies born) compared to 34 in rural areas, showing a stagnation in the efforts to bridge the rural-urban divide. If anything, the gap has widened marginally in the five years to 2019. While all states have narrowed the gap in IMR between rural and urban areas, the difference continues to be alarmingly high in Assam and MP, where rural areas account for 86% and 72% of the total population respectively. Odisha, Rajasthan and Gujarat have shown the most remarkable improvement in bridging the gap in IMR between rural and urban areas. Rural Odisha had the second highest IMR of 68 in the country in 2009 while its urban IMR was 46. It steadily cut the gap to a single digit and by 2019, the rural and urban IMR were 39 and 30 respectively. Similarly, Gujarat too has significantly reduced the gap in the last decade. In 2009, the rural and urban IMRs were 55 and 33 respectively, which narrowed to 29 and 18 by 2019. The gap between rural and urban IMR (65 and 35) was the highest in Rajasthan in 2009, and its rural IMR was among the highest in India. It has not only brought down rural IMR, it has also narrowed the gap between rural and urban areas (38 and 25) by 2019, a significant improvement from where it had started. Rural MP continued to have the highest IMR in the country in 2009 (72), 2014 (57) and 2019 (50). Though an IMR of 57 in 2014 was a huge improvement over 72 in 2009, by 2019 the pace of improvement had slowed down as rural IMR came down to just 50 in 2019. Moreover, the rural-urban gap remained the second highest after Assam, which also showed little progress in bridging the gap. Several states have reduced the rural-urban gap in infant survival to single digits. The gap remains in double digits and almost unchanged between 2014 and 2019 in UP, where 78% of the population lives in rural areas. While better urban IMR in a state shows what is possible with the availability of better healthcare, even the urban IMR of many of these laggard states is higher than the rural IMR of better performing states, an indication of how far these states have to go.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/urban-india-kids-have-higher-chances-of-survival-in-1st-year/articleshow/87530402.cms||Rema Nagarajan

The BSE index gained 296 points to end at 60,068 during the Muhurat session for Diwali. HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries and ITC led the gainers during the special evening session that ushered in Samvat Year 2078, while ICICI Bank witnessed some profit taking. Veterans on Dalal Street say that on the first day of the Samvat year, during the hour-long special trading session, one should only buy stocks, even if those are in small quantities, and should not sell any. During the Muhurat trading session on Thursday too, after a year of high gains when the sensex rose 38%, positive mood was seen in BSE’s International Convention Hall in the city. The mood was helped by the government’s post-market decision on Wednesday to sharply reduce petrol and diesel prices, a move expected to partially address the inflation fear in the country. The government’s decision came after prices of these two important petro products were increased several times in the past few months and were at record levels, mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices globally. The move is expected to directly have a calming effect on inflation as well as an indirect effect through reduction in transport costs. According to Barclays chief India economist Rahul Bajoria, the inflation impact of this decision will be limited on consumer price inflation (CPI), but it may reduce costs of logistics more materially. “Fuel prices have been climbing for the past three months, with both diesel and gasoline prices up over 20% year-on-year, hitting historical highs on level terms,” the report by Barclays noted. “The impact of this tax reduction will be limited on inflation, as diesel has a very small weight (0.15% in CPI), but the reduction in gasoline (2.2%) taxes will contribute materially. Overall, the direct impact of this price reduction will be 12 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) on headline CPI in November, and it will lead to an indirect impact of 12bps reduction in three months, bringing the total impact to 24bps,” Bajoria wrote. Additionally, late Wednesday late, after months of speculation as to when it is likely to pull the plug on its $120-billion-per-month bond-buying programme, the US Fed — the central bank of the world’s largest economy — finally said that it would start that in the current month. The reduced per-month buying limit would be $105 billion. As the uncertainty about the timing as well as the magnitude of the tapering ended, the Dow Jones index rallied over 100 points on Wednesday night. The rally in tech and chipmakers continued on Thursday too, which helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs. The end of the uncertainty is also expected to leave traders on Dalal Street to focus on other issues, market players here said. After a great year for equities, investors are looking forward to stock markets continuing to rise, though not at the same pace as the past year, said HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli. “Global headwinds in the form of rising inflation and withdrawal of monetary stimulus may impact the momentum, but strength in Indian macros and improving micros may help offset these. Investors need to conduct portfolio and asset-allocation reviews, and raise the quality of stocks held in their portfolio,” Relli said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bullish-street-sees-a-positive-start-to-samvat-2078/articleshow/87529442.cms||---

As a child, I would also wake up at 4 am, gather the salt lumps and go from door to door, offering ‘luck.’ This gesture is symbolic of the exchange of goodwill in the society – just as salt makes food edible, this small gesture is believed to improve the neighbour’s day and thus the year,” says Hetal Padh, a resident of Kalupur. Amidst winds of westernization, the Unesco World Heritage City of Ahmedabad – primarily the traditional walled city areas – along with built heritage continues to be the custodian of customs and traditions followed since years immemorial. Right from the time of Sultans to Mill magnets, the city’s social fabric reflected its practices and how Diwali remained one of the biggest festivals for the city. The traditional Diwali spread too is different from the platter offering to guests in the western city. Jagdip Mehta, resident of Moto Sutharwado and owner of renowned heritage homes of the city, says pol residents still collectively sweat it out to dish out traditional sweets and savouries at home. “In walled city, Diwali platter mandatorily includes suvali, a deep fried crunchy round discs made from maida, along with chakri, ghughra, mathiya, cholafali, mohanthal and magas among others,” says Mehta. He rues that the only thing missing these days is the massive appetite people used to work up during the festivals. Even as earthen lamps have been replaced with fairy lights and custom-stitched clothes ditched for ready-made garments, visits to the local temple is a must for the residents of Desai ni Pol. While majority people in western parts embark on vacations outside the city, pol residents hold sneh-milans to eat, meet and greet their neighbours. “Diwali festivity is incomplete without visiting a temple and seeking blessings of the elders during ‘sneh milan’ of the Mohalla,” says Maitri Pasawala, a resident of Desai ni Pol, adding that the lure of the traditions get many back to Pols for the festivals. Prof Ramji Savaliya, former director of BJ Institute of Learning & Research, said that the majority of the traditions of today have roots in centuries-old practices. “Saal Mubarak for example has come from the interaction of the Gujarati traders with their counterparts from today’s Middle East. Even today, the expression is used without any religious connotations. Similarly, Diwali was a big part of Ahmedabad’s culture as mills would give bonuses ahead of the festivities, and the entire market would get energized,” he said. “Even traditionally, the festival and Labh Pancham were the days when the accounts would get settled, and the new account would begin. While the merchants of the past are no more, several of the traditions linger that I believe is the living heritage and should also be conserved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/how-world-heritage-city-nurtures-living-heritage/articleshow/87526371.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Of little traditions continuing through generations||AHMEDABAD: Far from the virtual world of chasing trends and making things picture-perfect only for the reels, ringing in the New Year continues to remain oh-so humble in our very own Ahmedabad. For a section of the business community in Ahmedabad, festivities are way beyond the elaborate charades and little, simple traditions continue to assume importance. Even before one part of Ahmedabad wakes up staring at their screens, drafting text and picture messages to wish New Year their never-ending circle of acquaintances, Gaurang Bhagat, a textile businessman reaches his office at the New Cloth Market, performs the New Year pooja, opens his brand-new bill book, and makes five entries. “After performing the chopda poojan, New Year is a day when we open our shops before sunrise at the first muhurat at dawn. I open the lock of my shop by myself, perform pooja, light the diya and then open the bill book. Usually these are orders from our regular customers, which are pre-determined. But we make the entry on bestu varsh i.e. New Year’s Day,” said Bhagat. Like Bhagat, there are many other jewellers, traders and businessmen, who continue to adhere to the New Year muhurat tradition. For them, New Year means ringing in the new and opening of account books. “We open the shop, perform the pooja and worship a new gold or silver coin every year, which is typically bought and accumulated over the years as a mark of savings. We also have our fixed old customers for years who tend to book their New Year orders with us and it is typically of the same amount year after year. We usually prepare their parcels in advance and ensure that their prized coins and bars are delivered to them. The bills are also prepared on the same day and the entry is made in the book of account,” said Ashish Zaveri, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. With computerized billing, the traditions of maintaining bill books is gradually fading however, most jewellers and traders continue to maintain a physical book for muhurats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/of-little-traditions-continuing-through-generations/articleshow/87526738.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Eternal diyas keep light of unity alive in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: There are three earthen lamps in the Walled City that have been keeping the light of collective faith burning for several centuries. From the lamp kept alive by a Muslim family at Teen Darwaza to prevent goddess Laxmi from leaving the city, to the 227-year-old Dipakji at a Haveli temple in Doshiwada ni Pol to the one at 600-year-old Hasti Bibi shrine at Kalupur — they are living testimonies of how our city, cutting across castes and religions, have bonded over common stories of faith and hope. For the ‘akhand jyot’ at Teen Darwaza, popular lore goes like this: Khwaja Siddiqui, a guard posted at Teen Darwaza in the ancient city of Ahmedabad, stopped goddess Lakshmi from leaving without the permission of Sultan Ahmed Shah. He made the goddess promise that she would wait there till he returned, went to the sultan and asked to be beheaded so that the goddess never leaves the city. A lamp was lit for the goddess and to keep the memory of the guard’s sacrifice alive. Zeenat Bibi (70) and her son Yunus Mirza (46) today continue the tradition of keeping the lamp burning. “During lockdown, we faced difficulties but ensured that the diya never goes out,” says Zeenat Bibi. Similar is the hope placed on Vaishanava ‘Goswami Haveli’ where resides ‘Dipakji’. Legend has it that Goswami Raghunathji built the haveli temple to house the Natwarprabhu idol 227 years ago. Later, his eldest son, Goswami Shree Gopinathji, installed the lamp for important rites. He attained ‘Amrutsanjivini’ and the lamp deposited vermilion instead of black carbon. That year, a get-together was organized where seven people died in a stampede. Legend has it that a miracle brought all seven back to life. “Since then, ‘Dipakji’ gained more acceptance across castes and communities,” says temple priest Goswami Ranchhodlalji ‘Abharan Baba’. At ‘Hasti Bibi No Ghoklo’, children and families are rid of sorrow. When a child is sick, worried parents carry the infant to a tiny dwelling in a Jain neighbourhood which houses the humble shrine or gokhlo (a small hole in the wall with an earthen lamp burning) of Hasti Bibi. “Such is the faith of locals that even during lockdown, traders and residents ensured the lamp never runs out of oil,” says munjawar Mohammed Usman, 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eternal-diyas-keep-light-of-unity-alive-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/87526389.cms||Bharat Yagnik

According to the founder, chairman and MD of AGS Transact Technologies, Ravi Goyal, while digital transactions are growing rapidly, cash in circulation — which used to be Rs 18 lakh crore around the time of demonetisation — has gone up to Rs 29 lakh crore. This indicates that cash is also growing. “We plan to capture the growth in both these areas,” said Goyal. Currently, there are around 40,000 cash-recycling machines — ATMs that allow customers to make deposits and use the same cash for withdrawals. These machines are being deployed by banks in their branches and, with customers getting accustomed to them, banks are looking at deploying them outside the branches as well. The other reason why cash-recycling machines have not replaced all ATMs is that, currently, the big banks deploying ATMs are not part of any interoperability arrangement. What this means is that the network effect does not kick off as customers cannot use any bank’s machine deposits. However, there is a strong push for these recyclers as the RBI has become more stringent with its cash-handling norms. Incidentally, AGS is also a provider of cash management services — both for in-house ATM management services and others. “We are 100% compliant with RBI’s cash management norms and we have been able to pass on the costs to the banks,” said Goyal. Although the promoter is selling stake, the proceeds will be invested in the company by retiring expensive debt, which will help improve its bottom line. AGS Transact Technologies has filed the draft red herring prospectus for a Rs 800-crore IPO, comprising an offer-for-sale from the promoter Goyal. Although the shares are being sold by the promoter, the money will be used to retire company debt which will improve its bottom line, Goyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/atm-co-ags-betting-on-cash-recycling-machines-files-papers-for-rs-800cr-ipo/articleshow/87529410.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Make healthcare affordable: Bajaj Allianz||Mumbai: The chief of India’s second-largest private insurer, Bajaj Allianz, has called for all-round efforts among all players to make healthcare more affordable to ensure that insurance costs do not keep rising. The measures include a cut in GST and widening the coverage of state schemes to cover all citizens. Speaking to TOI, Bajaj Allianz General Insurer MD & CEO Tapan Singhel said that the cost of treatment has gone up in the wake of the Covid pandemic as additional protocols have been put in place. Some of these are likely to be structural. “Insurers cannot change the price for three years and, when the change takes place, customers find it difficult because medical inflation is 15%.” He added, “Health insurance rates always come under focus. However, there are three players — insurers, hospitals and the government. Medical inflation keeps shooting up every year. When it comes to the government, it continues to collect 18% GST on health insurance.” According to Singhel, there is a need to reduce the service tax on health insurance and regulate healthcare so that there are no sharp increases in premiums for customers. “Insurers are already doing their bit as they are losing money in health insurance. The government and hospitals also need to do their bit,” said Singhel. “We have to learn from the government health schemes. I believe that, like the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the state government schemes providing Rs 5-lakh health insurance should be made open to all citizens of the state. This would result in market behaviour improving the affordability of health insurance,” he said. Bajaj Allianz has a reputation for being the most profitable non-life insurer with a razor-sharp focus on its combined ratio (ratio of claims plus management costs to premium). In the first half of FY22, Bajaj Allianz managed to be in the top two — both in terms of top line and bottom line. The company’s gross written premium rose 16.8% in the first half to Rs 7,529 crore, while its net profit grew 8% to Rs 788 crore. “We have managed to retail our position because we never lost our head for acquiring business,” said Singhel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/make-healthcare-affordable-bajaj-allianz/articleshow/87529383.cms||Mayur Shetty

The civic administration on Wednesday night appealed to the residents to get vaccinated as early as possible before November 30, failing which they will be barred from purchasing fuel or undertaking inter-district travel. Dr Paras Mandhlecha, a health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, on Thursday said all beneficiaries should complete their first or second dose as and when the vaccination drive resumes from November 7. “We are taking measures on a war-footing to increase the vaccination coverage in Aurangabad among the left-out beneficiaries. It involves making phone calls to the beneficiaries whose second dose is overdue and arranging door-do-door visits of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) staffers to convince the residents to take the first dose,” he said. The civic administration has also appealed to industries, educational institutes and commercial establishments among others to ensure complete vaccination involving both the doses of their stakeholders before November 30. “As the civic administration decided, the sale of fuel or inter-district travel involving non-vaccinated person will be liable to action under the enabling provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” Mandhlecha said, adding that the Covid-19 vaccines were utmost safe and offer necessary protection against Covid-19 infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vax-drive-to-resume-from-nov-7-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/87528463.cms||---

The market players reported bright sales in sectors like electronic goods and appliances, automobiles, clothes, and jewellery. Ajay Shah, the state senior vice-president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said the market has bounced back this year. “The market is witnessing the activities on par with pre-Covid times. Diwali is serving as an ideal opportunity for buyers who missed out on earlier festival days due to the Covid. Overall, the market is abuzz due to the huge rush of buyers,” he said. The CAIT, along with the local traders’ body 'Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasang' has appealed to its members to ensure strict compliance with Covid norms. “The huge crowd at the market is a risk for all, including the members of business community who get exposed to a large number of buyers. We have asked our members to not lower guards against Covid,” Shah said. While local markets are being thronged by the public since Dhanteras, more vibrancy is expected on the occasion of Padwa on Friday.  Meanwhile, Aurangabad city on Wednesday reported 17 fresh Covid cases, which is a record single-day surge in cases in recent times. The health authorities too have appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary visits to crowded places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-markets-witness-huge-turnout-during-diwali/articleshow/87528457.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Green crackers have lesser amount of hazardous chemicals and create 40%-50% less pollution. People were seen thronging the fire cracker stalls at Bagal chowk, Irwin Christian high school ground, Nirman chowk ground, Khari corner, Paan lane, etc. Akhtar Shikalgar, a fire-cracker shop owner at Bagal chowk, said the easing of restrictions had prompted citizens to buy firecrackers, especially those with less sound. “Business in lakhs of rupees will take place this year in the fire-cracker market, which is a good sign post Covid,” he said. Ranveer Khedkar said he bought firecrackers to meet the demand of his children, who enjoy bursting the crackers as part of the celebrations. “I have purchased all the crackers that make less sound and smoke so that my children are also happy and pollution is also somewhat controlled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/eco-friendly-crackers-light-up-skies-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87528473.cms||---
---||Pune||Type-2 dengue strain max in circulation in Maharashtra: ICMR-NIV study||PUNE: Scientists have attributed this year’s severe outbreak of dengue to a “nasty strain” of the mosquito-borne viral disease. A molecular study of the odd 1,413 dengue infected patients' blood samples at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) has confirmed that dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) is the predominantly circulating strain or serotype in Maharashtra this year. Dengue virus has four distinct strains — DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Treating doctors said they were also coming across patients showing early onset of severe symptoms and rapid progression — some of the fairly identifiable traits of DENV-2. Another important indication coming forth this year is DENV-2’s ability to “superinfect” the previously infected individuals, causing an enhanced or double-antibody response leading to an increased virus intrusion in cells and triggering a severe inflammatory response, higher organ penetration. All these factors are eventually leading to a clinically severe illness. Some of the prominent cities, such as Pune, had three strains — DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 — cocirculating in 2019-20. However, there were comparatively fewer cases. As a part of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), ICMR-NIV supports the state of Maharashtra and Goa to understand the circulating serotypes of the dengue virus. Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been added to the list. The ICMR-NIV Bengaluru field unit supports the state of Karnataka. “For the year 2021, ICMR-NIV has tested 1,413 samples from Maharashtra, 209 from Goa, 28 from Andhra Pradesh and 385 samples from Karnataka. DENV-2 is a predominantly circulating serotype in the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Earlier in 2018, DENV-1 and DENV-3 were the predominantly circulating serotypes in Maharashtra,” an ICMR-NIV official said. In addition to adults, the dengue virus strain is affecting a lot of children too. “This year, we are witnessing more and more children with severe dengue. Hence, it appears to be a more severe dengue season in comparison to the previous years’,” said Deenananth Mangeshkar hospital’s paediatric intensivist, Sumant Patil. “DENV-2 does not have a very specific manifestation separating it from other strains but can be recognized by early onset of severe symptoms and rapid progression," he said. The dengue cases peaked in Maharashtra between August and October this year. “The cases have not come down very much as of now but stabilized and not worsened further,” Patil said. “Some of the northern states such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have an ongoing dengue health crisis in adults as well as in children, mostly related to DENV-2,” he added. Secondary dengue is the biggest risk factor for severe dengue and doctors have been witnessing a rise in such cases over the last four months. “We saw quite a surge in cases of secondary dengue infection this year in the past four months,where dengue is very severe and patients undergo a lot of complications,” said Pune-based physician Abhijit Lodha. During a primary (first) dengue infection, the patients’ IgM dengue antibody levels are very high, but they test negative for IgG dengue antibody. “But in the secondary (second time) dengue infection, patients test positive for both the antibodies. And their IgM antibody levels are lower than IgG. The levels of IgG actually increase during secondary infection,” Lodha said. The state registered 6,374 cases of dengue and 1,537 cases of chikungunya till September 14. Eleven persons have so far died due to dengue viral fever. There were 2,029 cases of dengue and four deaths from the disease and 422 cases of chikungunya were registered during the same period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/type-2-dengue-strain-max-in-circulation-in-state-icmr-niv-study/articleshow/87529271.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Zilla Parishad (ZP) health department is taking steps to increase awareness regarding the importance of vaccination among pregnant women with the help of city-based obstetrics and gynaecologists with the hope that the pregnant women will give priority to vaccination if advised by their gynaecologists. During a special workshop of obstetrics and gynaecologists held by the ZP health department at the health and family welfare training centre located at Shenda Park in Kolhapur, the district health officer Dr Yogesh Sale said, "Till Wednesday, 31,614 pregnant women have been registered, out of which only 5,042 have taken jabs. These women have been asked to take benefit of the vaccination drive held under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan." Dr Satish Patki, renowned obstetrics and gynaecologist from Kolhapur said, "To avoid negative effects of Covid during pregnancy, it is advisable for pregnant women to take the vaccine as early as possible. The vaccinations are safe and can be taken anytime between the first month to the ninth month of the pregnancy. Awareness regarding the vaccine needs to be spread among the pregnant ladies." Other renowned medical practitioners from the medical and gynaecology sector were also present at the workshop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pregnant-women-asked-to-take-jabs-on-priority/articleshow/87528475.cms||---

Citizens were seen lighting lamps, exchanging sweets, bursting fire crackers, drawing rangolis and performing traditional Laxmi puja in the evening. This year, the threat of Covid has reduced and people are celebrating with more ease. With no rainfall, the city roads were packed with people shopping for bhai dooj. As Narak-Chaturdashi and Laxmi puja fell on a single day alike last year, the citizens performed 'Abhyang-snan' before sunrise on Thursday morning after which the families relished on Diwali sweets and snacks. The Mahalaxmi temple in Kolhapur saw a huge rush of the devotees on the occasion of Laxmi puja and long queues were seen. Prasad Prabhu, a resident from Uttareshwar Peth, said “The rituals may vary family to family but generally a Kalash filled with water, areca nut, turmeric and kumkum is placed near the deity, where idol of Lord Ganesha is placed first and then the idol of Laxmi on a yellow cloth. We all worship the items in the house that embody Laxmi, like gold and silver jewellery, currency notes.” Local priest Uday Kulkarni said, “Laxmi puja is the most important puja in Diwali. Every household performs the puja as a thanksgiving to the goddess of prosperity and well-being. On this day, people leave their doors open in the evening to welcome the goddess in their homes.” The rates of the flowers and fruits have increased on the occasion of Diwali and Laxmi puja. Marigold flowers were selling at Rs 120 to Rs 150 a kilo and the mixture of five fruits used in the Laxmi Puja also cost Rs 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/festive-mood-picks-up-on-lakshmi-puja/articleshow/87528501.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Pune||Pune: Air quality best this Diwali since 2019 despite crackers||PUNE: The city recorded the best air quality this Diwali after 2019 on Thursday, SAFAR-Air Quality Forecasting Model of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) data showed. Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration this time was the lowest after that year and second lowest since 2015. Despite firecracker activity in the city, weather conditions and less vehicular traffic had a major role to play in reducing overall emissions in Pune on Thursday, B S Murthy, project director, IITM-SAFAR, told TOI. Average PM 2.5 levels till Thursday night (9pm) were 59 micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3), second lowest to 2019 concentration on Diwali at 37.7 g/m3. The maximum permissible limit for this pollutant is 60 g/m3, thus the concentration on Thursday was nearly on the borderline of this level. Track the pollution level in your cityConcentration of the pollutant above this is considered hazardous to human health. PM2.5 can pose a serious health concern since smaller particles of pollutants ( less than 2.5 micrometers) travel deeper into the lungs and affect breathing. Murthy told TOI, “Traffic emissions seemed to reduce drastically on Thursday. Many roads were free of traffic--Thursday being a holiday and the start of a long weekend. Pollution levels usually are higher on the day following Diwali as pollutants tend to get accumulated in the early morning hours of the next day. So a clearer picture on city’s pollution levels will appear on Friday.” He said that cloudy conditions in the city on Thursday due to a low pressure area over Southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep ensured that minimum temperature in Pune was on the higher side. Thursday recorded a minimum temperature of 19.2 degrees C, nearly 3.4 degrees C above normal. “With higher minimum temperature and relatively windy conditions, pollutants could be dispersed rather than hanging in the air for a longer time. Colder temperature in winter causes the mixing layer height of the atmosphere to reduce or drop. This coupled with calm winds seen during this season causes pollutants to get trapped close to the earth’s surface, hindering their dispersal and causing pollution levels to increase. This was not the case on Thursday,” Murthy further said. Some areas received rain late on Thursday which would have washed away the pollutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-quality-best-this-diwali-since-2019-despite-crackers/articleshow/87529277.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Cloudy conditions keep winter at bay, warmer nights till November 10||PUNE: Winter-like temperatures are taking time to set in over parts of the state, including Pune, temperature data from India Meteorological Department showed. Southern parts of Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra such as Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, are experiencing high night temperatures, a trend that is expected to continue during the next couple of days. Night temperatures are expected to remain above normal in Pune till around November 10-11, Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI. “Minimum temperatures were slowly reducing in Maharashtra before the formation of low pressure area over Southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area started affecting the south-central parts of state’s weather. The low pressure is likely to move north-northwestwards and become more marked over eastcentral Arabian Sea during the next 48 hours. Moreover, a trough in the easterlies also runs from the cyclonic circulation associated with the low pressure over Southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area to eastcentral Arabian Sea off south Maharashtra coast. Both these systems are causing moisture incursion over South Maharashtra, including South Konkan and southern parts of Madhya Maharashtra,” Kashyapi said. Though not much rain is expected except for isolated heavy rain in a few districts of South Konkan on November 5, cloudy conditions are expected to persist in parts of the state including Pune, which will keep minimums on the higher side. “After November 6, slowly the effect of the system is likely to reduce as it may likely to be less significant for the state. Therefore, above normal minimum temperatures are expected to continue till around November 10. This is because remnant moisture from the current systems is expected to hang around in the air till November 9-10,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cloudy-conditions-keep-winter-at-bay-warmer-nights-till-nov-10/articleshow/87529297.cms||Neha Madaan

Apart from the purchase of garments, sweets, decorative items etc, firecrackers are also a major part of Diwali celebrations. According to the firecracker traders, there has been a positive mood in the market as people are buying crackers enthusiastically this year after improvement in the Covid scenario. The traders said they have registered over a 50% rise in sales of firecrackers. Moreover, the demand is mostly for noiseless crackers. Many people have procured firecrackers with noise below 120 decibels. Sachin Patni, a firecracker trader said, “The past one-and-a-half years were very bad for us due to the Covid-19 pandemic as people could not celebrate festivals. Our firecracker business was badly affected during Diwali last year. However, the market sentiments have become positive due to improvement in the Covid scenario.” “There is an enthusiasm among people coming to buy firecrackers. The sales have increased by over 50% this year as compared to the last year,” said Patni. Another firecracker trader Nagesh More said that the demand is mostly for soundless or low decibel firecrackers. “We are seeing this change for the past few years that people are mostly buying soundless crackers,” More added. “We can’t imagine Diwali celebrations without firecrackers. Last year, I did not procure firecrackers due to the pandemic. But since the Covid cases have significantly dropped and the restrictions have been eased out this year, we are buying firecrackers, said Atharva Muikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-50-increase-in-firecracker-sales-this-year/articleshow/87528540.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four Juhu cops who were held for youth’s killing reinstated||MUMBAI: Four police constables attached to the Juhu police station who were suspended and arrested in August last year for killing a 22-year-old man and later chargesheeted have been reinstated by the Mumbai police. The four cops—Santosh Desai (48), Digambar Chavan (39), Ananda Gaikwad (37) and Ankush Palve (35) — had allegedly assaulted a 22-year-old Vile Parle resident, Raju Velu Devendra, on the intervening night of March 29 and 30, 2020, soon after a nationwide lockdown was enforced in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The four policemen claimed that Devendra had been caught stealing by residents of chawl number 5 in Nehru Nagar, who had thrashed him to death. However, Devendra’s family alleged that the mob lynching theory was a cover-up and that he had been killed by the policemen themselves. Lawyer Bahraiz Irani filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in this regard in the Bombay high court, urging it to take action against police brutalities across the state during the lockdown, and the high court directed the cops to take cognizance. A case of murder was registered in August 2020 on the complaint of Raju’s brother Manikam and the four cops were arrested as a departmental inquiry was initiated. “The police had tried to shield the four suspects, who even took away the digital video recorder of every CCTV camera covering the site of incident and tried to pass the incident off as a case of mob lynching,” said Manikam. The special investigation team (SIT) of the police that probed the case on the HC’s order filed, in September 2020, a 450-page chargesheet. The SIT dropped the murder charge against the constables and invoked the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Now with their reinstatement, the four have been posted at different units of the local arms department. Joint CP (administration) Rajkumar Vhatkar confirmed to TOI they had been reinstated. “Can elaborate (on) the criteria for their reinstatement only after going through the case papers,” Vhatkar said. Lawyer Bahraiz Irani said he was shocked that the four cops had been taken back. “ The matter will be taken up when the case comes for hearing in court,” Irani told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-four-juhu-cops-who-were-held-for-youths-killing-reinstated/articleshow/87529324.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: In 4 weeks, civic bodies fine fewer than 500 for flouting Covid-19 norms||PUNE: Marketplaces across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) are teeming with festive shoppers, many of whom are in flagrant violation of Covid-19 norms. But the official figures stand in stark contrast — in the past four weeks, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations together found fewer than 500 people flouting the rules. As per official data, Pune Municipal Corporation(PMC) fined just 454 people for not wearing masks or spitting in public places, while a mere 41 people were punished in Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits. Data available with the district health office shows that maximum action was taken in the rural pockets. While the number of people penalized was not known, Rs34 lakh was collected in fines. On Thursday too, on the occasion of Laxmipujan, huge crowds could be seen at Sarasbaug, while serpentine queues of people were waiting outside Mahalaxmi temple. Many of the devotees or revellers could be seen not wearing masks or flouting social distancing norms. Pune additional municipal commissioner Ravindra Binwade said they were aware of the situation. “We will make sure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed on the rest of the festive days. But apart from action, citizens should also be more responsible and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and take safety precautions at crowded places,” Binwade told TOI. Sanjiv Wavare, assistant health officer of PMC, said the onus was on ward offices to act against Covid norm violations in their limits. While the state health ministry had assured that it would assess the Covid situation post-Diwali, activists are demanding stricter action by the civic bodies during the festive season. Health activist Abhijit More criticised the response by the municipal corporations. “The civic administrations should deter the citizens from violating the norms. Now not only citizens, but even the civic bodies are lowering their guard against Covid, which is not advisable in any case, considering we are still amid a pandemic,” More said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-4-weeks-civic-bodies-fine-fewer-than-500-for-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/87529320.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Vikas Tayade, assistant engineer with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), lodged a theft complaint with the Hadapsar police on Wednesday. Sachin Talewar, MSEDCL Pune circle’s chief engineer, told TOI on Thursday that almost 100 transformers have been stolen so far this year by various gangs in rural areas, causing a loss of Rs2 crore to the state power utility. “It is a matter of concern and calls for immediate attention. We will soon meet the police commissioner to raise the issue and devise a plan for reducing such kind of thefts,” said Talewar. In this case, the culprits chose a transformer which was the primary means for supplying power to water pumps and allied works in agriculture fields around Bhapkar Mala, 20km from Hadapsar. The thieves opted to strike at night, knowing well that the MSEDCL was to effect a shut down for repair and maintenance work, police said Senior inspector Arvind Gokule of the Hadapsar police told TOI, “The culprits removed the transformer, weighing 400kg, and took it to a nearby field. They pulled out copper wires weighing 335kg and oil and abandoned the steel frame at the same place. MSEDCL officials found the steel frame while conducting a search in the area; the frame is barely of any value.” “It is a secluded spot and there is no CCTV surveillance. We are checking with scrapyard owners to see if they were approached by anyone to sell the copper wires,” Gokule said. Thieves usually steal transformers from remote places or areas with low population and dispose of them in the scrap market.  “They get Rs12,000-15,000 for a transformer that costs lakhs,” said Talewar.  Copper wires, plates and the oil recovered from transformers fetch a decent amount of money. An MSEDCL official said organised gangs from within and outside Maharashtra are known to carry out such thefts and they are well-versed with the process of shutting down these units before stealing them. MSEDCL officials said they have urged local residents to keep a watch on nearby transformers, while farmers who get power supply from transformers installed near their farms have been entrusted with the responsibility of guarding them. “Since these incidents happen mostly in the rural areas, alert villagers and a ‘janamitra’ appointed by the MSEDCL are our biggest support,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transformer-worth-rs-2-lakh-stolen-sold-as-scrap-cops/articleshow/87529325.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Nashik||Nashik municipal corporation spends Rs 60 crore on Covid infra||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has spent Rs 60 crore so far on creating coronavirus-related infrastructure and on treatment facilities for Covid-19 patients. In the first wave between April 2020 and January 2021, the civic body had spent Rs 25 crore, and Rs 20 crore during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The NMC has spent around Rs 15 crore so far on the preparation of the third wave of the pandemic. Moreover, it will additionally spend Rs 10-15 crore on various preparations for the third wave. NMC officials said the funds during the first and second wave were spent on creating infrastructure. Infrastructure created in the first wave was used during the second wave. NMC officials said they have converted two civic hospitals - Bytco and Zakir Hussain - into Covid-19 hospitals with a total capacity of around 1,000 beds. Nashik city registered the first Covid-19 positive case on April 5, 2020, and the first Covid-19 death was reported on May 5, 2020. The city recorded a total of 80,717 Covid patients, and 1,039 of them succumbed to the infection in the first wave. The second wave, however, was bigger than the first. The city registered 1.50 lakh Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic, and 2,956 patients succumbed to the infection. There had been a shortage of oxygen during the second wave, as the requirement of oxygen beds had increased manifold. Considering there would be more need of oxygen during the third wave, the NMC has planned to arrange around 1,200 additional oxygen beds. The NMC is upgrading two Covid Care Centres (CCCs) to Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) with total oxygen beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-spends-rs-60-crore-on-covid-infra/articleshow/87528542.cms||Tushar Pawar

The market has been ready for over four years now. VMC has been consistently forced to bring down the lease rates, but it has not worked. Another attempt is now being made by the civic body to attract takers for the market inaugurated in August 2017. The civic body was initially looking for a minimum upset value of Rs 6 lakh which was later reduced to Rs 5 lakh, Rs 3.11lakh, Rs 2.25lakh and, now, Rs 1.5lakh. The interested parties have been asked to submit bids by November 17. The market has been planned on the lines of the one at the VUDA Circle. The VMC plans to have eateries in the market that remain open till late in the night or even early hours. The market has 35 shops out of which four are reserved for persons from the SC, ST or OBC categories. Apart from the shops, the market has facilities like washrooms, a security office and covered sitting areas where people can hang out or eat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lease-rate-for-ajwa-road-ratri-bazaar-hits-rock-bottom/articleshow/87526510.cms||---

With most of the healthcare workers wanting to celebrate the festival with their families along with the drop in in footfall of beneficiaries at vaccination centres, the administration has decided to leave it up to the health staff for taking a decision regarding administering the vaccination. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has already announced its vaccination centres would remain closed on Thursday and Friday, and would reopen on Saturday. However, the exact number of centres that will resume operations on the weekend will be announced later by NMC “We have asked the health authorities to decide among themselves which centres would administer doses and which ones would remain closed. There is no restriction on the number of centres that can remain closed. If a centre has staff that is ready to conduct vaccination they can go ahead,” Ganesh Misal, deputy collector and the district coordinator of vaccination, said. In Nashik district, on Thursday, there were only 39 vaccination centres that were operational with most of them in and around Malegaon.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man convicted for sending ‘flying kisses’, molestation||MUMBAI: Making observations such as “the name and fame of the family of the victim is lowered down due to the incident”, a magistrate court convicted and sentenced a 28-year-old man for sexually harassing and molesting his neighbour by sending her a flying kiss and verbally and physically abusing her when she objected to his behaviour. The court noted that despite all odds, the woman mustered courage and entered into the witness box and underwent the test of cross-examination where she was accused of having an affair with him. The court, however, said it was one-sided love and that was the motive of the accused. “No lenient view could be shown to the accused as the same might convert into grave or very grave offence. Moreover, the name and fame of the family of the informant (survivor) is lower(ed) down due to the incident,” the Kurla magistrate’s court said. The court did not allow the accused Istikar Shaikh’s (28) plea to be released on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act instead of serving a sentence. “In the instant matter, the accused has committed very serious offence, as the same is against a woman. The provision of Section 354 of the IPC is enacted to safeguard public morality and decent behavior. Therefore, if any person uses criminal force upon a woman with the intent or knowledge that woman’s modesty will be outraged (Section 354), benefit of probation cannot be extended to him,” the court said. On June 14, 2019, at 9 am, the survivor’s parents had gone out to work. According to the prosecution, the accused came at the door of her house and started sending flying kisses and making abusive gestures. The survivor told the accused to go away. Enraged, the accused abused her in filthy language. He then caught hold of her hand and dragged her outside. The survivor and her sister screamed for help. The neighbours gathered. Then accused then pulled her stole and touched her inappropriately. Cops were called and the accused was arrested. The court denied the defence claims that the survivor and accused were having an affair and due to a fight she falsely implicated him. “Defence brings no iota of evidence in the line of its defence except by mere suggestions which are denied by the informant and witnesses. One cannot reach to a conclusion that the present complaint is lodged by informant under pressure and aftermath of the quarrel. Thus, the defence of accused is not only improbable to be believed but also flimsy in nature,” the court said.

The WBBSE announced the Madhyamik date schedule on Monday afternoon. The exams will begin from March 7, 2022. Sources said that while students in government and aided schools in the city and major towns in the state had continued studies online, those from smaller towns and remote areas in the districts have suffered due to lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Though the school education department distributed activity tasks to students to regularise their studies, there remain huge gaps. The on-site pre-board exam intends to plug this gap. Swagata Basak, headmistress of Taki House, said, “I feel students need to take at least one offline test before the final board exams, otherwise it will be difficult for them. However, we had taken online pre-test for Class XII and Class X before the puja vacation. ” Parimal Bhattyacharya, headmaster of Jadavpur Vidyapith, said, “I think this should be done a bit earlier so that students can get two months’ preparation time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-schools-mull-offline-pre-boards/articleshow/87529347.cms||---

The officials have also asked the citizens to avoid the use of sanitizers just before bursting crackers. The officials have also warned the citizens against bursting crackers on the roads and storing the crackers near naked flames to avoid mishaps. The fire brigade staff are on their toes to attend any call of duty at any given moment. Sanjay Bairagi, the Chief Fire Officer (CFO) of Nashik fire brigade said, while the children should not be allowed to burst crackers on the road and be supervised and monitored at every point of time, care should also be taken that they do not burst crackers near vehicles. “Bursting crackers near parked vehicles or vehicles parking spaces could be dangerous as even a small spark could lead to a catastrophe. It is, therefore, desirable that the citizens consider the parking spaces and the areas where the vehicles are parked as ‘no-cracker’ zones,” the CFO said. He also noted that very often people tend to bust crackers near sewage pipes “There is always a chance that highly flammable methane and hydrogen sulfide gas produced in the sewers may be finding a way out and when comes in contact with the naked flames or sparks it could tend to explode causing damage to life and property in the vicinity,” Bairagi said. While the Covid infection is still persistent, people should ensure personal hygiene, however, the official warned against the use of santisers just before bursting crackers.

The branch manager Hemantkumar Meena, peon Shailesh Sharma and two others — Vinu and Subham Singh — were booked when the new branch manager found a mismatch in the records of cash in the bank’s ATM. The bank records showed that there was enough cash in the machine, but the ATM’s cash vault was empty. Police said that the theft is suspected to have happened between October 19 and October 28 as the ATM was not working due to technical problems. Just a day before the ATM went out of service, the cash stolen was deposited in the machine. “There was not attempt to forcefully open the machine or damage it. Prima facie it looks as if some insider who knew the password is involved,” said in-charge inspector J G Desai. Bank officials told police that the cash vault of the ATM opens with a key and a password, both of which are with the branch manager. “The manager and peon have been booked for their negligence or their involvement which we are investigating. Two other persons who have also been named as accused are technicians who had come to repair the machine,” Desai said. All four accused named in the police FIR are yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bank-manager-three-others-steal-rs-10l-cash-from-atm/articleshow/87526531.cms||---

As per data shared by the district health authorities, the situation in Sinnar and Yeola talukas — two of the three hotspots in rural areas of Nashik district — has shown remarkable improvement even as cases in Niphad taluka are also decreasing. Active cases in the district had dropped from 735 on October 28 to 678 on Thursday. The number of deaths have also fallen from 21 to nine. “There is remarkable improvement in talukas like Sinnar where cases dropped from erstwhile high of 190 cases during the past three months, while cases in Yeola also dropped from 67 to 32 during the last week. This is helping in curbing the spread of infection,” Dr Anant Pawar, nodal officer for Nashik district, said. Cases in three talukas — Sinnar, Niphad and Yeola — were high because of its proximity with neighbouring Ahmednagar district. In Nashik district, the administration had issued notices to the establishments like shops and agriculture markets, restaurants, grocers, among others for not complying with Covid-appropriate behavior. The health authorities also conducted door-to-door survey and conducted rapid antigen tests of asymptomatic people and RT-PCR of symptomatic people, besides implementing strict containment zone norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/weekly-covid-cases-register-significant-drop-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/87528563.cms||Abhilash Botekar

We have taken their applications and are investigating the complaints. We are expecting many more complaints like this,” said a crime branch official. Senior police officials said that Dalal has formed a group, which the patients, who feel that they were overcharged for the Covid treatment, can approach and give a complaint.  “Though we are investigating the applications, it becomes a bit difficult to prove the charges as the hospital management, in its defence, says that they had informed the patients about the fees well in advance,” the police said. The crime branch, though, has asked the hospital, against whom Dalal had filed a complaint, to furnish all the bills and documents apart from taking statements from the hospital management. Dalal had approached the cops some days ago accusing a hospital of charging excess fees from the Covid patients. She alleged that the hospital collected hefty fees in her name but didn’t pay the amount to her. The hospital management, though, has denied all the allegations and said that one doctor alone can’t manage Covid-19 at any multi-speciality hospital. The management said that there were five doctors and a team of 100-150 medical officers who managed the Covid-19 patients. The management claimed that the charges were as per Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) notification and classification of the rooms as was also per the civic body’s guidance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/11-more-accuse-vadodara-hospital-of-overcharging/articleshow/87526560.cms||---

Cops investigating the Rs 30 lakh fraud committed by Shahid, a resident of Mumbai, and three of his gang members, said he must have targeted people in different states.  “The modus operandi he used shows that he has got an expertise in such rackets. Shahid used to confidently introduce himself as a customs officer and convince his victims by his smooth talk. Though he claimed that he hasn’t cheated anyone else, investigations will reveal about his other frauds,” said a crime branch official. The cops said that he has been ducking questions and his statements have been contradictory. “He has said that he committed the fraud as he had to pay his housing loan. But investigations revealed that he has an expensive SUV to his name. Shahid said that he doesn’t own it but the registration papers have his name as owner. He has been trying to fox the cops by giving confusing replies,” the official added.  A crime branch team will soon leave for Mumbai to gather more details about his background. Shahid told the cops that he had planned to commit the fraud after he saw some videos of black dollar scam executed by Nigerian gangs on YouTube. He came in contact with another key accused Bharat Gida, a resident of Amreli, during his business visits to the state.  Shahid and Gida, who has several offences registered against him, then made plans to dupe businessmen and they roped in two more persons Mahesh Vala and Imran Bhurani. All the four then began scouting for victims and defrauding them. An Ahmedabad-based businessman Maulik Prajapati came in contact with Gida last year and the latter convinced him to invest in black dollars. Gida introduced Prajapati to Shahid, who posed as a customs officer, and offered him lakhs of US dollars for low rates. The gang duped Prajapati of Rs 30 lakh by promising US dollars but handed him bunch of fake currency notes dipped in black colour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/kingpin-duped-many-across-india-owns-suv/articleshow/87526579.cms||---

Police will take stern action against those playing cards and involved in gambling. Police have instructed all hotels and clubs not to give out their premises for gambling. Police commissioner Labhuram said police had made announcements in the jurisdictions of all police stations that they will initiate stern action on gambling during Diwali. “The announcement was made to avoid unnecessary arguments when action is initiated against unlawful acts,” he added. “Police stations already convened meetings with clubs and hotels and asked them not to provide space for gambling. If anyone is found doing so, merciless action will be initiated. We will certainly keep a tab on social clubs and gambling dens during Diwali and will carry out a drive against gambling,” he said. Police teams will keep going on rounds, and they will be on the lookout for clubs and commercial establishments where money is exchanged while playing cards, said police sources. Fearing police action, most of these card-playing sessions have now shifted to private households, social clubs or farmhouses and resorts on the outskirts of the city. Any game where movable or immovable property is transacted is considered to be an act of gambling and is punishable under the Gambling Act. Any game where luck plays a more important role than the skill of the person involved and where exchange of money takes place qualifies as an act of gambling, sources said. Those who are in the habit of playing cards said there is nothing wrong with it. They claim that playing cards and gambling is officially allowed during Diwali and it is not considered as wrong or illegal. Dr MC Sindhur, a social activist and a practising doctor said, “It is a good initiative by the police to create awareness on unlawful gambling during Deepavali. As there is still fear of Covid-19, it is better to avoid social gatherings during night hours and curtailing gambling will help celebrate Deepavali peacefully.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/police-launch-spl-drive-to-curb-gambling-during-deepavali/articleshow/87528987.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The Pune civic administration has carried out a pilot project to deal with problems like dumping of garbage at Yerawada. The civic body has identified 150 public spots, where dumping is rampant. The civic body intends to fine errant citizens defacing public places using AI. Officials said that the civic body plans to use data analytics, AI, machine learning (ML), satellite imagery and e-governance to regularise property tax, illegal constructions etc. Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC, said that the chronic spots would be identified using technology. Mitigation programmes would be carried out after that. “The civic administration plans to use mechanised sweeping machines at chronic spots. The aim is to reduce human intervention in garbage collection and disposal,” said Khemnar. He said that a software has been developed for keeping a watch on garbage disposal. The spots identified using satellite images would be cross-verified by staffers. “Even if garbage dumping does not stop after repeated cleaning, action will be taken against those throwing trash. The offenders will be identified with the help of CCTV footages. They will be fined,” said a senior official. The PMC plans to take the help of technology to collect property tax. The municipal corporation expects to collect more tax from 15 ward offices. Even properties out of the tax ambit will be added into the tax net using technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-use-ai-to-resolve-garbage-dumping-in-open/articleshow/87529362.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Citizens seek more relief, fuel dealers rue losses||PUNE: Transporters and daily commuters on Thursday called for a further reduction in fuel prices, a day after the Centre’s decision to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel. Ali Daruwalla, the national spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, told TOI that there are around 550 petrol pumps in Pune and many of them have suffered losses of almost Rs2 lakh due to purchasing fuel stock at higher prices. “Due to the festive season, dealers had stocked up on fuel from oil companies. It is mandatory for any dealer to have an inventory of three days. With oil companies and banks closed due to Diwali and the long weekend, dealers purchased additional fuel as top up from the companies at higher prices,” Daruwalla said. Fuel prices in the city have been climbing steadily since early this year. Petrol prices breached the Rs100/litre mark in May this year and crossed Rs115 on Wednesday this week. “The state government should also take steps and reduce its taxes, especially VAT, on fuel like other states. Around a dozen states have already announced a reduction in VAT. ,” according to Daruwalla. “Roughly 60% of the cost is via different taxes and 40% is the base price,” Daruwalla said. Baba Shinde, director of All India Motor Transport Congress in Maharashtra, told TOI that a further reduction was necessary. “While the reduced diesel prices will bring some relief, more is required. The prices should be Rs70 per litre and the state and Centre can further help,” he told TOI. Those buying petrol were not too happy with the price reduction. “What good will a Rs5 reduction do? The price of petrol is still more than Rs100. Our monthly budget has gone haywire as the prices of all commodities have also increased,” said Kondhwa resident Nadeem Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-seek-more-relief-fuel-dealers-rue-losses/articleshow/87529375.cms||Joy Sengupta

Most of our streams have attained new peaks. As soon as one branch closed and the next opened, students picked IIT Bombay over the others. This tells us that we are the preferred choice,” said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri. Faculty at IIT-B say it is the quality of education, campus ambience, rigour and research that electrify its academic and social life. “Research and teaching at the IITs, especially the first-generation ones, is comparable at the undergraduate level. I feel it is the perception among students that makes them pick one institute over the other,” said JEE chairman at IIT Delhi Parag Singla. IIT Roorkee opened its computer science stream at rank 32; this college which is celebrating its 175th anniversary has 2 students in the top 250 ranks and both will be awarded the James Thomson Scholarship, which entails a grant of Rs 25,000 per month as stipend. “This has been a long journey. Our current students have been reaching out to aspirants over social media and telling them more about the vibrant campus life, the canteen, our placement drive and the festivals on campus,” said IIT Roorkee dean (students’ welfare) Mukeshkumar Barua. Among the rest, Kanpur, Madras and Hyderabad have quite a few takers from the top 500. There are 23 IITs in all with 16,232 seats. Some IITs have lost sheen over the years though. Once, getting past the gates of IIT Kanpur gave candidates a demi-god status. This year, CS at IIT Kanpur opened at rank 100 to close at 213. Among younger institutes, rank 191 opted for IIT Hyderabad with CS closing there at 520. At IIT Kharagpur and Guwahati, the preferred choice of CS opened at 207 (closing 285) and rank 439 at Guwahati to close at 593.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-quality-of-education-campus-research-electrify-academic-social-life-at-iit-b/articleshow/87529380.cms||---

Rajendra Joshi, a 72-year-old resident of Ellora Park, stated in police complaint that he had purchased a shop in Sevasi for Rs 18 lakh from Jala Satiya in November 2014. Joshi had paid Rs 17 lakh to Satiya and the remaining amount was to be paid at the time of possession of the property. Later, Satiya approached Joshi and convinced him to sell the same shop to a couple who were ready to pay Rs 28 lakh. Joshi was told that the duo can share the profit of Rs 10 lakh equally and his Rs 17 lakh would also be returned. Joshi agreed to the deal and allowed Satiya to sell the shop to the couple. After the shop was sold, Joshi was paid Rs 11 lakh instead of Rs 22 lakh that he was promised. Joshi reminded Satiya to pay him his money. But as Satiya did not pay in all these years, Joshi approached Vadodara Taluka police who registered an offence of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-cheated-of-rs-11-lakh-in-property-deal/articleshow/87526631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After beach, restoration of Mahim Fort on cards; BMC to prepare blueprint soon||MUMBAI: With the Mahim beach beautification project inaugurated in September this year being well received by locals, the BMC has now decided to go a step ahead and work on the restoration of Mahim Fort — a Grade I heritage structure which lies exactly next to the beautified beach portion. While ownership of the fort is with the Customs department of the central government, officials said cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray has been pushing for the project to be taken up by the BMC. This is the first time after independence that restoration of the fort is being planned out elaborately. To begin with, the civic body is looking at removing the large-scale encroachments around the structure. The encroachers are said to have been there since the 1970s and will most likely be given alternate accommodation. The proposal for restoration and rejuvenation of the fort will be prepared after demolishing the illegal structures. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G North ward Kiran Dighavkar said the approximate area of Mahim Fort, a state-protected monument, is 3,796 sq metres. “We have visited the Mahim Fort site and the entire fort is completely encroached. To ascertain the exact status, our office carried out a survey and found that there are 267 hutments and approximately 1,100 habitants residing at the fort. To prevent any untoward incident, it is necessary to vacate the Mahim Fort and provide alternate accommodation to eligible hutment dwellers. Only after demolition of structures around Mahim Fort and evicting the encroachers will it be possible to assess the Mahim Fort and prepare the proposal for repairs, restoration and rejuvenation,” said Dighavkar. As per a report by NGO NAGAR titled, ‘A Rejuvenation Plan for The Historic Forts of Mumbai’, the Mahim fort is entirely encroached by shanties made of various materials, such as brick and wood, with some built along the fort walls. The load on the structure has caused tremendous damage to it, with deep cracks in the walls, raising concerns about its structural integrity. Nayana Kathpalia, trustee of NAGAR, said, “NAGAR was appointed as consultant by the BMC on pro bono basis to make design plans for the buffer area outside Mumbai Fort. While we prepared a plan, the same did not materialise. It is good if the BMC is taking forward the restoration of Mahim Fort as it is an important historical landmark.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-beach-restoration-of-mahim-fort-on-cards-bmc-to-prepare-blueprint-soon/articleshow/87529389.cms||Richa Pinto

HC has asked cops to submit a report during next hearing on November 13 with an explanation as to why the probe regarding the incident be not transferred to CID (crime). A transfer application was filed in HC as there was no development in the investigation being done by the police station. Nehal Gohil, the son of Radha Gohil, a nurse working at a private hospital, was allegedly beaten by the ASI Ravjibhai Sanabhai on April 9 last year. Nehal had stepped out of the house to help her mother who was at the hospital. After the incident, a complaint was given to Panigate police station, but no offence was registered. “There are specific allegations against the cop, but police officials did not do anything about it. Our argument was that because the cop is from the same police station where the complaint was given, officials are trying to protect him,” said Nehal’s lawyer, Nisarg Jain. He added that as there was no progress in the probe a transfer application was filed to let CID (crime) take over the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/guj-hc-seeks-police-probe-report/articleshow/87526644.cms||---

The incident occurred when the elderly woman was sleeping outside her house early on Wednesday morning. The woman Bhurki Bhabhor is a resident of Ranipura village, but had come to Chhaparwad to spend time with her relatives. The leopard bit her on her right elbow and hand. She was initially taken to the referral hospital for treatment. Since her wounds were deep, she was referred to the Godhra civil hospital. Officials of the forest department were also informed by the villagers and were rushed to the area to trace the leopard. Patrolling was also intensified to ascertain if the leopard was still present in the area. No attacks were reported in the vicinity before or after the incident. Sources said that the leopard may have come to the house in an attempt to hunt a goat or hen.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Minor’s evidence ‘unreliable, untrustworthy’, 28-year-old man acquitted of rape, kidnapping||MUMBAI: In a recent judgment acquitting a 28-year-old man of kidnapping, raping and getting a 17-year-old pregnant in 2018, a special court observed no man accused of rape can be convicted if witnesses do not support the prosecution case or give quality evidence, as in the present case, where evidence of the minor was unreliable and untrustworthy. “It will not be out of place to mention that today there is so much public outrage and a hue and cry being raised everywhere that courts are not convicting rape accused. It should not be ignored that the court has to confine itself to the ambit of law and contents of the file as well as testimonies of witnesses, and is not to be swayed by emotions or reporting in media,” the judge said. The minor told court she left home and got the accused take her to Punjab. She said she left as her step brother and uncle were raping her, and even told this to the magistrate when her statement was recorded. The duo was arrested and a POCSO case is pending against them. The court said charges against the accused in the charge-sheet were not made out. “The prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt,” the judge said. The accused has been out on bail. Among witnesses to depose in court were the girl, her aunt and police. The prosecution said the informant was the paternal aunt of the victim who told police the minor did not return home on July 9, 2018, and she had stolen Rs60,000 from the house. When the minor was traced to Punjab, she was seven months’ pregnant. The accused was arrested. In court, the aunt said she told cops the girl was missing but did not lodge a report. She claimed police told her to sign on a paper. The minor told court the accused was her brother’s friend and she liked him, so she proposed marriage. She said on July 9, 2018, she went Dadar railway station and called the accused to meet her. The minor said she told him to to take her to Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minors-evidence-unreliable-untrustworthy-28-yr-old-man-acquitted-of-rape-kidnapping/articleshow/87529414.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The library which has been set up at Govindamoola, in the picturesque village of Malavayal in Sulthan Bathery, Wayanad, will cater to the upliftment of the students of the Paniya community. Community members and those working for the welfare of tribespeople in Paniya said it is the first memorial set up in memory of Karinthandan, a legendary community figure. “This is the first library in the history of the community also. There is no other memorial in the name of Karinthandan in the state. It is believed that he helped the British find the route from Kozhikode to Wayanad through the Thamarassery Ghat. Legend has it that the British shot him dead after he showed them the route. The community members were scattered and moved to various parts of the district following his death,” said Manikuttan Paniyan, a community member. The members of the Paniya community are now spread over four districts---Wayanad, Malappuram, Kannur, and Kozhikode. S Ramanunni, a member of People’s Action For Educational And Economic Development Of Tribal People, who has been working for the welfare of the Paniya community for the past 10 years, said the community members in Vattachira Colony in Kozhikode believe Karinthandan once lived in their colony, where 120 families from Paniya community currently live. “The community has a population of around 92,000 in Kerala. Their literacy rate is around 60% only. We cannot say whether he lived here or not. But the Paniya community members come together on the second Sunday in March every year to walk 14km along the ghat route to commemorate him,” he says. Next year, the commemoration falls on March 13. For the past 10 years, the ‘pilgrimage’ of the Paniya community has continued uninterrupted, even in the face of the pandemic. About around 100 people took part in the walk through the ghats last year. The year before that as many as 1,200 people had taken part in the trek, covering the whole stretch of the ghat route. There were a series of accidents on the route between 1890 and 1900 and it is believed that Karinthandan’s ghost caused the accidents. Finally, it was overpowered and tied to a tree with an iron chain. Even now one can see the tree with the chain on the side of the highway at Lakkidi, Ramanunni said, adding that officials from the archaeology department who inspected the chain estimated it to be 100 years old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/memorial-tribute-to-karinthandan-on-whose-steps-pilgrims-still-walk/articleshow/87568722.cms||T C Sreemol

The direction by a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade came after it was told by MSRTC’s advocates G S Hegde and Pinky Bhansali that one of the two unions has agreed to abide with HC’s November 3 order to refrain from holding the strike from midnight till further orders. The unions had issued a notice that they want an assurance that MSRTC employees will be treated on par with state employees. Hegde said the second union leader Ajay Gujjar has categorically informed MSRTC that he will continue with strike. Before taking any “stern action”, the judges directed Gujjar to explain why action should not be taken against him for willful breach of November 3 order. Gujjar also has to remain present on Friday, “failing which the court will pass necessary orders, including issuing an arrest warrant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-warns-msrtc-union-leader-over-indefinite-strike-threat/articleshow/87529419.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Earlier, Amaravati was having the highest price of diesel in Maharashtra, which is now at third place (Rs 95.73 per litre) after Parbhani (Rs 95.77) in terms of costliest diesel, shows data made available by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited. Aurangabad city witnesses levying of 3% beautification tax on the sale of diesel, which the retailers have attributed for the higher fuel price. Asserting the need of doing away with beautification tax on the sale of diesel in Aurangabad, Aqeel Abbas, secretary of Local Petroleum Dealers Association said the fuel prices should come down further by easing out the burden of different taxations by the Centre and the state. After slashing of fuel prices by the Centre, the highest petrol price in the state at Parbhani from Marathwada is now down to Rs 113.11 per litre. “The sharp rise in fuel prices have inflicted huge losses among retailers. Many retailers had purchased bulk stock of diesel and petrol ahead of Diwali vacations and slashing of prices all of a sudden considerably now has affected the flow of capital,” he said. bhishek Kale, a private professional, said Aurangabad no longer needs beautification tax on diesel. “Aurangabad is a part of Smart City Mission of the Centre, which is ensuring the desired fund-flow for making necessary beautification. The citizens must get rid of local taxation,” he said. In Kolhapur, the prices of petrol dropped from Rs 115.79 per litre on Wednesday to Rs 110.07 per litre on Thursday. At the same time, diesel rate dropped from Rs 105.3 to Rs 92.88 per litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/diesel-rates-in-aurangabad-costliest-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87528224.cms||Prasad Joshi

Petrol prices reduced by Rs 5.85 per litre to Rs 110.42 per litre, the diesel prices have reduced by Rs 12.19 per litre to touch Rs 93.19 per litre. According to petrol dealers, this is a significant drop in fuel prices in a single day. In the past one year, petrol prices have increased by Rs 27.76 per litre to touch Rs 116.27 per litre till November 3 this year. The diesel prices had also increased by Rs 28.85 per litre during the corresponding period. Nashik transporters association (NTA) said that the reduction of fuel prices would give huge relief to the transporters as their profit margin had reduced from 25% to below 10% due to Covid pandemic and rising prices of diesel. Rajendra Phad, president, NTA said the reduction was also a big relief for the construction and automobile industries. “The cost of raw materials like steel and cement had increased due to the rise in fuel prices. Even the automobile sector will get a boost as sales of vehicles will also increase due to drop in fuel prices,” he said. Amol Kulkarni, who works in a city-based private firm, said that the drop in fuel prices was good but it would be even lesser if the state government reduces its taxes on fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/drop-in-fuel-prices-gives-relief-to-transporters-common-people/articleshow/87528221.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Fuel prices drop, sigh of relief across the board||AHMEDABAD: It’s a true Diwali bonanza for commuters and transporters as the state government announced a reduction in value added tax (VAT) by Rs 7 on both petrol and diesel, late on Wednesday. The decision followed the Union government decision of reduction in excise duty by the Union government by Rs 5 on petrol and Rs 10 on diesel. With this, petrol prices settled at Rs 95.13 a litre, whereas diesel cost Rs 89.12 a litre on Thursday in the Ahmedabad market. The last time petrol prices were at this level was in mid-June. After a gap of 38 days, petrol and diesel prices finally witnessed a decline. The last time fuel price declined was on September 28, when petrol was priced at Rs 98.25 per litre whereas diesel cost Rs 96.53 per litre. Petrol price finally plunged below the Rs 100-mark after a gap of 29 days, whereas diesel went below Rs 100-mark after 26 days. Ease in petrol and diesel prices has left manufacturing and transport industries heaving a sigh of relief. “The hike in petrol diesel prices had impacted manufacturing and heavy industries adversely. Transportation costs had gone through the roof and so had freight charges and as a result, the working capital requirements had gone up drastically. However, reduction in taxation and in turn prices of fuel will help ease the cost-pressure on industries and in future, help improve export competitiveness as well,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). Meanwhile, industry experts also suggest that the price reduction will also help sustain the pace of recovery in industrial production and overall economy. “Post Diwali, the pace of demand slows usually. Therefore, duty-cut and tax reduction came absolutely at the appropriate time because it will help sustain the momentum in the market,” Patwari further added. This is the steepest reduction in excise duty as well as VAT on petrol diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-prices-drop-sigh-of-relief-across-the-board/articleshow/87525924.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Ahmedabad||Rush in Ahmedabad's Jamalpur: Flower prices touch the sky||AHMEDABAD: After a dull festive season last year, the flower market in the city has witnessed a 70% jump in demand this Diwali. This has led to a 100% increase in prices in the wholesale market, while retail flower prices have shot up by 150%-200%. Rizwan Arab, president of the Jamalpur flower market said people had mostly stayed indoors last Diwali with restrictions in place. But this year, people are celebrating without fear and the flower market too has opened to booming business. Arab said that the prices had risen riding on demand as there was short supply of flowers from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh where flower crops had suffered damage. “There was heavy rain in October, and the flower crops were damaged in these two main supplying states,” he said. A flower market office-bearer said that on Thursday, in place of the 20-odd vehicles last year, at least 30 vehicles had arrived carrying flowers. He said that it was difficult to estimate the flower sales in the main market as there was also an informal market operating in the area. Javed Raja, a flower dealer, said that the production of flowers this year was much lower than demand, and thus the wholesale prices have almost doubled. “Marigold was being sold at Rs 60 per kg while desi rose ranged from Rs 250 to Rs 350 per kg. The price of rose was about Rs 150 last year and that of marigold was Rs 30 per kg,” Raja said. Ashok Pancholi, a retailer in Navrangpura, said that the lotus flower, which is offered during Laxmi poojan, usually sells for Rs 10, but today it cost Rs 25 per piece. Also, the price of marigold had shot to Rs 80 per kg from Rs 30. Pancholi says that rose was selling at Rs 600 to Rs 700 per kg. He said, “Earlier, if someone bought a rose garland at least 100 to 150 grams of marigold and 10-odd roses were given free, but now this year, the practice has stopped due to high prices,” Pancholi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rush-in-jamalpur-flower-prices-touch-the-sky/articleshow/87526734.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The letter from Theng, has asked the cheie engineer to consider the complaints raised by Jaykumar Phulwani and Nitin Pande, both BJP office-bearers for Manmad, and resolve them at the earliest. Pande, who was among the delegation that met union minister Nitin Gadkari during his recent visit to Nashik on October 5, said, “We raised the issue of Manmad-Yeola road stretch that is in bad shape and the road over bridge (ROB) across railway tracks also needs urgent attention from the authorities concerned as it will ensure the safety of commuters.” The BJP office-bearers claimed that the section of the road was very badly maintained and it was riddled with potholes, while the ROB needed immediate intervention owing to its poor condition. The section concerned is currently part of the state highway hence maintained by the PWD. It is being maintained on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis till 2025. A PWD official said, “The repairs of the road have been carried out and the only issue was the five-decade-old rail over bridge. The department is in touch with the railways and waiting for the structural audit report after which appropriate decision will be taken.” He added, “The steps taken by us would be duly informed to the minister and official concerned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ministry-writes-to-pwd-about-poor-road-condition-in-nashik/articleshow/87528234.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad murder case: Cops carry out ‘Diwali milan’ to find clues||AHMEDABAD: Police officers probing the double murder of an elderly couple have been approaching the public to get some clue about the crime. They have been meeting residents of the Parasmani Flats in Ghatlodia area as guests to wish them Diwali and talk about the incident. The cops believe ‘Diwali Milan’ diplomacy may yield some clue as there was no eyewitness of the case nor any CCTVs were there to capture the accused. A senior police officer said that they have talked with at least 200 persons about the incident. “Initially, people were trying to avoid the cops as they did not want any trouble during the festive season. So, we started talking with people by meeting them one after another very cordially while trying to instil trust in them,” said a senior police officer. It is a blind murder case, where there is no clue, so police have been solely relying upon people’s testimony, he said. On Tuesday night, the couple — Dayanand Shanbaug (90) and his wife Vijayalakshmi Shanbaug (80) — were found murdered at their residence on the third floor of Parasmani Flats. Prima facie, it seemed that robbery was the motive behind the killings. However as investigation progressed, police have found various complexities that rule this out as an open-and-shut case. “No valuables were robbed from the house so we shifted to other angles also,” said a cop. The murder of the elderly couple by slitting their throats on the day of Dhanteras shook the city. This happened around eight months after another elderly couple — Ashok and Jyotsna Patel staying in Shantivan Palace bungalows in Hebatpur were killed by slitting their throats. Box: People sitting outside the flats didn’t see accused The police officers said that the murder took place at around 7pm on Tuesday and at that time, people were sitting outside the Shanbaug couple’s flat and also outside the building there was a crowd, but no one had seen the accused. This strengthened the doubt that the accused might have been hiding either in the Shanbaugh couple’s flat or on the same floor of the building and he might not have run away soon after the killings. Police officers probing the case strongly suspect involvement of some person known to the family in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-doing-diwali-milan-to-gain-peoples-trust-on-ghatlodia-murder/articleshow/87525941.cms||Ashish Chauhan

All these three police units successfully closed over 85% calls received on the Dial 112 emergency response support system (ERSS). The single emergency response number connects a person making an emergency call with the police, fire brigade, medical and disaster management teams.  The service also has automatic location identification of the caller and shares it with the nearest ERSS vehicle or the team on the move. The system is on the verge of replacing Dial 100 service. Washim district with 96% calls completed topped the list, followed by Solapur rural with 94%, Chandrapur 93%, Kolhapur, Amravati city, Mira Bhayander and Aurangabad city completing 92% of the calls received on the number. These units are followed by Nanded with 90%, Yavatmal 89%, Latur 88%, Pimpri Chinchwad, Navi Mumbai and Thane rural with 87% each, Palghar with 86% and Ahmednagar with 85% of completed calls. The other police units of Sangli 81%, Amravati rural, Aurangabad rural, Sindhudurg 80% each, Akola 78% and Bhandara recorded 75% closing of calls. Authorities said completing a call refered to receiving the call diverted by the Navi Mumbai and Nagpur based ERSS command and control rooms, responding to it as per standard operating protocol, including reaching the spot within stipulated time-frame and alerting respective police station for further action. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh has shared the stats with all the unit commanders in the state, while asking the units of Beed (57%), Pune city (56%), Jalna (54%), Nandurbar (40%), Thane city (34%), Dhule and Nashik city (33% each), Jalgaon (27%) and Nashik rural (13%) asking them to improve their performance. The remaining police units in the state have recorded between 75% to 60%. Authorities said that the some of the police units have recorded poorly as, in most of the cases, the tabs given to each of the 112 patrolling vans were found to have been either switched off or due to poor network connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/three-police-units-from-marathwada-in-top-10-in-state-for-emergency-response/articleshow/87528244.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The seven universities include MS University, South Gujarat University, Saurashtra University, Dr Babasahed Ambedkar University, Guru Gobind University and Bhavnagar University, said sources close to the development. In the case of Gujarat University, the term of pro-VC is coming to an end. “All the present vice-chancellors have for long been trying to get another term. Some BJP party leaders are of the view that they should all be replaced with new faces,”said a source. The new education minister Jitu Vaghani, who got the ministerial berth for the first time in the new cabinet that was formed in September, has received a proposal from a senior party leader on these lines, said sources. Vaghani did not respond to calls made on his phone. “The appointment of vice-chancellors should be done according to UGC norms. The entire cabinet was changed recently after complaints were made against the ministers. Presently, there are allegations of corruption in recruitment and construction activities against vice-chancellors. The BJP should implement the no-repeat theory in these universities as well,” said Manish Doshi, Congress spokesperson in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-bjp-go-for-no-repeat-theory-in-appointing-vcs/articleshow/87525975.cms||---
---||Nashik||Strength of elected representatives in Nashik municipal corporation to go up by 11||NASHIK: The state election commission has informed that the strength of the elected representatives in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) will increase by 11 — from present 122 to 133 — during the upcoming civic elections. Initially, after the state cabinet approved the proposal to increase the strength of the local civic bodies, the civic administration had assumed that the strength would go up by 20. An NMC official said it has received a letter from the state election commission outlining that the strength of the elected corporators would increase by 11 and the number of wards would go up from 31 to 44. According to the official, the election commission has directed the civic administration to prepare a draft plan to restructure the wards in order to accommodate the 11 new corporators and submit it by November 30 so that it can be approved or changes can be suggested. “We had already started working on restructuring of the three-member wards as per the directive of the state election commission. But the state cabinet recently decided to increase the members as per the average growth of population,” the official said. “Now, the state commission has informed us about the total members and wards during the upcoming civic elections. Now, we have to restructure the wards as per the fresh instructions,” he added. The NMC polls are due early next year. During the 2017 elections, there was a four-member ward system and one voter had to cast four votes. Last year, the government had introduced a one-member ward system for the civic polls. But after the demand by the different political parties, the state government revised its decision, allowing a three-member ward system for the upcoming civic polls. Currently, the BJP with 66 elected members is in power in the 122-member house. Shiv Sena is the main opposition with 35 seats, while Congress and NCP have six seats each and MNS has got five. The remaining seats are with smaller parties and independents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/strength-of-elected-representatives-in-nmc-to-go-up-by-11/articleshow/87528254.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: I-T official held in Rs 14 crore drug smuggling case||MUMBAI: The city crime branch probing smuggling of drugs worth Rs 14.40 crores have made another breakthrough with the arrest of an income tax (I-T) official who was facilitating a syndicate smuggling drugs from Jammu and Kashmir. The crime branch unit 6 on Wednesday arrested Satish Bhau Padav alias Bapu, who works as notice server with the I-T department in Mumbai. Police said they have informed the I-T department about his arrest. Satish Bapu, 59, has one year to retire. Last month, the crime branch team kept a watch on a specific Santro car at Dahisar check post, and deatined the car with four passengers and charas worth Rs 14.40 crore. The four suspects were identified as Bandu Udanshive, 52, his wife Clera, 52, daughter Cynthia, 23, and son-in-law Jasar Jahangir Shaikh, 24. “During the scrutiny of their mobile phones, we came across a few audio clips where they are heard discussing the drugs and money trail. We learnt that Satish Bapu used to regularly buy charas from the gang and sell it,” said an officer. Police on Thursday took the custody of all the four accused to confront Satish Bapu for various drug dealings. Police said the modus operandi of the gang was to travel to J&K with the women to evade checking on toll nakas. The family resides in Powai. “Udanshive rans a garment business and would take garments in the car to mislead cops. He was arrested with 39 kgs of charas in 2010, too. “While searching the car, we found the contraband hidden in cavities of the car doors and back panel of the boot,” said Datta Nalawade, deputy commissioner of police. The accused told police they would procure drugs from Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-official-arrested-in-rs-14-crore-drug-smuggling-case/articleshow/87529464.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||Armed with reports on runway, pilots to decide if it’s fit to land||KOLKATA: From now, an aircraft captain will take a call on whether the runway condition is fit to land rather than depend on a controller to take the decision. This will be possible following a more detailed reporting of the runway condition as per the global reporting format (GRF), a new runway condition code to improve aircraft safety and enhance passenger travelling experience. Pilots contended the new reporting format would also lead to improved runway maintenance. Unlike the earlier runway reporting format, in which the condition of the entire runway was summarised and given to the ATC by the runway inspection team to help them decide if the runway was suitable for operation, from Thursday, the runway condition began to be reported in three parts — touchdown zone; middle zone and end or rollout zone, each describing the state of a third of the landing strip. For the primary runway at Kolkata airport measuring 3,633m, this means three reports, each of them on a 1,211m segment. The three reports will be conveyed to the ATC that will be uploaded in the form of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), to which all pilots will have access. “Erratic climatic change has been reported all over the world due to global warming. This methodology will improve runway condition reporting of airport and notify pilots about any significant change in runway condition, which will help them decide to land or take off accordingly,” said airport director C Pattabhi. GRF will be particularly helpful in monsoon when pilots will be empowered to take a call on whether they can land on the runway despite puddles in a section or divert to another airport and return when the runway condition improves. Till now, it was the controller in the air traffic control tower, who advised the pilot on whether to land or stay on hold. “For an Airbus A-320 aircraft or a Boeing B-737 aircraft, 2,200-ft runway length is enough for operations. So if the touchdown zone or the rollout zone is slippery or waterlogged, the pilot can decide to land in the middle down or stop before the rollout zone,” said an official. A veteran pilot said the GRF would also ensure better maintenance of the runway, particularly in its brake coefficient. “Right now, the average brake coefficient is reported for the entire runway. So if a particular portion is bad, it does not get highlighted. Now, since different parts of the runway will be reported separately, there will be more prompt action to improve the condition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/armed-with-reports-on-runway-pilots-to-decide-if-its-fit-to-land/articleshow/87529460.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Beed police launch hunt for duo in land fraud case||AURANGABAD: The Beed police officials have registered a case of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and relevant section of Central Waqf Act, 1954 against two, including a dismissed deputy collector, and have launched a manhunt to nab the duo. The police officers said the duo had been booked on the charges of conspiring with a common intention and illegally transferring prime 40 acres of Waqf land under the limits of the Ambhora police station. The offence has been registered on the complaint lodged by Beed Waqf officer Amin-uz-Zama. In his complaint, the Waqf officer stated that the land is located in Devinimgaon and the title of land is with the local mosque. The officer said the alleged illegal transfer of the land had been carried out without the knowledge and consent of Waqf, which is the supervisory, regulatory and monitoring authority for Waqf properties. The illegal and unauthorized transfer of Khidmat-i-mash land that was granted by Nizam, to the forefathers of a private person named as accused in the case, was carried out in connivance with the then deputy collector, who served in the district in 2018. Rahit Bhembre, an assistant inspector, said, “The suspected deputy collector named in the FIR has already been removed from the services. Recently, he was arrested in another land-related cheating case and is currently out on bail.” The official said that police teams have been fanned out to nab the suspected duo. The alleged forgery came to Waqf’s notice after a person identified as Syed Arif Yusuf lodged a complaint in September this year. Accordingly, an internal probe was carried out, following which a police complaint was lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-police-launch-hunt-for-duo-in-land-fraud-case/articleshow/87528257.cms||---

Upadhye demanded Gadakh’s resignation, saying an impartial investigation was not possible as long as Gadakh continued to be a cabinet minister. Gadhakh, a Shiv Sena MLA from Nevasa in Ahmednagar district, denied that Pratik was his PA. Kale, he said, worked in a dental college run by his brother, Prashant. Pratik died by suicide on October 30. Since then, BJP has been demanding Gadakh’s resignation. The minister said the allegations were politically motivated. Upadhye said in audio and video clips issued by Pratik online prior to his death, Pratik has named the minister and his family. “In the audio clip Pratik is heard saying he has been subjected to mental harassment and has named10 persons. But police have filed complaints only against seven and not mentioned the other three who are the minister and others in his last statement,” he said. Upadhye said Gadakh was in a position to influence investigations and hence chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must dismiss him from his ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-sena-min-must-quit-for-pas-suicide/articleshow/87529473.cms||---

Rajesh Gohel, a resident of Ambika apartment in Naranpura, said that his younger brother Nilesh Gohel stays with his parents in Uday apartment near Naranpura telephone exchange. He said that his parents stay in the half portion of the house and Nilesh and his family live in the rest of the house. On Tuesday evening, Rajesh went to meet his parents at their home and found that Nilesh’s swing was lying on the side of his parents’ house. Rajesh said that it was obstructing his parents’ movement, so he decided to remove it from there to put somewhere else. He said that he first told Nilesh to remove it from his parents’ house but rather than removing it, he started a heated argument with Rajesh. After that, Rajesh himself began removing the swing from there but it did not go well with Nilesh who brought an iron rod with which he attacked his elder brother indiscriminately. A neighbour Mahesh Barot who tried to rescue Rajesh also got hurt in the attack and Rajesh’s wife Nisha who tried to rescue him, was also attacked, mentioned the FIR. Rajesh alleged that Nilesh threatened to kill him if he would ever touch the swing. Rajesh later approached Ghatlodia police and filed a complaint of causing hurt, criminal intimidation and uttering of abusive words against Nilesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/brawl-between-brothers-over-removal-of-swing/articleshow/87525997.cms||---

On Thursday, he spoke at the United Nations COP26 on social empowerment through solar technologies. Basak, who is currently undertaking PhD in sustainable and energy-efficient container farming at TERI school of advanced studies, addressed the audience of global leaders and change makers. The UK is currently hosting the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. The COP26 summit has brought parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. For the first time in COP history, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), in partnership with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), is hosting a dedicated SDG7 Pavilion in the Blue Zone at COP26. The pavilion brings together SDG7 stakeholders to mobilize and connect bold commitments and actions for energy around the world. “I am feeling privileged to be sharing a global stage with such illustrious personalities like Jon Lane, head of Energy Access of Carbon Trust, Anne Sonogole of ACCESS Coalition, David Lecoque, CEO Alliance for Rural Electrification,” said Basak. Earlier, Basak had hit the headlines by developing a solar-powered fodder unit that can generate 50kg fodders per day. Their hydroponic fodder unit could cost farmers approximately Rs 15,000, including solar panels, control systems and other inputs. The unit employs solar power without rising costs for converting DC energy to AC (alternating current).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-boy-youngest-speaker-at-cop26/articleshow/87529470.cms||---

Cops said the accused had entered the house on Monday evening on the pretext of meeting Renuka between 6pm and 6.30pm. Dhal reportedly told the interrogators that he had hidden under Renuka’s bed till close to midnight, when he smothered her to death and fled with her belongings. He allegedly took with him the victim’s ornaments and two mobile phones. Cops are still not convinced of the claims regarding his entry into the house on Tuesday evening. “We have still not ruled out the possible involvement of others in the crime,” said an officer. Cops said Kumar had run into major debts and he was also into gambling. “He was desperate to raise some money and had returned to the victim’s house on consecutive days to know about the movements of the Chowdhurys before striking here. He had recently mortgaged his two-wheeler,” said a police source.

After having killed Chaki and his driver Rabin Mandal, with the help of his mother, Mithu, and four others, Vicky was disappointed for not being able to rob much. So, he tried to make some money by using Chaki’s cellphone that he had stolen. Desperate to make one last attempt, Vicky, who had reached Sarisha in South 24 Parganas on October 18, day after committing the crime, tried to transfer money from Chaki’s account to his own. He hoped that Chaki’s banking details had been stored in the phone. Vicky had inserted another SIM card and tried to hack into Chaki’s mobile banking system. However, when his attempt failed, he decided to flee from the city after collecting around Rs 6,500 from his employees and depositing the stolen items in lieu of money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/accused-tried-to-get-chaki-bank-info/articleshow/87529526.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Not even 50% of 45+ population in Maharashtra are fully vaccinated against Covid||MUMBAI: One of the key factors that could make a dent in hospitalisations and deaths should a third wave occur would be the vaccination of vulnerable age groups. The Union health ministry and the World Health Organisation have often reiterated the importance of immunizing the 45-plus population as severity of Covid and deaths are higher in this age group. Yet, state numbers suggest coverage of the 45-plus population is far from desirable. Numbers reveal that not even 50% (46%) from the 45-plus age groups have taken both shots despite vaccination being open to them since April. District-wise numbers give a grim picture. Not a single district in Maharashtra has reached even 80% double dose coverage for this highrisk age group. Sindhudurg is the only district that has covered 77.5% of this population with both shots. Even Mumbai is lagging and has managed to cover just 68% with both doses. In fact, as many as 13 districts are below the state average of 46%. Lowest are Hingoli and Aurangabad where barely 29% have got both the shots. Closer to Mumbai, Palghar has given two shots to 32% people above 45 years. In Hingoli, Nandurbar and Aurangabad, even the single dose coverage is less than 60%. The state Covid taskforce had said in the past that Maharashtra must cover at least 70% people in the vulnerable age groups by October. “Vaccination, isolation, contact tracing are some of the key tools to stay ahead of the virus. We mustn’t make the same mistakes we did between the first and second waves,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid taskforce, adding that immunization must be expedited. Maharashtra has an adult population of 9.14crore eligible for immunisation. Of that, 3.51crore people are above 45 years age, while another 5.6crore people are in the 18-44 years bracket. In absolute numbers, nearly 2crore people above 45 years are waiting to be fully vaccinated. A state official said districts have been repeatedly told to better their coverage of the 45-plus and senior citizens. “More than 80% of Covid deaths in the state have occurred in people above 45 years and with comorbidities. Hence, districts must understand the importance of vaccinating this age group on priority,” the official said. Officials from Aurangabad, which is among the 48 districts pulled up for poor vaccine coverage by the Centre, said they will kickstart door-to-door drives shortly. Hit by lack of stocks initially, the district was ravaged by rains for several months. “Post Diwali, we will target all age groups,” said Dr Sudhakar Shelke, district health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/not-even-50-of-45-popln-in-maharashtra-are-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/87529509.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Kolkata||Report with screenshot if app cab cancels: Kolkata Police||KOLKATA: With app cabs cancelling bookings at the drop of a hat nowadays, traffic police has requested passengers to take a screenshot of their bookings and report refusal to them along with the date, time, location and other basic details. Rampant cancellations had started during the festive season and the problem assumed alarming proportions after the massive hike in petrol and diesel prices. The police top brass has asked the public grievance cell of the traffic unit to look into each allegation and take “appropriate measures”. Cops announced the strong measures following multiple complaints on the Kolkata Police Twitter account, where passengers claimed app cab drivers had cancelled their booking after knowing their destinations even during the day. “A long-term solution, involving all stakeholders, is being planned to stop passenger harassment,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. The police are not limiting their action to individual cases. For a longterm solution, they plan to ask all app cab aggregators to share their cancellation policy. “We will ask about the permit provisions. App cabs are not like normal state carriages which can be flagged down on the road. It is booked through an app service where the companies are not even owners of the car. Hence, they enter into a contract with multiple clauses with their driver partners. We need to study the agreement to decide on punishments these violations can attract,” said a senior traffic department officer. When contacted, the city’s two biggest aggregators said they would “get back soon with their cancellation policy”. “We have a very passenger friendly policy. We will share the details right after Diwali,” said one of them. App-cab drivers cited the lack of passengers on return journeys and the destinations being far away from cabbies’ homes as the major reasons behind cancellations. App cabs in Kolkata had gained popularity given the frequent refusals by yellow taxis drivers at that time. In fact, then transport minister Madan Mitra had launched the “No Refusal” taxi movement to stop errant drivers from denying passengers rides. But with time, the practice seems to has crept in even among app cab operators. “I was heading to a hotel in Rajarhat barely 5km from the airport. But three drivers cancelled my trip upon hearing the destination. A fourth one finally agreed,” said Namrata Sharma, a businesswoman from Guwahati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/report-with-screenshot-if-app-cab-cancels-police/articleshow/87529522.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

For the quarter ending September 30 this fiscal, the company reported sales of around Rs 1,689 crores, a 48% increase over the same quarter previous fiscal, 45% higher than the preceding quarter. Both of its domestic and export businesses grew by double digits annually and sequentially. Despite improved revenues, Cummins’ sequential profits fell 6% to around Rs 220 crore.  The company was bullish on future prospects, despite issues in the supply chain. “With near normal monsoon, we expect that rural demand will be sustained. Similarly, the continued focus of the government on infrastructure is helping in economic recovery. With abating Covid-19, economic recovery is visible across various economy segments, and demand in some segments has reached or exceeded the pre Covid level. Supply chain remains constrained, however, there are improvements visible in some areas, especially on locally produced parts. Rising commodity prices, coupled with the recent development of shortages in silicon, polymers and coal, may have a cascading impact on supply chain and material cost,” said Ashwath Ram, MD of Cummins India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cummins-reports-revenue-growth/articleshow/87529089.cms||---

Pump owners, on the other hand, complained of losses up to Rs 10 crore as they had stocked huge quantities of fuel three days ago at the “hefty rates”. Once the Centre reduced excise duty by Rs 5 (petrol) and Rs 10 (diesel), the VAT automatically reduced by over a rupee and over Rs 2.40 for petrol and diesel, respectively, said dealers. Asked if the state government has plans of offering a similar cut in duties, a senior bureaucrat said: “Nothing as of now. The VAT got reduced due to the ad valorem effect. Rate of VAT taxation is the same at present.” Former CM Devendra Fadnavis tweeted: “Our request to Maharashtra government that diesel and petrol cost can be reduced by Rs 20 and Rs 10, respectively, in the state like we reduced earlier during our government.” Dealers too demanded reduction in VAT and surcharge.

The reduction has taken the price of diesel to what it was during the second week of this June and petrol to what it was in the second week of October. “It is a great beginning for the Diwali weekend as I fill up my SUV’s tank with diesel. I am excited to see the rate drop by 12% overnight and this means big savings,” said Sunil Karandikar, an IT professional in Bhandup who drives to work. Bikers too saved at least 5% of what they would pay the previous day. Petrol pump owners were left sulking. “Diesel dealers on the highways and outskirts of the city suffered huge losses on Thursday as they had stocked much more than the petrol stock,” said former Petrol Dealers Association president Ravi Shinde. The dealers are upset as their commission has not been revised for nearly five years, and now it has further dropped due to the duty cuts. The price of petrol in neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai was Rs 110.12 and diesel Rs 94.28 on Thurday. Parbhani has the highest petrol rate in Maharashtra even after it came down to Rs 113.17. The highest diesel rate in Amravati dropped from Rs 108.22 to Rs 95.74 per litre. Bal Malkit Singh from the All India Motor Transport Congress told mediapersons that prices could further go down if the VAT and taxes in Maharashtra were brought on par with neighbouring states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-car-owners-save-rs-400-200-at-fuel-pumps-bjp-wants-state-relief-too/articleshow/87529525.cms||Somit Sen

You are showing us a five rupee note. A minimum fuel reduction of Rs 25 was required and then Rs 50. What kind of heart wants to increase prices by Rs 100 and decrease by just Rs 5?... These days will pass in 2024,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut said. The Centre woke up after BJP faced massive defeats in bypolls across the country, he said. “If we want to make petrol cheaper by Rs 50, we will have to defeat BJP all over the country… The atmosphere in the state today is not against the government, but against the opposition,” he added. Raut said fuel prices are controlled by the Centre and not the states. The state government is discussing cutting state taxes on fuel too. “Discussions are underway. The Maharashtra government has raised questions regarding inflation. But the central government is responsible for all this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bypoll-losses-shook-centre-state-mulling-cuts-says-raut/articleshow/87529528.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai's air quality moderate on Diwali as wind, temperature normal||MUMBAI: Despite firecrackers, fears of heavy pollution on the Diwali evening of Thursday did not materialize as the city reported a moderate air quality index (AQI) of 150-165, all thanks to near normal temperatures, humidity and wind speed. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), though, has predicted that the AQI could deteriorate to the very poor category in the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, and the most polluted areas are expected to be Navi Mumbai, BKC and Chembur. Firecrackers usually aggravate existing pollution. By comparison, Diwali in the pandemic year of 2020 had seen a poor AQI of around 270 despite fewer crackers while in 2019 the air was cleaner with better air quality due to low temperatures and gusty winds. Track the pollution level in your citySince earlier this week, the city’s AQI had been in the poor category, between 201 and 300. There were apprehensions it would breach 300 to very poor category that can cause respiratory illness in case of prolonged exposure. Moderate AQI causes breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases. The main reason for poor to very poor AQI, say experts, is low breeze and high humidity, due to which smoke from vehicles, garbage burning, industries and crackers, and construction dust do not disperse. On Thursday, temperatures, wind speed and humidity were close to normal. In the AQI, the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 mainly decides the quality of air as its presence goes up in case of heavy polluting activities amid high humidity and low wind speed. The AQI starts deteriorating when winter approaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-air-quality-moderate-on-diwali-as-wind-temp-normal/articleshow/87529538.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

On Thursday, the state Covid update showed 1,141 new cases and 32 deaths. None of the major regions had over 500 cases, with the Mumbai region (including eight municipal corporation areas, apart from BMC) registering the highest at 494. Pune (306) and Nashik (231) regions were the only other areas with a three-digit tally; the rest had less than 50 cases each. In Mumbai, the BMC update showed Thursday’s cases had dropped below 300 (252) after a slight rise on Wednesday (319). The city registered six de aths. “The Covid infection is under control, with no spike in cases despite a rise in socializing and crowding across the city,” said a BMC official. The state’s caseload since March 2020 stands at 66 lakh, including 7.5 lakh in Mumbai, and the statewide toll is 1.4 lakh, including 16,265 in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-12th-day-in-a-row-maharashtra-daily-tally-below-1500/articleshow/87529560.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai faces last-mile hurdle to 100% single Covid vaccine dose feat||MUMBAI: Even as Mumbai’s single Covid-19 vaccine dose coverage is nearly 99% and double 60%, local ward offices are finding it difficult to walk the last mile. Ward officers said while they have been able to track the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated in large housing societies, slums are not that easy to monitor. Some wards, for instance, have issued letters to housing societies, requesting the vaccination status of the eligible population in their buildings, including the house help, gardeners and laundry men, among others. A ward officer, though, said, “In the case of a standalone building or a housing colony with a few buildings, this is still possible. But if it’s a large society, there are again challenges as getting the vaccination status of those who live on rent is not possible, even for the office bearers as communication with such persons is limited.” Last month, the BMC had conducted a vaccination camp within the G P Nagar slum locality in Dahisar which has a population of around 50,000. Former Shiv Sena corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar said while the plan was to vaccinate 12,000, they could manage to give the jabs only around 4,000. “The response was not as we had expected. However, the reason could also be that vaccine availability improved only from August in the civic centres and people began coming to take their first dose. In that case, there is still time for them to get the second dose, considering the minimum 84-day gap between doses,” said Ghosalkar. Problems such as vaccine hesitancy are being seen among several semi-literate citizens, say civic officials. Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical health officer, M-West Ward, said in slums there are some who continue to be misinformed about the vaccine and its efficacy. “We are hence taking help of local community influencers or asking community health workers to bring such persons to the vaccine centres and requesting them to take a shot,” said Patil. Goreagaon corporator Srikala Pillai, whose ward largely comprises slums such as Bhagat Singh Nagar 1 and 2, Laxmi Nagar and Indira Nagar, too, said, “Those who are semi-literate have wrong notions about taking the vaccine. In slum pockets, most youngsters have taken the shots as workplaces or local train travel mandate two doses. But some in the adult population are still left. Apart from going into these pockets and initiating vaccine drives, I am offering free cloth bags and face masks, for which many come forward. And then we check for their vaccine status and if not vaccinated, they are administered a dose,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-faces-last-mile-hurdle-to-100-single-dose-feat/articleshow/87529562.cms||Richa Pinto

Vijaypat and his son Gautam, who is chairman of Raymond Limited, have legally clashed over the release of the book, with the latter claiming its contents are defamatory. Vacation judge Justice Surendra Tavade passed the interim order on a contempt petition by Raymond Limited against Vijaypat, Macmillan Publishers India Pvt Ltd and Amazon India, stating that the book was released on November 1. In April 2019, a Thane court had restrained Vijaypat and an erstwhile publisher from publishing the book. Raymond has urged HC to restrain the respondents from further distributing, selling or making the book available. The court’s order said it appears that Vijaypat has published the autobiography in spite of an injunction order against him. He noted that the book is on sale digitally and in hard copy on Amazon and is required to be stopped. “ I am of the considered opinion that further damage is required to be averted by issuing the injunction order as prayed for,’’ said Justice Tavade, posting the hearing on November 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-restrains-distribution-of-industrialists-autobiography/articleshow/87529569.cms||---

He has been admitted to a private hospital at Koregaon Bhima and his condition is stable. The incident took place when Sarde went to water his cane farm. Range forest officer Manohar Mahisekar of Shirur forest range told TOI, “The victim is a resident of Perne village. He went to water the farm and was not aware of the presence of the animal in the locality. Sarde told us that the animal suddenly appeared before him and attacked him. He has sustained deep injuries on his cheek, head, and hands.” Local residents took him to a private hospital. “As per government norms, his injuries are of ‘severe’ type, and he will receive Rs1lakh compensation. The state government will bear the cost of his medical treatment,” Mahisekar said. The farmers in the village are scared and have demanded that a trap cage be placed in the area. “We have carried out an inspection of the site and found leopard’s pug marks on the field. Based on that we have submitted a report to the state government for permission to place a trap cage in the village,” said Mahisekar. Officials said that the village has a vast area under sugarcane cultivation and hence it would be difficult to trap the animal immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmer-injured-in-leopard-attack/articleshow/87515885.cms||Sandip Dighe

DPUE director Snehal Rayamane said the new mode, to be introduced for the first time, is to face the unforeseen exigencies arising during the final examination of II PU. “If we are unable to conduct board examination, DPUE will consider mid-term marks as one of the criteria to award results,” Snehal told TOI. Last academic year, II PU examinations were not held due to the pandemic, because of which all students were declared pass. They were promoted based on their SSLC and I PU marks, internal assessment and grace marks. Pre-pandemic, colleges were given the liberty to conduct mid-term examinations and award marks. However this time, DPUE will give question papers to all colleges. Snehal said: “DPUE will set question papers and issue them to all colleges across the state. The exam will be conducted at each college campus and evaluation is centralised, which is similar to I PU terminal examination.” According to Snehal, the new arrangement will help students gauge their academic performance. “Last academic year, all I PU students were promoted to higher class without any examination. This mid-term examination will help them know their learning capacity,” she added. The official calendar of the II PU mid-term examination will be issued within a week. Vittal K, principal of Kittel Memorial PU College, welcomed the new arrangement. “We were battling to come up with a clear roadmap for the next PU final examination in case of cancellation or unforeseen events due to the pandemic. The new mode, being a good initiative, will preepmt confusion,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dpue-plans-mid-term-exam-for-ii-pu-students/articleshow/87528730.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Anil Deshmukh questioned; son to appear before Enforcement Directorate too||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday interrogated former state home minister Anil Deshmukh (72) for nearly five hours in the Rs 100-crore money-laundering case as his lawyer Inderpal Singh sat “at a visible distance”, as directed by the Bombay high court. Later, Singh told mediapersons that Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh will also appear before the ED. Hrishikesh, an accused in the case, had been evading questioning by the ED for months despite several summons. Deshmukh too had avoided five summons and appeared before the ED office on Monday unannounced after both the Bombay high court and Supreme Court refused to grant him relief. The ED had arrested Deshmukh early Tuesday stating that he was not cooperating in the probe during the questioning. The same day, he was produced before a special holiday court, which remanded him into ED custody till Saturday. On Thursday morning, ED officials took Deshmukh to a government hospital for routine medical examination and brought him back to their Ballard Estate office around 1.30pm. Half an hour later, they started questioning Deshmukh, which went on till 6pm. The ED is investigating the money-laundering case based on the CBI FIR where former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh had asked now-dismissed API Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. The ED remand stated that Deshmukh, by virtue of his position as state home minister, received around Rs 4.7 crore. Deshmukh’s CA, Sudhir Baheti, told the ED he had introduced Delhi-based hawala operators to Hrishikesh to legitimize the cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-questioned-son-to-appear-before-ed-too/articleshow/87529600.cms||Vijay V Singh

Ambica Prabhu, Rupa Bhatt and Mona Singh are the teacher mentors from Kalmadi High School, Baner and Megha Gupta, Jayashree Ghorpade, and Rashmi Bindra are the teacher mentors from Vidya Valley School. The project has been conceptualized by principal Lakshmi Gandhi of KHS Baner, Jyoti Kumta, and Ipsita Rodricks (VVS).  Just like the river changes its course there might be some changes or some bumps on our way but the thought is that if we could change the mindset of 10% of the people then we will consider ourselves to have achieved our goal, the team said. With this thought, the two schools decided to do some hands-on work to break away from traditional learning. The Ramnadi confluence is filled with heaps of plastic and glass bottles, discarded boxes, worn-out old clothes, household waste, among other garbage. The children and the teachers recently took a walk by the river and cleaned a bit of the area. They also learnt how the river paves its way and creates a niche. It was a site of great learning about biodiversity too with some birds and the different trees.  Mukund Singh Negi gets FAP national award Mukund Singh Negi was given the FAP (Federation of Private Schools and Association of Punjab) National Best Teacher Award-2021 for his 26 years of commendable services as a PE teather.

Ward councillor Kasthuri M S submitted a letter to Mayor Arya Rajendran on Tuesday citing the immediate need for a retaining wall along the canal. In her letter, she has also flagged concerns of local residents about encroachments in the canal. Dev, a 10-year-old died on Sunday after slipping into the stream in front of his house. The child went missing around 4:30 pm. The stream is too lengthy and slabs were constructed in front of each house across it. “Lack of a retaining wall here has made it extremely dangerous. During heavy showers even the residents here are unable to distinguish between road and canal. To add to the issues, encroachments have also been reported in the area. I have written to the mayor and secretary to take immediate action,” said Kasthuri who added that unscientific construction of slabs over the canal even made rescue operations difficult. “The fire force team who reached the spot had a hard time trying to retrieve the boy because of uneven construction of slabs,” she said. The child went missing after his father went to a shop. When the parents could not find the missing child they understood that he must have slipped into the overflowing stream. Thus, the villagers and fire force officers started searching in that direction. “When I came to know about the incident, I went to the nearby pond, as the stream flows into it.The body was stuck on a tree branch in the stream. We swam there and pulled the body out of the water,” said Girilal T G, who pulled the body from the stream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/residents-demand-retaining-wall-along-canal/articleshow/87494972.cms||---

In an editorial in the party mouthpiece, Saamana, the Sena said that those who want to “explode bombs” after Diwali were free to do so, but they must check if there is any gunpowder left in their bombs. The editorial, ‘Shiv Sena’s Diwali’, said that just before Diwali, the light in the BJP’s lantern had faded out. “These are not good signs. The results of the by-elections are a slap on their arrogance, and this shows that they are not invincible. The BJP has no party workers of its own and they are somehow managing to beg and borrow candidates from other parties. But the people eventually defeat them and this was seen in Deglur. The BJP doesn’t have any workers who agree with their ideology anymore, and from now on, they can get officers from CBI, ED and I-T to contest on the lotus symbol for the party. This has become the talk of the town now and the BJP is responsible for this,” the editorial said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-taunts-bjp-over-ls-assembly-bypoll-losses/articleshow/87529603.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Wilson College gets autonomy; in over 2 years, two-fold rise in such colleges under Mumbai University||MUMBAI: The 185-year-old Wilson College at Chowpatty was granted autonomy by University Grants Commission (UGC) on Wednesday, taking the total count of autonomous colleges affiliated to Mumbai University (MU) to 46. The state now has 122 autonomous colleges, of which the most, around 38%, are from MU. The number of autonomous colleges under MU rose two-fold in over two years. Maharashtra is second in the country, after Tamil Nadu, to have the most autonomous institutes. With flexibility in assessment and curriculum, simplified process and the new National Education Policy (NEP) pushing for more autonomy, more colleges are opting for it. Vijay Joshi, chief consultant for Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) – Maharashtra, said, “With the NEP pushing for more autonomy, colleges have realised that it is the way forward. Autonomous colleges can have a robust evaluation system, flexibility in curriculum and many good ones are now experimenting with newer ideas,” Joshi said, adding that the state’s autonomous colleges also received more grants under RUSA as compared to other states. “Eligible colleges with an ‘A ‘grade in NAAC should opt for autonomy as it is an academic experiment worth considering in response to fast changing disruptive innovation economy,” he said. Many prominent colleges in the city, including St Xavier’s, Jai Hind, Ruia, Podar, NM, Mithibai, SIES, Sophia, already have autonomy. After autonomy, Wilson College will consider offering BSc courses in artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and cyber security, said director (education), TA Shiware. Courses in medical operation technology with Saifee Hospital, fashion journalism and film direction are also on the anvil. “Autonomous colleges should take more initiative in offering students a ‘cafeteria’ approach. They need to offer more skill-oriented industry courses and publicise them. Earlier, starting a new course, under the university would take a minimum two years. With autonomy, you can do it in no time. Currently, only about 20-30% colleges are using autonomy to optimum level,” said Shiware, who is also president of Association of non-government Colleges. Even as new courses are offered, these colleges should ensure fees are moderate and affordable, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wilson-gets-autonomy-in-over-2-yrs-2-fold-rise-in-such-colleges-under-mumbai-university/articleshow/87529607.cms||Yogita Rao

The accused are a father-son duo. The father is a retired bank manager whereas his son is a software engineer who works in Dubai. The incident reportedly took place around 11pm on Wednesday, where victim Vinayak Kamath,40, a resident of Veera Venkatesh Apartment near the Mahammaayi Temple at Car Street was stabbed by Krishnanand Kini,75, and his son Avinash Kini. Complainant Amani Kamath, the wife of the victim, in her complaint, stated that she was married to victim Vinayak Kamath, and they have a three-and-a-half-year-old son. She works as a tailor. A few days ago, there was a minor scuffle between Vinayak and the accused over repair works in front of the apartment complex where work under the Smart City is under progress. Amani stated that the father-son duo got upset after Vinayak allowed a person to drive a vehicle over concrete that was laid a few hours back, in front of the entrance, to come inside the apartment complex. On Wednesday night, Vinayak objected to children from the third floor bursting crackers at the apartment, and complained that it was causing a nuisance. However, accused Krishnanand and his son supported the children. This snowballed into a heated argument between the victim and accused around 11pm. In the melee, Avinash manhandled Vinayak and his father Krishnanand stabbed the victim several times on the chest, arms and neck with a knife. The victim was immediately rushed to a nearby private hospital and died around 1.40 am, as he failed to respond to treatment. A case has been registered at the Mangaluru North police station. The accused have been arrested and produced before a court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-stabbed-to-death-after-dispute-over-bursting-crackers/articleshow/87528744.cms||---

A tumour compressing her optic nerve threatened to rob her eyesight. Several doctors and hospitals assured that the tumour, which threatened to reach the brain if not operated upon, can be removed. But along the tumour her eye also would have to be extricated, leaving her visionless in one eye. However, Jivani has not only been cured of the tumour but retained her eye as well as the eyesight she had when the tumour developed. In what is being claimed as the first such surgery using the modern 3D technology, a team of doctors led by retina ocular trauma surgeon Dr Parth Rana, director of city-based Netralaya Hospital, removed the tumour without having to sacrifice her eye. "She suffered from an extremely rare condition called optic nerve sheath meningioma. This is a very rare condition with meningioma, a tumour that arises from the membranes around the brain and spinal cord,” he said.  Unfortunately, it was right behind the eyeball and of the size of an eyeball. Had it not been removed, chances were high that it would have compressed her optic nerve, leaving to vision loss, or even reached the brain," Dr Rana told TOI. Jivani, a housewife, started having frequent bouts of dizziness a a year ago. She was later operated upon by a neurosurgeon and was stable for one year. She was stable for a year but started complaining of vision problems within a month," Dr Rana explained. A repeat MRI revealed that the optic nerve was getting compressed and the tumour was growing right behind the eyeball. Dr Rana said such cases are very rare, maybe one in one lakh. "The condition could have become life threatening had the tumour spread through the orbit and affected the brain," added Dr Sapan Shah, ocular oncologist, who was part of the team. Rupani had around 30% vision the affected left eye and the entire has been restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/womans-eye-vision-saved-after-removal-of-big-tumour/articleshow/87526219.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No leniency, BEST bus driver gets 1-month jail for dashing into woman||MUMBAI: Refusing to grant leniency to a now 52-year-old BEST driver who rammed into a woman despite a pedestrian walking signal seven years ago, the Kurla magistrate’s court while sentencing him to one month imprisonment held that it has to be mindful of the galloping trend in road accidents in India and the devastating consequences visiting the victims and their families. The court refused to grant Sakharam Bangar’s plea to be released on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act instead of serving a sentence. “Criminal courts cannot treat the nature of the offence as attracting the benevolent provisions of Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act. In such a set of circumstances it would not be judicious to sentence the accused on mere fine or till rising of court,” metropolitan magistrate Mrudula S Kochar said. “It is established that the accused drove the bus at high speed, recklessly, without taking any proper precautions and dashed to the informant.” Six witnesses, including the injured woman Kulsum Khaled, an eyewitness and the conductor deposed. Khaled submitted that on November 5, 2014, at 10.30pm, she was using the pedestrian crossing on Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road when BEST bus number 357 dashed her and she sustained injuries on the left side of her body. The conductor deposed that they were proceeding towards Shivaji Nagar Depot from Kurane Chowk when the bus stopped at a signal at Shivaji Nagar Junction. He submitted that the bus was taking a right turn as the signal turned green when people started banging on the bus and shouting that a woman had come under it. He said Bangar immediately halted the bus. But a witness said he was waiting at the signal on his bike when he saw the bus come at high speed, take a U-turn and hit the woman who had already crossed half of the road. He said the bus dragged her for some distance and it was only when people shouted that the driver halted the bus, got off and ran towards the police chowky. A technical report also showed that there was no mechanical fault with the bus. “It is apparent that the accused was driving the vehicle at the alleged time of incident. One can infer that prosecution is successful in establishing the identity of the accused and the vehicle involved in the offence,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-leniency-best-bus-driver-gets-1-mth-jail-for-dashing-into-woman/articleshow/87529611.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The video of four of the accused entering the place of worship with their footwear had gone viral, and a complaint was registered in this regard. The arrested accused are Busher Rehman,20, a resident of Masthikatte, Ullal; Ismail Arha Maj, 22, a resident of Mukkacheri, Ullal; Mohammed Tanish,19, a resident of Halekote, Ullal and Mohammed Rashad,19, a resident of Babbukatte, Mangaluru. A complaint was filed by Vinay Kumar on behalf of the president of the temple’s managing committee on Wednesday. The case was filed under Indian Penal Code 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class). The Punjalkatte police started the investigation based on the viral video and arrested them. They were produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/four-held-for-desecrating-temple-in-bantwal/articleshow/87528749.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2-year RI upheld for tempo driver in 1998 mishap case||MUMBAI: A sessions court upheld the conviction of a tempo driver who ran over a 14-year-old more than a decade ago, relying on the eyewitness statement of the victim’s friend (who is now 25 years old), among others. The court held that it was indeed possible for the youth to still recall the tempo’s registration number after 13 years due to his age and circumstances. “At the time of the accident, he (the witness) was just 14-and-ahalf years old, a school-going boy. Such a lad of young age can easily remember things as compared to adult persons, and particularly when they face such an incident, involving them and their friends. In addition to this, it must be noted that the witness is a resident of Mumbai suburban area, which is heavily crowded and where everyone has to be smart enough,” the sessions court said. It was the prosecution’s case that on June 29, 1998, around 10pm, the victim, Mainuddin Shaikh, the witness Virendra Agarwal and their friend Ashok Kesarwani were walking home from karate class when the speeding tempo rammed into them from behind at Akurli Road, Kandivli (East). While Agarwal and Kesarwani suffered injuries, Shaikh died. The two bleeding teenagers managed to take Shaikh to his house, after which his father had rushed him to hospital, to no avail. The driver was also booked for drink-driving, but a medical examination was not conducted to show the blood alcohol percentage, leading to his acquittal on the charge under the Motor Vehicles Act. In addition to Agarwal’s statement, the court also relied on the statements given by a rickshaw driver whose vehicle the tempo had rammed into. He had noted down the tempo number. The court said that the rules of the road regulations states that the driver of a vehicle should drive it close to the left side of the road and allow all traffic that is proceeding in the opposite direction to pass from his right. It further said the driver moving behind another vehicle should keep sufficient distance to avoid collision should the vehicle in front suddenly slow down or stop. The court said from the evidence of the witnesses, it has come on record that the tempo had dashed the auto from behind on the right side, after which it appeared to have travelled to the wrong side of the road and hit the boys. “Thus, this discussion proves that the vehicle of the appellant was either being run in a negligent manner or he was driving rashly, without taking into consideration the condition of the traffic on the road,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-yr-ri-upheld-for-tempo-driver-in-1998-mishap-case/articleshow/87529620.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra revenue collection only 41% of target till October-end||MUMBAI: The cash-strapped state government’s revenue has shown signs of recovery after lockdown curbs were lifted in June, but the pandemic has left its mark. In the seven-month period between April-October this year, the state has managed to raise only 41% of its annual revenue target. The latest data shows that till October-end, the state had raised Rs 1.51 lakh crore of the annual target of Rs 3.69 lakh crore. The state’s revenue collection dipped between September and October mainly because the state had received a large tranche of GST compensation from the Centre in September. This was worth Rs 3,945 crore. However, the collection of taxes rose in October compared to the previous month. In October, the state collected taxes worth Rs 17,705 crore compared to Rs 16,282 crore the previous month. In the seven months till now, the state has met 43% of its tax collection target for the year. In October, the collection of stamp duty and registration fees, which reflect real estate transactions, were higher. This increased to Rs 2,866 crore in October from 2,640 crore in September. However, vehicle tax collections dipped from Rs 833.6 crore in September to Rs 749 crore in October, despite the onset of the festive season. Observers say the vehicle purchase was impacted by the rise in fuel prices. State GST collections soared in October, recording the secondhighest figure for the year, with the onset of the festive season and the release of pent-up demand. “Revenues are expected to improve during the festive season and in the last quarter of the year. ,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-revenue-collection-only-41-of-target-till-oct-end/articleshow/87529642.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Air quality slides from moderate to poor in an hour on Kali Puja night||KOLKATA: The city’s 24-hour average air quality remained moderate (AQI: 101-200) on Kali Puja-Diwali day this year. However, some continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) ominously showed hourly AQI swing from moderate to poor as people lit all kinds of fireworks and crackers. Environmental activists said Diwali had once again marked the threshold of declining air quality in the city and it would be extremely difficult for a recovery before spring next year. Three of the seven CAAQMS showed sharp decline of air quality since early evening with the AQI plunging to poor (AQI: 201-300). Bidhannagar (Salt Lake), Rabindra Bharati University campus on BT Road in the northern part of the city and Jadavpur area in the south showed air quality deteriorating by the hour. All these areas had celebrated Chhoti Diwali, the Diwali eve, with gusto. CAAQMS at Ballygunge, Fort William, Victoria and Rabindra Sarobar were a saviour as they maintained the moderate air quality level and ensured that the average AQI was within the moderate limit. But once the day progressed into evening and evening turned to night, the AQI of Ballygunge and Fort William also inched close to ‘poor’ category, leaving the WBPCB officials worried. Crackers burst continuously between 9pm and 10pm at New Alipore. Earlier, the local police visited Block K and made a video of crackers being burst. Poor air quality causes breathing discomfort to most people on a prolonged exposure. “Since we cannot avoid breathing, we must take care of the air quality. But people seem to forget about it on Diwali night. We keep receiving an alarming number of patients with acute breathing distress after Diwali night. Many of them light fireworks themselves,” said Arup Haldar, a senior pulmonologist. “The noise is less compared to last few years, but the air has turned heavy with metals released from bursting fireworks. I think it is high time that the religious leaders come forward to issue a diktat against such mindless indulgence in fireworks. Where were these chemical-laden poisonous fireworks in our ancient traditions?” said environment crusader Subhas Datta. The problem is thermal inversion, which is slowly setting in. Thermal inversion lowers the vertical wind movement because of lower radiative temperature at the ground. If the wind speed goes below 2m/second, the dispersal of pollutants from the lower strata of the atmosphere becomes slow. As pollutants pile up in the breathable height, people face serious health impacts, explained a WBPCB scientist. Naba Dutta, secretary of Sabuj Mancha, which has been travelling across the city to monitor the violation/compliance, said: “The known hot spots of violations in the city have swung back to their old habits of revelry by bursting firecrackers. The pollution level will certainly go up and it will affect everyone. I am horrified to think about the Covid-recovered patients who now have fragile lungs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/air-quality-slides-from-moderate-to-poor-in-an-hr-on-kali-puja-night/articleshow/87529193.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cat-&-mouse game to stop sale of banned firecrackers||KOLKATA: From New Town to Thakurpukur and Kalikapur to Kidderpore, cracker sellers continued to try and sell now illegal, non-green firecrackers in a clandestine manner, at times putting on display candles, diyas and even fruits and vegetables, and dealing in the banned items under the counter. Cops, too, continued their raids and seizures, often in plain clothes. At New Town’s Action Area II near Eco Urban Village, crackers were being sold outside a flower shop and at Thakurpukur Satyen Park, a man selling diyas and fairy lights had a cache of sparklers, charkis and flower pots in two crates under his temporary shop platform. Both shops were forced to close and the fireworks seized. In Kalikapur and Charu Market areas, a team of cops went around in plainclothes and seized banned crackers from multiple sellers — mostly inside neighbourhood lanes away from main thoroughfares. While the sellers pleaded helplessness, claiming to be selling items at a loss or at cost price, cops said, with no green crackers in sight, their job was made easier. “We had a large stock of fireworks at home since 2020 and had to make an attempt to sell them. We are not criminals. When we bought the crackers they were not banned. What can we do if they are suddenly prohibited?” asked a hawker in Taratala who was selling sparklers, flower pots and torches before cops seized all his items. The Kolkata Police adopted a three-pronged strategy since Wednesday afternoon to ensure citizens followed the court order. As a first step, cops attended to the local distress calls as complaints poured in, especially close to midnight, across Kasba, Tiljala, Beniapukur, Cossipore, Sarsuna and Thakurpukur on Chhoti Diwali. In New Alipore, crackers were continuously burst between 9pm and 10pm. Earlier, local cops had visited Block K and made a video of crackers being burst. “It was as if those bursting crackers were testing our patience. They burst one and hid themselves only to burst another as soon as we came back after inquiry,” said an ASI near Ballygunge railway station. In the central division, across four police stations between Brabourne Road and Girish Park, cops seized 1,258kg of crackers in the past week, over 400kg of which was seized on Wednesday. Seizures at Girish Park ranged between 3kg to 540kg in the past week. On Wednesday evening, there were raids where cops stopped every vehicle at special nakas and checked whether they were carrying firecrackers. The police said they checked as many as 2,500 vehicles and seized 1,856kg of crackers in these raids. The police said the seizures mostly consisted of chocolate bombs and dodomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cat-mouse-game-to-stop-sale-of-banned-firecrackers/articleshow/87529198.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In Diwali bonanza, 19 elderly get keys to redeveloped flats after 7 years in high court||MUMBAI: Their eyes glittered, their smiles lit up the courtroom. Diwali wishes were exchanged and festival cheer infected Bombay high court on Thursday as 19 original tenants of a Goregaon (west) housing colony were given the keys to their redeveloped ownership flats in the court by the developer seven years after they had vacated their houses. It was an overwhelming experience for those present in the courtroom presided over by a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade as the recipients were mostly senior citizens, including an 88-yearold, leaning on their walking sticks and had to be helped in. One of the recipients was disabled. As Justice Kathawalla called out their names, they came forward, took the keys to their apartments in the 27-storey Earth Terrace and bowed with joined hands. The court had heard a petition by 19 out of 120 tenants of the erstwhile Gajanan Colony, which comprised four buildings, at Eksar Pahadi. They had vacated their homes in 2014, and though the redeveloped building was ready and occupation certificate had been granted in February 2021, the landlord/developer Earth Graphics did not hand over possession. He made “illegal” demands such as charges for chajja/overhanging eave and a 99-year lease. Of all the tenants, only these few arranged for funds and moved the HC. On November 3, to “put an end to the long-standing dispute”, the judges insisted that the developer hand the keys to them in their presence. The tenants’ advocates Amogh Singh and Bhavin Bhatia said the developer now wants an undertaking that they will not sell their ownership flats for 10 years. The judges questioned the developer’s son whether it was part of the permanent alternative accommodation agreement. He replied it was decided later. The developer’s advocate Shanay Shah said: “They (tenants) must take liability of the society whenever we hand over.” The judges said the original tenants and their legal heirs shall abide by conditions in the agreement. Advocate Singh said there are over 100 tenants and relief is granted to the ones who were able to approach HC. “They will actually have a very happy Diwali,” he added. “Happy Diwali,’’ a smiling Justice Kathawalla wished the tenants. The group was happy and relieved as they left the court. When TOI asked how they felt, Sakarben Gala, 78, and Jayaben Shah, 75, chorused: “Bahu saru (very good).” Amit Shah, son of Arunaben, 67, said: “We stayed for almost 30-35 years in the old buildings. We have been out for seven years. We have an emotional attachment to the place. We are happy to be back.” A frail Suryaben Shah, 88, was the cynosure of all eyes. She sat slumped in a chair resting her feet, and while leaving appeared exhausted. A happy Pushpa Shetty, 59, distributed kachoris and chocolates. Jitendra Shah, son of Dhanlaxmi Shah, 79, was in tears. After composing himself, he said: “He (builder) created hurdles for us to get our homes. Our fight is over.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-diwali-bonanza-19-elderly-get-keys-to-redeveloped-flats-after-7-yrs-in-hc/articleshow/87529652.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mangaluru||Initiative explores tourism off the beaten track in Udupi||Udupi: Is there more to Udupi than religious and beach tourism? What about carrying sweet memories of the temple town in a box? With this idea, Placexplore Lab, a tourism incubator aimed at community-based tourism and experiential travel, has been launched. The programme is being hosted by the Urban Vision, Red Dot Foundation Global, Udupi Tourism and Mangaluru City Corporation, with support from Vital Voices Fortune Mentoring Program of the United States department of state. The experimental ‘Udupi in a box’ —a memento—consists of the products made from GI tagged items from Udupi district. The box will also give a fillip to local jasmine cultivators, who often reel under arbitrary pricing and a limited local market. “Tourists who visit here don’t carry any memories in terms of a memento, like they do when they travel to foreign locales. That’s why this community-based experiential tourism startup incubator was launched,’’ says P Valsaraj, associate professor, coordinator, department of food & beverage service, Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration. The launch and design hackathon were organised on October 31, and featured micro entrepreneurs from the twin districts working on various initiatives. There were a range of tourism microenterprise initiatives from surf schools, fishing tours, local artisans with coconut, pottery and bamboo weaving crafts, Yakshagana and ecological as well as farm tours. A total 16 women from the National Rural Livelihood Mission, who were trained for self-employment through the district zilla panchayat office, are also part of this startup lab. Prathima Manohar, founder of Urban Vision and Elsa Marie D’Silva, president of Red Dot Foundation Global, sharing details of the incubator programme, said the cohort of entrepreneurs will receive mentorship and entrepreneurial training as well as a market access platform. “Community-based tourism involves giving tourists the chance to meet locals and experience authentic cultural exchange. It is about supporting locally-led projects that have a direct benefit for the local community, as well as travellers. Community-based tourism provides opportunities for locals to earn and also introduce their culture to visitors,’’ they added. Chef Thirugnanasambantahm and Valsaraj and Vageesh Kelkar from WGSHA hosted a food and beverage theatre demonstration using local ingredients for global products like pasta and burgers, as well as wellness shots and juices featuring local flowers like blue pea, hibiscus and jasmine. The team featured the importance of GI tagged products mattu gulla and Shankarapura Jasmine in local cuisine. Team WGSHA in their product demonstration, displayed various products made from mattu gulla, betel leaf, Shankarapura jasmine, star fruit and jackfruit, which they believe can empower locals in developing community-based tourism. The team also presented a ‘Udupi in a box’ memento consisting of the products made from GI tagged items from the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/initiative-explores-tourism-off-the-beaten-track-in-udupi/articleshow/87528827.cms||Stanley Pinto
---||Kolkata||City kids celebrate with lights and flowers||Kolkata: The news of a cracker-free Diwali this time had come as a dampener for many, especially children. The restrictions made them sad but with the help of elders — and festival committees in case of housing complexes — most children ended up enjoying this Diwali with a difference. In South City Residency, a rangoli competition was organised and children participated with enthusiasm. Many youngsters tried to chip in too, making it a huge big community event that was judged by a panel. “We initially missed the fun around crackers but that yearning perhaps brought out the artist in us and almost every floor had such creative rangolis. We spent the evening appreciating each other’s creative efforts,” said Madhavi Rao, a resident. At individual homes, parents bonded with children teaching them how to light up homes. Some like liaison executive Soumi Sinha illuminated the whole house with the help of her sons Aarav and Aayan. “The focus was on illumination since crackers were out. The effect was mesmerising. The gap left by the absence of crackers was not felt at all. I think this was a learning experience for all of us,” Sinha said. In some families, Kali Puja at home became the centre of attraction. “This time, the distraction of crackers not being there, our children simply enjoyed their grandmother’s Kali Puja. Right from lighting the diyas to helping out with arranging the fruits and the bhog, my daughter Aarin and her cousins Toshani and Hridan were as busy as the elders,” said Avijit Dhar, a marketing professional. The Bhatt family of Siddha Pines decided to exchange crackers with flowers. The idea came from Class XII student Harshita Bhatt, who was looking for something as exciting as crackers. “I thought of doing up the whole house with flowers and everybody liked the idea. Finally, I got so busy with my decorations that I forgot everything about crackers,” Harshita said. She was happy that her father indulged her with as much flowers and as many types as she wanted. Many seniors felt that since awareness about air pollution is on the rise, the cracker industry in Bengal, which came into existence from the time of the British Raj, will cease to exist unless immediate steps are taken to correct the manufacturing formula and turn towards green varieties. “We consider this a watershed year when we were able to make our children realise the importance of being crusaders against air pollution,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of South City Residency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-kids-celebrate-with-lights-and-flowers/articleshow/87529200.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Cinemas in Kolkata gear up for Diwali season litmus test||KOLKATA: Diwali has turned into a make-or-break time for theatres in Bengal after the state allowed 70% occupancy. The festival will see the release of the biggest line-up of three movies — Rajinikanth’s ‘Annatthe’, ‘Sooryavanshi’ starring Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh, and the American superhero film ‘Eternals’ — since the pandemic broke out. That effectively means a litmus test for audience’s interest in the big screen in the absence of alternate seating arrangement. ‘Annatthe’ released in Kolkata on Thursday. On Friday, SVF Cinemas is releasing ‘Sooryavanshi’ in over 150 theatres in Bengal. ‘Eternals’, helmed by Academy award-winning director Chloe Zhao and starring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie, is also being released on Friday. Ratan Saha, chairman of the exhibitors’ section of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, believes the audience turnout will also help determine the future of cinemas and the film business. “The response during the Diwali weekend will put to rest the debate over whether or not OTT platforms can wipe out the importance of theatrical releases,” Saha said. Amit Sengupta, manager of Humayan Properties Ltd which runs New Empire, opened the advance bookings of ‘Sooryavanshi’ on Sunday. “New Empire is no longer a hub meant exclusively for an English-speaking audience. Our crowd now prefers to watch English movies dubbed in Hindi. For Diwali, we preferred to bank on the Hindi release. The advance bookings have been mediocre, but we are hoping for better business at the current counter,” Sengupta said. However, opening the advance bookings at most single screens that show both Hindi and English films posed a problem because of uncertainty over show-sharing between the Hindi and English releases. The likes of Navina, Priya and Menoka opted for screening ‘Eternals’ in place of ‘Sooryavanshi’. Pranab Kumar Roy of Menoka had signed the deal for the release of ‘Eternals’ at his South Kolkata theatre before he came to know about the release of ‘Sooryavanshi’. “This Hindi release came with a rider from the producer in Mumbai. We were told that if we released the film, it will mean that all shows will have to be devoted to it. This rider landed me in a fix since it meant going back on our word with ‘Eternals’. Advance bookings of such big releases usually happen from Monday. But, in this case, we lost out on that. Finally, on Thursday, we decided to go ahead with ‘Eternals’. With a number of films lined up this year, show-sharing has to be allowed to give space to everyone,” Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cinemas-gear-up-for-diwali-season-litmus-test/articleshow/87529204.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The boy was unwell for the past three days suffering from fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. He was brought to the NCH due to heavy vomiting where doctors declared him dead. Condition of Shaurya, son of Raj Sharma, a furniture businessman, worsened on Wednesday after which the family shifted the boy to the hospital. However, upon arrival doctors declared him dead. Family members said that they found ‘pop-pop’, a type of tiny cracker, in Shaurya’s vomit and raised suspicion that he may have accidentally swallowed the cracker and fell sick. Police sent the body for post mortem, while doctors collected viscera samples to find out what could have caused such severe health complications. “It is yet not clear if the boy died due to swallowing some type of cracker. Only chemical analysis findings will confirm the exact cause,” said an officer in Dindoli police station. In another incident, a month old baby suffered burns on her back while sleeping in a makeshift cradle made of saree on a footpath near Sosyo Circle. The saree was tied under a three-wheel pedal rickshaw and the parents realised that the baby suffered burns only in the morning. They told docs that the cloth cradle may have caught fire from embers of a cracker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mystery-shrouds-death-of-3-yr-old-boy/articleshow/87526293.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Two dalit groups ask Mumbai caste certificate authority to probe Sameer Wankhede case||MUMBAI: A group Youth Republican, led by dalit activist Manoj Sansare, and Bhim Army general secretary Ashok Kamble on Wednesday submitted a petition to the Mumbai district caste certificate scrutiny committee demanding a probe into the caste certificate of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Sansare alleged that Wankhede had submitted a false caste certificate to secure a prestigious job on a seat reserved for a Scheduled Caste nominee. “We have documents to establish that Wankhede is not an SC, but he still secured a job under the SC quota in the Indian Revenue Service, customs and central excise, in 2008,” Sansare said in his letter to the member secretary of the committee. Sansare said that as per information given by Wankhede’s father Gyandev to the media, he belonged to the Mahar community and has secured his caste certificate from Washim district in 2008 from the competent authority. Sansare’s contention was that Sameer Wankhede too should have, like his father, secured his caste certificate from the same authority. “We feel that Sameer Wankhede secured the SC certificate from the competent authority in Mumbai. As per rules, the Mumbai competent authority has no authority to issue a caste certificate for any other district. So the certificate submitted by him is void,” Sansare alleged. Sansare also alleged that from the birth records of Sameer Wankhede, as well as from his marriage records, it appeared that he was a Muslim. “From December 14, 1979 to his marriage on December 7, 2006, he was a Muslim. Despite such a situation, he misled the Mumbai competent authority for securing an SC certificate for obtaining a job,” Sansare claimed, adding that the authorities should revoke his SC certificate, withdraw all benefits and initiate criminal proceedings against him. Following Wankhede’s complaint to National Scheduled Castes Commission that NCP minister Nawab Malik has been falsely alleging he is not from the SC community and questioning his caste certificate, the SC panel has asked Mumbai police chief Hemant Nagrale to probe. Nagrale is expected to submit a report in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-dalit-groups-ask-city-caste-cert-authority-to-probe-wankhede-case/articleshow/87529654.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The cops recovered cash Rs 50,000 and also a car, worth Rs 6 lakh, that was used in the theft. Cops said that a gang of six persons was involved in the theft. The burglars sprayed some colour on CCTV cameras in the ATM booth and cut open the machine’s chest using a gas cutter on October 29. Based on specific information, police arrested Dildas alias Babloo Saiyed (22) from the city. On being interrogated, Saiyed gave information about Jakir alias Guchhu Sahbuddin alias Kallu Qureshi (40), who was nabbed from Haryana. The State Bank of India ATM in Vadod of Pandesara was burgled during the wee hours on October 29. It was suspected that after stealing cash, the burglars torched the machine and booth. But now the cops think that the fire might have broken out accidentally. “It is suspected that the ATM’s wiring caught fire while the burglars were breaking it open using a gas cutter. However, they succeed in stealing the cash tray,” said a police officer in Pandesara police station. Along with the ATM, fixture, AC and CCTV cameras were destroyed in the fire. “The gang is from Mevat and after carrying out the theft they returned back. From the way the crime was executed, we suspect that it is a professional gang involved in cash theft from ATMs,” said A P Chaudhary, police inspector, Pandesara police station. Cops also identified four other involved in the theft and attempts are on to nab them. It is not clear what type of spray was used to blind the CCTV cameras and if the cash in the ATM also caught fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-nabbed-in-rs-31-lakh-atm-theft/articleshow/87526314.cms||---

This was a long pending demand by Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI). The facility is likely to benefit small and medium jewellery manufacturers and textile traders. At present, they have to send samples or finished orders of small quantities through courier. “Many times the cost is too high and since there was no alternative, they have to spend the amount. But with the option of a post office they can send small parcels at affordable cost,” said Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman, GJEPC.  Small diamond jewellery manufacturers often receive orders for one or a few pieces. “At present, they take services of private courier firms. The couriers also don’t deliver goods to a few countries while the post office has ties with many countries,” Navadiya added. The post office will prove beneficial for textile traders who send samples for examination to buyers abroad. It will bring down their courier cost and increase reach to many countries. Union textile minister Darshana Jardosh said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has implemented Gati Shakti Yojna in which 16 different departments have been asked to work in collaboration for speedy results due to which many projects are being implemented quickly.” Navsari MP and state BJP chief CR Paatil, said, “The post office will benefit the diamond and jewellery sector in the city. The state government has also launched an plane service between state’s cities which will push the development further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/foreign-post-office-to-benefit-diamond-textile-sectors/articleshow/87526378.cms||---

The production is going on according to the target. The challenge is to ensure maximum coverage,” said national task force member Dr NK Arora. He said the objective of the door-to-door vaccination was to ensure coverage of beneficiaries from difficult terrains, daily wage workers or those vaccine hesitant. Naturally, reaching the last mile would be a tough ask, he said. “The door-to-door drive would cover about 20% of the target population, who are yet to get the first dose. We are starting it as a monthlong drive and would be followed up by another month if required,” Arora said, adding that the strategy would be to ensure that no one was left out. About 77% of the eligible population in India has been vaccinated against Covid-19 with the first dose. A senior health official from the Union government said most of the first dose vaccine beneficiaries were being administered Covishield and Covaxin. “Serum Institute of India already has a large share in the Covid vaccine supply in India. Covaxin maker Bharat Biotech is slowly increasing the production,” he said. Bharat Biotech officials said manufacturing has been scaled up gradually across its multiple facilities in Hyderabad in Telangana, Malur in Karnataka and Ankleshwar in Gujarat. “The company was able to expand manufacturing capacity in a short timeline mainly because of specially designed bio-safety level-3 production campuses. We are on course to have annual capacity of 1 billion Covaxin doses. At present, the company is producing 50-55 million doses per month,” a company official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-shortage-of-vax-for-door-to-door-drive-national-task-force-member/articleshow/87529234.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||5,230 students get jabs under ‘Mission Yuva Swasthya’||Pune: Around 5,230 college students in the district have been vaccinated with the first or the second dose under the “Mission Yuva Swasthya” initiative so far and the district health officials are hoping for a better response after classes resume. Of the 5,230 beneficiaries, as many as 3,397 got the first jab. A total of 1,833 were administered the second dose. According to district health office data, Pune rural has seen the highest response of 2,837 beneficiaries, followed by Pune civic limits (1,463) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas (930). A total of 71 sessions were held across various colleges in the district. The data revealed that Pune rural conducted the highest number of sessions (42) in the district. Suryakant Devkar, chief immunisation officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told TOI, “The response to the college immunisation has been on a slower side because of the holiday season. Many students, especially those from other cities or villages, have gone home.” Devkar said the vaccination would be done at a few sites until 2pm on Friday, while it would remain closed again on Saturday and Sunday. Only 373 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district on Thursday as per the CoWin data because almost all the government-run sites were shut on the occasion of Laxmipujan. An official said, “We have received over 2 lakh Covishield and Covaxin doses — enough for the next few weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5230-students-get-jabs-under-mission-yuva-swasthya/articleshow/87529235.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Demand grows for priority campaigns in slum pockets||Pune: Public representatives and health experts stressed on door-to-door vaccination in the city’s slums because a sizable number of the 4.6 lakh residents living in 390 such pockets had not come forward to take the Covid shot yet for various reasons, including general apathy and wrong notions about immunisation. “We have requested the deputy chief minister and Pune’s guardian minister Ajit Pawar to take up door-to-door vaccination in slum households on priority. One such door-to-door pilot has been carried out in one of the slums,” said Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole. “A big chunk of the unvaccinated slum population will take the shot if we take the vaccination right up to their doorsteps. The remaining will need some counselling to decide in favour of vaccination as they continue to harbour misconceptions,” Shirole said. “Besides vaccinating the unvaccinated, we have to focus on the vaccination of slum population not turning up to take the second dose of the vaccine despite being due for it. The door-to-door vaccination will address both. The guidelines in this regard are awaited,” said the Pune Municipal Corporation’s Covid immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar. “Mainly, the herd mentality is prominently at play when it comes to vaccinating the city’s congested hutments. Those who have the wrong notion can be convinced to take the shot through doorstep vaccination,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-grows-for-priority-campaigns-in-slum-pockets/articleshow/87529237.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Less than 90 per cent of frontline and healthcare staff fully vaccinated||PUNE: Complete vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers against Covid in Maharashtra is still at 87% and 86%, respectively, despite the passage of 10 months since the drive to inoculate the two categories started, public health department statistics till early this week revealed. A senior official in the department, however, attributed the gap to the possibility of many frontline workers taking their second dose in the general category. The official also did not rule out the possibility of vaccine hesitancy among a section of the health workers. With a 100% first dose coverage set for all districts in the state by November-end , the public health department will now again re-draw the list to double check the tally for both the healthcare and frontline workers. All local authorities have been told to prepare a list of first and second dose beneficiaries ahead of the door-to- door vaccination after Diwali. “We believe the vaccine coverage of the healthcare and frontline workers is over 90%. There are definitely some issues regarding the data. We have been told that many frontline workers might have taken the vaccine in the general 18-44 year category. The data need to be assessed and the list will be drawn out to arrive at the final figures before the end of this month,” the official said. The latest data by the public health department sshowed that vaccination of the healthcare workers was lowest in Aurangabad (79%), Jalna (76%) and Yavatmal (74%) districts. In case of the frontline workers, Jalna (79%), Yavatmal (79%), Gondia (77%), Kolhapur (77%) and Osmanabad (75%) were among the districts that have not yet touched the 80% mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/less-than-90-of-frontline-healthcare-staff-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/87529244.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Prices of Australian coal in the last 12 months have increased 188% —almost twice the appreciation of Brent crude, which is under focus for its 95% rise. While coal and crude were the best performers in the last 12 months, the worst performers, ironically, were gold and silver, which dipped 4.7% and 2.9% after rising amid the flight-to-safety following the pandemic-induced economic crisis last year, according to an analysis by Care Ratings. Coal has seen demand firing up even as the world is trying to arrive at a consensus on net-zero emissions. One reason for the rise in prices is India, which has seen a renewed demand for power as the economy came out of restrictions that were brought in because of the pandemic. Besides coal and crude, no other commodity or asset has come close to doubling its price in the last 12 months. While the sensex has doubled from its post-Covid bottom, it has gained only 38% since last Diwali. The other commodities that have done well are copper (45%) and soya oil (27%). The price increases have an element of demand, but this is not great long-term news for investors. Care Ratings has said that there are bright lights shining all around (in terms of macroeconomic numbers) and it does seem that the economy is witnessing a turnaround. The report, however, cautions that what held good for last year may not hold for the next 12 months. While the agency has retained its 9.1% growth forecast, this expansion is because of a smaller base and the economy is still not in a revival. “We should also keep in mind the fact that all these good numbers are in the realm of consumption and not investment. Infra spending is still restricted to government and the pace of private investment is limited. This will be a major cog in the process of growth, and we expect a revival only in FY23. For the rest of the year, it will be, at best, stable,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coalleast-loved-commodityappreciates-188-the-best-performer-since-last-diwali/articleshow/87530744.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Despite tax cuts, petrol still hovers over Rs 100/litre in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Despite a substantial cut in tax by both Centre and state on petrol and diesel prices, petrol in Karnataka continues to hover at over Rs 100 per litre. As per the state government's notification on Thursday, petrol price has reduced from Rs 114 on November 3 to Rs 101 (reduction of Rs 13.30) while diesel price has reduced from Rs 104 on November 3 to Rs 85 (reduction of Rs 19.40). Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday, while announcing reduction in prices of both fuels by Rs 7 more, said the prices of petrol and diesel will be Rs 95.50 and Rs 81.50 per litre in Karnataka. This was because prices were calculated on the old base price which is linked to fluctuating crude oil prices in the international market as well as the dollar rate fluctuation. "The difference is because the break-up calculated yesterday (Wednesday) was on the base price on October 20 as oil market companies had not given the latest figures. In the past 13 days, there was an upward revision - Rs 4.39 on petrol and Rs 4.09 on diesel - in base prices. Petrol base price increased by 40paise yesterday," said a finance department official. Tax cut to boost consumption, revive economy, says FKCCIOn Wednesday, the Centre reduced duty by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively on petrol and diesel while the state on Thursday notified a reduction of Karnataka Sales Tax (KST) to 25.92% from 35% earlier on petrol and 14.34% from 24% on diesel. Bommai in Hubballi said the government had been contemplating reducing prices ever since fuel prices crossed the Rs 100 mark and it may cause an estimated loss of Rs 2,100 crore to the state's exchequer. The bigger concern is that sales tax will continue to increase with increase of base prices since sales tax structure is ad valorem tax (imposed on monetary value of product) unlike central excise duty, which is constant irrespective of fluctuation of base price. “Since upward trend of crude oil prices is expected to continue, base prices will increase, and retail prices will correspondingly increase. At this rate, the effect of KST reduction is expected to be neutralised in 20 days,” said KM Basave Gowda, president, Akhila Karnataka Petroleum Dealers Association. M Govid Rao, economist and former director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said: “Specific rates of state sales tax on the lines of central excise duty seems to be the solution. States have to agree and the Centre must build consensus.” “There’s merit in the argument that KST should be made a constant after due deliberation at the ministerial level,” said commercial taxes commissioner C Shikha. “The tax reduction by both Centre and state has given much-needed relief. It may boost consumption and help revive the economy after the Covid-induced lull,”said BT Manohar, state taxation chairman, FKCCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/despite-tax-cuts-petrol-still-hovers-over-rs-100/litre-in-karnataka/articleshow/87530875.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Shifa, who is currently in her parental home in Belagavi district after delivering a baby girl 20 days ago, immediately alerted the Shivamogga jail authorities. By the time, they rushed to Tagari's house and broke open the door, he was found dead. Suicide case: Police yet to get video call details of jail guard Police said jail officials found him hanging from the ceiling fan. Shifa is from Ernal village and Tagari is from Hosur village, both in Hukkeri taluk of Belagavi district. He joined the police department last year and this was his first posting. Police are yet to get details of the video call and what led to the suicide. According to his colleagues, Tagari attended the birthday of his friend in the police complex on Wednesday and returned home around 8pm. Police said he made the call after 9pm. During the call, he wished his family good health before taking the extreme step. His father Babu Tagari and father-in-law Raje Saab, who arrived in Shivamogga on Thursday, said Ashwak was suffering from a stomach ailment for many years. Both denied marital or family disputes as the reason for Tagari's death. "He was a caring person... We had promised him to provide the best treatment possible," Raje Saab told reporters. "He was physically fit and an efficient warder," said prison officer Mahesh Kumar Jinagi. Shivamogga superintendent of police BM Laxmi Prasad said a case has been registered at the Tunga Nagar police station and Tagari's body was handed over to his parents after the autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/jail-guard-kills-self-during-video-call-with-wife-in-karnataka/articleshow/87530897.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: LKG, UKG classes set to reopen from November 8||BENGALURU: In the last phase of return to offline classes, pre-primary schools - LKG and UKG - will reopen from November 8 in all taluks where the Covid test positivity rate is below 2%, according to the department of public instruction's notification on Thursday. With this, all classes will be fully functional in the state for the first time since March 2020. TOI reported on Wednesday that the government decided to reopen pre-primaries following anganwadis opening. As per the standard operating procedure, teachers and staff will have to compulsorily wear masks and be fully vaccinated. Teachers over 50 years have to use face shields too. However, masks for students are not mandated. Experts said children below 5 years need not wear masks. Children have to be asked to cover mouths and nose while coughing or sneezing. If a student shows any Covid symptoms like cough, fever, cold, loss of sense of smell or taste, she has to be isolated and guardians informed. If a student tests positive, all kids should be tested and the school closed temporarily. Reopening should be done based on health workers' instructions. 'Don't send kids who are ill to schools'  Parents should not send sick children to school. Campuses should be regularly sanitised with sodium hypochlorite solution. Children should be tested for Covid symptoms at the entrance and they should maintain a physical distance of 1m between each other. Children should bring food and water from home. Schools should have hot water facility. Care should be taken to ensure that children don't put any other substance in mouths other than food and water and sanitisers should be stored away from their reach. Classes for these children can be run from 9am to 3.30pm from Monday to Friday. In the government sector, Karnataka Public Schools have LKG and UKG. The School Development Monitoring Committees that want to run nurseries can do so at their own cost. In the private sector, apart from schools having nursery and kindergarten classes, there are neighbourhood stand-alone pre-schools . 'Learning gap'Students enrolled in Class 1 haven't attended school for about 21 months and not learnt their mother tongue or skills like writing or reading. There are over 12 lakh students in Class 1, and it's difficult to teach them after this long gap. We're happy about the reopening. Students have lost touch and need to learn something as they have no basic knowledge, said Lokesh T, secretary, Recognised Unaided Private Schools' Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-lkg-ukg-classes-set-to-reopen-from-november-8/articleshow/87530901.cms||---
---||Kolkata||State panel begins groundwork for Deocha-Pachami coal project||Kolkata: The state-appointed apex committee, formed a week ago to supervise pre-mining activities and initiate confidence-building measures among residents, has begun talking to stakeholders for acquisition of land for the Deocha-Pachami coal block in Birbhum. Compensation will soon be announced for 3,012 families living in 24 villages and the package promises to be one of the most lucrative for any coal block land acquisition so far. “The process of social assessment has begun. The government is working on a rehabilitation plan. Resident interest won’t be hurt during the entire project,” said a source close to the development. The assessment work is likely to be over by December this year. The Deocha-Pachami coal block, which has an estimated reserve of 2.1 billion tonnes, was allocated to Bengal by the Centre in June 2018. Spread over 9.7km, the block in south-western Birbhum is estimated to bring an investment of Rs 12,000 crore. Last year, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said the coal mine was expected to generate nearly one lakh jobs. West Bengal Power Development Corporation was allotted the Deocha-Pachami-Dewanganj-Harinsingha mine for captive use of its thermal power plants. Last week, the state formed a nine-member committee to gain the trust of residents and pave the way for smooth pre-mining activities. The government believes in the need for continuous dialogue with community leaders to ensure the project doesn’t hit a roadblock. “We will ensure that the interest of each and every resident is taken care of,” said Tanmay Ghosh, convener of the apex committee. The government has also proposed a feedback system to thrash out an action plan for development of infrastructure through social welfare activities. “Based on what people need, projects on healthcare, education, drinking water and sanitation and community infrastructure will be started,” said an official close to the development. The committee will also liaison with the block and district administrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-panel-begins-groundwork-for-deocha-pachami-coal-project/articleshow/87529820.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Pockets of defiance burst Kolkata’s Kali Puja-Diwali green restraint||Kolkata: Kali Puja-Diwali 2021 turned out to be a mixed bag for Kolkata, with some localities displaying the restraint they had shown last year, even as other areas saw no-holds-barred revelry and bursting of banned firecrackers at will. Conventional cracker hotspots, such as Lake Town, Bangur, Kasba, Bhowanipore, Burrabazar, Talla, Behala and Garia swung back to noisy celebrations. This had an immediate impact on air quality, which slid from moderate to poor by evening. Ignoring court rulings and in blatant violation of NGT orders, sound crackers were burst in a number of neighbourhoods like Behala, Thakurpukur, Kasba, Mukundapur, Bhowanipore, Maniktala, Dum Dum and fringe areas of Salt Lake like Duttabad and Sukantanagar from early evening and continued till late into the night. But there were other areas — like Ballygunge, Park Circus, Entally, Shyambazar and Belgachia — where Kali Puja-Diwali was relatively quieter. The overall situation was worse than last year’s, when people struggling to come to terms with the pandemic were in no mood to celebrate. It was, however, markedly better than 2019 and earned praise from Covid warriors, green activists and police. In pockets that witnessed violations, the bursting of crackers intensified after the two-hour window for celebration got over. Naba Dutta, secretary of Sabuj Mancha, an umbrella organisation for environmental activists and organisations, said the initial restraint of early evening was largely shattered by the revelry spurt late in the evening, around 10.30pm. In Taratala and Kasba, sound crackers ruled late into the night. “I called the cops. They noted down my complaint and asked me in detail about the location from where the sound was coming. I don’t know if they took any action, but there did not seem to be any difference,” said Puja Sengupta, a resident of New Ballygunge Road in Kasba. Police said 91 persons were arrested between 6pm and 11pm for bursting illegal fireworks and 219kg of banned crackers were seized. In Garcha, police counselled groups of children who were bursting crackers. At Shakuntala Park, police had to break open the grill of a four-storey apartment complex to arrest a person bursting crackers. A steady stream of complaints continued all evening from different parts of the city. In peripheral areas like Maheshtala, Sonarpur and Howrah, the complaints poured in thick and fast. The violations happened despite police seizing 7,142kg of firecrackers ahead of Diwali. Also, 62 persons had been arrested under the Explosives Act by Thursday evening, twice that of last year. Police claimed the decision to deploy cops at trouble spots, including locations around Covid hospitals, showed results and acted as a deterrent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pockets-of-defiance-burst-kolkatas-kali-puja-diwali-green-restraint/articleshow/87529865.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Restaurant industry shrugs off pandemic blues, serves up new outlets in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Among the worst sufferers in the last year and half due to the pandemic, the restaurant industry is not only now showing signs of a turnaround but is confident enough to draw up ambitious expansion blueprints. Several iconic and popular city chains have either launched new outlets recently or are planning to do so in the coming months. The list includes names like Peter Hu? from the house of Peter Cat and Mocambo, MS Bar and Lounge from Songhai and Manthan, 6 Ballygunge Place, Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Aminia. The director of Peter Hu?, Siddharth Kothari, said it was after almost five decades that the group had created a new brand. Owned by his father Nitin Kothari, the group owns the two iconic restaur-ants Peter Cat and Mocambo. “Peter Hu? is our third brand. We did some expansion for Mocambo in 2015 but this is a complete new venture,” Siddharth said. A brainchild of the younger Kothari, who spent several years in Japan, the new 145-seater restaurant offers an entire range of oriental cuisine. “We were so far into continental and Indian so this was our first journey into pan-Asian that includes Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian. We started just two weeks ago and the response is really good,” he added. Popular restaurants Songhai and Manthan have a sibling after a decade, but in the form of a lounge bar. Sudesh Poddar, the owner of the group and president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India, has started MS Bar & Lounge on Waterloo Street which offers both Indian and Chinese cuisine. “Lounge bar was a new thing for us. Having been in the restaurant business for a few decades, we took the challenge and the response is overwhelming. It started around a month back and we are already getting repeat customers,” Poddar said. The owners of 6 Ballygunge Place have taken over the Maharaja restaurant in Chowringhee and rebranded it. “There was no good authentic Bengali restaurant in the Chowringhee area so we decided to take over an existing restaurant and turn it into a 6BP,” said managing partner S Raman. The managing director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2, Dedaditya Chowdhury, said he had been expanding all the brands even during the pandemic. “We took over a restaurant called Sanjha Chulha in Salt Lake and opened a Chowman there. In Gouribari, we opened another Chowman a few months back by taking over a place which was earlier a CCD outlet. We also opened a Chapter 2 on Southern Avenue in the middle of the pandemic,” he said. The director of Aminia, Kabir Azhar, said the group has plans to add two-three new outlets in the first three months of 2022. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city and outskirts with a combined revenue of Rs 6,000-7,000 crore annually. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata alone had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. It employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurant-industry-shrugs-off-pandemic-blues-serves-up-new-outlets-in-city/articleshow/87529884.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal cabinet senior, 1970s’ ‘Young Turk’ Subrata Mukherjee passes away at 75||KOLKATA: Senior Trinamool Congress minister Subrata Mukherjee died at SSKM hospital on Thursday evening after suffering a stent thrombosis days after undergoing an angioplasty. He was 75. Mukherjee was shifted to the ICU around 8.15pm when his condition suddenly deteriorated. CM Mamata Banerjee, who rushed to the hospital along with her cabinet colleagues, stepped out to say, “I had never thought such darkness would descend when we celebrate the festival of lights. I can’t even come to terms with this loss. He suffered a massive cardiac arrest. The doctors, his wife, his well-wishers, tried all they could have done. But we could not save him.” Mukherjee’s body will be taken to Rabindra Sadan at 10am on Friday for people to pay their respects. “I will not go there. I cannot see Subratada like this. I have faced many adversities, but this is perhaps the toughest for me to deal with,” an emotional Banerjee said. A young minister in the Siddhartha Shankar Ray cabinet in 1972, Mukherjee wore many hats in his long political career. He was Kolkata mayor, member of the governing body of the ILO, Pradesh Congress working president and a Trinamool Congress minister since 2011. Mukherjee started his political career as a student activist in Kolkata. He joined the Chhatra Parishad in the 1960s. During this period he made the acquaintance of Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi and the two went on to become close aides of former PM Indira Gandhi. CPM leaders had coined a slogan — “Indirar dui putra, Priyoranjan o Subrata (Indira’s two sons, Priyaranjan and Subrata) — for the two. His association with Dasmunsi and his running feud with another city Congress satrap, Somen Mitra, was the stuff of state political lore in the 1970s and the 1980s; one of the stories involved two red-beacon cars monitoring street fights between two Congress factions at the College Street-Surya Sen Street crossing in the mid-1970s. In 1971 and 1972, Mukherjee was elected to the legislative assembly from the Ballygunge Assembly constituency. In 1972, he became the youngest minister at 26 years when he was appointed a minister of state in the Siddhartha Shankar Ray cabinet. Veteran politicians recalled how Bengal CM Banerjee was often called a Subrata Mukherjee protege in state Congress circles. To his credit, Mukherjee remained one of Banerjee's most solid backers in the Trinamool to his last. When Banerjee severed her ties with the Congress to form her own party, Mukherjee set aside seniority and backed her. In 1999, he joined the Trinamool Congress and was made mayor of Kolkata in 2000. Mukherjee was the first KMC mayor from a non-LF party in quite some time when the LF was in office. Mukherjee was credited with bringing in a bit of glasnost and modern, pragmatic administration in the hide-bound KMC. It often involved run-ins with his own party but he managed to have his way a few times. But ahead of the civic polls in 2005, Mukherjee quit Trinamool Congress following differences with the party chief, and joined the Nationalist Congress Party. He was able to cobble up an alliance with Congress and several marginal players under the platform of Paschimbanga Unnayan Mancha. Although he was able to get elected to the corporation, his front suffered a humiliating defeat. He returned to the Trinamool fold in 2010. Mukherjee was also known and respected for his in-depth knowledge of parliamentary politics and legal nitty-gritty. He was often known to advise other ministers and MLAs, even from the Left Front ministry, on assembly rules. A survivor to the core, Mukherjee also kept himself afloat during the heydays of Left rule in Bengal. As a trade unionist, he was close to former CM Jyoti Basu, and his successor Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. His detractors introduced the term “tarmuj” (water melon, green outside and red inside) for Mukherjee, Somen Mitra and some other state Congress leaders. Mukherjee, however, took it in his stride working within the parameters set by his own party. Mukherjee’s political guru, Dasmunsi, died in 2017. His one-time rival, Somen Mitra, passed away in 2020. Mukherjee's death brings to an end these associations and rivalries. It also marks the end of an era in state and Congress politics that saw the rapid rise of local Young Turks, who fell as rapidly but then -- much more slowly and gradually -- reclaimed their own political space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-cabinet-sr-1970s-young-turk-subrata-passes-away-at-75/articleshow/87529878.cms||---

The average AQI for the city touched an alarming 1645 around 1am. The pollution levels remained well above the hazardous mark across the city, with Nehru Stadium (1103), Okhla (1100) and ITO (948) recording some of the worst PM2.5 levels. A plot of last evening's AQI for the city shows a steady rise in pollution levels post 6pm, consistent with celebrations with firecrackers as has been reported. The levels dipped gradually after 1am, but still remained well above the hazardous levels, and was around 1053 at 5am.   People from several parts of the city and its suburbs complained of itchy throat and watery eyes resulting from the polluted air. Read AlsoLights, sound, chemical reaction: Facts about Diwali firecrackersAll about firecrackers, their composition and health hazards.According to the Central Pollution Control Board's data, the national capital's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 661 at 6am on Friday, up from 382 on Thursday. It was 314 on Wednesday, 303 on Tuesday and 281 on Monday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The authorities had predicted that pollution levels would shoot up in Delhi with the share of stubble burning in the national capital's pollution rising to 25 per cent on the day of Diwali itself. It was the highest of the year. That, along with people celebrating the festival, contributed to the national capital's poorest day of the year in terms of air quality. Besides Delhi, the air quality in adjoining areas like Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram also breached the severe mark. AQI of Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram stood at 956, 729 and 737 respectively at 6am.   Stubble burning makes matter worseAccording to SAFAR model forecasts, the stubble burning share is likely increase to 35 per cent on Friday and 40 per cent on Saturday with the wind direction changing to northwesterly. This could keep pollution levels above the dangerous levels. Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital. "Relief is expected only from the evening of November 7 but AQI will fluctuate within 'very poor' range," the air quality forecast agency had said. A 2020 report by Swiss organisation IQAir found 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities were in India, with Delhi ranked the most polluted capital globally. The same year, the Lancet said 1.67 million deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, including almost 17,500 in the capital.

Residents of Worli, Byculla, Parel, Andheri, Malad, Borivli, Chembur, and even Navi Mumbai and Thane, reported loud, incessant sounds beyond 10pm. The quantum of crackers burst this Diwali was most certainly higher than 2020 given that the festival last year was affected by the pandemic lockdown. However, activist Sumaira Abdulali who went about the city Thursday measuring the pollution caused by firecrackers, said the sound measure was far lower than pre-Covid times. On Thursday night, Abdulali measured negligible noise at Bandra and Marine Drive-the latter is where the action usually unfolds. The presence of police at the location held revellers in check. The activist measured a decibel level of 100 at Shivaji Park which is far lower than the pre-Covid measure of 120 decibels. The air in Andheri was thick with smoky fog as residents unleashed their celebratory spirit after a year and a half of staying cooped indoors. "We were unable to enjoy any outdoor activity, including festivals like Holi and Diwali. Now that we have taken our vaccine shots and the lockdown has eased, we feel it is time to get a sense of normalcy back into our lives," said businessman Dhiraj Kapadia of Oshiwara. Track the pollution level in your cityThane too witnessed a rise in bursting of crackers compared to last year. A trader from the main cracker market at Kopri in Thane said sales were higher than Diwali 2020. "The mood this year is positive especially after several long months of restraint due to Covid restrictions, and so residents seem to be sparing no effort to celebrate even if it is bursting with loud, noisy crackers," said activist Lata Ghanshyamnani. Compared to the pre-Covid scenario, sale of crackers this season was just 30%, said Ashok Sawane, a seller in Dadar market. In Kandivli, vendor Rupesh Shah said more than fireworks, Mumbaikars chose to buy lanterns, lamps and lights. Navi Mumbai residents reported palpably loud bursts from a few pockets. This year CM Uddhav Thackeray had exhorted citizens to light lamps rather than fireworks, lest they inconvenience Covid patients. The apex court too has endorsed use of green firecrackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/diwali-crackers-back-with-a-bang-in-mumbai-despite-strict-sc-curbs/articleshow/87531058.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The journey of this 19-yearold BTech aspirant’s life has taken a turn from one of struggle to one filled with hope and confidence. The daughter of an auto driver, Jetti’s family faced a financial crisis in 2016 and her father’s income was not enough to make ends meet, leave alone paying rent for their house. She realised she needed to get skilled if she had to find a job. Jetti enrolled for an assistant electrician’s course at Tata Strive, and travelled 70km daily from her home in Nagole to the centre. The theory and practical training armed her with domain knowledge, making her dream of becoming an electrician come true. Today, Jetti works as an assistant electrician at Taj Krishna, earns Rs 12,000 a month, and is able to help her family financially. She has also enrolled herself for a BTech degree. “The training at Tata Strive has proved to be very useful for gaining knowledge and improving job prospects,” says Jetti. Tata Strive, a skill development initiative of Tata Trusts, has set a goal of impacting 1 million aspirants by 2022. This is being done by enabling jobs for 3 lakh people through skill development. It also aims to raise the standards of skill development for 7 lakh by strengthening the ecosystem. Till September this year, 7.5 lakh have been impacted. Tata Strive CEO Anita Rajan says, “We work with young people, especially the socially and economically disadvantaged, and we link them to a livelihood. We provide the necessary skill sets, drive behavioural changes that are required in their personalities as well as give them technical and domain skills to prepare for a job and, at times, also help them become entrepreneurs.” It’s not just a job for an individual from an underprivileged background, it’s about meeting aspirations and lifting an entire generation of a family out of dire straits. Take the case of Manikandan Palani. He used to sell fish by the roadside, a job that was highly unpredictable. His family couldn’t make ends meet and had to sell their home. That’s when Palani approached Mahindra Pride School, which groomed him in interpersonal and communications skills, as well as trained him on IT modules. At the end of his training, Palani got a job with Zoho as a software development trainee. Then there’s Sai Prasad Nandala, son of a vegetable vendor. Apart from a disadvantaged background, he had a stammer that sapped his confidence. Mahindra Pride School’s soft skills training improved his confidence levels and, today, he is working as a content reviewer at Wipro. The Mahindra Pride Schools training includes a compulsory soft skills module that covers competency in spoken English, grooming and computer skills to prepare trainees for the challenges of the professional world. Mahindra Group senior vice-president (CSR) Sheetal Mehta says, “Excluding the pandemic year, Mahindra Pride School usually achieves 100% placement in reputed organisations every year, that is, 5,500-6,000 youths trained through its 90-day training course. Such training has led to a consistent increase in average starting salaries to a little over Rs 11,000 per month at present. Two years back, a breakthrough came about when 65 students of Mahindra Pride were placed by UD Trucks in Japan at a salary of a little over Rs 1 lakh per month.” Companies like Ceat also offer skilling programmes to young people and it hires many of them for its offices and factories in Halol, Nagpur and Chennai. Ceat CHRO Milind Apte says the objective is not only to help them have skills but also to give them an opportunity for permanent employment. It’s a win-win for organisations which, in turn, get a skilled employee base. “These are restless young people who have been deprived, but they have their dreams and ambitions. They also have to support their families. They have a lot of fire in their belly. We are leveraging that fire,” says Apte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-skill-training-is-helping-change-lives/articleshow/87531108.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to call up 3 lakh-plus citizens to check if second Covid vaccine dose taken||MUMBAI: The BMC’s 24 ward-level war rooms, set up last year to smoothen Covidrelated hospitalisation and data, now have a new task at hand: to straighten out the city’s vaccination rolls over the next 10 days. The war rooms have to call up three lakh people who took their first shot in a vaccination centre in Mumbai but didn’t turn up for the second one. “We got these three-lakh-plus names from the CoWin portal and plan to reach out to each one to find out why they haven’t taken the second shot despite it being overdue,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. A senior public health department doctor said the list has 3.84 lakh names. The exercise is part of the BMC’s all-out plan to complete the “last mile” in Covid vaccination; 1.47 crore shots (91.5 lakh first shots and 56.4 lakh second shots) have been given out in Mumbai’s nearly 500 vaccination centres. As the city has an adult population of 92.3 lakh who are eligible for Covid shots, it is presumed that 99.1% of the city’s target population has taken the first shot, and 61% have taken the second as well. The war room drill could provide an insight into whether 99.1% first-shot beneficiaries are all from Mumbai or include ‘outsiders’ from municipal corporations surrounding Mumbai. BMC public health officials presume 10-20% of the 91.5 lakh who have taken the first shot in Mumbai could be from beyond city limits. “Many from Mumbai’s workforce live in satellite cities, so it is good if they have taken the vaccine here,” said a doctor. The Union health ministry rules state people can take their shots anywhere in India. “These three lakh people could be residents of neighbouring civic corporations who took their first shot here due to better availability of vaccines in Mumbai, but took the second locally. Or they could be migrant workers who left the city after taking the first shot,” said Kakani. The number could include Mumbaikars who are resistant to taking the second shot. “We have to counsel them, and get them to the nearest mobile vaccine centre for the second shot,” he said. E ward’s assistant municipal commissioner Manish Walunju said the calling-up exercise was on. “Our war room is calling up those with co-morbidities and urging them to come forward and take the shot. The problem is with persons who may have taken the shot while passing by from the centre, but maybe living some place far off. We are requesting such persons to go to the nearest vaccination centre and ensure that they get inoculated,” he said. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said, “Despite BMC going all-out by taking the vaccination van to many slum and housing localities, some are choosing to stay unvaccinated. Calling up people who have not taken the shot will serve as a reminder to them and hopefully they will take the shot,” said Miranda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-call-up-3-lakh-plus-citizens-to-check-if-second-covid-dose-taken/articleshow/87531117.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s cumulative fatality rate drops to three-month low in October||PUNE: Maharashtra’s Covid mortality rate reduced to a three-month low of 1.92% in October on the back of increased vaccination, early case detection and timely treatment. The state’s fatality rate stood at 2.07% in September and 2.83% in August.Expecting a further drop in the deaths, Dr Avinash Supe, in charge of the state Covid death committee, told TOI that the cumulative fatality rate for Maharashtra was 2.12%. When the pandemic started in March last year, the fatality rate was as high as 10% and gradually dropped to 0.92% in March, only to rise to 1.68% in April during the second wave. Health department data showed that the highest fatality rate (7.41%) has been recorded between the age group of 81 and 90, followed by the patients within the age group of 71 and 80 (6.37%). In spite of the relaxations in restrictions, there hasn’t been a sharp rise in the number of Covid cases or deaths, Dr Supe said. “The overall situation looks better and if the same trend continues, we should see the disease become endemic soon,” he said. Dr Supe said there had been a marked decrease in the number of patients as well as deaths in October, considering there hasn’t been a significant drop in the testing. “ The disease is now prevalent only in a few districts in the state. Having said that, vaccination is still inadequate in the slum and some other areas. While the government is doing all things possible to spread awareness to eliminate vaccine hesitancy, there is a need for more coverage. There is need for booster dose for people who have completed 10 months of vaccination,” he said. On the efforts taken by the health department, Dr Supe said during the early phase of the first wave, around 21,000 patients got admitted after 3-6 days of symptom onset, due to which 50% of them died within 48 hours of admission. “The formula is ‘Test, Trace and Treat’. This helped in early detection and treatment, followed by vaccination,” he said, adding that the focus should now be on any sudden spike and genome sequencing for new variants.State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi confirmed the trend and said, “Multiple factors have led to decrease in deaths, which include vaccination, early treatment and easy access to monoclonal antibodies. However, the state’s target is to reduce the CFR further and register zero Covid deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtras-cfr-drops-to-three-month-low-in-october/articleshow/87529224.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune: Three held for robbery bid at DSK project site||PUNE: The Hadapsar police arrested three criminals for attempting to rob steel from DSK Dream City site at Phursungi, off Pune-Solapur highway, after assaulting one of the security guards at the project entrance, at 8.30pm on Tuesday. The police on Tuesday night arrested Raj Pawar (22), Sanket Gaikwad (22), and Sumit Salve (22), all residents of Kawadipat in Hadapsar. They had cases of body and property offences against them. In the past three years, five complaints had been lodged in relation to theft of steel, furniture, glass, vehicles, electronic goods and other articles from the DSK Dream City site, the police said. The Dream City premises has been wearing a deserted look ever since its developer Deepak Sakharam Kulkarni, alias DSK, was arrested in a cheating case that was lodged with the Shivajinagar police. The assaulted security guard (28), a resident of Hadapsar, had lodged a police complaint soon after the incident. Police registered a case under IPC sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The police said the government agencies, which are probing the DSK cheating case, have hired security guards to protect the property from thieves, as directed by the court. According to the police, four security guards and their supervisor were on duty when the incident occurred. The arrested men walked into the premises of DSK Dream City when the security guard stopped them. The suspects, who were armed with sharp weapons, assaulted the guard and he fell on the ground. He managed to raise an alarm and the other security guards and the supervisor rushed to the spot. The police said one of the security guards managed to contact the police. A team of police was sent to the site. The suspects by then had taken shelter in a building. But the police were able to nab them after a search.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-held-for-bid-to-steal-steel-from-dsk-project-site/articleshow/87529136.cms||---

New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles have the largest shares of crypto hires this year, followed by the Miami and Chicago metropolitan areas, according to a new ranking based on LinkedIn data. But the remaining 53% of crypto jobs in the study were dispersed elsewhere in relatively small chunks, the data show. The study, provided by LinkedIn at Bloomberg’s request, shows that the industry hasn’t settled on a single hub like finance in New York, tech in San Francisco and movies in Hollywood. It’s the result of a culture where many crypto entrepreneurs will often hold themselves out as renegades who reject traditional boundaries. At the same time, the global pandemic has shown white-collar work can be done from anywhere. “Crypto companies are an extreme version of tech, where the ethos of their work is about being decentralised,” said Diogo Monica, cofounder of crypto technology services company Anchorage Digital, which is hiring for remote jobs around the world. “This means cities and states with lower taxes, great infrastructure, and quick access to an international airport will benefit from fully remote work.” A crypto hire is any LinkedIn member who started a new job with titles including the keywords “crypto”, “blockchain”, “Bitcoin”, “Ethereum”, or “Solidity” — the latter being a smart contract programming language used for blockchain technology. The data is meant to serve as arough proxy for the broader crypto job market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/crypto-jobs-span-us-as-hubs-spring-up-all-over/articleshow/87531284.cms||---

With 78 million cases in the WHO's European region- which spans 53 countries and territories and includes several nations in Central Asia -- the cumulative toll now exceeded that of South East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean region, the Western Pacific, and Africa combined, the organisation said. "We are, once again, at the epicentre," WHO Europe director Hans Kluge told a press conference. Kluge noted that the "current pace of transmission across the 53 countries of the European Region is of grave concern." According to "one reliable projection" the current trajectory would mean "another half a million Covid-19 deaths" by February, Kluge added. The increases were observed "across all age groups," he said. Kluge blamed the soaring caseload on "insufficient vaccination coverage" and "the relaxation of public health and social measures." Hospital admission rates were higher in countries with lower vaccination rates, he said. Measures like testing, tracing, physical distancing and the use of face masks were still part of the "arsenal" in fighting the virus. "We must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of Covid-19, to preventing them from happening in the first place," Kluge said. The number of new cases per day has been rising for nearly six consecutive weeks in Europe and the number of new deaths per day has been rising for just over seven consecutive weeks, with about 250,000 cases and 3,600 deaths per day, according to official country data compiled by AFP. Over the past seven days, Russia has led the rise with 8,162 deaths, followed by Ukraine with 3,819 deaths and and Romania with 3,100 deaths, according to the data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/rising-pace-of-covid-transmission-in-europe-of-grave-concern-who/articleshow/87531366.cms||---

While vehicular movement from Wave City Centre metro station towards Parthala roundabout and Greater Noida West has commenced, officials said traffic flow on the second side will begin post-Diwali. A long-pending demand of residents living in adjacent sectors, the underpass will allow a seamless commute from City Centre mall to Greater Noida West through Vikas Marg. On Monday, a team from the Noida Authority had inspected the underpass and given its approval for the partial opening, officials said. “We have opened one side of the Sector 71 underpass on Wednesday. For the next two days, we will monitor the traffic flow on it and the complaints, if any, regarding the cuts and access points. The second side is likely to be opened by November 5,” Mukesh Vaish, senior manager of Noida Authority, said, adding that the underpass will continue to remain under trial for the next 15 days. Access points to the service lanes along the underpass, Vaish said, will be shut up to the Balaknath temple now. While a U-turn near the temple will remain open but modifications may be expected based on feedback from commuters, the official added. Commissioned on June 14, 2019, at a cost of Rs 52.58 crore, the underpass has earlier missed its December 2020 deadline due to Covid-19 and subsequent NGT restrictions on construction activities. Later, issues related to a metro pillar alignment and subsequent permissions from the DMRC and monsoon led the Authority to miss three further deadlines between January and October this year. As a result of this, the cost of construction also went up by Rs 6.77 crore, taking the total to Rs 59.35 crore. The underpass has been a long-pending demand for people living in Sectors 51, 52, 61, 62, 70 -79, 121 and 122 who can now access it to reach signal-free destinations from both Parthala roundabout to Wave City Centre as well as from 7x sectors’ to Sectors 61-63. So far, commuters had to take detours via MP2 elevated road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-missing-4-deadlines-sector-71-underpass-opens-partially-to-public/articleshow/87517898.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The Asiatic lion is the new mascot of the Gujarat prohibition and excise department. The department has chosen a mascot for the first time since it came into existence. "Hoon daru peeto nathi chhata hoon raja chhu. Nashabandhi aapna dwara, aapna maate (Though, I do not drink, I am still the king of the jungle. Prohibition of liquor by us, for all)," goes the phrase with the symbol. A senior officer of the prohibition department said they selected the mascot after discussing it with the newly chosen ministers. "If a person does not drink, s/he can show confidence like a lion. If s/he is caught drunk, then cops will roar like a lion in front of the accused," said another senior officer. The officer added that Gujarat is known for the Asiatic lion, so it was the obvious choice as a mascot. "There are many animals in the state, but the lion is part of Gujarat's identity. The state is known basically for two things: one for the Asiatic lions and the other for 'darubandhi' (prohibition). So, it is very apt to make the Asiatic lion our mascot," said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/asiatic-lion-to-roar-for-prohibition-in-gujarat/articleshow/87531378.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Personal enmity is said to be the reason behind the incident that occurred on November 4, police said. The police said that two of the victims were involved in a murder in 2007 and were out on bail. Complainant Rajesh Kumar said Yogender alias Rinku of Kasan village, Deepak alias Bholu of Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, Manish Rana of Bhiwani, Amit alias Gaath of Sonipat and a few other assailants barged into the house of former Sarpanch Gopal at around 8 p.m. and opened indiscriminate firing. Rajesh Kumar told the police that he along with his nephews Balram and Sohanpal and Praveen, cousin brother of Balram, were inside the house, while his son Vikas Raghav and Balram's eight-year-old son Yash Chauhan were celebrating Diwali in the lawn when the attack took place. "The assailants entered the house and opened fire on us. Vikas received several bullet wounds and after we raised an alarm, all the armed criminals fled the spot," he said. "Vikas was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead by the doctors," the complainant told the police. One person died on the spot. "Search is on to nab the absconding criminals," said Veer Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Pataudi. The deceased have been identified as Vikas (21) and Sohanpal (35). Sohanpal was the son of Gopal. His brother Balram was also injured in the attack and is under treatment at a private hospital. Rajesh is the third person to be injured. The condition of Praveen is said to be critical while Yash Chauhan is out of danger. Singh said Balram and Sohanpal were "involved" in the murder of Manoj, brother of the prime accused Yogender alias Rinku on Holi in 2007, and the attack could be connected to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/one-dead-five-injured-after-assailants-fire-at-family-in-gurugram/articleshow/87531377.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 'Hazardous' air quality recorded after Diwali celebrations||DELHI: While Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) reached the 'severe' category on Diwali night, the Janpath area recorded 'hazardous' air quality on Friday morning as a thick blanket of smog shrouds the skies of the national capital. Even though the Delhi government has banned firecrackers, people burst crackers on street.  Several people in Delhi-NCR complained of itchy throat and watery eyes. The PM10 levels crossed the 500 micrograms per cubic metre mark around 5 am on Friday and stood at 511 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR shot up from 243 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm on Thursday (Diwali day) to 410 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am on Friday, around seven times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre, reported PTI. Of the 39 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, 33 reported their AQI in the severe category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (454), Greater Noida (410), Ghaziabad (438), Gurgaon (473) and Noida (456) recorded severe air quality on Friday morning. As per the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality would not improve until Sunday evening (November 7). The improvement would, however, just fluctuate in the 'Very Poor' category, reported ANI. SAFAR said, "If firecrackers are burned even 50 per cent of last year then PM2.5 will enter 'severe' category by midnight and shoot up rapidly by today early morning with AQI even crossing 500+." As per the SAFAR model forecast, the stubble share will touch ~35 per cent today (November 5) and ~40 per cent on November 6 and November 7. "Relief is expected only from the evening of November 7 but AQI will fluctuate within the Very Poor range," it said. The extremely calm wind conditions in Delhi combined with a 25 per cent stubble share (fire count 2,293) are two major factors of pollution on Friday. - With inputs from PTI and ANI Watch Diwali 2021: Despite ban, crackers make their presence felt in Delhi; air quality 'hazardous'||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hazardous-air-quality-recorded-at-janpath-after-diwali-celebrations/articleshow/87531431.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Experts draw comfort from Covid stats||KOLKATA: Despite the fear of a sharp spike in Covid numbers during the fortnight after the Puja, hospitals across the state have seen either a slight drop in Covid bed occupancy over the past few days or the number of admissions has remained more or less unchanged. Health experts said while such a trend is a positive sign, we need to observe it for a longer period and without dropping the guard during Diwali. After the massive second wave surge that led to a major hospital bed crisis, the number of Covid patients started declining after the state imposed strict curbs. The number in most Kolkata hospitals had come down to less than 15, even to single digits by August-end and September beginning. But cases started rising again before the Pujas with markets and malls overcrowded with shoppers. “Number of patients requiring hospital admission was rising gradually and had shot up to 36/37 a day a week ago. But we are seeing a slight dip in the number in the past few days. We currently have around 22 patients,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Labs are also seeing a slight dip in positivity rate. From about 4%, many labs had started reporting a higher positivity ranging between 6% and 10% after the festival. “The bed occupancy has come down a bit along with the positivity rate in our hospital,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (East) Narayana Health. Some hospitals have decided to stick to the current Covid bed strength till at least two weeks post-Diwali. “Post-Puja, we had about 12 patients daily on an average. The number started shooting up and reached 23, the maximum so far post-Durga Puja, before the number started declining since the past few days,” said Subhasish Datta, chief general manage (operations) Ruby General Hospital. “Bed occupancy has remained stagnant with us for the past few days. Even as it looks like the situation is under control we are keeping a close watch and our facility is prepared,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. Health experts cited vaccination as the reason for this lull in number and also the likely absence of a new strain. “We had feared a new strain cropping up due to the reckless crowding during Pujas that could have been disastrous. But with more patients now being asymtopmatic , we hope to be moving towards herd immunity,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-experts-draw-comfort-from-covid-stats/articleshow/87531490.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Ceramic tile prices up 10% after gas price revision||AHMEDABAD: Ceramic tile makers in Morbi have decided to raise prices of various types of tiles by 10%. The decision follows a recent hike in prices of piped natural gas (PNG) supplied to the industrial units in India's largest cluster of ceramic industry. "Tile prices have been increased by 10% with effect from November 1. The prices have been revised thrice in the past three months due to the increased prices of natural gas and other fuels," said Mukesh Kundariya, president, vitrified tiles division, Morbi Ceramic Association (MCA). According to industry players, some manufacturers have already passed on the hike, while others are in the process to do so. With back-to-back price rises in August, October and November, ceramic tiles - vitrified, wall tiles and floor tiles - have become 40-50% costlier this year, added tile manufacturers in Morbi. "The prices have gone up due to spiralling cost of fuels, which include natural gas, coal and petrol and diesel over the past one year," added Mukesh Ughreja, a Morbi-based tile maker. Kundariya further added that the recent price rise in industrial PNG has translated in to a cost burden of Rs 200-250 crore per month on the Morbi ceramic tile industry. "The increased natural gas price is likely to have an adverse impact on our export orders as well," he said. With effect from November 1, state-run Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL) has raised the tariffs of industrial PNG supplied to ceramic and sanitaryware units in Morbi and Surendranagar by Rs 11 per standard cubic meter (SCM) to Rs 58 per SCM from Rs 47 per SCM for the three-month minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO). The industrial PNG has been revised upwards following a rise in the international prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Since the beginning of August, industrial PNG prices for 3-month MGO have gone up from around Rs 33.14 per standard cubic meter (excluding tax) to Rs 58 per SCM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-ceramic-tile-prices-up-10-after-gas-price-revision/articleshow/87531810.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||India||Oxford scientists find gene that doubles risk of dying from Covid-19||LONDON: Scientists identified a specific gene that doubles the risk of respiratory failure from Covid-19 and may go some way to explaining why some ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe disease than others. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that a higher-risk version of the gene most likely prevents the cells lining airways and the lungs from responding to the virus properly. About 60% of people with South Asian ancestry carry this version of the gene, compared with 15% of people with European heritage, according to the study published Thursday. The findings help explain why higher rates of hospitalization and death may have been seen in certain communities and on the Indian subcontinent. The authors cautioned that the gene cannot be used as a sole explanation as many other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, play a role. Despite a significant impact from the virus to people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry, only 2% carry the higher-risk genotype. People with the gene, known as LZTFL1, would particularly benefit from vaccination, which remains the best method of protection, the authors said. The findings raise the possibility of research into treatments specific to patients with this gene, though no tailored drugs are currently available. This “shows that the way in which the lung responds to the infection is critical,” said James Davies, co-lead author and associate professor of genomics at Oxford, who worked in intensive care during the pandemic. “This is important because most treatments have focused on changing the way in which the immune system reacts to the virus.” Davies and his colleagues found the gene using artificial intelligence and cutting-edge molecular technology. The team trained an algorithm to analyze large quantities of genetic data from hundreds of types of cells all over the body, and then used a new technique that allowed them to hone in on the DNA behind this specific genetic signal. All other things being equal, “if you have the higher-risk genotype and you get very unwell with Covid, there’s a 50% chance that that wouldn’t have happened to you had you had the lower-risk genotype,” Davies said on a briefing with reporters Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxford-scientists-find-gene-that-doubles-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19/articleshow/87532088.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Will relocate evicted families of Gorukhuti if citizenship proven, says Assam government||GUWAHATI: The Assam government said it has earmarked about 134 hectare for relocating the evicted families of Gorukhuti in Darrang district provided they are valid citizens besides a set of other requirements. The evicted families of Dhalpur villages in Gorukuti will not, however, be paid any compensation as they are “encroachers”, the government said in an affidavit to Gauhati High Court in response to a PIL filed by the leader of the opposition Debabrata Saikia. “An area of about 1,000 bighas (about 134 hectares) of land in the southern part of No 1 & No 3 Dhalpur village has been earmarked for relocating the evicted persons subject to verification of the status of erosion affected and landless status in their respective original places and districts, citizenship and existing rehabilitation policy of the state,” the affidavit by the government said. Sipajhar Revenue Circle Officer Kamaljeet Sarma, representing the Assam government, said in the affidavit that the occupants of the areas were encroachers and they were “liable to be evicted at any time” as per rules framed under Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886. “The matter is related to encroachment and eviction only and is not at all related to acquisition of land. Therefore, the question of resettlement, rehabilitation and compensation etc as per Land Acquisition Act is irrelevant,” he added. Besides Saikia’s case, the Gauhati high court had itself registered a suo motu PIL after the violent eviction drive at Sipajhar and both the matters were clubbed together. The Gauhati High Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Kakheto Sema, heard the matter on Wednesday and granted one week’s time to the state government for filing a detailed counter affidavit and fixed December 14 for the next hearing. The court also noted the state government’s assurance that as of now for the remaining alleged encroachers no coercive measure is being adopted as efforts are being made to convince them to move to the demarcated area on their own. “All the same, as and when such measures are adopted, the petitioner would be at liberty to move an application before this court,” the order said. When contacted, Saikia’s counsel Talha Abdul Rahman told a news agency that there is a due process to detain foreigners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/will-relocate-evicted-families-of-gorukhuti-if-citizenship-proven-says-assam-government/articleshow/87532209.cms||---

Kaisa's woes come as a liquidity crisis at one of the nation's biggest property developers Evergrande threw a spotlight on the industry in recent months, following a state crackdown that has rattled investors and fuelled fears of wider economic fallout. The trading halt on Friday came amid Chinese media reports that wealth management products related to Kaisa had not been repaid when due, and that chief executive Kwok Ying-shing admitted the company was facing "unprecedented pressure on its liquidity". In a brief notice to the Hong Kong stock exchange Friday no reason was given for the suspension. Last week, ratings agencies Fitch and S&P both downgraded Kaisa, citing refinancing risks. Fitch said the downgrade was due to Kaisa's "limited funding access and uncertainty over the refinancing of a significant amount of US-dollar bond maturities and coupon payment." Troubles in China's property sector are weighing on authorities' resolve to forge ahead with reforms to rein in excessive debt. Evergrande, which is bogged down in a sea of more than $300 billion in liabilities, plunged into crisis after Beijing began clamping down on the country's colossal property sector. There have been suggestions that Beijing could be rolling back some of those regulations though, with state media recently hinting that local banks had begun easing some credit controls on homebuyers and developers on orders from the central bank. For now, all eyes are on another key deadline with an $82.5 million coupon payment by Evergrande coming up on Saturday. As the Shenzhen-based group works to shed assets, e-mobility firm Bedeo said Thursday that it had acquired Protean Electric from a subsidiary of Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group. Chinese authorities have urged Evergrande billionaire founder Xu Jiayin, also known as Hui Ka Yan, to use his personal fortune to alleviate the company's debt crisis, according to reports. Bloomberg reported that his luxury assets alone -- including a 60-metre yacht, business jets and houses under his name -- have an estimated value of $485 million, which could help cover the bond coupons that are yet to come due or have grace periods ending this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/chinese-developers-shares-bonds-stumble-again-as-kaisa-units-suspended/articleshow/87532296.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals hope for rise in Covaxin demand||KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata greeted the WHO nod to Covaxin and hoped they would now be able to use up at least a part of stocks that they have been holding for months and which are due to expire in three weeks. Some said they are staring at a huge loss and rued that the vaccines would be wasted unless there was an immediate surge in the number of recipients. At least two hospitals are planning to pass on their stocks to government hospitals free of cost. AMRI Hospitals are left with 4,800 doses of Covaxin worth Rs 50 lakh. The nod has come a little too late for existing stocks to be used, felt CEO Rupak Barua. “We are not expecting a rush for Covaxin now since most have got first dose. The impact of this late nod will be slow and won’t really help to exhaust stocks we hold. Had the government accorded permission for emergency administration to the under-18 age group, it would have made a difference,” said Barua. AMRI has been giving a mere 10-15 Covaxin doses a day. “At best, it can go up to 40-50 which won’t be enough. So, we have written to various clubs and associations to help us hold offshore camps where these can be used,” added Barua. He said the hospital may donate the residual stocks to government hospitals soon. Peerless Hospital is saddled with 500 doses of Covaxin. Daily consumption has been less than 10 for several months. Often, it has been zero. “We had no Covaxin recipient on Thursday despite WHO nod. We are trying to get in touch with recipients and tell them that it’s now recognized worldwide. Queries have been coming in but people are not yet convinced. So, we are heading for a wastage,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The state currently has a stock of 15 lakh Covaxin doses which are being used mostly on second dose recipients. “We will again start administering first dose of after we get the next tranche of 11 lakh Covaxin doses which may reach in next two days,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Erratic supply of Covaxin and its shorter window for second dose, apart from the WHO non-recognition that prevented foreign travel, are the reasons why it was rejected by recipients, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain felt that Covishield enjoyed the ‘first mover’ advantage.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences said it has exhausted Covaxin stock and would wait for ‘response in near future’ before deciding on procuring the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-hospitals-hope-for-rise-in-covaxin-demand/articleshow/87532298.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

She was 82. Collins' family confirmed her death on Thursday to The Detroit News, the newspaper reported. Christopher Collins, 51, said his mother died around 2am on Thursday. She had been vaccinated against the coronavirus, but still fell ill and was hospitalized before her death, he said. "She lived her whole life in the same neighborhood, same house she was born in, on the lower east side," he added. "That says a lot about a person." Barbara-Rose Collins, a Democrat, was elected to the US House in 1990 after eight years on the City Council. She was defeated for reelection to Congress in 1996 by Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick. She was elected again to the council in 2001 and served until 2009 when she did not seek reelection. In 1974, Collins was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives where she served three terms. "You could get into a floor fight with her but she would then invite you to her house a few days later," former Detroit mayor and city council president Ken Cockrel Jr told The Detroit News. "She always understood that it was business and never personal." Collins was born in Detroit and graduated in 1957 from Cass Technical High School, according to her US House biography. She attended Wayne State University in Detroit, majoring in political science and anthropology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/former-us-congresswoman-barbara-rose-collins-dies-at-82/articleshow/87532307.cms||---
---||Business||Asian markets struggle to track Wall Street rally, eyes on US jobs||HONG KONG: Asian markets were mixed Friday following the previous day's gains, with eyes on the release of key US jobs data later in the day, while investors are also assessing the outlook for central bank monetary policy in the face of surging inflation. Equities around the world enjoyed a healthy run-up Thursday after the Federal Reserve finally announced its plan for tapering the vast bond-buying programme that has provided crucial support since it was put in place at the start of the pandemic. The news removed a lot of uncertainty about officials' response to a spike in inflation that is expected to last a lot longer than previously thought, and follows moves in other countries to step back from their ultra-easy measures as the world economy recovers. However, the Bank of England's decision Thursday not to lift rates shocked traders, who had taken recent indications from boss Andrew Bailey that it would do so. While its board signalled a rise was still on the cards in the coming months, it raised questions about how quickly the financial leaders would tighten policy, with forecasts for the Fed's own hiking timeline put back. Bond yields, which indicate future pricing for interest rates, sank after the announcement and raised concerns about further uncertainty, particularly as inflation remains doggedly high owing to supply chain snarls, high commodity prices and wage growth. That has fuelled talk of a period of stagflation when prices surge but economic growth stalls. "Rates are a global market," Subadra Rajappa, at Societe Generale, said. "Global central banks seem to be pushing back on market expectations for aggressive policy action." The BoE decision also hammered the pound, which sank against the dollar, and it struggled to recover on Friday sitting below $1.35, having been at $1.37 beforehand. Still, Wall Street enjoyed another record, with tech firms the main beneficiaries as they are more susceptible to higher borrowing costs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both chalked up new highs for a fifth straight day, though the Dow dipped. Markets in Paris and Frankfurt were also at new peaks. However, Asian investors struggled to pick up the baton. Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul all fell, while there were gains in Sydney, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta. Manila jumped more than one percent as virus measures were eased in the Philippine capital. Oil shot up after OPEC and other major producers stuck to their plan to modestly lift output despite surging demand and concerns about supplies. The move also ignored a call from US President Joe Biden and other big energy consuming nations to open the taps further. Friday's gains came after a recent heavy retreat in prices following news that Iran nuclear talks were progressing and could lead to the removal of sanctions barring the sale of Tehran's crude on world markets. Still, OANDA's Edward Moya expects the commodity to remain buoyed. "The selloff in WTI crude won't last long as the oil market is still in deficit and whatever response the US has will likely be temporary relief and nothing that brings US production back to the levels seen under the Trump administration," he wrote in a note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/asian-markets-struggle-to-track-wall-street-rally-eyes-on-us-jobs/articleshow/87532429.cms||---

The comment was made while dismissing a petition challenging the decision to reserve the post of adhyaksha of Konaje gram panchayat in Mangaluru taluk in Dakshina Kannada district in favour of scheduled castes (woman). “It is in fact a vindication of empowerment of women in grassroots politics. The case at hand is a clear step towards fruition of the dreams of the father of the nation with regard to villagelevel governance and participation of women in such governance,” justice M Nagaprasanna stated. The judge also noted the 73rd amendment to the Constitution, which was a step towards self-governance at grassroots level, but equal rights had not come about yet. “This is a classic case where empowerment of the hitherto under-powered has emerged in all vigour at grassroots level. The challenge is made by one of the petitioners who is a scheduled caste man. If it were to be contrary to law, it would have been a different circumstance altogether, while it is not,” the judge noted in his order while dismissing the petition filed by Ravi and Ramakrishna K Pattori, two elected members of Konaje village panchayat. The petitioners had sought for directions to reserve the post of adhyaksha of their village panchayat as SC (general) instead of SC (woman). Their argument was that there’s already a scheduled caste member of the 12 elected members in the GP. The State Election Commission had informed the court that women have emerged victorious in all the reserved seats in the taluk and that cannot be a ground for the petitioners to contend that offices of adhyaksha and upadhyaksha cannot be reserved in favour of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-high-time-men-gave-way-for-women-to-lead-says-hc/articleshow/87532502.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||World||US submarine commander fired after crash into sea mountain||WASHINGTON: The US Navy on Thursday sacked the commanding officer, executive officer and top enlisted sailor of a nuclear-powered submarine that crashed into an underwater mountain, saying the October 2 accident was preventable. Commander Cameron Aljilani and two others were removed from their positions following an investigation into the crash in the disputed South China Sea. The USS Connecticut was forced to sail on the surface for a week to reach Guam. "Sound judgement, prudent decision-making and adherence to required procedures in navigation planning, watch team execution and risk management could have prevented the incident," the western Pacific-based 7th Fleet said in a statement. After a damage assessment in Guam, the vessel will return to the US submarine base in Bremerton, Washington for repairs. Last week the navy said the investigation showed that the submarine struck an uncharted "seamount" while patrolling below the surface. Eleven sailors were injured in the accident. According to reports, the crash damaged the sub's forward ballast tanks, but its nuclear plant was not damaged. The US Navy regularly conducts operations in the region to challenge China's disputed territorial claims on small islands, reefs and outcrops. Aljilani was replaced by an interim commanding officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-submarine-commander-fired-after-crash-into-sea-mountain/articleshow/87532439.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Loss of tropical tree cover causes more CO2 release than India overall||BENGALURU: One of the major takeaways at the COP26 in Glasgow has been the pledge — by more than 100 leaders — to end deforestation by the end of this decade. That countries, including India, have stayed away from the declaration notwithstanding, those that have taken it together account for 85% of the world’s forests. While experts and leaders have been speaking about the need to cut deforestation, the loss of tree cover continues. Data from Global Forest Watch analysed in research published by journal Nature shows tropical tree cover loss has led to an average annual CO2 equivalent emissions of 5.3 gigatons from 2001-19. An analysis by Statista, a global company specialising in data, shows that this average annual CO2 equivalent emissions — due to tropical deforestation — is nearly 2 gigatons more than India’s estimated annual emission of 3.4 gigatons. The firm has additionally used data from World Resources Institute. In fact, if tropical deforestation was a country, it would have the third largest carbon footprint in the world after China and the US, when excluding the effects of landuse change and forestry. Need to reduce gross emissions, says studyThe study in Nature, accessed by TOI, has 17 authors/researchers from the US, the Netherlands and Indonesia. And, in the conclusion of their study, the authors say: “Our analysis reinforces the need to reduce gross emissions from tropical deforestation as a climate change mitigation strategy, while also highlighting the substantial but often underappreciated contribution of intact primary and older secondary forests to carbon dioxide removals.” Pointing out that quantifying gross emissions and removals separately and consistently across all forest lands — and producing maps in addition to tabular statistics — improves transparency in accounting of factors and geographies contributing to global net forest GHG flux, they added that it also provides a framework to integrate new and improved data sources over time and that governments interested in spatially prioritizing implementation and tracking of national and subnational forest mitigation targets can increasingly make use of such data. “Non-government actors... could benefit from a globally consistent and spatially explicit forest monitoring system...,” the study reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/loss-of-tropical-tree-cover-causes-more-co2-release-than-india-overall/articleshow/87532546.cms||Chethan Kumar

---||Guwahati||Grandson of Mizoram ex-CM Thenphunga Sailo surrenders in sodomy case||AIZAWL: Former chief minister Brigadier Thenphunga Sailo’s grandson, Zodinliana Sailo, surrendered before police in Aizawl on Thursday morning in connection with an alleged sodomy case in 2018. Sailo allegedly sodomised a 25-year-old youngster on September 9, 2018. He and another co-accused, R Lalhruaitluanga, were arrested after a complaint was filed on September 28, but both managed to secure bail. Following public outcry and media attention, Aizawl’s additional district and sessions judge HTC Lalrinchhana issued arrest warrants on Wednesday against Sailo and Lalhruaitluanga. But when police went to arrest Sailo, he allegedly evaded arrest and surrendered before police around 2 am on Thursday. As Lalhruaitluanga tested positive for Covid-19, police have currently kept him in isolation at his home. The case came to light after the victim’s relatives accused police of not registering a case even after a complaint was submitted. One of the relatives accused police of trying to convince the family to settle the case with the accused. However, after public outcry, police initially registered a case under bailable sections. After more protests, they added non-bailable charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/grandson-of-mizoram-ex-cm-thenphunga-sailo-surrenders-in-sodomy-case/articleshow/87532489.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Nine-year-old Mysuru boy kidnapped for Rs 4 lakh ransom found murdered; one detained||MYSURU: A nine-year-old boy kidnapped for a Rs 4-lakh ransom on Wednesday was found murdered and his body was found in a bush in Hunsur taluk of Mysuru district on Thursday. Superintendent of police R Chethan said Karthik, son of trader Nagaraj from Hanagod in Hunsur, was kidnapped late on Wednesday and was found his throat slit by Thursday noon. Investigations are going on to establish where the boy was kidnapped from, where he was kept, when he was murdered and people involved in the crime. A suspect has been detained in the case, the SP said. Police claimed that four more persons, including two women, have been detained for questioning. One woman is said to be from the same village who was closely moniroing the trader’s activities. Karthik, a class IV student, went missing after he left home to buy crackers from a village shop on Wednesday evening. His father Nagaraj received a call from an unlisted phone number around 7.30pm and was informed that his son has been kidnapped. The trader rushed home to find his son missing. In a second call, the kidnapper allegedly demanded Rs 4 lakh to set the boy free before switching off the phone. Nagaraj, aided by villagers, searched for his son in nearby areas before approaching police in the night. Senior police officers interrogated a few suspicious persons in the village and detained one of them. On his information, cops reached the crime scene – a village called Kunterikere – where his body was recovered from a nearby bush. Sources said the accused, possibly from the same or neighbouring village, may be an acquaintance of trader Nagaraj. A source said the kidnappers may have developed cold feet after making the ransom call and eliminated the boy over fears that their identity may be revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/nine-year-old-mysuru-boy-kidnapped-for-rs-4-lakh-ransom-found-murdered-one-detained/articleshow/87532587.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka comes up with solution for flyers testing positive post-Covid recovery||BENGALURU: After it was pointed out that a few international flyers who have completely recovered from Covid-19 continue to test positive for the viral disease, thus affecting their travel to India, the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19 has recommended that these travellers furnish a clinical evaluation report stating that they have no symptoms and a negative sub genomic RNA (SgRNA) test in order to fly. The TAC report on the issue said the clinical evaluation report will have to be given by a clinician. The SgRNA test is a specialised one that proves the individual is free of the virus. However, TAC members were hazy on where one could get such a test done. The advisory committee took up the issue after senior IAS officers from the secretariat brought to the attention of panel members the plight of a couple of international flyers who were unable to make it to Bengaluru as they had continued to test positive for Covid-19, despite completely recovering from the viral infection. “People who want to travel to India cannot even buy air tickets if they continue to test positive,” said a TAC member. “The positive test is attributed to remnants of the virus still present in the body and the results of these RT-PCR tests are considered false positives. These people have no symptoms, nor can they infect others since they are not carriers of the virus. Such cases are rarely seen, perhaps a couple once in three months. In this particular case, two passengers reached out to higher authorities who brought it to our attention.” After detailed discussions on the issue at their meeting on October 28, TAC members opined that such rare cases should not be considered a dilution of the current standard operating procedure (SOP). “However, such individuals who have recovered from Covid but continue to test positive may be permitted to travel after complying with the following criteria: A clinical evaluation report from a physician declaring the person asymptomatic and has recovered from Covid-19; and a subgenomic RNA (SgRNA) test wherever available should be done and the result should be negative,” reads the TAC report submitted to the government. A TAC member said the SgRNA test is an indicator of virus replication. “Though SgRNA was suggested, it is still in research mode in India. We don’t know where it is being done abroad or where one can get it done,” the member said. Given that such cases are rare, another member said, “In such cases, a clinical evaluation is done to ensure that they have completely recovered.” TOI could not ascertain if there were any people in Karnataka who are unable to fly out because they continue to test positive for Covid-19 despite completely recovering from the viral disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-comes-up-with-solution-for-flyers-testing-positive-post-covid-recovery/articleshow/87532675.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||World||Jack Ma, Trump and Xi: How Chinese billionaire flew close to the sun||HONG KONG: This was supposed to be Jack Ma's finest hour: a year ago to the day, his Ant Group was meant to go public in a $37 billion blaze of glory. Instead Beijing reined in his empire, abruptly clipping the wings of corporate China's biggest star. Now, to the cautious cheer of investors, the billionaire Alibaba e-commerce tycoon is taking his first tentative steps back on to the global stage with a low-key trip to Europe where he's cultivating hobbies like horticulture. It's a far cry from the height of Ma's statesman-like powers in 2017 when he travelled to New York to meet President-elect Donald Trump for one-on-one talks in Trump Tower days before inauguration and promised to create a million American jobs. That high-profile outing had roiled the Chinese government, which first learned of the meeting and jobs pledge along with the rest of the world when Ma held an informal televised Q&A session with reporters in the lobby of the skyscraper, according to four people close to Alibaba with knowledge of the matter and one Beijing government source. Alibaba's government relations team was subsequently told by Chinese officials that Beijing was unhappy about Ma meeting Trump without its prior approval, two of the people close to the company said. Ma's charitable foundation, which handles his media queries, did not respond to a request for comment. The State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. All the sources declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. The meeting on January 9 came at a time of taut tensions between the two countries after Trump was critical of China during his election campaign, blaming it for the loss of American jobs. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. The four people close to Alibaba said they believed the meeting was a negative turning point in the relationship between Ma and Beijing. They did not elaborate on their thinking. Investors are hungry for clues about Ma's situation: the mere sighting of the businessman on the Spanish island of Mallorca last month, his first trip abroad in over a year, immediately saw Alibaba gain as much as $42 billion in value. The story of his fall from official favour helps illustrate how rapidly China has transformed under Xi Jinping, as he nears what could be a precedent-breaking third term as leader of the economic powerhouse and exerts greater control over some of its most innovative companies. 'A natural first target'Authorities cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October last year accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. Regulators suspended the $37 billion listing of his fintech firm Ant Group two days before the planned debut on November 5, ordered that Ant be restructured and launched antitrust investigations into Ma's businesses, eventually leading to a record $2.75 billion fine for Alibaba in April. The clampdown has spread across the private sector, with officials tightening oversight of companies in technology, real estate, gaming, education, cryptocurrencies and finance. "Given that Jack appeared too provocative, out of step with the new approach to governance espoused by Xi, he was a natural first target to signal that a major change had begun," said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA China and author of a book on Alibaba and Ma. "Jack was rubbing shoulders regularly with foreign presidents, prime ministers, royalty, celebrities at places like Davos or on his own visits overseas. There was a constant stream of VIP visitors to see him in Hangzhou too." Ma's global outreach did not end after the Trump meeting, though. Between 2018 and 2020 he held talks with a host of high-profile figures, including UN Secretary General António Guterres, Queen Rania of Jordan, Malaysia's veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad and then Belgian premier Charles Michel, according to Alibaba's news portal Alizila and media reports. At Alibaba's Hangzhou headquarters, it has a building housing the company's museum where Ma and his business partner Joe Tsai would take foreign visitors and show them around, according to another person close to Ma. Tsai did not respond to a request for comment via Alibaba. Ma had viewed meetings with foreign politicians as "unofficial diplomacy" for China, which he enjoyed doing, the person added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/jack-ma-trump-and-xi-how-chinese-billionaire-flew-close-to-the-sun/articleshow/87532588.cms||---

Gerry Rice, director, communication department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said India's actions may help catalyse action in other emerging economies as well in addressing the climate change challenges. "We welcome India's announcement at the COP26 of new targets to increase reliance on renewables and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy, including to adopt a net zero target by 2070," Rice told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. "As you know, India is currently one of the world's largest emitters, still heavily reliant on coal for electricity generation. India's significant investment in renewables and climate change adaptation policies suggest it is well positioned to take further steps to reach this new target," Rice said responding to a question. "We are heartened by India's focus on achieving progress in the current decade given the urgent need for global mitigation action. And as with other countries, it will be important to follow through with specific actions to contain emissions over the current decade," he added. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made significant announcements, including the bold pledge of India becoming net zero by 2070. Besides the net zero target, PM Modi also raised India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of achieving 450 giga watt non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watt by 2030. "India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watt by 2030; India will fulfil 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030. Between now and 2030, India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes and by 2030. "India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent and achieve the target of net zero by 2070," the Prime Minister said, adding that these five elixirs will be an unprecedented contribution by India towards climate action. He also asserted that India is the only country that is delivering in "letter and spirit" the commitments on tackling climate change under the Paris Agreement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/imf-welcomes-indias-announcement-at-cop26-on-renewables-net-zero-target-by-2070/articleshow/87532640.cms||---

---||Mumbai||9 of top 10 JEE(A) rankers, 58 of top 100 choose IIT-Bombay, Delhi distant second||MUMBAI: The cream of the country’s young brains have picked IIT Bombay at the close of round one of admissions 2021-22, making it the most soughtafter tech college, with Delhi and Madras a distant second and third. Nine of the top 10 rankers will pursue their BTech in computer science at IIT-B. Scroll the rank list further and 43 of the top 50 have followed suit and decided to pick the Powai institution over any other tech institute. Of the top 100 JEE(A)-2021 rankholders who have been admitted to the IITs this year, more than 50% or 58 preferred IIT -B over any other. This was followed by Delhi, where 32 of the top 100 have been admitted. Last year, 64 of the top 100 joined IIT-B and 33 IIT Delhi. A number of factors are responsible for this: from geography to gastronomy and placement records to what coaching classes tell students. At the close of round one of IIT admissions on October 31, a look at the options exercised by the top 1,000 students reveals Bombay, Delhi, Roorkee and Madras are the top choices, though Kanpur, Kharagpur and Hyderabad have a sizable representation. “This year, we saw that 9 of the top 10 rankers chose IIT-B. Most of our streams have attained new peaks. As soon as one branch closed and the next opened, students picked IIT Bombay over the others. This tells us that we are the preferred choice,” said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri. Faculty at IIT-B say it is the quality of education, campus ambience, rigour and research that electrify its academic and social life. “Research and teaching at the IITs, especially the first-generation ones, is comparable at the undergraduate level. I feel it is the perception among students that makes them pick one institute over the other,” said JEE chairman at IIT Delhi Parag Singla. IIT Roorkee opened its computer science stream at rank 32; this college which is celebrating its 175th anniversary has 2 students in the top 250 ranks and both will be awarded the James Thomson Scholarship, which entails a grant of Rs 25,000 per month as stipend. “This has been a long journey. Our current students have been reaching out to aspirants over social media and telling them more about the vibrant campus life, the canteen, our placement drive and the festivals on campus,” said IIT Roorkee dean (students’ welfare) Mukeshkumar Barua. Among the rest, Kanpur, Madras and Hyderabad have quite a few takers from the top 500. There are 23 IITs in all with 16,232 seats. Some IITs have lost sheen over the years though. Once, getting past the gates of IIT Kanpur gave candidates a demi-god status. This year, CS at IIT Kanpur opened at rank100 to close at 213. Among younger institutes, rank 191 opted for IIT Hyderabad with CS closing there at 520. At IIT Kharagpur and Guwahati, the preferred choice of CS opened at 207 (closing 285) and rank 439 at Guwahati to close at 593.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/9-of-top-10-jeea-rankers-58-of-top-100-choose-iit-bombay-delhi-distant-second/articleshow/87532809.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Business||Cut in fuel excise duty to cost govt Rs 45k cr: Report||MUMBAI: The excise duty cuts on diesel and petrol will cost Rs 45,000 crore and lead to a 0.3 percentage point widening in the Centre’s fiscal deficit, a foreign brokerage said on Thursday. Going by the overall consumption, the cost of the surprise move, which came after months of concerns over high payouts at filling stations, for the entire fiscal will come to Rs 1 lakh crore, or 0.6% of GDP, economists at Japanese brokerage Nomura said in a report. For the remaining months of the ongoing FY22, the cost will be Rs 45,000 crore, which leads to an upward review of the fiscal deficit target. The brokerage said it now expects the fiscal deficit to be 6.5% as against the earlier expectation of 6.2% and underlined that it will still be lower than the budgeted 6.8% target. The central government on Wednesday announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 10 per litre on the eve of Diwali. The move only partly reverses the hike in duties in 2020 by Rs 13 per litre for petrol and Rs 16 per litre on diesel, following a steep drop in oil prices, and comes on the heels of higher crude prices pushing retail prices to record highs, it said. The brokerage said “parsimonious” spending by the government so far this fiscal has helped limit fiscal deficit in H1FY22 to 35% of the budgeted target, compared with a 15% overspend of the budget in H1FY21. The tax cuts should lower headline CPI inflation by 0.14 percentage points due to direct effects and up to 0.3 percentage points if indirect effects are included. But there are offsets from elevated input costs, reopening pressures and an ongoing energy crunch, it said. Politically, high inflation remains one of the top concerns for voters, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cut-in-fuel-excise-duty-to-cost-govt-rs-45k-cr-report/articleshow/87532855.cms||---

This is also probably for the first time fuel rates in Bengaluru are cheaper than New Delhi. On Friday, a litre of petrol was sold in Bengaluru at Rs 100.58 compared to Chennai (Rs 101.51), New Delhi (Rs 103.97), Kolkata (Rs 104.67), Hyderabad (Rs 108.20) and Mumbai (Rs 109.98). Similarly, diesel price in Bengaluru on Friday was at Rs 85.01 per litre, lower than New Delhi (Rs 86.67), Kolkata (Rs 89.79), Chennai (Rs 91.53), Mumbai (Rs 94.14) and Hyderabad (Rs 94.62). The Union government on Wednesday evening slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively which came into effect from Thursday early morning. Karnataka government’s Rs 7 per litre reduction in the state tax on fuels was implemented at 6pm on Thursday. On Wednesday night, CM Basavaraj Bommai had tweeted: “Even though it will mean a loss of Rs 2,100 crore to our exchequer, it will bring down the prices for our citizens to Rs 95.90 & Rs 81.50 (approx.) for petrol and diesel respectively”. However, many fuel dealers disputed it, saying that fuel prices will cost more. Friday's fuel rate in Bengaluru is Rs 4.68 and Rs 3.51 more per litre for petrol and diesel than the CM’s projections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/among-metro-cities-bengaluru-motorists-pay-less-for-fuel/articleshow/87532877.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

By Monday morning, timed-entry tickets had sold out, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. More than 5,000 people were expected to visit the garden by Tuesday evening. The bloom of the “corpse plant” lasts just 48 hours and during its peak it emits a putrid odor of rotting flesh to attract carrion beetles and flesh flies that help its pollination process.

---||World||Taliban Interior Minister mediates peace talks between Pakistan and TTP||PESHAWAR: Acting interior minister in the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, Sirajuddin Haqqani is reportedly playing a role of a mediator between Pakistan and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to reach a "broader" "peace agreement" to bring an end to the two-decades of militancy in Pakistan, local media reported. Pakistan has reached a possible understanding with the TTP after the "direct, face-to-face" talks between the two sides that are being held in South-western Khost province of Afghanistan for almost two weeks, reported Dawn citing the sources. However, it is not clear who on the Pakistan side is negotiating with the TTP. The understanding includes the declaration of a nationwide truce and the release of some TTP terrorists based on certain conditions, as part of confidence-building measures. However, the TTP has yet not confirmed or denied the possible understanding reached between the two sides. The number of terrorists who are to be released was not clear, however, the newspaper reported citing the sources that the number of such terrorists would not be more than two dozen. "These are foot soldiers (terrorists), not senior or mid-level commanders. We are testing the ground. We are cautious. The truce will come into effect once the prisoners are released," Dawn quoted the sources as saying. "Talks are being held directly between senior officers and senior TTP leadership. The TTP includes all groups without exception. There are several proposals on the table and both sides are working to hammer out a workable solution," Dawn quoted the source as saying. However, Dawn reported citing the source that it is clear that no tribal intermediaries were being engaged in talks with the TTP leadership at the moment. The strong resurgence of Pakistani Taliban's terror activities soon after the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan is raising new concerns about Pakistan's overall stability, including the security of its nuclear arsenal, said a Canada-based think tank. According to an article in International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS), Pakistan efforts to pressurise the Taliban to ensure that the TTP is not allowed any sanctuary in Afghanistan, have failed to yield any visible results. In recent times, the Pakistani Taliban has carried out multiple attacks in Pakistan. A ceasefire between Pakistan's government and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) announced on October 1 has fallen apart in days as fears rise about the al Qaeda-linked group's true agenda, the think tank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-interior-minister-mediates-peace-talks-between-pakistan-and-ttp/articleshow/87532993.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru motorists say fuel price reduction paltry; petroleum dealers cry foul||BENGALURU: A day after the Union and state governments announced reduction in fuel prices, many motorists here say it’s not enough. In Bengaluru, petrol price reduced from Rs 113.93 /litre on Wednesday to Rs 107.64 on Thursday morning at Indian Oil petrol bunks, while diesel price fell from Rs 104.50/litre to Rs 92.03/litre. Late in the evening, the Karnataka government’s Wednesday night announcment of Rs 7 per litre reduction in state tax on fuels kicked into effect, following which petrol and diesel prices were Rs 100.58 and Rs 85.01 respectively. Motor fuels are costlier by a paise or two at bunks of other petroleum corporations. On Wednesday night, CM Basavaraj Bommai had tweeted: “Even though it will mean a loss of Rs 2,100 crore to our exchequer, it will bring down the prices for our citizens to Rs 95.90 & Rs 81.50 (approx.) for petrol and diesel respectively”. However, many fuel dealers disputed it, saying that fuel prices will cost more. The current fuel rate in Bengaluru is Rs 4.68 and Rs 3.51 more per litre for petrol and diesel than the CM’s projections. Not all motorists were glad. Tinu Cherian Abraham, a social media influencer, tweeted: “Reminds of the shopkeeper’s tactic — increase the price by 50%. Give a discount of 10%. Everyone happy (sic).” Kirankumar S, a motorist from Indiranagar, said: “This reduction is not any Deepavali gift. They were forced to reduce it due to recent bypoll results. If they’re serious about common people, they should keep petrol and diesel prices below Rs 70 per litre.” On Thursday morning, there were fewer customers at most fuel stations. “The demand was less mainly due to Deepavali and due to the rumours that the price would be reduced further. Those travelling for emergencies and going far filled their tanks in small quantities,” said an outlet owner. Fuel dealers upsetThe sudden reduction of prices has not gone well with dealers. Many had bought extra stock for the long weekend. “The stock bought earlier has to be sold at the revised price. The more the stock, higher the loss. The sudden decision has left all dealers in a lurch,” said a dealer in the city. A Tharanath, another fuel dealer, said: “Most of us suffered losses between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 35 lakh due to the unscientific reduction of prices. The Centre should increase profit margins of dealers. The margin has not been revised since 2017.” KM Basavegowda, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders, said: “The reduction in excise duty is welcome but should have been implemented in a phased manner like the way it was increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-motorists-say-fuel-price-reduction-paltry-petroleum-dealers-cry-foul/articleshow/87533038.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

World leaders have gathered in Scotland this week for COP26 negotiations billed as one of the last chances to avert catastrophic climate change, though Chinese President Xi Jinping made a written address instead of attending in person. China -- the world's largest emitter of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change -- has ramped up coal output after supply chains in recent months were roiled by an energy crunch owing to strict emissions targets and record prices for the fossil fuel. A thick haze of smog blanketed swathes of northern China on Friday, with visibility in some areas reduced to less than 200 metres (yards), according to the country's weather forecaster. Authorities in Beijing blamed the pollution on "unfavourable weather conditions and regional pollution spread" as schools in the capital -- which will host the Winter Olympics in February -- were ordered to stop physical education classes and outdoor activities. Stretches of highways to major cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Harbin were closed Friday due to poor visibility. Pollutants detected Friday morning by a monitoring station at the US embassy in Beijing reached levels defined as "very unhealthy" for the general population. Levels of small particulate matter, or PM 2.5, which penetrate deep into human lungs and cause respiratory illnesses hovered around 220 -- far above the WHO recommended limit of 15. The smog is likely to persist until at least Saturday evening, according to city officials. China said earlier this week it had increased daily coal production by more than one million tonnes to ease an energy shortage that had forced factories to close in recent months. Rapid industrialisation has made China no stranger to air pollution, although severe smog episodes have become less frequent in recent years as authorities have increasingly prioritised environmental protection. Beijing has pledged to bring emissions of planet-heating carbon dioxide to a peak by 2030 and reduce them to net zero by 2060. China hit back Wednesday at criticism by Joe Biden, saying "actions speak louder than words" after the US president accused Beijing of not showing leadership to combat climate change. China generates about 60 percent of its energy from burning coal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/beijing-shuts-roads-playgrounds-amid-heavy-smog-after-coal-spike/articleshow/87533172.cms||---
---||World||Chinese journalist jailed over Covid reports 'close to death'||BEIJING: A citizen journalist jailed for her coverage of China's initial response to Covid in Wuhan is close to death after going on hunger strike, her family said, prompting renewed calls from rights groups for her immediate release. Zhang Zhan, 38, a former lawyer, travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the chaos at the pandemic's epicentre, questioning authorities' handling of the outbreak in her smartphone videos. She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced in December to four years in jail for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" - a charge routinely used to suppress dissent. She is now severely underweight and "may not live for much longer", her brother Zhang Ju wrote last week on a Twitter account verified by people close to the matter. Zhang has been on a hunger strike and was force-fed through nasal tubes, her legal team, which did not have information on her current condition, told AFP earlier this year. "She may not survive the coming cold winter," Zhang Ju wrote, adding that he had urged his sister in letters to "take care of herself". "In her heart, it seems there is only God and her beliefs, with no care for anything else." Zhang Ju's posts sparked fresh calls for his sister's release, with Amnesty International urging the Chinese government on Thursday to "release her immediately so that she can end her hunger strike and receive the appropriate medical treatment she desperately needs". Amnesty campaigner Gwen Lee said in a statement that Zhang's detention was a "shameful attack on human rights". Someone close to the citizen journalist, who declined to be named, told AFP the family had asked to meet Zhang more than three weeks ago at the Shanghai women's prison where she is being held but had not received a response. AFP was unable to reach Zhang Ju while Zhang's mother declined to comment. The Shanghai prison also offered no response when approached by AFP. Zhang now cannot walk or even raise her head without help, according to Reporters without Borders (RSF). RSF East Asia Bureau head, Cedric Alviani, said the "international community (must) apply pressure to the Chinese regime and secure Zhang Zhan's immediate release before it is too late." "She was only performing her duty as a reporter and should never have been detained, not to mention receive a four-year prison sentence." China has revelled in its success in keeping domestic infections down to a trickle of sporadic outbreaks. The government has put forward a narrative crediting the Communist Party with returning life almost to normal even as death tolls and infections continue to explode in the rest of the world. But those who threaten the official version by raising questions about the government's early cover-up and handling of the Wuhan outbreak face the party's wrath. Zhang is among a group of four citizen journalists - including Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua - detained after reporting from Wuhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-journalist-jailed-over-covid-reports-close-to-death/articleshow/87533078.cms||---

The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a slim loss, ending its streak of record closes at four. Declines in shares of banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group weighed on the blue-chip index. Financials dropped 1.3%, most among S&P 500 sectors, as US Treasury yields fell, with the market unwinding expectations of quicker Fed rate hikes a day after the central bank signaled it was in no hurry to do so. "The growth side of the market is seeing more positive results today as they are benefiting from the falling yields that are developing,” said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “The market had been positioning for higher yields in general given the Fed announcement of tapering. As we walked in today, there has been a reversal in that.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.35 points, or 0.09%, to 36,124.23, the S&P 500 gained 19.49 points, or 0.42%, to 4,680.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 128.72 points, or 0.81%, to 15,940.31. The S&P 500 growth index rose 1.2% while the S&P 500 value index fell 0.5%. Among S&P 500 sectors, tech and consumer discretionary led the way, both rising about 1.5%. Qualcomm shares jumped 12.7% as the company forecast better-than-expected profits and revenue for its current quarter on soaring demand for chips used in phones, cars and other internet-connected devices. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index climbed 3.5%, with Nvidia soaring 12%. Better-than-expected third-quarter earnings have helped lift sentiment for equities. With about 420 companies having reported, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 41.2% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES. “The corporate earnings story remains quite bright,” said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “The market is rewarding companies that are beating and upping their outlook, and the market is punishing companies that are missing their estimates in the quarter and more importantly, perhaps, signaling a more sour outlook.” Moderna shares tumbled about 18% as the company slashed the 2021 sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine by as much as $5 billion, grappling to fill vials and distribute them to meet unprecedented world demand. Moderna shares weighed on the S&P 500 healthcare sector, which fell 0.8%. Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 20 months last week, suggesting the economy was regaining momentum. Investors will get a critical view of the economy with the monthly jobs report on Friday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 75 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 224 new highs and 38 new lows. About 11.3 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 10.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-stocks-sp-500-nasdaq-extend-record-streaks/articleshow/87533261.cms||---

As on Thursday, the border district had only five active cases, all of whom were recovering in home isolation. As a result, the Covid-19 ward at the district hospital is now empty. The numbers have fallen although there has been no reduction in the number of tests being conducted. Between 800 and 1,200 tests, a large majority of which are RT-PCR, are conducted daily. Ever since the pandemic broke last year, the district recorded a caseload of 33,002. Of these 32,477 have recovered and 502 died. The district had collected swab samples from 820 individuals on Wednesday, 549 on Tuesday, 942 on Monday and 1,138 on Sunday. Dr Srinivas, surgeon, Chamarajanagar district hospital, said that while cases have fallen, people should continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People should not forget to maintain social distance, wear masks and ensure hand hygiene since cases are still being reported in neighbouring districts of Mysuru and Mandya, besides neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu,” he said. Dr Srinivas added: “During the peak of the second wave in Kerala, the district administration had strictly screened people at the border. People must still abide by all Covid precautionary measures.” Dr Sanjiv, dean and director, Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, said healthcare workers have administered 9,79,275 doses of the vaccine so far. Of these, 6,23,626 comprise first-dose coverage and 3,55,649 people have been jabbed twice. “Since various studies have shown vaccination has played a crucial role in significantly reducing infections and the spread of the virus, people should voluntarily come forward and get the shot,” Dr Sanjiv said. “Many individuals who received the first dose are not coming forward to take the second dose, despite local ASHA and anganwadi workers and other health volunteers following up and urging them to get fully inoculated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-zero-covid-19-cases-in-chamarajanagar-in-past-four-days/articleshow/87533404.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Five-fold increase in tuberculosis cases in Ballari in past nine months||BALLARI: While Covid-19 has taken centre stage, cases of tuberculosis have swelled. At 9%, the iron-rich districts of Ballari and Vijayanagar have the highest tuberculosis (TB) fatality rate in the state, and the two districts also figure in the top-10 across the nation, figures from the TB Control Board under the Union ministry of health show. The fatality rate in the two districts is well above the country’s average of 5% and the state’s average of 6% and shows a staggering five-fold rise in the past nine months. In contrast, the Covid-19 fatality rate is just 1.7%. In the past nine months – from January to September – the two districts have had 3,407 TB notifications and 247 (7.2%) deaths. As many as 1,170 patients have recovered, while 1,966 patients are still under treatment. District health authorities are unsure of the whereabouts of the remaining 24. Authorities say people with symptoms are refusing to come forward and get treated because of the fear of being mistaken for Covid-19. The Union government had set a goal of eliminating tuberculosis by 2025, but that now seems ambitious given low detection and fear of Covid-19. Sources say, a joint supportive supervision (JSS) team comprising seven members from the Centre and state visited the districts recently to review the situation. The team has asked the district to take steps to curb the fatality rate. “Ballari taluk has had 93 TB deaths, the highest,” said an official from the district TB control office. “The death rate is five times that of Covid-19. TB patients who have comorbidities such as HIV, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease are at a higher risk of dying.” Dr LH Janardhan, district health officer, said one reason for the spike in TB cases is fear of Covid-19. People are not willing to come forward and get tested and treated. “Many come in the final stages which is pushing the death rate up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-five-fold-increase-in-tuberculosis-cases-in-ballari-in-past-nine-months/articleshow/87533436.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
---||Mysuru||This year, only 50 foreign students have enrolled in University of Mysore so far||MYSURU: Travel and other restrictions due to Covid-19 have affected admission of foreign students to University of Mysore, with just 50 students enrolling for courses so far this year. On average, the varsity admits 700 foreign students to undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses every year from over 50 countries. The century-old varsity is looking at clocking 400 foreign admissions this year. Last year, it recorded zero admissions due to Covid-19. The UoM received 2,100 online applications from candidates abroad and it issued 800 provisional admission certificates — including 400 for UG and 300 for PG. “Only 50 turned up for admissions and we are hoping at least 350 students will arrive, thanks to partial resumption of international flights,” an official said. UoM rules mandate physical presence of candidates at the time of admission and the varsity says these regular courses can’t be offered in online mode. The academic year for UG courses starts in June-July and it is August-September for PG courses. Admissions have been delayed due to Covid curbs and varsity officials will meet to discuss plans to cover the first semester backlog after the enrollment process is complete. The last day for UG admissions is November 20. The PG admission process is likely to end in January. “Cancellation of flights to India from many countries is the reason for a dip in admissions. Currently, over 350 foreign students are studying in colleges affiliated to the varsity. Candidates from over 50 nations opt to study in India; Karnataka has more foreign students in the country,” said GR Janardhana, director of international centre, UoM. “Foreign students prefer computer science, economics, English and management courses in our varsity,” vicechancellor G Hemantha Kumar added. Most students applying for seats were from Afghanistan and China. “After the outbreak, all the Chinese students returned home, and 79 Afghan students stayed back due to political turmoil back home. The Centre has extended their visas and plans to provide scholarships to help them continue studies,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/this-year-only-50-foreign-students-have-enrolled-in-university-of-mysore-so-far/articleshow/87533497.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Delhi||Delhi: 152 fire calls received on Diwali, no serious incident reported||NEW DELHI: A total 152 calls for reporting fire were received by Fire Service Department in the national capital on the occasion of Diwali, yesterday, which is 25 per cent less compared to last year, said Atul Garg, Director of Delhi Fire Services on Friday. "About 36 more fire calls were received post-midnight and all of them were in the category of 'normal' fire," the Garg said. "We have received 152 calls on Diwali this time which is 25 per cent less than last year. A total of four calls are suspected to be connected with firecrackers. No serious fire incident occurred on Diwali. No major fire calls have been received," he noted. "People burst fewer firecrackers this year," he added. Despite the ban, people in several areas of the national capital were seen burning firecrackers, thereby contributing to the already poor air quality in the national capital. Notably, the Delhi government had banned the bursting and sale of all firecrackers, including green crackers. Following the celebrations of the festival, the air quality in various parts of the National Capital Region deteriorated as it entered the 'severe' category on Friday morning. As per the Ministry Earth Sciences' SAFAR-India application, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Noida slipped to the 'severe' category. The concentration of Pollution Meter (PM) 10 stood at 448. In Delhi overall, the AQI stood at 386 with a PM concentration of 2.5. Meanwhile, the concentration of PM 10 stood at 430 in Mathura Road today morning. As a thick layer of smog shrouds Delhi, several people here complained of itchy throat and watery eyes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-152-fire-calls-received-on-diwali-no-serious-incident-reported/articleshow/87533610.cms||---
---||World||What's in, and what's out, as House nears vote on Biden bill||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's now- $1.85 trillion plan to boost social and education programs as well as protect against global warming continues to be fine-tuned by Democrats in Congress with a new goal of completing work before Thanksgiving. The updated plan includes universal preschool, funding to limit child care costs and a one-year continuation of a child tax credit that was expanded earlier this year and applied to more families. But Democrats are scaling back some investments and shortening the timeframe for funding to whittle down spending. Some proposals have been dropped entirely. The House is working to pass the legislation soon, but it will still have to clear the Senate, where revisions are likely. The framework fits an approximately $1.85 trillion budget over 10 years, rather than the $3.5 trillion budget plan originally envisioned. Here's what's in the package, based on summaries provided by the White House and the House. TAX BREAKS* An expanded child tax credit would continue for another year. As part of a Covid relief bill, Democrats increased the tax credit to $3,000 per child ages 6-17 and $3,600 per child 5 and under. Households earning up to $150,000 per year get the credit paid to them on a monthly basis. Budget hawks worry that a one-year extension is a budgetary tool that will lower the cost of the program on paper, but mask its true costs since lawmakers tend to continue programs rather than let them expire. * The expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that goes to 17 million childless, low-wage workers would continue for one year. EDUCATION* Universal prekindergarten would be established for all 3- and 4-year-olds and child-care subsidies would be provided for poorer and middle-income Americans. But the programs are funded only for six years. * $40 billion would be provided for higher education and workforce development. This includes raising the size of Pell Grants and providing funding for historically Black colleges and universities as well as institutions that largely serve Hispanic students or tribal communities. HEALTH CARE* Medicare would be expanded to cover hearing aids, costing an estimated $35 billion over 10 years. * Expanded tax credits for insurance premiums tied to the Affordable Care Act would be extended through 2025. The White House says that would help 3 million uninsured people gain coverage. * $150 billion for a Medicaid program that supports home health care, helping to clear a backlog and improving working conditions. * $90 billion for investments that would include funding maternal health, community violence initiatives, disadvantaged farmers, nutrition and pandemic preparation. * Out-of-pocket Medicare Part D costs for older Americans would be capped at $2,000 and the price of insulin reduced to no more than $35 a dose. * A Medicare drug negotiation program would be established. Each year, the secretary of Health and Human Services would identify 100 brand-name drugs that lack price competition and from that list negotiate the price of up to 10 drugs in 2025, 15 in 2026 and 2027, and 20 thereafter. Insulin products must also be negotiated. A drug selected for negotiation would continue to be included in the program until competition enters the market. CHILD CAREBiden's plan says parents earning up to 250% of a state's median income should pay no more than 7% of their income on child care. Parents must be working, seeking a job, in school or dealing with a health issue to qualify. HOUSING$150 billion would be committed toward housing affordability with a goal of building more than 1 million new rental and single-family homes. The goal would be to reduce price pressures by providing rental and down payment assistance. ENVIRONMENT* Clean energy tax credits would receive $320 billion worth of funding. These credits over 10 years would help businesses and homeowners shift to renewable energy sources for electricity, vehicles and manufacturing. * $105 billion would be directed toward investments that would improve communities' ability to withstand extreme weather caused by climate change. The funding would also create a Civilian Climate Corps that focuses on conserving public lands and bolstering community resilience to flooding, drought and other weather emergencies. * $110 billion would help develop new domestic supply chains and develop new solar and battery technologies. Support would also be given to existing steel, cement and aluminum industries. * $20 billion would be allotted for the government to become the buyer of clean energy technologies as part of its procurement process. * $9 billion would be allocated for lead remediation projects, such as the replacement of water lines or the replacement of school drinking water fountains that may contain lead. TAXES* Biden's plan bolsters the IRS to improve collections and close the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid. * A 15% minimum income tax would be applied to large corporations, along with a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks. The U.S. would also be aligned with an agreement reached by more than 100 countries designed to deter multinational companies from stashing profits in low-tax countries. * The bill would create a new surtax on multimillionaires and billionaires and close a provision that allows some wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying the 3.8% Medicare tax on their earnings. * A $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions would be raised to $72,500. Tax analysts say the change would largely benefit high-income households. IMMIGRATIONThose who entered the United States prior to Jan. 2, 2011, and have continuously resided there since would be eligible for renewable parole grants for five years after paying an administrative fee and completing security and background checks. The parole status gives recipients authorization to travel and work in the U.S. and deems them eligible for a Real ID-compliant driver's license or a state identification card. PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVEEligible workers would receive up to four weeks of paid leave to reimburse them for time taken to care for a new child or other family members or to recover from illness. Biden had initially proposed 12 weeks of paid family leave. WHAT'S OUT OF THE BILL* A proposal to expand Medicare to cover dental and vision care is out because of concerns about the cost. * A proposal to allow for up to two years of free community college is out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/whats-in-and-whats-out-as-house-nears-vote-on-biden-bill/articleshow/87533547.cms||---

The protestors demanded the arrest of the accused in the case, local media reported. The body of the victim was recovered from the farmhouse of PPP MPA Jam Awais in Malir's Jam Goth at around 2:30 pm on Wednesday, reported Dawn citing Memon Goth Station House Officer (SHO) Khalid Abbasi. The PPP MPA Jam Awais and MNA Jam Abdul Karim were being accused by the victim's brother of involvement in the alleged murder. "Our protest will continue till the cruel waderas (landlords) are arrested," Dawn quoted the victim's brother as saying. The allegations were based on a video that the relatives claim had been recorded by the victim himself where he said that he had been tortured and threatened over a clip where he had shot the guests of some influential persons hunting in his village, reported Dawn. The relatives along with the members of the Jokhio community staged a sit-in with the body of the victim on the main National Highway near Ghaghar Phatak on Thursday, after which the burial of the body was done and the sit-in resumed that lasted into the evening, reported Dawn. The demonstration was joined by the leaders of various political parties and activists that included PML-N leader Qadir Kalmati, PTI leader Dr Masroor Siyal, PML-F lawmaker Nusrat Abbasi, Sindh United Party leader Zain Shah and former MNA Hakeem Baloch, according to the newspaper. Other party leaders and Sindh Social Welfare Minister Sajid Jokhio paid a visit to the victim's family and assured them of justice. The minister, however, belonging to PPP denied being the visit politically motivated, reported the newspaper. "We are not here to do politics, but to express regret over the loss of human life and to assure the heirs of the arrest of the suspects," Dawn quoted the minister as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/protests-continue-after-corpse-found-at-pak-lawmakers-farmhouse-in-karachi/articleshow/87533789.cms||---

The San Francisco-based ride-hailing company said its third-quarter loss widened to $2.42 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $1.1 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year earlier quarter. The latest quarter included stock-based compensation costs as well as a hefty unrealized loss related to its investment in Didi. The Chinese ride-sharing company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in late June and days later faced a cybersecurity review from China's internet watchdog. Uber put the pretax impact of Didi's decline at $3.2 billion, partially offset by unrealized gains in Zomato and other investments. Revenue in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 grew 72% year over year to $4.85 billion as gross bookings rose 57% to $23.1 billion. The company noted that mobility gross bookings over Halloween weekend - after the quarter ended - surpassed 2019 levels. On average, analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast a loss of 33 cents per share on revenue of $4.42 billion. Uber said its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA -totaled $8 million during the quarter, turning positive for the first time in the company's history. Its restaurant delivery segment also is close to breakeven. For the fourth quarter, Uber Technologies Inc. expects gross bookings of $25 billion to $26 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $25 million to $75 million. Shares in Uber Technologies Inc. rose about 1% in after-hours trading. The stock is down roughly 11% in the year to date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/quarterly-results/uber-q3-loss-widens-on-investment-losses-revenue-up-72/articleshow/87534155.cms||---
---||Business||US trade deficit hits record of $80.9 billion in September||WASHINGTON: The US trade deficit hit an all-time high of $80.9 billion in September as American exports fell sharply while imports, even with supply chain problems at American ports, continue to climb. The September deficit topped the previous record of $73.2 billion set in June, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. The deficit is the gap between what the United States exports to the rest of the world and the imports it purchases from foreign nations. In September, exports plunged 3% to $207.6 billion while imports rose 0.6% to $288.5 billion. Part of the weakness reflected a 15.5% drop in petroleum exports related to the drilling rig and refinery shutdowns during Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico. Economists expect that decline to reverse in coming months with petroleum production coming back on line. The politically sensitive goods deficit with China shot up 15% in September to $36.5 billion. Through the first nine months of this year America's deficit with China, the largest with any country, totaled $255.4 billion, an increase of 14.9% over the same period in 2020. The overall trade deficit through September hit $638.6 billion, a 33.1% increase over the same period last year. That big jump reflects the surge in US demand for imports compares to last year when many parts of the economy were shut down because of the coronavirus. In September, the deficit in goods rose to $98.2 billion, up a sharp 10% from the August deficit. The surplus in services, which covers such things as airline travel and financial services, rose 10.5% to $17.2 billion, still well below the levels seen before the pandemic hit. The surplus in services is expected to rise further as Covid-19 cases retreat and travel restrictions are eased. The rising trade deficit subtracted 1.1 percentage points from growth in the July-September quarter, a period when the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, slowed to an annual growth rate of just 2%, sharply lower than a GDP growth rate of 6.7% in the April-June period. As Covid-19 cases retreat and the supply chain becomes untangled, the US trade deficit should start to improve in coming months although the improvement may be modest, economists say. "We look for the trade balance to remain historically elevated through year-end, but moderation in domestic demand will cool import volumes while steady vaccine diffusion and slower virus spread should underpin stronger export growth," Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-trade-deficit-hits-record-of-80-9-billion-in-september/articleshow/87534119.cms||---
---||India||PM Modi offers prayers in Kedarnath, inaugurates various development projects||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday offered prayers at Kedarnath temple in Uttarakhand. After arriving in Kedarnath, the Prime Minister watched a brief documentary detailing the reconstruction work carried out at the Himalayan temple after the devastating deluge of 2013 and then entered the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) were also in Kedarnath along with the PM. 'Regularly reviewed redevelopment works at Kedarnath from Delhi'Speaking at Kedarnath, the Prime Minister lauded the redevelopment efforts and said that he regularly reviewed the projects from Delhi. "After 2013 destruction, people used to think if Kedarnath could be redeveloped. My inner voice always said that Kedarnath will stand with more pride than ever before," PM Modi said. "Despite extreme weather conditions in Kedarnath, these development projects have come to fruition due to the labourers working tirelessly to help me achieve this mission of restoring strength to this region," he added. PM Modi affirmed that the new development projects will enhance the journey of devotees with improved amenities and safety measures to ensure that we are prepared for future calamities. "This combination of modernity with the eternal on this primitive land is the result of the natural grace of Lord Shankar," he said. PM Modi unveils statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya in KedarnathThe Prime Minister unveiled a 12-foot statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya at the seer's rebuilt samadhi in Kedarnath. Work on the Shankaracharya statue, weighing around 35 tonnes, had begun in 2019. Its unveiling was streamed live at 12 jyotirlingas, four mutts or monasteries established by the eighth century seer, his birth place and a number of prominent temples across the country. "When India was grappling with 'Rag-Dwesh', Adi Guru Shankaracharya was envisioning a society free of sins of Hinduism through 'Advaita-Sindhanta'," PM Modi said. "Adi Guru Shankaracharya established temples & Jyotirlingas by working all his life for the development of our 'Parma-Dharma' that reflects in 'Bhartiya & Bhartiyata'," he added. The prime minister sat in meditation at the foot of the statue for a while before taking a walk around Kedarpuri to review the reconstruction work carried out over the last few years. Laid foundation stone of reconstruction projects worth over Rs 400 crore.PM Modi also laid the foundation stone of five Kedarpuri reconstruction projects worth over Rs 400 crore on the river Mandakini. These projects include Saraswati Retaining Wall Aasthapath and Ghats, Mandakini Retaining Wall Aasthapath, Tirth Purohit Houses and Garud Chatti bridge on river Mandakini. "It is an auspicious day to lay the foundation of not only new projects but opening a gateway of development for this 'Dev Bhoomi' to maximise the safety measures for devotees," PM said. PM Modi further said that he was able to successfully install these development projects in Kedarnath due to his experience of handling earthquakes in Kutch in 2001. "I have watched the pain and disaster of the 2013 floods and I feel fortunate enough that we successfully established these development projects in Kedarnath," he said. The Prime Minister's visit to the shrine comes ahead of the 2022 assembly polls in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-offers-prayers-in-kedarnath-inaugurates-various-development-projects/articleshow/87534068.cms||---
---||World||5 major heatwaves in 30 years has turned the Great Barrier Reef into a bleached checkerboard||TOWNSVILLE/WASHINGTON: Just 2% of the Great Barrier Reef remains untouched by bleaching since 1998 and 80% of individual reefs have bleached severely once, twice or three times since 2016, our new study reveals today. We measured the impacts of five marine heatwaves on the Great Barrier Reef over the past three decades: in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. We found these bouts of extreme temperatures have transformed it into a checkerboard of bleached reefs with very different recent histories. Whether we still have a functioning Great Barrier Reef in the decades to come depends on how much higher we allow global temperatures to rise. The bleaching events we've already seen in recent years are a result of the world warming by 1.2 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. World leaders meeting at the climate summit in Glasgow must commit to more ambitious promises to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. It's vital for the future of corals reefs, and for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on them for their livelihoods and food security. Coral in a hotter climateThe Great Barrier Reef is comprised of more than 3,000 individual reefs stretching for 2,300 kilometres, and supports more than 60,000 jobs in reef tourism. Under climate change, the frequency, intensity and scale of climate extremes is changing rapidly, including the record-breaking marine heatwaves that cause corals to bleach. Bleaching is a stress response by overheated corals, where they lose their colour and many struggle to survive. If all new COP26 pledges by individual countries are actually met, then the projected increase in average global warming could be brought down to 1.9 degree Celsius. In theory, this would put us in line with the goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to keep global warming below 2 degree Celsius, but preferably 1.5 degree Celsius, this century. However, it is still not enough to prevent the ongoing degradation of the world's coral reefs. The damage to coral reefs from anthropogenic heating so far is very clear, and further warming will continue to ratchet down reefs throughout the tropics. Ecological memories of heatwavesMost reefs today are in early recovery mode, as coral populations begin to re-build since they last experienced bleaching in 2016, 2017 and 2020. It takes about a decade for a decent recovery of the fastest growing corals, and much longer for slow-growing species. Many coastal reefs that were severely bleached in 1998 have never fully recovered. Each bleaching event so far has a different geographic footprint. Drawing upon satellite data, we measured the duration and intensity of heat stress that the Great Barrier Reef experienced each summer, to explain why different parts were affected during all five events. The bleaching responses of corals differed greatly in each event, and was strongly influenced by the recent history of previous bleaching. For this reason, it's important to measure the extent and severity of bleaching directly, where it actually occurs, and not rely exclusively on water temperature data from satellites as an indirect proxy. We found the most vulnerable reefs each year were the ones that had not bleached for a decade or longer. On the other hand, when successive episodes were close together in time (one to four years apart), the heat threshold for severe bleaching increased. In other words, the earlier event had hardened regions of the Great Barrier Reef to subsequent impacts. For example, in 2002 and 2017, it took much more heat to trigger similar levels of bleaching that were measured in 1998 and 2016. The threshold for bleaching was much higher on reefs that had experienced an earlier episode of heat stress. Similarly, southern corals, which escaped bleaching in 2016 and 2017, were the most vulnerable in 2020, compared to central and northern reefs that had bleached severely in previous events. Many different mechanisms could generate these historical effects, or ecological memories. One is heavy losses of the more heat-susceptible coral species during an earlier event – dead corals don't re-bleach. Nowhere left to hideOnly a single cluster of reefs remains unbleached in the far south, downstream from the rest of the Great Barrier Reef, in a small region that has remained consistently cool through the summer months during all five mass bleaching events. These reefs lie at the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef, where upwelling of cool water may offer some protection from heatwaves, at least so far. In theory, a judiciously placed network of well-protected, climate-resistant reefs might help to repopulate the broader seascape, if greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed to stabilise temperatures later this century. But the unbleached southern reefs are too few in number, and too far away from the rest of the Great Barrier Reef to produce and deliver sufficient coral larvae, to promote a long-distance recovery. Instead, future replenishment of depleted coral populations is more likely to be local. It would come from the billions of larvae produced by recovering adults on nearby reefs that have not bleached for a while, or by corals inhabiting reef in deeper waters which tend to experience less heat stress than those living in shallow water. Future recovery of corals will increasingly be temporary and incomplete, before being interrupted again by the inevitable next bleaching event. Consequently, the patchiness of living coral on the Great Barrier Reef will increase further, and corals will continue to decline under climate change. Our findings make it clear we no longer have the luxury of studying individual climate-related events that were once unprecedented, or very rare. Instead, as the world gets hotter, it's increasingly important to understand the effects and combined outcomes of sequences of rapid-fire catastrophes.

---||Business||40 countries pledge to quit coal, but why are big polluters like India still missing?||Over 40 countries have pledged to quit coal at COP26 but some of the world’s biggest coal-dependent countries, including India, China, US and Australia did not sign on. The new pact includes 23 countries that have promised for the first time to stop building and issuing permits for new coal plants at home and to eventually shift away from using fuel. Among them are five of the world’s top 20 power-generating countries: Poland, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam and Ukraine. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 there has been a 76 per cent reduction in the number of new coal power plants that are being planned. That amounts to the cancellation of more than 1,000GW of new coal plants. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change and weaning the world off coal is vital to achieving global climate targets. But several big polluters are still missing from the major pledge to phase out coal. China and India together burn roughly two-thirds of the world’s coal while the United States generates about one-fifth of its electricity from coal. Australia is the world’s eleventh-biggest coal user and a major exporter. So, what is exactly this coal pledge?The world's largest alliance on phasing out coal gained 28 new members. Chile and Singapore were two nations to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance which is co-chaired by the UK and Canada. And 20 new countries, including Vietnam, Poland and Morocco committed to building no new power plants. Signatories to this agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. They have also promised to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations. Several major banks have also agreed to stop financing the coal industry. Also, more than 20 countries and financial institutions have decided to stop financing fossil fuel development abroad from next year, diverting an estimated $8 billion a year to clean energy. "Securing a 190-strong coalition to phase out coal power and end support for new coal power plants and the Just Transition Declaration signed today show a real intentional commitment to not leave any nation behind," said Alok Sharma, COP26 president. Why are big emitters still missing?Now, China and India are home to almost half the over 2,600 coal-fired plants operating or under construction around the world. Other major users and producers of coal, such as Australia and Japan, have also not joined the group.  China was responsible for about 54.3% of global coal consumption in 2020, India used 11.6%, according to BP’s 2021 world energy statistical review. The United States consumed 6.1%. China alone added 38.4 gigawatts of coal capacity in 2020. This implies that China burns nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined, while Australia is one of the biggest exporters of the fossil fuel. India relies on coal for 70% of its electricity, followed by hydro/marine power at 11%, solar and wind power at 6% each, nuclear power at 5% and bio-energy at 2% While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed that half of India's energy needs will be met from renewables by 2030, India isn't ready to swear off coal altogether as the country has large domestic reserves of coal, which the government wants to exploit in order to avoid having to spend foreign currency on imports. Fresh coal mining has figured prominently in the government’s pandemic-recovery economic package. The domestic coal industry also employs, directly and indirectly, many hundreds of thousands of people, while majority of the country's poorest rely on coal for basic things like heating and cooking. The coal belt in India -Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh- is dotted by industries that need the fuel, like steel and brick making. Even Indian Railways earns half its revenue by transporting coal. "Coal will continue to feed the growing energy need of India in next five decades and only going to peak in the 2040s- hence we need to continue investment in coal mines and infrastructure going forward, else we will face fuel side challenges like in October," said Debasis Mishra, partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. According to the International Energy Agency, India's energy needs will grow faster than any other country in the world in the next twenty years, which is why perhaps coal-fired plants worth $60bn are under construction while India attempts to increase private participation in the coal sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/40-countries-pledge-to-quit-coal-but-why-are-big-polluters-like-india-still-missing/articleshow/87534302.cms||---

---||World||Covid cases break records across Europe as winter takes hold||BUDAPEST: Coronavirus infections are hitting record levels in many countries across Europe as winter takes hold, prompting a call for action from the World Health Organization which described the new wave as a "grave concern". Soaring numbers of cases, especially in Eastern Europe, have prompted debate on whether to reintroduce curbs on movement before the Christmas holiday season and on how to persuade more people to get vaccinated. That conversation comes as some countries in Asia, with the notable exception of China, reopen their tourism sectors to the rest of the world. "The current pace of transmission across the 53 countries of the European Region is of grave concern," regional WHO head Hans Kluge said, adding that the spread was exacerbated by the more transmissible Delta variant. The virus spreads faster in the winter months when people gather indoors. Kluge warned earlier that if Europe followed its current trajectory, there could be 500,000 COVID-related deaths in the region by February. "We must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of Covid-19, to preventing them from happening in the first place," he said. The region saw a 6% increase in new cases last week, with nearly 1.8 million new cases, compared to the week before. The number of deaths rose 12% in the same period. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, reported 33,949 new infections, the highest daily increase since the start of the pandemic last year. Cases in Russia and Ukraine are soaring. Austria's daily new coronavirus infections surged towards a record set a year ago, making a lockdown for the unvaccinated ever more likely. Covid-19 prevalence in England rose to its highest level on record in October, Imperial College London said, led by a high numbers of cases in children and a surge in the southwest. Slovakia reported 6,713 new cases, also a record, while daily new cases in Hungary more than doubled from last week to 6,268. Poland, Eastern Europe's biggest economy, reported 15,515 daily cases on Thursday, the highest figure since April. Croatia and Slovenia on Thursday both reported record daily infections. China on alert ahead of olympicsChina is also on high alert at ports of entry to reduce the risk of Covid-19 cases entering from abroad, and has stepped up restrictions amid a growing outbreak less than 100 days before the Beijing Winter Olympics. Authorities have also tightened curbs in the capital ahead of a major gathering of the top members of the Communist Party next week. Since mid-October, over 700 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms have been reported in China. While the number is tiny compared with other countries, it has led to a growing wave of restrictions under Beijing's zero-tolerance policy. In Central Europe, Hungary has trimmed its 2021 GDP growth projection to 6.8% from 7.0-7.5% due to a rise in inflation, energy prices, and the risks stemming from Covid-19, the finance minister said, flagging the possibility of some new restrictions in a country where there are currently hardly any curbs in place. Slovakia's Finance Ministry cut its forecasts for 2021 and 2022 growth in September, saying a new wave of Covid-19 cases will hit consumer demand and the labour market at the end of the year although the impact will not be as strong as earlier in the pandemic. Poland's central bank left its projections unchanged. Fresh curbsThe Hungarian government has urged people to take up vaccines and last week announced mandatory vaccinations at state institutions, also empowering private companies to make jabs mandatory for employees if they believe that is necessary. Romania - where hospitals cannot cope with a surge in Covid-19 patients - the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland have all tightened rules on mask wearing and introduced measures to curb infections. The Czech Republic has introduced a requirement for restaurant customers to show proof of vaccination or a test. It also has tough mask regulations and some children are again being tested in schools in areas where cases are higher. In Poland, mask wearing is mandatory in enclosed public spaces while cinemas, theatres and hotels have a 75% capacity limit. The Hungarian government has not replied to Reuters questions on potential measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/covid-cases-break-records-across-europe-as-winter-takes-hold/articleshow/87534676.cms||---

The Prime Minister today offered prayers at Kedarnath Temple. He also inaugurated various re-development projects worth Rs 130 crore including Saraswati Retaining Wall Aasthapath and Ghats, Mandakini Retaining Wall Aasthapath, Tirth Purohit Houses and Garud Chatti bridge on river Mandakini. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said, "It is an auspicious day to lay the foundation of not only new projects but opening a gateway of development for this 'Dev Bhoomi' to maximise the safety measures for devotees." The Prime Minister also unveiled the 12-feet statue of Adi Shankaracharya at the premises of the Kedarnath Temple in Rudraprayag district. This is Prime Ministers' second visit to the temple during his term; the last time he visited the Kedarnath temple was in 2019. Located on the bank of the Mandakini river, Kedarnath Temple is the of the four ancient pilgrimage sites referred to as 'Char Dham' which also include Yamunotri, Gangotri and Badrinath.

---||India||'I'm a woman, I can fight': Priyanka Gandhi Vadra aims to revive Congress||GORAKHPUR: At a recent election rally, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, strode on stage and asked the crowd to repeat after her: "I'm a woman, I can fight." The slogan is at the heart of the party's bid to revive its fortunes in Uttar Pradesh by winning over women voters who have long been marginalised but are starting to find a voice. The Uttar Pradesh result will offer a clue as to whether the Congress can mount a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the next general election in 2024. A spate of violence against women has alarmed voters across India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which according to government data faces the highest number of gender crimes in the country, and Priyanka Gandhi promised women change. "I want to tell the women that I will fight for them, the Congress party will fight for them," Priyanka said on Sunday to cheers in the Gorakhpur stronghold of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. In Uttar Pradesh, the well-organised BJP has been criticised for its handling of violence against women as well as the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also facing protests by farmers. An unusually high proportion of women attended the Gorakhpur rally - about a quarter of the estimated 40,000 people - suggesting the Congress message may be getting through. "People, especially women, have started looking at Congress with hope, that the party will stand with women and become their voice," said Sunita Mishra, 40, a party worker at the rally. Voters had welcomed a Congress pledge to field women in 40% of the state's 403 assembly constituencies, said Mishra, helping her sign up 50 women as party cadre in the past few days. The party has also promised electric scooters and smartphones to female students, free rides on government buses to all women, three free cooking-gas cylinders per family a year, and gender-based job reservations. 'Listening to sycophants'But the Congress in Uttar Pradesh is suffering from a series of internal problems - mirroring its woes at the national level - with disenchantment in the rank-and-file and resignations of senior members as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tries to stamp her authority, current and former party officials said in interviews. "The state leadership is listening only to sycophants and the number of such people has increased in the party in the last two years," said Rana Rahul Singh, a former Congress assembly candidate from Gorakhpur who recently quit the party. 'Grassroots workers in Congress are being neglected.'Priyanka's team did not respond to an interview request from Reuters but party spokeswoman Supriya Shrinate said reorganisation was underway. "Changes are uneasy but changes are good," Shrinate said. "In the longer run, these changes are going to work." A recent survey by polling agency CVoter projected that the BJP would easily win the state election with more than 240 of its 403 seats, with Congress likely finishing a distant fourth with just three to seven seats. In the last state election in 2017, which Congress fought in a coalition, it won only seven of 114 seats it contested, while the BJP won 312. The proportion of women voters across India has steadily increased and some states now have more women casting votes than men, said Praveen Rai of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies think-tank in New Delhi. "Whether it converts into more seats or not is a little difficult to predict," Rai said about Congress's focus on women. "But I think this is the right strategy for the party to make a comeback and create some political space for itself." At the Gorakhpur rally, district Congress president Nirmala Paswan said she had hope in Gandhi Vadra. "A lot of women are approaching us to join the party," she said. "Change is coming and women are going to bring it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/im-a-woman-i-can-fight-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-aims-to-revive-congress/articleshow/87535213.cms||---
---||Business||Fuel price cut: How much will it cost the government exchequer?||The Centre's Diwali gift for the aam aadmi in the form of lower excise tax on fuel will cost the exchequer Rs 45,000 crore for the remaining of this fiscal as lost revenue, or 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to a note by brokerage Nomura. The tax cuts—Rs 5 per litre for petrol, and Rs10 per litre for diesel— aimed at helping farmers, manufacturers, and transporters, who have been unnerved by the steep price rises, could cost the government Rs one lakh crore (0.45 per cent of GDP) on an annual basis in terms of lost revenues. “The tax cuts could cost the government Rs 1 trillion (0.45 per cent of GDP) on an annual basis in terms of lost revenues and around Rs 45,000 crore (0.2 per cent of GDP) for the remaining months in FY22,” the note said. In the first half of FY22 (H1-FY22), petrol consumption risen 21.4 per cent on year nd diesel consumption by 15.4 per cent, reflecting the sharp increase in economic activity, said Nomura. What about inflation?A cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel will also lower fuel inflation to an extent since petrol has a 2.2 per cent weighting in the CPI basket, while diesel has a weighting of 0.15 per cent. "Assuming global crude oil prices do not increase further increase in November, a Rs 5/litre drop in petrol prices and a Rs 10/litre cut in diesel price should translate to around 0.14 percentage point (pp) reduction in headline inflation in November due to direct effects, and around 0.3pp, including the second round impacts, as logistics costs decline. Consequently, we reduce our Q4-2021 CPI inflation projection marginally from 5 per cent to 4.9 per cent, although the 2021 projection remains unchanged at 5.1 per cent,” said Nomura. It pointed out that the reduced fuel prices should be positive for consumption. The timing of the cut – on the eve of Diwali – seems designed to maximise the growth boost from festive consumption. It has retained its GDP growth projection of 9.2 per cent for the current fiscal because of downside risks from supply-side bottlenecks on account of chip and energy shortages. Nomura said that the Centre’s move partly reverses the hike in duties in 2020 by Rs 13 per litre for petrol and Rs 16 per litre on diesel, following a steep drop in oil prices, and comes on the heels of higher crude prices pushing retail prices to record highs. States follow suitSeveral states have announced additional reductions in fuel prices. The union government also urged states to commensurately reduce VAT on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers. Petrol price on Thursday was cut in the range of Rs 5.7 to Rs 6.35 per litre across the country and diesel rates by Rs 11.16 to Rs 12.88 as oil companies passed on a record reduction in excise duty rates to consumers. The reduction was larger in states like Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Karnataka, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Odisha and Arunachal Pradesh since they charge a higher VAT. Since, January 1, 2021 petrol and diesel prices have risen by more than Rs 26 a litre before the duty cuts. The excise duty cut by the Centre is first such exercise since the onset of Covid pandemic. In fact the excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020 and was as high at Rs 31.8 on diesel and Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol before the Centre finally decided to take a call on the tax cuts. Excise duty cut a by-product of by-pollsOpposition parties argued the drop in taxes is an attempt to regain lost ground after the Modi government’s poor show at the polls. While Congress’ general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the reduction was made “out of fear, not from the heart, Congress MP P Chidambaram, took a jibe at the centre stating that the decision was a taken after BJP's poor performance at the by-elections held recently for three Lok Sabha and 30 Assembly seats. "The results of the 30 Assembly and 3 LS by-elections have produced a by-product... The centre has cut excise duties on petrol and diesel!" Chidambaram tweeted. But prices will rise again soon:According to energy expert Narendra Taneja, fuel prices will rise in the coming months because India imports 86% of its oil requirements, and globally the price of crude could soon cross $100/barrel. Today, we have to import 86 per cent of our total oil use. The prices of oils are not in the hands of any government. Both petrol and diesel are de control commodities. In July 2010, Manmohan Singh's government implemented the deregulation on petrol. In 2014, the Modi government decontrol diesel...Whenever there is an imbalance in demand and supply, prices are bound to increase. The second reason is the lack of investment in the oil sector as governments are promoting renewable/green energy sectors like solar power. Crude oil will be more expensive in the coming months. In 2023, the price of crude oil can rise by Rs 100," he stated. He added that when oil prices are low, the government increases the excise duty, and when oil is too expensive, the government reduces the excise duty. "The consumption and sale of oil had come down to 40 per cent during the time of COVID. Later, it had come down to 35 per cent. When the sales have reduced, the income of the government will automatically decrease. But now that sale is back like the pre-COVID era."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fuel-price-cut-how-much-will-it-cost-the-government-exchequer/articleshow/87535253.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

While Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura reduced VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 7 each, Arunachal Pradesh cut VAT on petrol by Rs 5.20 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 5.22 per litre. Assam was the first to announce the VAT cut, which came soon after the Centre's announcement. Of these states, Manipur goes to polls early next year.

---||Business||Asian markets struggle to track Wall Street rally, eyes on US jobs||HONG KONG: Asian markets were mixed on Friday following the previous day's gains, with eyes on the release of key US jobs data later in the day, while investors are also assessing the outlook for central bank monetary policy in the face of surging inflation. Equities around the world enjoyed a healthy run-up Thursday after the Federal Reserve finally announced its plan for tapering the vast bond-buying programme that has provided crucial support since it was put in place at the start of the pandemic. The news removed a lot of uncertainty about officials' response to a spike in inflation that is expected to last a lot longer than previously thought, and follows moves in other countries to step back from their ultra-easy measures as the world economy recovers. However, the Bank of England's decision on Thursday not to lift rates shocked traders, who had taken recent indications from boss Andrew Bailey that it would do so. While its board signalled a rise was still on the cards in the coming months, it raised questions about how quickly the financial leaders would tighten policy, with forecasts for the Fed's own hiking timeline put back. Bond yields, which indicate future pricing for interest rates, sank after the announcement and raised concerns about further uncertainty, particularly as inflation remains doggedly high owing to supply chain snarls, high commodity prices and wage growth. That has fuelled talk of a period of stagflation when prices surge but economic growth stalls. "Rates are a global market," Subadra Rajappa, at Societe Generale, said. "Global central banks seem to be pushing back on market expectations for aggressive policy action." The BoE decision also hammered the pound, which sank against the dollar, and it struggled to recover on Friday sitting below $1.35, having been at $1.37 beforehand. Still, Wall Street enjoyed another record, with tech firms the main beneficiaries as they are more susceptible to higher borrowing costs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both chalked up new highs for a fifth straight day, though the Dow dipped. Markets in Paris and Frankfurt were also at new peaks. However, Asian investors struggled to pick up the baton. Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Jakarta and Seoul all fell, though there were gains in Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei. Manila jumped 1.9 per cent as virus measures were eased in the Philippine capital. Oil climbed after Opec and other major producers stuck to their plan to modestly lift output despite surging demand and concerns about supplies. The move also ignored a call from US President Joe Biden and other big energy consuming nations to open the taps further. Friday's gains came after a recent heavy retreat in prices following news that Iran nuclear talks were progressing and could lead to the removal of sanctions barring the sale of Tehran's crude on world markets. Still, OANDA's Edward Moya expects the commodity to remain buoyed. "The selloff in WTI crude won't last long as the oil market is still in deficit and whatever response the US has will likely be temporary relief and nothing that brings US production back to the levels seen under the Trump administration," he wrote in a note. "The mid-$70s should prove to be a very attractive entry for energy traders."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/asian-markets-struggle-to-track-wall-street-rally-eyes-on-us-jobs/articleshow/87535673.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Dholpur displaced 'encroachers', says Assam government to high court||GUWAHATI: The Assam government has submitted before Gauhati high court that families evicted from Dholpur area in Darrang district in September last year are not erosion-affected migrants as claimed in a PIL but "encroachers," who are not eligible for rehabilitation under the state rehabilitation policy of 2020. "The claim that the occupants of Dholpur Char and their ancestor were forced to migrate from their respective original place of residence due to devastating floods and land erosion does not exist in the revenue files," circle officer of Sipajhar revenue circle, Kamaljeet Sarma, submitted in his affidavit in response to a PIL filed by opposition leader Debabrata Saikia. "The evicted occupants of Dholpur area have migrated to these areas from different parts of the state and since the land in this area is fertile, they gradually occupied and grabbed the large fertile land. In the garb of being landless, some individuals have also become land grabbers," the government affidavit added. Accordingly, those evicted from Dholpur will be relocated "subject to verification of the status of erosion-affected and landless status in their respective original places and districts, citizenship and existing rehabilitation policy of the state," the affidavit by the government said. The government rules say that whenever any family becomes a victim of erosion and subsequently turns landless, they must report to the revenue authority, which are recorded in "the Gara Khahania Register" and eventually a certificate of erosion-affected and landless is issued to such genuine land holders displaced by floods or land erosion. "However, the evicted occupants of Dholpur Char and their ancestors have never produced such certificates issued from their original place where they have claimed to have migrated from. Hence, the claim of forced migration due to flood and erosion is not true," the circle officer submitted. The circle officer submitted that the state government's "The Rehabilitation Policy for erosion affected families of Assam, 2020" does not cover the displacement from the government land and it clearly states that "families occupying government lands as encroachers shall not be eligible for rehabilitation". The circle officer submitted that "the eviction carried out at Dholpur Char area under Sipajhar revenue circle was not at all an illegal act and the encroachers were removed as per the provision of rules framed under Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/dholpur-displaced-encroachers-says-assam-government-to-high-court/articleshow/87535734.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||World||Vaccine mandates are working in US, but are still divisive||LOS ANGELES: When vaccine mandates were announced in the United States, there were dire warnings they would cause mass layoffs or walkouts. But they didn't. In fact, figures show they are working. There are pockets of resistance to rules requiring employees be protected against Covid-19, notably among police and firefighters, but they have nudged more people towards getting the jab. "Mandates, so far, seem to be the most effective thing we have to overcome the vaccine hesitancy," Bradley Pollock, professor of Public Health Sciences at the University of California at Davis, told the Sacramento Bee last month. "It's more than good; it's very good." Around 58 per cent of the total US population was fully vaccinated as of early November, up from half in August as mandates began to be announced. President Joe Biden on Thursday set a January 4 deadline for employees in large companies to be fully vaccinated - a rule the administration says will affect more than two-thirds of the country's workforce. "Vaccination is the single best pathway out of this pandemic," he said. "Businesses have more power than ever before to accelerate our path out of this pandemic, save lives, and protect our economic recovery." The government rules follow mandates announced by several major employers - to impressive effect. They included United Airlines, which told its 67,000 US-based staff to get the jab or face termination. By Thursday, 2,000 had sought medical or religious exemptions and all but a handful of the rest had complied. Tyson Foods, one of the biggest meatpacking companies in the world announced in early August that all of its 120,000 staff would need to be vaccinated. Around 96 per cent of its staff have now fallen into line, the New York Times reported. The US military, which has told all serving personnel they must be jabbed - or face consequences - reports take-up is above 95 per cent in all services. On the whole, workers like the mandate and want to be vaccinated, with the AFL-CIO, the umbrella grouping for unions, calling it "a step in the right direction." But there are notable pockets of resistance, usually couched in terms of an objection to the mandate, rather than to the vaccine per se - even if the two attitudes often go hand-in-hand. That vein of skepticism is particularly thick in police departments, despite the toll the virus has taken on them. Covid-19 has claimed more than 260 police officers' lives this year - five times the number shot dead, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks deaths in the line of duty. Los Angeles County sheriff Alex Villanueva said this week that just 43 per cent of his officers had been jabbed, and called on his bosses to suspend a rule that could see unvaccinated staff fired. "Sadly," he said, the executive order is "actually disrupting our ability to provide public safety services." In Chicago, several thousand police officers face being placed on unpaid leave after refusing to disclose their vaccine status. New York City's police officers make up around half of the city employees who have applied for religious or medical exemptions. No major religion has barred followers from taking a vaccine scientists say is safe and effective. While hesitancy is concentrated in the more conservative-leaning professions, there is skepticism across society. Caleb Macy, who helps build the antennas for Nasa's Deep Space Network arrays was this week among dozens of staff demonstrating at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Like other federal employees, he faces the possibility of losing his job if he has neither a religious exemption nor full vaccination by December 8. But he says that's something he is prepared for. "I can assure you I will never get this vaccination. Because once you tell me that I have to, I draw the line at that point. It's no longer a choice when it's forced," he told AFP. He acknowledged, however, that he would not get what he called an "experimental" vaccine under any circumstances. Holdouts are getting succor from right-wing politicians, who have declared mandates everything from "overreach" to "dictatorship." Despite reams of scientific evidence about their safety and efficacy, vaccines and other anti-pandemic measures like masks continue to rile Republicans, as the latest rallying cry in the US culture wars. Jeremy Boreing, founder and chief executive of right-wing outlet The Daily Wire said his company would not be enforcing the mandate, and would be challenging it in court. "Joe Biden isn't your mom. The government isn't your mom and your employer sure as hell isn't your mom. We've already retained legal counsel and we're prepared to go to battle with this administration to put an end to their unconstitutional bullshit", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vaccine-mandates-are-working-in-us-but-are-still-divisive/articleshow/87535867.cms||---

Freight transport has already reached pre-Covid levels, said official sources at the Airports Authority of India's (AAI) NE regional office. Just before the outbreak of Covid-19 in India, while the number of aircraft movement in NE airports was 7,173 in February 2020, the same has gone up to 6,382 in October this year after months of no flights. During the same time, passenger footfall, which had dipped by more than half to 3.13 lakh in July 2021, has again touched over 7.04 lakh this October. In February last year, the corresponding figure was 8 lakh. "The passenger and aircraft movement at NE airports has reached almost 85% as compared to the pre-Covid period movements," said a senior official of AAI. Since July this year, air traffic in NE has shown constant improvement despite the second wave of the pandemic and in August and September the aviation sector in the region started witnessing substantial growth. While in August aircraft movement and passenger footfall in NE was 5,493 and 4.56 lakh respectively, the same in September further enhanced to 5,872 and 5.21 lakh. "With gradual relaxation in Covid-19 related travel protocols and Union civil aviation ministry's decision to restore the scheduled domestic operations without any capacity restrictions, there has been a significant increase in aircraft movement and passenger footfall in the northeast. Air traffic movement is returning to normalcy," the official added. On Thursday evening, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma flagged off the inaugural Flybig flight from Guwahati to Lilabari (Lakhimpur) at LGBI Airport here. Sarma termed it a significant move to bolster air connectivity in the region, which he said will give new wings to PM Modi's vision of transforming NE as the new engine of growth. A boost in passenger air connectivity to Lilabari will ease communication with the northeastern part of Assam and even parts of neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. AAI sources said that completion of the construction of the Hollongi Airport in Arunachal and the new integrated terminal buildings in Agartala and Guwahati are major tasks ahead in the region. "Full efforts are being made to complete the work and operationalise the airport by August 15 next year. It will have a peak hour capacity to handle 200 passengers," the official added. The airport, constructed in the state bordering China, holds strategic relevance and its foundation stone was laid by PM Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/85-business-recovery-in-northeast-in-october-with-regular-flights/articleshow/87535915.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Agartala||BJP wins 7 of 20 Tripura ULBs without contest||AGARTALA: The ruling BJP has won seven of 20 urban local bodies (ULB) in Tripura without contest. In five ULBs, no opposition party was allowed to submit their nomination while in two cases, except for BJP, no other candidate could file nominations in the majority of the seats. The opposition CPM, Trinamool Congress, Congress and TIPRA Motha alleged that BJP cadres had resorted to large-scale violence across the state for the past few days and from the first day of nomination process, the ruling party cadres gheraoed the offices of the returning officers to prevent nomination filing. Wednesday was the last day of filing nominations and opposition parties were not able to reach the offices, as BJP workers prevented them on the way in Kamalpur, Khowai, Mohanpur, Jirania, Ranirbazar, Bishalgarh, Udaipur and Santirbazar. Somehow, an Independent candidate in the 10-member Jirania nagar panchayat and six Independent candidates in the 15-member Santirbazar nagar panchayat managed to submit nominations although elections to these seats would not affect the victory of the BJP, alleged CPM state secretary Jitendra Chowdhury. TIPRA Motha chief and royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman alleged that they were supposed to contest five seats of Santirbazar nagar panchayat but BJP cadres did not allow them to submit nomination papers. As a result, they blocked the road and protested against BJP and called the people of other ULBs to defeat BJP. Trinamool Congress state convener Subal Bhowmik alleged that despite repeated appeals to state election commission (SEC) and police, no opposition was provided adequate security to file their nominations in all the seats of ULBs except for Agartala Municipal Corporation. Rather, BJP goons have threatened opposition supporters in front of the police, but security personnel were silent, he added. Meanwhile, SEC officials said altogether 829 candidates from various political parties and Independents have submitted their nomination papers across the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/bjp-wins-7-of-20-tripura-ulbs-without-contest/articleshow/87535970.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Built at a cost of Rs 127.2 crore, the flyover was contructed in 22 months, much ahead of its 36-month deadline. Sarma said the flyover will considerably reduce congestion in Dispur area by diverting traffic from Ganeshguri to Last Gate through the flyover, and will also ensure hassle-free movement from Khanapara to Ganeshguri. "A capital city always signifies the glory of an entire state. Completion of the flyover in a record time testifies the rate of development, which is sweeping the entire state," he added. Stating that Guwahati being the gateway to ASEAN countries, Sarma said infrastructural development of the city augurs well for the development of the whole state. Giving a snapshot of several infrastructure projects in the state and their level of implementation, the CM said it has been the commitment of the new dispensation in Assam to adhere to timely completion of projects to avoid cost overrun and give people a taste of development. He also said the under-construction bridge over the Brahmaputra from Guwahati to North Guwahati as well as flyovers in Sarab Bhatti area and Maligaon area will be inaugurated by 2023. To reduce traffic congestion, the CM also announced the proposed flyovers at RG Baruah Road-Geetanagar tri-junction, Guwahati Club-Bamunimaidan, Basistha traffic junction and Garchuk traffic junction. Sarma added that his government is also examining the construction of a six-lane ring road connecting Baihata-Sipajhar, Kuruwa-Narengi to the national highway 27. "The detailed project report for the ring road is underway, and work will be taken up under Bharat Mala Project," he added. The CM also said besides the existing Saraighat Bridge, three more bridges will come up in the next five years of this present government. The bridges comprise the one connecting Narengi and Kuruwa, the under-construction Guwahati- North Guwahati bridge and Palashbari-Sualkuchi bridge, which will unclog the connectivity bottleneck for people living along the south and north banks of the river Brahmaputra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cm-himanta-biswa-sarma-opens-2-lane-flyover-to-decongest-guwahati-traffic/articleshow/87536109.cms||Mukut Das

While the situation on the ground was quite normal and peace has been restored with the initiative of the state government and the major political parties, some vested interest groups have been visiting the state and spreading false information and photographs across the globe, which state police have taken a serious note of, said director general of police VS Yadav. The police registered a suo motu case against Qamar Ghani Usmami, founder and president, Ahsan-ul-Haque Razvi, national secretary, Asif Raza Khan, national vice president and Muddasir Dibkar, executive member of TFIslam for violating the provision of Sections 120(B)/153A/153B/503/504 of IPC and 13 of ULA (P) Act. Unknown people with different identities have been visiting the locality, making media statement on distorted facts, false propaganda and spreading fabricated photographs after vandalism in shops and houses of Muslim families in Rowa area of Panisagar on October 26 from a VHP rally. Four persons identified as Dipankar Das (52), Krishna Das (31), Surbata Das (30) and Jitendra Nath (32) were arrested three days after the violent incidents and sent to judicial custody till November 12. A TFIslam group on Wednesday around 4 pm visited an abandoned mosque in the area denying the request of on duty policemen. Later, the delegation was told not to refrain from visiting the place but they didn't listen to the police and again around 6 pm they had visited the mosque. Later, they made a false statement to media that the Quran Sharif was burnt in the incident of October 26. "Such false statements and propaganda to media followed by spreading them in social media by the outsiders with ulterior motives has been terrorising the situation and disturbing communal harmony. As a preventive measure they were detained and the next course of action would be taken after judicial review of the charges," a senior police officer said. Apart from that five criminal cases were registered against 71 people for posting "provocative" and "fake posts" on social media over the alleged communal violence in the state. A separate complaint has been registered against a team of advocates in the Supreme Court who recently visited the state to find the facts on the purported violence for making false statements and instigating communal tension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/four-held-in-north-tripura-for-suspicious-movement/articleshow/87536300.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

No major fire incident or casualty was reported, Director of Delhi Fire Service, Atul Garg, said, on Friday. According to the fire department, fire-related calls go up usually on Diwali mainly due to bursting of firecrackers, not taking adequate precautions when lighting earthen lamps or candles and not checking for loose wires while putting up decoration lights and overloaded extension boards causing short-circuit. "This is a very positive sign that fire calls have reduced on the day of Dilwali this year. This is the first time that we have recorded only 152 calls on Diwali, which is the lowest in last 15 years on the day of festival," Garg said. "This is also because of public awareness. There were less calls related to fire-cracker bursting and people also behaved responsibly and followed all the safety precautions as suggested while celebrating the festival be it while lighting diyas or decorating houses and buildings with lights," he said. According to a data shared by fire department, out of the total 152 calls, 117 calls were fire-related incidents including four which were suspected due to crackers while other calls were related to short-circuit, fire in garbage and due to lighting of earthen lamps. Besides the 117 fire-related calls, there were 10 calls seeking assistance for animal rescue, 12 for bird rescue, one related to house collapse, seven other rescue related operations and two other class seeking assistance in connection with two road accidents, the data stated. "There has been no major fire-related incident this Diwali and no casualty was reported due to fire. In total, we received 152 calls which is less than 25 per cent from last year," Garg added. The DFS control room usually responds to maximum calls on Diwali, and fire-fighters need to be on their toes to deal with any emergencies, they said. Maximum of these fire-related calls were received in the evening during peak hours, he said. According to the DSF, most of the fire-related calls were of minor category. There was a fire reported from outer Delhi's Mangolpuri area on Friday night. A fire broke out in a factory in Mangolpuri at around 10.14 pm and eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot on Friday, a senior fire official said, addding tiles stored in the basement, artificial flowers stored on the first floor and shoe manufacturing material kept on the second floor of the factory caught fire. No one was injured in the process, said a senior fire official. The fire-fighting operations ended at 3 am, he said, adding the cause of fire is being ascertained. Another fire broke out at the basement of a godown in Nilothi Extension at around 1.06 pm on Friday and eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Crockery items AND disposable cups stored in the basement of the godown caught fire but no one was injured in the incident and the fire was doused off by 3.30 pm, the fire officials said. Fire crackers were burst in the city in a blatant disregard to the government's ban on it. The fire department had responded to 205 fire-related calls on Diwali last year, officials said. According to fire officials, around 3,000 fire fighters were on duty for the last two days and Delhi Fire Service teams were deployed in over 30 specific locations across the capital to tackle any incident. Fire tenders were deployed at 22 locations across the national capital including Bara Tooti Chowk, Tilak Nagar, Lajpat Nagar (Central Market), Lal Kuan Chowk, Lahori Gate, Nangloi, South Extension, Sonia Vihar, Mehrauli, Ghitorni metro station, among others.

This comes after five companies successfully concluded their public offerings (IPOs) this week. Those five firms are — FSN E-Commerce Ventures, which runs online marketplace for beauty and wellness products Nykaa; Fino Payments Bank; Policybazaar parent entity PB Fintech; decorative aesthetics supplier SJS Enterprises; and microcrystalline cellulose maker Sigachi Industries. The three-day IPOs of Paytm, Sapphire Foods India and Latent View Analytics are scheduled to open on November 8, November 9 and November 10, respectively. So far in 2021, as many as 46 companies have floated their IPOs to raise Rs 80,102 crore and market experts believe that the year should close with the Rs 1-lakh crore primary market fundraising. Apart from these, PowerGrid InvIT, the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) sponsored by the Power Grid Corporation of India, mopped up Rs 7,735 crore through its IPO, and Brookfield India Real Estate Trust raised Rs 3,800 crore via its initial share-sale. The fundraising so far this year is way higher than Rs 26,611 crore collected by 15 companies through initial share-sales in the entire 2020. Such impressive fundraising through IPOs was last seen in 2017 when firms mobilised Rs 67,147 crore through 36 initial share-sales. Digital firm One97 Communications, which operates under the Paytm brand name, is set to come out with its Rs 18,300-crore IPO on November 8. The IPO comprises fresh issuance of equity shares worth Rs 8,300 crore and Rs 10,000 crore from an offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders. The company has fixed a price band of Rs 2,080-2,150 apiece, implying a valuation of around Rs 1.48 lakh crore. The Rs 18,300-crore offer, if successful, will be the biggest in the country after Coal India's IPO in 2010, wherein the state-owned company had garnered Rs 15,200 crore. "The biggest merit for Paytm's IPO would be that they have so much more diversified regulatory access under one roof. "This focus on diversification means that none of their particular business books has depth, unlike other major players who focus more on specialising," Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of True Beacon and Zerodha, said. On Wednesday, Paytm raised Rs 8,235 crore from anchor investors. Sapphire Foods India's public issue will be entirely an offer of sale (OFS) of 17,569,941 equity shares by promoters and existing shareholders. As part of the OFS, QSR Management Trust will sell 8.50 lakh shares, Sapphire Foods Mauritius Ltd will offload 55.69 lakh shares, WWD Ruby Ltd will divest 48.46 lakh shares and Amethyst will offer 39.62 lakh shares. In addition, AAJV Investment Trust will sell 80,169 shares, Edelweiss Crossover Opportunities Fund will offload 16.15 lakh shares and Edelweiss Crossover Opportunities Fund-Series II will divest 6.46 lakh shares. The company has fixed a price band of Rs 1,120-1,180 a share for its IPO. At the upper end of the price band, the initial public offering is expected to fetch Rs 2,073 crore. Latent View Analytics' IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 474 crore and an offer of sale of equity shares to the tune of Rs 126 crore by a promoter and existing shareholders. As part of the OFS, promoter Adugudi Viswanathan Venkatraman will offload shares worth Rs 60.14 crore, shareholder Ramesh Hariharan will sell Rs 35 crore shares and Gopinath Koteeswaran will offload Rs 23.52 crore shares among others. Currently, Venkatraman owns a 69.63 per cent stake in the company, Koteeswaran holds a 7.74 per cent stake and Hariharan has a 9.67 per cent holding in the firm. The company has set a price band of Rs 190-197 a share for its IPO. The proceeds from the fresh issue will be used for funding inorganic growth initiatives, working capital requirements of the subsidiary LatentView Analytics Corporation, and investment in subsidiaries to augment their capital base for future growth and general corporate purposes. The company provides services ranging from data and analytics consulting to business analytics and insights, advanced predictive analytics, data engineering and digital solutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/ipo-rush-continues-paytm-2-other-public-issues-to-open-next-week/articleshow/87536552.cms||---

---||Business||Merck's Covid pill: What is it and why is it crucial to fight the pandemic?||The United Kingdom has become the first country to approve an antiviral medication molnupiravir for treating mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illnesses like obesity, older age diabetes, and heart disease. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends the use of molnupiravir following a positive Covid-19 test and within five days of symptoms onset as based on clinical trial data, the drug is found to be most effective when taken during the early stages of the infection. The antiviral pill has been jointly developed by US-based Merck & Co Inc and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The approval comes at time when Covid-19 prevalence in England rose to its highest level on record, led by a high numbers of cases in children and a surge in the south-west of the country. Merck is expected to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022. How does the drug work?Lagevrio (molnupiravir) works by interfering with the virus' replication. This prevents it from multiplying, keeping virus levels low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease. It is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the coronavirus and is taken twice a day for five days. "Molnupiravir gets incorporated into burgeoning RNA strands and, once inside, wreaks havoc. The compound can shift its configuration, sometimes mimicking the nucleoside cytidine and sometimes mimicking uridine. Those RNA strands become faulty blueprints for the next round of viral genomes. Anywhere the compound gets inserted and that conformational shift happens, a point mutation occurs.. When enough mutations accumulate, the viral population collapses. The virus essentially mutates itself to death And because the mutations accumulate randomly, it’s difficult for viruses to evolve resistance to molnupiravir — another plus for the compound," reported a news website quoting Richard Plemper, a virologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta. Should I be worried about the genetic code?The genetic activity has led some experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumour. But Merck says it has run extensive tests in animals that show that this isn’t an issue. Merck ran two separate tests in animals in which it gave monulpiravir at higher doses, and for longer, than it would in humans. The tests showed that monulpiravir is not mutagenic, the company said. How effective is the drug?Merck maintains that viral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalisations and deaths recently. Merck announced preliminary results in September showing its drug cut hospitalisations and deaths by half among patients with early Covid-19 symptoms. However, the results haven't yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal. Why is it a breakthrough achievement?The drug could keep hospitals from overflowing, especially in places where vaccination rates are still low, such as many low- and lower-middle-income countries. . Poorer nations have received disproportionately low supplies of vaccines – only 7% of Africa’s population has received one vaccine dose while wealthy, largely-vaccinated countries have hoarded doses for booster shot programmes. Hence, Merck’s pill would be an important step towards tackling the pandemic. Who will get the drug?Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said the drug would be administered to patients at higher risk of complications. A wider rollout will follow if it is clinically and cost-effective in reducing hospitalisations and death. The United States has already ordered 1.7 million courses of the drug, and the United Kingdom almost half a million courses.

Students were allowed to hold multiple offers, which enabled companies to find a better Company-Student fit. Bucking the perennial trend, the finance sector was the top recruiter with 121 students, followed by consulting with 120 students. These two sectors accounted for 50% of total hires. Recruiters included the likes of Bank of America, Blackstone, Macquarie and top consulting firms like Accenture Strategy, Bain & Co., Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Co. Sales and marketing and general management accounted for 19% and 13% of total hires, respectively with companies like Aditya Birla Group, Hindustan Unilever Limited, ITC, Mahindra, Mondelez, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Star Disney, Tata Administrative Services being among the top recruiters. E-Commerce and software services accounted for 10 per cent of all hires. Top recruiters were Amazon, Flipkart, Google and Microsoft. Students, however, were more keen on new-age start-ups like Byju’s, Navi Technologies, OLX, Swiggy and Unacademy. “It is very heartening to see that the hard work of one and all in the IIM Calcutta community once again led to 100% summer placements. Kudos to the placement team’s efforts and dedication. We thank recruiters for continuing to repose faith in what Joka has to offer,” said professor Chetan Joshi, chairperson (career development and placement committee). In fact, IIM Calcutta 2021 batch also saw 100 percent job placements in March. A total of 172 firms participated and the average and median salaries rose to Rs 29 lakh and Rs 27 lakh, respectively. Last week, IIM C bagged the top spot in the 2021 edition of the Business Today-MDRA Best B-school survey. 2020's top-ranker IIM-Ahmedabad (IIMA) topped three of the five primary parameters this time -- learning experience, living experience and selection process, governance and establishment, while IIM-C topped in the other two -- placement performance and future orientation. "It was IIM-C's big score in future orientation that finally helped it topple the perennial favourite for the first time. In a close contest, IIM-C pipped IIM-A by a mere 0.1 points," said the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iim-calcutta-100-placement-for-summer-internship-top-stipend-is-rs-2-lakh/month/articleshow/87536892.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

Recent opinion surveys showed Yoon Suk Yeol would be locked in a tight race with Lee Jae-myung, the outspoken liberal ruling party candidate, who has vowed to take an appeasement policy on North Korea and adopt pragmatic diplomacy between Washington and Beijing. The close race between the two candidates will likely further intensify severe domestic polarization in South Korea at a time it faces growing North Korean nuclear threats, an intense US-China rivalry and various economic woes. A victory for Yoon could lead to South Korea taking steps to bolster its military alliance with the United States while its ties with North Korea and China may sour. If elected, Lee would push for greater ties with North Korea but he may not be able to convince the country to abandon its nuclear program, possibly sharing the legacy of his party colleague and dovish current President Moon Jae-in, whose single five-year term ends in May. In the opposition People Power Party's convention on Friday, party authorities announced that Yoon garnered 47.8% of the votes cast by party members and general citizens, beating his main rival Hong Joon-pyo with 41.5% and two other competitors. “The government must be very frightened and feeling bitter pains about my victory at the party primary,” Yoon said in an acceptance speech. “I'll surely achieve a shift in power ... I'll surely rebuild a new Republic of Korea." Yoon, 60, has spent most of his professional career as a prosecutor but is a novice in party politics. He was also previously Moon's prosecutor general, who led the president's contentious anti-corruption campaign that largely focused on conservatives including those aligned with the People Power Party. But Yoon was later embroiled in high-profile political strife with Moon's allies after some of his investigations targeted Moon associates. Moon's supporters argued Yoon's investigations were politically motivated to elevate his own political standing or disrupt Moon's push to reform the prosecution. Yoon denied such views, saying his investigations followed due, fair procedures. The infighting triggered a domestic political firestorm, undermined Moon's anti-corruption drive and boosted Yoon's popularity. He eventually resigned the top prosecutor's post in March and joined the People Power Party in July. Yoon has since pledged to strive to end liberal rule, accusing the Moon government of “trampling on fairness and justice” while being “corrupt” and “anachronistic.” Yoon's opponents have attacked him over a lack of expertise on security and other major issues. “Yoon himself does not have a foreign policy record, but he has a deep pool of experienced advisers. The question is whether he will listen to and adjudicate different opinions among them,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. In September, Yoon said if elected he would talk with Washington to formulate procedures on the deployment of US nuclear weapons in case of emergency and conduct related joint training to boost the reliability of the US “nuclear umbrella” security commitment offered to allies. But he later suggested he would oppose the US reinstalling tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, which it withdrew in the 1990s, because that would deprive Seoul of its legitimacy in calling for North Korean denuclearization. He said it would be “more realistic” to ask Washington to send submarines carrying nuclear missiles around the Korean Peninsula as deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea. Yoon has also said he would prepare for economic cooperation with North Korea but link it to progress in Pyongyang's steps toward denuclearization, a policy that North Korea won't welcome. How to deal with North Korea has long sharply split South Koreans. Conservatives have called for tougher sanctions and pressures in close coordination with the United States to get North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. But liberals favor a negotiated resolution of the nuclear issue while prioritizing improved ties with North Korea over South Korea's US alliance. Moon's government once brokered high-profile nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang, but their talks collapsed in early 2019 because they differed over how much sanctions relief the United States should provide to North Korea in return for dismantling its main nuclear complex, a limited disarmament measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ex-prosecutor-in-south-korea-wins-opposition-presidential-ticket/articleshow/87536960.cms||---

The report on the 38-member group adds pressure to major central banks that have said the situation is largely transitory and shied from any sudden tightening of policy to contain prices. “Our expectation is that once supply bottlenecks are resolved, inflationary pressures are likely to fade. However, there is a risk of more persistent inflationary pressures and policy makers will need to remain vigilant in the coming months,” OECD secretary general Mathias Cormann said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/inflation-at-13-year-high-in-oecd-area/articleshow/87537223.cms||---

Torrential rains on Thursday unleashed flash floods in Malang and the highland city of Batu, inundating houses with mud and debris, while a wall of water destroyed local bridges.  Six people were pulled from the detritus alive, while rescuers found a half dozen bodies in Batu and two more victims in Malang.  On Friday, teams raced to find several more people unaccounted for in Batu, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency, as the dead were placed in body bags.  "Until now, we are still trying to find three people still missing," the agency's chairman Abdul Muhari said in a statement.  Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Southeast Asian archipelago during the rainy season, which started in September.  The disasters are often caused by deforestation and poor mitigation planning, according to environmentalists.  Seven people were killed in a landslide triggered by torrential storms in Sumatra last month.  In April, more than 200 people were killed in a cluster of far-eastern islands in Indonesia and neighbouring Timor Leste as Tropical Cyclone Seroja turned small communities into wastelands of mud and uprooted trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/indonesia-flash-floods-kill-at-least-eight/articleshow/87537280.cms||---

The boy was reunited with his parents on Wednesday, three days after he left home, they said. "The teen left his house on October 31, after informing his parents that he would be away for one year," assistant police inspector Sandesh More of Badlapur East police station said. His parents then lodged a complaint with the police and a case of kidnapping was filed in this connection, he said. "When the police inquired with his friends, they came to know that the boy was connected with other children on Discord mobile app and used to chat in the group for hours," he added. His friends also told the police that the members of the chat group had decided to leave their houses to do something in life in order to prove themselves, More said. Accordingly, the cyber cell of the Thane police were roped in, who traced the IP address of the mobile phone used by the boy and found the chats through which they came to know that he was in Goa. "The police tracked him down at Calangute in Goa and was reunited with his family.

He also unveiled a 12-foot-high statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya, who started the akhara system in the eighth century AD, at his samadhi sthal that has been reconstructed after its destruction in the 2013 Kedarnath flash floods. In his address at the shrine town, the PM made a strong pitch for Hindutva, saying, “Cultural heritage centres of faith are being viewed with deserved and valid pride today, as they should be viewed. Ayodhya is getting its glory back after centuries. A grand temple of Lord Ram is coming up there. Two days back, the entire world witnessed grand Deepotsav celebrations and we can imagine how our ancient culture and traditions must have been.” He urged people to “visit places related to our glorious freedom struggle and pious places of pilgrimage and get acquainted with the spirit of India.” Modi added that the places associated with Lord Ram would be developed as part of a circuit for devotees. He also highlighted the ongoing projects at Kashi (Varanasi). “Work on Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi is also progressing rapidly,” said the PM, adding that efforts are underway to develop a Buddha Circuit as well. “Now, the country aims high and also sets a time limit to achieve these aims. I hear the voices of 130 crore Indians and an inner voice within me says that getting tied down under the constraint of time-span is no longer acceptable to the country. Today, India doesn't accept being timid about deadlines and goals,” said the PM. Earlier, after reaching Kedarnath in the morning, the Prime Minister offered prayers at the shrine. During the visit, prayers were offered at 12 Jyotirlingas and all the four dhams and Shiva temples all over the country in a coordinated event by the BJP. Later, the PM inaugurated several projects, including the Saraswati retaining wall and ghats, Mandakini retaining wall, teerth purohit houses and Garud Chatti bridge on river Mandakini. He also laid the foundation stone for multiple projects, said to be worth over Rs 180 crore. These include redevelopment of Sangam Ghat and a first-aid and tourist facilitation centre. The PM was also shown a short documentary on the works carried out at Kedarnath in the last few years. The PM in his address spoke emotionally about his connect with Kedarnath. “Whenever I come here, I feel connected with every bit of the place. I feel privileged that I was able to have a darshan at the temple on the auspicious occasion for Govardhan Pooja. There are no words to describe the experience of sitting before Adi Guru Shankaracharya's statue at his rebuilt samadhi.” Speaking about the developmental projects in Kedarnath, the PM said, “After the 2013 destruction, people used to wonder if Kedarnath could ever be rebuilt but a voice within me always said that Kedarnath will be redeveloped again with greater glory than before.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-inaugurates-infra-projects-worth-rs-130-cr-at-kedarnath-says-cultural-heritage-centres-of-faith-being-viewed-with-deserved-and-valid-pride/articleshow/87537388.cms||Kautilya Singh

This is the first time that China has spelt out concretely punishment for people deemed to be pro-Taiwan independence, as tensions rise between the mainland and the self-ruled island China claims as its own.  The office named Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang, Parliament Speaker You Si-kun and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu as people who are "stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence", and made public for the first time it has drawn up a list of people who fall in this category.  China will enforce punishment on the people on the list, by not letting them enter the mainland and China's Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, said spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian in a statement.  The blacklisted people will not be allowed to cooperate with entities or people from the mainland, nor will their companies or entities who fund them be allowed to profit from the mainland, she said.  Taiwanese politicians typically rely on donations from companies to fund their election campaigns. Many Taiwanese companies derive profits from doing business with the mainland.  China will also take "any other necessary measures" against these people, Zhu said.  She said the message China wants to send to supporters of Taiwan independence is: "Those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland and split the country, will never end up well and will be spurned by the people and judged by history."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/china-says-it-will-hold-supporters-of-taiwans-independence-criminally-responsible-for-life/articleshow/87537608.cms||---
---||World||COP26 braces for youth protests after vague emissions pledges||GLASGOW: Thousands of youth activists were preparing to descend on Glasgow on Friday to protest against what they say is a dangerous lack of action by leaders at the COP26 climate summit.  Demonstrations are expected across the Scottish city to highlight the disconnect between the glacial pace of emissions reductions and the climate emergency already swamping countries across the world.  Organisers of the Fridays for Future global strike movement said they expected large crowds at the planned three-hour protest during COP26 "Youth Day", which will be attended by high-profile campaigners Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate.  "This UN Climate Summit, we're once again seeing world leaders saying big words and big promises," said Mitzi Joelle Tan, a climate justice activist from the Philippines.  "We need drastic carbon dioxide emission cuts, reparations from the Global North to the Global South to use for adaptation and to manage loss and damages, and we need to put an end to the fossil fuel industry."  Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.  The UN-led process requires countries to commit to ever-increasing emissions cuts, and enjoins richer, historical emitters to help developing countries fund their energy transformations and deal with climate impacts.  Countries issued two additional pledges on Thursday to reduce their fossil fuel consumption.  Twenty nations including major financiers the United States and Canada promised to end overseas fossil fuel funding by the end of 2022.  And over 40 countries pledged to phase out coal -- the most polluting fossil fuel -- although details were vague and a timeline for doing so not disclosed.  Thunberg was unimpressed, tweeting: "This is no longer a climate conference. This is a Global North greenwash festival."  - 'Take responsibility' - Experts say a commitment made during the high-level leaders summit at the start of COP26 by more than 100 nations to cut methane emissions by at least 30 percent this decade will have a real short-term impact on global heating.  But environmental groups pointed out that governments, particularly wealthy polluters, have a habit of failing to live up to their climate promises.  "On Monday, I stood in front of world leaders in Glasgow and asked them to open their hearts to the people on the frontlines of the climate crisis," said Kenyan activist Elizabeth Wathuti, who addressed the conference's opening plenary.  "I asked them to take their historic responsibility seriously and to take serious action here. So far they haven't."  Countries came into COP26 with national climate plans that, when brought together, puts Earth on course to warm 2.7C this century, according to the UN.  With just 1.1C of warming so far, communities across the world are already facing ever more intense fire and drought, displacement and economic ruin wrought by our heating climate.  "We are tired of fighting against the current 'normal -- the 'normal' we have is unviable, unsustainable and not enough," said Kenyan activist Kevin Mtai.  "We need to change."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/cop26-braces-for-youth-protests-after-vague-emissions-pledges/articleshow/87537660.cms||---

He accused Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of being in denial mode. Amarinder had been raising the issue of national security in his interviews and had also referred to it in his resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi last week. Amarinder tweeted, "Hope Punjab government, HM Punjab in particular, will come out of denial mode and take this threat seriously. With multiple consignments being sent regularly from across the border, extra vigil and a detailed action plan must be formed to combat the challenge." He was referring to a statement by the DGP Office, Punjab that a tiffin bomb was recovered on the eve of Diwali. It was kept concealed in the agriculture fields at village Ali Ke, Ferozepur. Three persons have been arrested so far, one is an accused and two others who provided shelter and logistical support to the accused. Earlier on September 15, Amarinder as chief minister had ordered high alert in the state following the arrest of four members of an ISI-backed terrorist module involved in a bid to blow up an oil tanker with an IED tiffin bomb. Amarinder had then said that the objective behind the tiffin box bomb recovered by police which was delivered allegedly through a drone was not known. It wasn't focused on farmers' protest but the frequency with which weapons are being delivered in the last 1.5 years. I have never seen this in my life, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amarinder-singh-calls-for-extra-vigil-following-recovery-of-tiffin-bomb/articleshow/87537709.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||World||Iran says has enriched over 210 kilograms of uranium to 20%||TEHRAN: Iran's atomic agency said Friday that its stockpile of 20% enriched uranium has reached over 210 kilograms (463 pounds), the latest provocative move ahead of upcoming nuclear talks with the West.  In a report carried by semi-official Tasnim and Fars news agencies, spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said the atomic agency had produced well beyond a 120 kilogram target for 20% enriched uranium set by parliament.  Under the historic 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the World Powers, Iran was not meant to enrich uranium above 3.67 percent. Enriched uranium above 90 percent can be used for nuclear weapons.  After months of delays, the European Union, Iran and the U.S. announced Wednesday that indirect talks to resuscitate the deal would resume on Nov. 29 in Vienna.  The nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for limits on its nuclear program, and is meant to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. Tehran insists its program is peaceful.  Kamalvandi also said that so far his agency has also produced 25 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium, a level that only countries with nuclear weapons have the physical capabilities to produce.  The U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, but Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia have tried to preserve the accord.  Tehran's strategy of deliberately violating the deal is seen as an attempt to put pressure particularly on Europe to provide it with incentives to offset crippling American sanctions re-imposed after the U.S. pullout.  On Sept. 15, Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said Tehran removed surveillance cameras belonging to the United Nation's nuclear watchdog because of unfulfilled commitments by other signatories of the nuclear deal.  U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders criticized Tehran last week for what it saw as accelerated and provocative nuclear steps as Iran continues to enrich uranium to a higher levels.  With the talks in Vienna now stalled, Iran has breached limits set by the accord and is enriching small amounts of uranium to its closest-ever levels to weapons-grade purity as its stockpile continues to grow. Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iran-says-has-enriched-over-210-kilograms-of-uranium-to-20/articleshow/87537748.cms||---

The country is set to exceed its 2020-21 revenue collection target of Rs 15.45 lakh crore ($207.77 billion), the first beat in four years, but a big chunk of the extra cash will go to a rural job programme and to provide free cereals to the poor. The government is also likely to lose Rs 55,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore in additional revenue after cutting fuel taxes this week to arrest runaway prices. "Even after the cut in fuel taxes we should be able to exceed the tax collection target for the year but will use the funds for rural job programme and subsidies," said one of the officials, both of whom declined to be identified talking about market-sensitive figures. "Fiscal deficit and borrowing will be at the budget estimate levels." The finance ministry declined to comment. Before the fuel tax cut, many economists had predicted India bettering its fiscal deficit target of 6.8% by 30-50 basis points for the year that ends on March 31. Market participants had also expected the government to review its budgeted borrowing of Rs 12.055 lakh crore before starting discussions on its next budget to be presented on February 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is planning to top up its rural job-guarantee effort by up to Rs 30,000 crore, said the second official, having used up Rs 73,000 crore allocated for the current fiscal year. The government will also have to provide an additional Rs 50,000 crore each for its free food drive and an incentives programme for exporters, said the officials. The government has also approved Rs 40,000 crore extra in fertiliser subsidies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-to-use-revenue-surge-to-fund-welfare-drives-not-beat-fiscal-deficit-target-sources/articleshow/87537670.cms||---

Amarinder had been raising the issue of national security in his interviews and had also referred to it in his resignation to the party president Sonia Gandhi last week. Amarinder tweeted, "Hope Punjab government, HM Punjab in particular, will come out of denial mode and take this threat seriously. With multiple consignments being sent regularly from across the border, extra vigil and a detailed action plan must be formed to combat the challenge." He was referring to a statement by the DGP Office, Punjab that a tiffin bomb was recovered on the eve of Diwali. It was kept concealed in agriculture fields at village Ali Ke, Ferozepur. Three arrested - one accused and two others who provided shelter and logistical support to the accused. Earlier on September 15, Amarinder as chief minister had ordered high alert in the state following the arrest of four more members of an ISI-backed terrorist module involved in a bid to blow up an oil tanker with an IED tiffin bomb. Amarinder had then said that the objective behind the tiffin box bomb recovered by police which was delivered allegedly through a drone was not known. It wasn't focused on farmers' protest but the frequency in which weapons are being delivered in the last 1.5 yrs, I've never seen this in my life, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-amarinder-singh-calls-for-extra-vigil-following-recovery-of-tiffin-bomb/articleshow/87537756.cms||Vibhor Mohan

---||World||Rise of Taliban adversely affecting South Asia: Report||KABUL: As the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating by the day, there have been reports emerging that radical Islam is on the ascent in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and even India since the Taliban took over Afghanistan, said a media report. Writing in The J.CA, Rachel Avraham, a political analyst cited an interview of Shipan Kumer Basu, President of the World Hindu Struggle Committee where he stated that with the rise of the Taliban to power, there are fears that the situation will further deteriorate. "Over the past few weeks, extremists Muslims have carried out barbaric attacks on Hindus by placing the Quran in a Hindu puja mandap (temporary places of worship). The people of the Buddhist community were not left out either. Due to false rumours of blasphemy, in more than 31 districts, Hindu idols were vandalized, Hindu homes were attacked and looted, and many Hindu women were gangraped," Basu said. From Basu's perspective, Bangladesh has always been associated with developments in Afghanistan - and the rise of the Taliban there has led to a euphoria of radicalism in Bangladesh, which has a government that was already pampering radical Islamists, said the report. According to the report, earlier this week, radical Islamists clashed with the police while en route to Pakistan's capital city. These riots, which did result in the death of a couple of police officers, resulted in the government releasing 350 banned Islamist activists. At the same time, there are also reports of Pakistani cricketers praising radical Islam and promoting bigotry against non-Muslims. A recent Gallop poll found that 55 per cent of Pakistanis would support the installation of a radical Islamist government similar to the Taliban in Afghanistan, the report stated. And in Afghanistan itself, the situation is deteriorating by the day, thus increasing the possibility that such radicalism will influence the entire region. Meanwhile, the European Parliament recently held an international conference on "the situation of women's rights in Afghanistan after the Taliban's takeover." The conference was organised by Manel Msalmi, a well-known feminist and human rights activist. In the conference, one of the speakers was Zarifa Ghafari, a former Afghani mayor of Maidan Shar. Ghafari proclaimed: "Afghanistan has undergone drastic changes in the past few weeks. Since the Taliban has illegitimately wrested power on 15 August 2021, it has been building a narrative of a 'moderate Taliban' to gain recognition from the International community," The J.CA reported. According to Ghafari, "It is becoming clear that Taliban 2.0 is going to be worse, as its worldview remains unchanged, rooted in medieval ideologies. Especially on the crucial issue of women's rights." "The new government formed by the Taliban is all-male, comprising mostly mullahs. Even in the ministry of education, female professionals are absent. The Taliban's higher education ministry consulted only male teachers and students on resuming the function of universities," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/rise-of-taliban-adversely-affecting-south-asia-report/articleshow/87537762.cms||---

However, no one was hurt in the incident that the minister described as "a clear murder attempt". Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws enacted last year have been opposing programmes of leaders of Haryana's ruling BJP and Jannayak Janta Party. A group of protesters carrying black flags blocked Jangra's route in Hisar's Narnaund, according to police. Later, the road was cleared, allowing the Rajya Sabha MP to proceed, the police said. Jangra said police officials informed him that two people have been arrested in connection with the incident. "After concluding my programme, I was on my way to attend another function when some miscreants threw lathis on my car, leaving it damaged. No one was hurt," Jangra told reporters. He was sitting in the back seat of the car. "I spoke to Haryana DGP and the SP regarding this incident. I have demanded strict punishment as per law against the culprits. This is a clear murder attempt," the MP said. "I was going to attend two more programmes in Narwana and Uchana. As my car was damaged, I had to cancel the visits," Jangra said. "I was attending a social function. It was not a political function. Will they (farmers) oppose social functions too?" he asked. Hundreds of farmers are encamped at Delhi borders since November last year demanding that the government repeal the three agri laws -- Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim that these laws will leave them at the mercy of corporates. They are also demanding a new law to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. The Centre, which has held 11 rounds of talks with farmers to break the deadlock, has maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/windshield-of-bjp-mps-car-smashed-during-farmers-protest-in-haryana/articleshow/87537883.cms||---
---||World||Chinese journalist jailed over Covid reports 'close to death'||BEIJING: A citizen journalist jailed for her coverage of China's initial response to Covid in Wuhan is close to death after going on hunger strike, her family said, prompting renewed calls from rights groups for her immediate release. Zhang Zhan, 38, a former lawyer, travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the chaos at the pandemic's epicentre, questioning authorities' handling of the outbreak in her smartphone videos. She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced in December to four years in jail for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" -- a charge routinely used to suppress dissent. She is now severely underweight and "may not live for much longer", her brother Zhang Ju wrote last week on a Twitter account verified by people close to the matter. Zhang has been on a hunger strike and was force-fed through nasal tubes, her legal team, which did not have information on her current condition, told AFP earlier this year. "She may not survive the coming cold winter," Zhang Ju wrote, adding that he had urged his sister in letters to "take care of herself". "In her heart, it seems there is only God and her beliefs, with no care for anything else." Zhang Ju's posts sparked fresh calls for his sister's release, with Amnesty International urging the Chinese government Thursday to "release her immediately so that she can end her hunger strike and receive the appropriate medical treatment she desperately needs". Amnesty campaigner Gwen Lee said in a statement that Zhang's detention was a "shameful attack on human rights". Someone close to the citizen journalist, who declined to be named, told AFP the family had asked to meet Zhang more than three weeks ago at the Shanghai women's prison where she is being held but had not received a response. AFP was unable to reach Zhang Ju while Zhang's mother declined to comment. The Shanghai prison also offered no response when approached by AFP. China's foreign ministry on Friday did not comment on Zhang's condition, but dismissed calls from rights groups for her release as "anti-China political manipulation." "China is a country with rule of law," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference. "Anyone who breaks the law must be punished in accordance with the law." Zhang now cannot walk or even raise her head without help, according to Reporters without Borders (RSF). RSF East Asia Bureau head, Cedric Alviani, said the "international community (must) apply pressure to the Chinese regime and secure Zhang Zhan's immediate release before it is too late." "She was only performing her duty as a reporter and should never have been detained, not to mention receive a four-year prison sentence." China has revelled in its success in keeping domestic infections down to a trickle of sporadic outbreaks. The government has put forward a narrative crediting the Communist Party with returning life almost to normal even as death tolls and infections continue to explode in the rest of the world. But those who threaten the official version by raising questions about the government's early cover-up and handling of the Wuhan outbreak face the party's wrath. Zhang is among a group of four citizen journalists -- including Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua -- detained after reporting from Wuhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-journalist-jailed-over-covid-reports-close-to-death/articleshow/87537888.cms||---

Since the fall of the former government, Afghans have faced challenges in withdrawing their money from the banks and said they no longer want to deposit funds, adding that they will take out all of their previously deposited funds, Tolo News reported. "We used to save our money in the banks, but currently they are not paying us on time. The banks have lost trust among the people, we no longer want to save our money in the banks," said Noorullah, a resident of Kabul. Meanwhile, a number of economists said that if the banking system continues at this rate, the banks will not be able to provide services, and this will have a negative impact on the country's economy, Tolo News reported. "If everyone transfers its money to other countries, what is left? The bank is an economic structure--when we deposit our money in the banks then that is used for investments," said Wahab Qati, an economic analyst. According to Tolo News, officials of Afghanistan's central bank recently said in a statement that private and public banks must increase the withdrawal limit of the customers' money to $400 per week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/kabul-residents-face-difficulties-withdrawing-money-from-banks-say-will-no-longer-use-banks/articleshow/87537522.cms||---

---||Business||Happiest Minds aims to lower revenue dependency on US to below 65% in few years||MUMBAI: Happiest Minds Technologies, which last week reported a 30 per cent jump in net income at over Rs 44 crore for the September quarter, wants to bring down its dependency on the world's largest software market US to under-65 per cent on a sustainable basis. The US is the single largest revenue head for all domestic software companies primarily because the country is the most tech-savvy market with the highest adoption levels and also the largest investor in technology and automation. On average, the US gives 48 per cent of the revenue to domestic software companies, down from 55-60 per cent earlier. For Happiest Minds, that is still much higher at close 70 per cent on average barring in Q2 when it slipped to 66 per cent. This is because the US companies are much more accessible and also take faster decisions on tech investment. "We used to have around 80 per cent of our revenue from the US alone. We've been diversifying our revenue pool to lower our revenue dependency on that market. In the September 2021 quarter, it was down to 66 per cent from 77 per cent a year ago. But we know such a drastic drop is not possible nor it is sustainable," Joseph Anantharaju, executive vice-chairman of Happiest Minds, told PTI from their California headquarters earlier this week. Anantharaju added that the idea is to cap the revenue share from the US at under-65 per cent on a sustainable basis over the next few years. Its managing director and CEO Venkatraman N said from the Bengaluru headquarters, "The sharp drop in the US revenue share in Q2 was because of a big one-time deal from a West Asian client which also boosted the rest of the world revenue share to over nine per cent from 2.6 per cent for long, and also a multi-million deal from a German engineering company." He added that the company is also on course to win a few more large West European deals, primarily from Germany over the coming quarters. "We could close a large German deal because we got a good opening to the West European markets after we bought the Austrian PGS which sells its services as Pimcore in Q1," Venkatraman said. As the company reduces its dependency on the US for revenue, the same will go up elsewhere, with European share touching 14 per cent from 11 per cent now on the back of German inductions, and that of India retaining the current 13 per cent share going forward from 10.9 per cent last year, he said. "We want to maintain the European share at 14 per cent or even lower because of tough marketing conditions there," Anantharaju said. He added that the company would like to focus on Europe but that will not be at the cost of defocusing the US, which is an easier market to win when it comes to marketing. "Therefore the US will continue to grow and we want it to grow further." Why the US tops in tech revenue for all domestic software companies is that the digital-first story began in the US, and Europe only caught up much later and so did the rest of the world. Secondly, it's a lot easier to talk to a US company and so is meeting its chief technology officer who takes much faster decisions, Venkatraman said. Last week, Ashok Soota-founded firm reported an over 30 per cent spike in net income at Rs 44.44 crore for the September 2021 quarter, while the total income rose to Rs 274.12 crore from Rs 187.91 crore. Venkatraman said they continued to show healthy cash flows of Rs 67.43 crore and improved on the capital return ratios prompting it to declare an interim dividend of Rs 1.75 a share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/happiest-minds-aims-to-lower-revenue-dependency-on-us-to-below-65-in-few-years/articleshow/87537344.cms||---

Warsaw and the EU accuse Belarus of spurring illegal migrants to enter Poland and other EU states via Belarusian territory to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions it imposed on Minsk over human rights abuses. Belarus has repeatedly denied this.  "Further provocations at the border. Yesterday, a Belarusian soldier tried to fire a flare gun towards Polish soldiers. Fortunately, the gun did not fire," the Polish defence ministry wrote on Twitter.  "100 metres away, five armed Belarusians tried to destroy (our border) fence, shouting at the same time that they would shoot Polish soldiers."  Poland has erected a barbed-wire fence along the border, where a state of emergency is in effect, to keep out arriving migrants and plans to build a 5.5-metre (18-foot)-high wall along a 180-km (110-mile) stretch of the boundary.  Anton Bychkovsky, spokesperson for the Belarusian State Border Guard Committee, told the Sputnik Belarus news agency that the Polish side was inventing facts.  "The adjoining side continues to escalate the situation around the situation on the border. Representatives of the Polish Ministry of Defence are in fact provocateurs themselves," Sputnik quoted him as saying.  The Belarusian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/poland-accuses-belarus-of-more-border-provocations-amid-migrant-crisis/articleshow/87538070.cms||---
---||World||China vows no mercy for Taiwan independence 'diehards'||BEIJING: China vowed Friday to punish "diehard" Taiwan politicians, saying it would ban several from visiting the mainland, as tensions between Beijing and Taipei spiked to their highest level in years. China claims Taiwan as its territory -- to be seized one day, by force if necessary -- and has intensified efforts in recent years to isolate the self-ruled island on the international stage. On Friday, the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing warned that "the mainland will pursue criminal responsibility for Taiwan independence diehards in accordance with the law, to be effective for life". The statement by spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian named Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang, parliament speaker Yu Shyi-kun and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu as among a minority of independence supporters. Zhu said the politicians "have tried to instigate cross-strait confrontation, maliciously attacked and slandered the mainland... severely undermining cross-strait relations". She added that Beijing has prohibited them and their family members from entering the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau. Their affiliates would also be restricted from cooperating with mainland organisations and individuals, she said, without giving more details. The nationalist Kuomintang party fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war. The island of 24 million people has since transformed into a vibrant democracy and major tech hub, leading many -- including President Tsai Ing-wen -- to assert Taiwan's distinct identity, which Beijing attacks as separatism. Beijing-Taipei ties have plunged since Tsai rose to power in 2016. "Those who forget their ancestors, betray their motherland and split the country will not come to a good end," Zhu said. The comments came a day after the head of a visiting European Parliament delegation to Taipei called Taiwan's democracy "a treasure" to be protected, promising to stand with the island. China has dramatically ramped up military activities in recent years, with a record number of planes intruding into the island's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) in early October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-vows-no-mercy-for-taiwan-independence-diehards/articleshow/87538093.cms||---

---||Business||Explainer: Why are foreign tech firms pulling out of China?||HONG KONG: Yahoo Inc is leaving the China market, suspending its services there as of Monday amid what it says is an "increasingly challenging" business and legal environment. Foreign technology firms have been pulling out or downsizing their operations in mainland China as a strict data privacy law specifying how companies collect and store data takes effect. Such companies have decided the regulatory uncertainty and reputational risks outweigh the advantages of staying in the huge market. WHICH FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE RECENTLY DOWNSIZED OPERATIONS OR LEFT CHINA?Yahoo Inc said in a statement Tuesday its services in China stopped as of November 1. Users visiting the Engadget China site run by Yahoo this week find a popup notice saying the site will not publish any new content. Last month, Microsoft's professional networking platform LinkedIn said it would shutter the Chinese version of its site this year and replace it with a jobs board with no social networking functions. Epic Games, which operates the popular video game Fortnite, also says it will pull the game out of the China market as of Nov. 15. The game was launched in China via a partnership with the China's largest gaming company, Tencent, which owns a 40% stake in Epic. WHY ARE COMPANIES LEAVING CHINA NOW?The Personal Information Protection Law that took effect on November 1 limits the amount of information companies are allowed to gather and sets standards for how it must be stored. Companies must get users' consent to collect, use or share data and provide ways for users to opt out of data-sharing. Companies also must get permission to send users' personal information abroad. The new law raises costs of compliance and adds to uncertainty for Western companies operating in China. Companies caught flouting the rules could be fined up to 50 million yuan ($7.8 million) or 5% of their yearly revenue. Chinese regulators have cracked down on technology companies, seeking to curb their influence and address complaints that some companies misuse data and engage in other tactics that hurt consumers' interests. The downsizing and departures also come asUS and China tussle over technology and trade. Washington has imposed restrictions on telecoms equipment giant Huawei and other Chinese tech companies, alleging they have ties with China's military and government. Local companies are also feeling the heat, with e-commerce companies like Alibaba facing fines. Regulators are investigating some companies and have imposed strict rules that affect gaming firms like NetEase and Tencent. WHAT OTHER HURDLES DO FOREIGN TECH COMPANIES FACE IN CHINA?China operates what is known as a "Great Firewall" which uses laws and technologies to enforce censorship. Content and keywords deemed politically sensitive or inappropriate must be scrubbed from the internet. Companies must police their own platforms, deleting posts and making sensitive keywords unsearchable. Western social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked by the Great Firewall and are generally not accessible for people in mainland China. "China has installed a very draconian policy governing internet operators, telling them what to do and especially what not to do," said Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities Limited in Hong Kong. "I think the question comes down to why bother (operating as a foreign company in China) with such a limited return, and such heavy liability," he said. Michael Norris, a research strategy manager at the Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina said compliance costs will rise further. "Fortnite's exit is particularly damaging, as it shows not even a close partnership and investment with Tencent is enough to make the business case work," he said. Foreign tech companies operating in China also face pressure from their home markets. SomeUS lawmakers criticized LinkedIn's censorship ofUS journalist profiles in China. In 2007, Yahoo Inc. was lambasted for handing over information on Chinese dissidents to the Chinese government that eventually led to their imprisonment. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR INTERNET USERS IN CHINA?Chinese alternatives have popped up over the years to fill the void left by foreign social media platforms that have given up operating under the Great Firewall. Instead of Google, China's most popular search engine is Baidu. Messaging apps like WeChat are used instead of WhatsApp or Messenger. Weibo, a microblogging platform, is the closest equivalent to Twitter, with more than 560 million Chinese users. Unless they use a virtual private network (VPN) to mask their internet traffic and location and circumvent the web restrictions Chinese have fewer options for social networking and access to content and are likely to turn to strictly censored local alternatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/explainer-why-are-foreign-tech-firms-pulling-out-of-china/articleshow/87538043.cms||---

In a hit-and-run case, five women were killed and eight injured on the Hyderabad-Bengaluru national highway near Pamidi. The accident occurred around 5.30 a.m. when an auto-rickshaw carrying agricultural labourers was hit by an unknown vehicle, believed to be a truck. The workers were on their way to Kottalapalli village to work in agriculture fields. Police said the three-wheeler was being driven on a wrong route which apparently led to the collision. The truck driver sped away from the scene. Police were trying to identify the vehicle by scanning CCTV footage. Such was the impact of the collision that the auto-rickshaw was badly mangled and the body parts of the deceased were seen strewn around. The injured were shifted to a hospital, where the condition of two is stated to be critical. The deceased were identified as Shankaramma (48), Nagaveni (40), Savitri (41), Subbamma (45)and Chowdamma (35). The victims were residents of Koppalakonda in Garladinne mandal. In another incident, about 10 km from the scene of the first mishap, two pedestrians were killed.

Earlier on Monday, Novavax and its partner Serum Institute of India (SII) had said that they had received the first emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Covid-19 vaccine in Indonesia. "The company has now completed the submission to World Health Organization (WHO) of all modules required for the regulatory evaluation of NVX-CoV2373, the company's recombinant nanoparticle protein-based Covid-19 vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant," Novavax Inc said in a statement on Thursday. The chemistry, manufacturing and controls module submitted to WHO, as well as other regulatory agencies worldwide, leverages Novavax' manufacturing partnership with the SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, it added. Novavax will make further submissions to enable vaccine supply from additional manufacturing sites in Novavax' global supply chain. The filing by Novavax is in addition to a previous filing to WHO by Novavax and SII, the company said. "Today's submission reflects our continued focus on accelerating access and equitable distribution as we work to bring our vaccine to people in need around the globe," Novavax president and chief executive officer Stanley C Erck said. The grant of WHO EUL is a pre-requisite for exports to numerous countries participating in the COVAX Facility, which was established to allocate and distribute vaccines equitably to participating countries and economies, Novavax Inc said. The company continues to work closely with governments, regulatory authorities and non-governmental organisations in its commitment to ensuring equitable global access to its Covid-19 vaccine, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/novavax-files-for-emergency-use-listing-of-covid-19-vaccine-with-who/articleshow/87538250.cms||---

Homes were flooded around Sarajevo while local roads were submerged in the southwest of the country, prompting some schools to cancel classes. Dozens of people had to be evacuated from their homes in the Sarajevo suburb of Otes and in the city of Konjic, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital. Rain started late on Thursday and forecasts say it will continue to fall until Sunday, raising fears of a repeat of record flooding that affected about a third of the population in 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/flash-floods-in-bosnia-prompt-evacuations-school-closures/articleshow/87538406.cms||---

Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, he said, "I have taken back my resignation. The day new advocate general is appointed and new panel comes on the director general of police, I will resume charge of my office". "I have taken back my resignation. The day new AG is appointed and new panel comes (on DGP), I will resume charge… https://t.co/Wh483Jgm3T— TOIChandigarh (@TOIChandigarh) 1636107791000Sidhu also justified his objections to appointment of the advocate general and the director general of police by the Charanjit Singh Channi government. Earlier, amid some reports that APS Deol offered to resign as the Punjab advocate general, a source close to him refuted the same, saying there is no such development. On September 27, the Punjab government had notified the appointment of Deol as the state's advocate general. The development comes days after the Punjab chief minister and Sidhu, who have not been on the same page over certain appointments, Tuesday said they will work with each other and fight the upcoming polls together, according to party MLAs. Sidhu said he has "no differences" with Channi. "I have been talking to CM Channi. I have no differences with him. Whatever I do is for Punjab. At the first meeting with him a month back, I was told that a panel on the DGP will be sent and the issue will be settled in a week," he said. They met during a meeting of party MLAs and other senior leaders on Tuesday evening to discuss strategy for the elections. The meeting was held on a day former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh resigned from the Congress and announced the name of his own political party. Senior Congress leader and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary was also present in the meeting where the party sought to show that there were no differences between Channi and Sidhu and the party will fight the polls unitedly. Sidhu and Channi had not been on the same page over certain appointments which led to unease between them. “All is well,” Sidhu told reporters after the meeting. A party MLA said Sidhu and Channi told the meeting they will work with each other and fight the upcoming elections together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/navjot-singh-sidhu-takes-back-resignation-as-punjab-congress-president/articleshow/87538559.cms||---

The incident took place near SKIMS hospital in Bemina area of the city on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway. "There was a brief firefight between terrorists and security forces at SKIMS Hospital, Bemina. Terrorists managed to escape taking advantage of civilian presence," Srinagar police said on Twitter. The police has cordoned off the area and launched a massive search operation. The attack comes amid a recent spurt in several incidents of killings of civilians by the terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir which have sparked fear in the valley. Last month, Union home minister Amit Shah visited Jammu and Kashmir and reviewed the security situation in the valley. He also visited forward areas at the Makwal border in Jammu and Kashmir with Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and interacted with jawans and local residents. He also met with the delegations of Kashmiri Pandits, Gujjar-Bakarwal community, Pahadi community and Jammu and Kashmir Chamber of Commerce in Jammu. Shah met families of soldiers and civilians killed this month.

During the 2013 tragedy, Choubey was also trapped at the holy place and several members of his group had lost their lives, he noted. "This is a very emotional moment for me. I along with my family members battled for life for days there. The seer's samadhi was heavily damaged. More than half of the members of my group lost their lives. The divine glory of Kedarnath Dham has returned after the Modi government took over,” he said. BJP leaders were joined by sadhus and devouts at holy places linked to Shankaracharya across the country to watch Modi's programme on the big screen. Choubey noted that he had sat on 'dharna' at Jantar Mantar here to brought to people's notice the situation there following the tragedy but the Congress governments at the Centre and the state then were "very indifferent". Modi's continuous efforts have restored the holy place's glory, and the projects launched by the prime minister will help tourists a lot, Choubey added. The decade belongs to Uttarakhand, there will be unprecedented boost to connectivity in the region in the coming years and the migration of people from the hills will stop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. He was addressing a large gathering of teerth-purohits and devotees at the Kedarnath temple after unveiling a 12-foot statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya at the seer's rebuilt samadhi. The prime minister sat at the foot of the statue for a while after unveiling it and then proceeded to take a walk around Kedarpuri to review the reconstruction work carried out over the last few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-govt-has-restored-kedarnath-dhams-glory-choubey/articleshow/87538689.cms||---

---||World||Pfizer says antiviral pill cuts risk of severe Covid-19 by 89%||LONDON: A trial of Pfizer Inc's experimental antiviral pill for Covid-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease, the company said on Friday. The results appear to surpass those seen with Merck & Co Inc's pill molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for Covid-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness. Full trial data is not yet available from either company. Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results for its pill, which is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir, to the US food and drug administration as part of the emergency use application it opened in October. The combination treatment, which will have the brand name Paxlovid, consists of three pills given twice daily. The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer's study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate Covid-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age. It found that 0.8% of those given Pfizer's drug within three days of symptom onset were hospitalized and none had died by 28 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 7% for placebo patients. There were also seven deaths in the placebo group. Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms - 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared with 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths. Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, in order to be most effective. Merck tested its drug within five days of symptom onset. "We saw that we did have high efficacy, even if it was five days after a patient has been treated, people might wait a couple of days before getting a test or something, and this means that we have time to treat people and really provide a benefit from a public health perspective," Annaliesa Anderson, head of the Pfizer program, told Reuters. The company did not detail side effects of the treatment, but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients. "These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients’ lives, reduce the severity of Covid-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations,” Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said in a statement. Infectious disease experts stress that preventing Covid-19 through wide use of vaccines remains the best way to control the pandemic, but only 58% of Americans are fully vaccinated and access in many parts of the world is limited. Pfizer's drug, part of a class known as protease inhibitors, is designed to block an enzyme the coronavirus needs in order to multiply. Merck's molnupiravir has a different mechanism of action designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. Merck has already sold millions of courses of the treatment, which was approved this week by UK regulators, to the United States, the UK and others. Britain said earlier this month it had secured 250,000 courses of Pfizer's antiviral. Pfizer is also studying whether its pill could be used by people without risk factors for serious Covid-19 as well as to prevent coronavirus infection in people exposed to the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-says-antiviral-pill-cuts-risk-of-severe-covid-19-by-89/articleshow/87538996.cms||---
---||World||China lashes out at press freedom survey in Hong Kong||HONG KONG: China on Friday criticized a press freedom survey from the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club that found nearly half its members were considering leaving the city. The survey said the members were concerned about a decline in press freedoms under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing following massive anti-government protests in 2019. Eighty-four percent of 99 journalists polled said that the working environment had ``changed for the worse'' since the law was introduced last June. The law outlaws subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion to intervene in the city's affairs, and has since been used to arrest over 120 people in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. ``These results clearly show that assurances that Hong Kong still enjoys press freedom, guaranteed under the Basic Law, are not enough,'' FCC President Keith Richburg said. ``More steps need to be taken to restore confidence among journalists and to make sure Hong Kong maintains its decades-long reputation as a welcoming place for the international media.'' In a statement, the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong warned the FCC to stop making ``noise'' and accused the organization of being ``black hands'' that intervene in the city's affairs. ``There is no absolute press freedom in the world that is above the law,'' the statement read. ``It is a common international practice for countries to supervise the news media working in their own countries in accordance with the law.'' The survey comes as authorities are cracking down on political dissent in Hong Kong. Most of the city's prominent pro-democracy activists are currently in jail. Critics say the security law has rolled back freedoms promised to Hong Kong for 50 years when it was handed over to China in 1997. The former British colony was previously known for its vibrant press freedoms, and for decades has served as regional headquarters for many English-language news outlets. The national security law has been used against journalists in the city. The pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was forced to close in June after millions of dollars in assets were frozen and several top editors and executives arrested. The New York Times has said it would transfer some of its staff from Hong Kong to Seoul due to the uncertainties about the city's prospects for journalism under the security legislation. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday at a regular news briefing that the rights of foreign media and journalists in Hong Kong will be ``fully protected'' as long as they report in accordance with the law. Wang said that as of April this year, there were 628 foreign employees with work visas for foreign media in Hong Kong, a 18.5% increase from the same time last year. ``It is a true reflection of how people from all walks of life, including foreign media in Hong Kong, see and feel about the economic and social and media reporting environment in Hong Kong,'' he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-lashes-out-at-press-freedom-survey-in-hong-kong/articleshow/87538930.cms||---

Speaking to reporters in Srinagar, Raina said flights will continue between Srinagar and Sharjah, the only difference will be that they will take a longer route. "Some days ago Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Srinagar and inaugurated direct flight between Srinagar and Sharjah, but it is extremely disappointing that Pakistan has closed its airspace proving it is the biggest enemy of people of Kashmir," Raina said. "Flight operations will continue. Flights will not use Pakistan's airspace but take a longer route - from Srinagar to Delhi, Delhi to Mumbai and Mumbai to Sharjah. But Pakistan's actions and intentions have become clear before the world." Pakistan has not allowed the use of its airspace for the Srinagar-Sharjah direct flight inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on October 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/despite-pak-denying-air-space-srinagar-sharjah-flight-wont-stop-bjp/articleshow/87539199.cms||---

According to sources, the NSA-level meeting will be chaired by Ajit Doval. Two earlier meetings in this format have been held in Iran in September 2018 and December 2019. The third meeting in India could not be held earlier due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to sources, there has been an overwhelming response to India's invitation. Several countries including Russia and Iran have confirmed participation in the meeting, in which, not just Afghanistan's immediate land neighbours are invited but also Central Asian countries are invited. The high-level participation in next week’s meeting hosted by India reflects the widespread and growing concern of regional countries about the situation in Afghanistan and their desire to consult and coordinate with each other. India has an important role to play in this process. Invitations have been extended to China and Pakistan too, and formal responses are awaited. However, Pakistan has indicated through the media that it will not attend. "Pakistan's decision is unfortunate, but not surprising. It reflects its mindset of viewing Afghanistan as its protectorate. Pakistan has not attended the previous meetings of this format. Its media comments against India are an unsuccessful attempt to deflect attention from its pernicious role in Afghanistan," sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-host-nsa-level-meeting-on-afghanistan-on-nov-10/articleshow/87539181.cms||---

---||World||Japan, Germany expand military ties as German warship visits||TOKYO: Defense minister Nobuo Kishi on Friday said Japan will step up military cooperation with Germany in the Indo-Pacific region as he welcomed a port call by the first German warship to visit Japan in about 20 years. The frigate Bayern is visiting Tokyo after two days of joint exercises with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer Samidare in the Pacific Ocean amid increasingly assertive maritime activities by China in the region. The ship's visit is “an important turning point” in pursuing a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and secure one of the world's most important shipping lanes, Kishi said after inspecting the frigate with German officials. "It shows Germany's strong commitment to actively contribute to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific,” he said. The frigate left Germany in August for deployment in the Indo-Pacific as part of the country's recent shift to the region and follows similar moves by other European countries including Britain, France and the Netherlands. Warships from those countries recently conducted joint naval exercises in the East and South China seas. Germany adopted a defense guideline last year focusing on the Indo-Pacific region and has since stepped up its military ties with Japan. The two sides signed an agreement in March on the protection of classified information exchanges, and held their first security talks involving defense and foreign ministers in June. “The Indo-Pacific is today one of the strategically most important regions of the world," Gen. Eberhard Zorn, chief of Germany's armed forces, said at a joint news conference with Kishi. "Here important decisions over freedom, peace and wellbeing in the world are being made. Deploying our frigate to the Indo-Pacific makes clear that Germany stands up for our common values.” China, which claims most of the disputed South China Sea as well as Japanese-held islands in the East China Sea, has defended its growing maritime activities and says it has the right to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests. Japanese officials say Chinese vessels routinely violate Japanese territorial waters around the islands in the East China Sea, sometimes threatening fishing boats. Zorn said the Bayern has conducted small-scale exercises with the militaries of eight countries since leaving Germany and made port calls at various locations including Guam and Australia. Beginning in mid-November, the Bayern will conduct monitoring and surveillance under a UN Security Council resolution of maritime activities by North Korean ships, including possible ship-to-ship transfers of banned cargoes in regional seas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/japan-germany-expand-military-ties-as-german-warship-visits/articleshow/87538945.cms||---
