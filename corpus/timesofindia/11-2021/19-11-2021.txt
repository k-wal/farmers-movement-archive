The court also directed marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners without insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar, who passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by one Mayra alias Vaishnavi and 16 others pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners, further called upon the Union government to initiate the process as the stage has been reached. "The uniform civil code (UCC) is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made purely voluntary as was observed by Dr BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community. The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code," the court observed. "Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law," the court further added. The court, in an attempt to envisage the possible effect of uniform civil code (UCC) on the Indian population if implemented, referred to the Hindu Family Code (HFC), which in the court’s opinion, acted as uniform civil code and integrated the citizens into an integrated and united Indian citizenry, on terms that is equal and uniform, in so far as the law regulating family law is concerned. Stressing that the impact of HFC on Hindu society has been phenomenal, the court opined that HFC has not encroached upon the religious custom, culture, practice, and propagation of the minuscule minority, i.e., Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, included within the definition of Hindus. The HFC can be said to be the UCC governing the Hindus and the communities, falling within the ambit and definition of Hindu and that it covers and has sway over 80% of the population. Significantly, the court noted that the HFC laid the foundation of transforming the traditional Hindu society, and the legislations lifted and transported the Hindu personal law from the shastra/religion and placed it within the domain of Parliament. "Parliament through HFC in a single stroke provided the legal platform where Hindu citizens could interact with each other on equal terms irrespective of rigid caste, jati, creed, gotra and the concept of purity, pollution in marriage and dining. The HFC has been largely instrumental, (apart from other factors viz education, mobility, health services), in facilitating and creating what the sociologist refer to as a Hindu social class and or a Hindu citizenry," noted the court. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehended threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, they had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Key observations:The issue of UCC, though constitutional, rakes political overtures whenever raised or debated in the public domain and calls for its implementation in the wake of a multiplicity of marriage and family laws in place. A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the minority community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. That has been the consistent official stand of the government within the country and in international forums. A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws that have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the state which is charged with the duty of securing Uniform Civil Code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uniform-civil-code-a-necessity-cannot-be-made-voluntary-allahabad-hc/articleshow/87787579.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The issue was raised by Sena group leader in the Thane House, Ashok Vaity, during the question hour session in the general body meeting. Vaity asked the corporation if it had constituted an inquiry in the allegations made by senior official Swarup Kulkarni who had told the House last month he was sent on compulsory leave a few years back as he had refused to approve files pertaining to Digi Thane. Additional municipal commissioner-1 Sandeep Malvi told the House the administration there was no enquiry done in the matter. The administration also later clarified to the House that the action taken on the official was disciplinary, which failed to convince Vaity who sought a probe in the matter. “The administration seems to be not transparent about the operations of the Digi-Thane projects and the incident which led to the official being sent on leave apparently for not approving certain projects under Digi-Thane. There has to be clarity if the official is guilty or was unnecessarily punished for not bowing down to unreasonable pressure from seniors. I will write to the anti-corruption department seeking a thorough probe in the same,” said Vaity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/probe-digi-thane-projects-following-allegations-says-shiv-sena/articleshow/87786634.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||India||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh score high on SMART police perception index; Bihar, UP lowest||NEW DELHI: Almost seven years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the call for SMART policing, a survey done by a thinktank to gauge public perception of the police has found the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to have the highest ‘SMART policing index’ score of 8.11 and 8.1 respectively on a scale of 1-10, even as UP and Bihar returned the lowest score of 5.81 and 5.74 respectively. SMART is an acronym for what the police in the country need to reform into. While 'S' stands for strict and sensitive police, ‘M’ expands to modern and mobile, ‘A’ alert and accountable, ‘R’ reliable and responsive and ‘T’ techno-savvy and trained. The SMART policing index was worked out by Indian Police Foundation (IPF) - a Delhi-based thinktank set up by eminent citizens including serving and retired police officers, civil servants, academics and lawyers etc – for each individual state or Union territory on the basis of respondents’ views along 10 indicators – six linked to competence, three to values and one to public trust. Telangana scored best on perception score of police sensitivity, strictness and good behaviour, accessibility, police responsiveness and technology adoption. Andhra Pradesh had the highest perception score in helpful and friendly policing, unbiased and lawful policing, police accountability and public trust in the police. Kerala returned the highest perception score on integrity and corruption-free service, while Bihar had the lowest score for this indicator. The survey questionnaire, comprising 10 queries, was filled via online mode and later through offline mode, even though almost 2/3rd of the 1.61 lakh valid responses were received online. Interestingly, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana together accounted for 56.48% of the total responses, while bigger states like UP returned only 2,868 and 1,615 responses respectively. "After consulting social scientists and statistical experts, IPF decided to limit itself to separately determining the smart policing index for each state and UT, and refrain from ranking the states based on their individual indices," IPF president and CEO N Ramachandran, a former IPS officer, said at a press conference here to release the survey findings. "We believe that the insights from the survey will help police to improve legitimacy, restore confidence and trust, even as they strive to progressively bring about a transformation in policing," said Ramachandran. IPF chairman Prakash Singh, the former BSF DG on whose plea SC had laid down the roadmap for key police reforms, added this was first of the series of annual, longitudinal surveys to assess public perception of the police. The survey found that respondents who had no previous contact with the police were more likely to have negative perceptions about the police, than those who had had such previous interactions. "This indicates perceptions may be formed based on secondary sources and hearsay, and building of relationships by police with the public earns the latter’s confidence and trust," said Ramachandran. Apart from numerical data, IPF received 25,761 messages, comments and suggestions. Some were radical and even abusive, but then there were sensible messages that IPF sees as a good barometer of the issues agitating the minds of citizens. Some spoke about police interventions in domestic violence issues, insisting that the woman should have her course of justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/telangana-andhra-pradesh-score-high-on-smart-police-perception-index-bihar-up-lowest/articleshow/87787831.cms||Bharti Jain

Chandra said while the government is keen to support the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) industry in a big way, and intends to set up a national centre for excellence, it would also like content producers to use the theme of 75 Years of Indian Independence to produce content on Indian war heroes and freedom fighters that can be appreciated by the youth and is inspirational. The I&B secretary also said the Centre is looking beyond creating a government institution to promote the M&E industry. “In future, we should develop institutions like the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis, as has been done for the AVGC industry. We should spawn these throughout the country so that the necessary skills are developed, with the industry as a partner,” he said. Chandra also assured the industry stakeholders that the government is keen to be a facilitator and will endeavour to support the media and entertainment industry in every way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/produce-content-in-new-formats-like-animation-for-youth-ib-secy-at-cii-summit/articleshow/87787834.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||Minnesota man charged in killing of couple at Fargo factory||FARGO: A 35-year-old man with a long criminal record was charged Thursday with three counts of murder in the shooting deaths at a Fargo factory of a man and a woman who was eight months pregnant.  Anthony Reese Jr of Moorhead, Minnesota, is charged with killing Richard Pittman, April Carone and Carone's unborn child after an argument Wednesday at Composite America. He made his first court appearance Thursday, where a judge set his bond at $2 million and scheduled a preliminary hearing for December 16.  If convicted of murder, Reese faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. His public defender at Thursday's hearing, Eric Thomas, told The Associated Press he couldn't comment on the case while it's ongoing.  Factory workers told police that Pittman and Carone were dating and that she was expecting a baby girl who they planned to name Layla.  Police responded to multiple 911 calls reporting an active shooter Wednesday afternoon and discovered the victims. Carone died at the scene and Pittman was declared dead at a hospital.  Authorities said Pittman, Reese and another employee, Pourdeye Kegbeh, had been involved in an altercation on the factory floor prior to the shooting. Management ordered Reese to leave the business but he returned a short time later and confronted Pittman, Kegbeh said.  Kegbeh told police that Reese pulled out a handgun and shot Pittman numerous times before he turned and fired multiple shots at Carone.  Police said Reese then drove to the Fargo Police Department and turned himself in. He told officers that he had ditched the gun in a residential neighborhood, and investigators later found the 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Detectives also recovered multiple 9mm cartridge casings at the crime scene.  The shooting wasn't Reese's first brush with the law. In 2014, he was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in Benton County, Minnesota, and he has to register as a sex offender until 2029. He also has convictions for domestic assault, illegal gun possession, selling and possessing illegal drugs and violating no contact orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/minnesota-man-charged-in-killing-of-couple-at-fargo-factory/articleshow/87787895.cms||---

There were certain aspects that were delaying the project which have now been cleared,” said Awhad while talking to the media following a review of several infrastructure projects in Kalwa, Mumbra suburbs. The 550-metre-long skywalk is being constructed at a cost of Rs 21 crores and will connect Thane station with Vitawa in Kalwa. The proposed skywalk, planned years ago, would run parallel to the railway tracks and over the Ulhas river. The skywalk is planned to give citizens a faster and cheaper alternative to reach Thane station and also reduce mishaps as presently commuters walk down the tracks. Meanwhile, one of the arms over the ambitious third bridge over Kalwa creek will be extended till Patni grounds which will ensure there will be no traffic congestions at Vitawa subway. Also, a parallel road connecting the entry point to Kalwa beyond Kalwa group connecting Atmaram Patil chowk near Kalwa Reti bunder will also be constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/crucial-infrastructure-works-to-begin-in-kalwa/articleshow/87786704.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Goa||ISL preview: With gap in quality between teams getting narrower, ISL-8 promises to hold an unusual competitive edge||When the CIES Football Observatory compared 72 top division leagues across the world, they discovered that the Colombian Categoria Primera A was the most balanced. Over 126 matches, it had the lowest proportion of uneven fixtures where a team won by at least three goals. Next on the list of the Switzerland-based research group was India. Only 5.3 percent of the games in the Indian Super League (ISL) were uneven. Elsewhere in Asia, the Arabian Gulf League in United Arab Emirates (22.2%) and Qatar Stars League (21.7%) stood out as lopsided competitions. As the next edition of the ISL kicks off in Goa on Friday inside a bio-secure bubble, many believe this could be the most competitive yet. “This is going to be very exciting because of the quality of the teams,” Jamshedpur FC coach Owen Coyle told TOI. “There is not going to be a lot between them. I truly believe that.” Part of the reason for its “competitiveness” is the salary cap which does not permit clubs to spend more than Rs 16.5 crore on player salaries. Accountants do find a way past that cap, but this season the gap between the top teams and those at the bottom is likely to be narrow. Take Odisha FC, for example. They finished at the bottom last season winning just two of their 20 matches but have responded by signing the second most expensive player in Brazilian striker Jonathas de Jesus Kerala Blasters made it to two finals in the first three years but have not tasted playoff success for the last four editions. They now look stronger than ever with an attacking lineup as good as anyone else. Coyle’s own Jamshedpur have made heads turn with success in pre-season friendlies, while even SC East Bengal, despite the limited time that they had due to a tussle between club and investor, are looking good enough to give others a run for the points. “It’s not like before where three or four teams are high-performing,” said FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando. “When I see the players, in my point of view, this is going to be very competitive. There are not just 11 teams. These are teams who can all qualify.” In a league where teams habitually change players and coaches, Goa have managed to buck the trend. No wonder Ferrando, now into his second season at the club with the same set of players, is being backed to do even better than last season’s semifinal appearance when they lost against eventual champions Mumbai City on penalties. Others like ATK Mohun Bagan are just as strong, never mind the departure of defender Sandesh Jhingan to Croatia or their off-field travails. Last season’s finalists were forced to go from south to north in search of accommodation and cancelled training on the eve of the opener due to the long travel. “It’s too tiring,” said one of the senior players. What about Mumbai? The defending champions have a new coach in Des Buckingham but the same philosophy that Sergio Lobera instilled and helped them win a rare double. Hyderabad FC have quietly strengthened themselves with some tried and tested foreigners from ISL. Having missed out by just two points, Manolo Marquez’s boys should now fancy their chances of making the final four stage. After missing out on a playoff spot, former champions Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC will be keen to prove a point. They’ve made significant additions and hired coaches who have set the bar high. All eyes, though, will be on Khalid Jamil, who previously had an interim role at NorthEast United and is now the first Indian head coach to take charge of an ISL team on an official basis. Till recent seasons, Indian coaches were not allowed to take charge. Jamil changed that perception, proved himself last season and took NorthEast to the playoffs, against the odds. Can he do it again?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-preview-with-gap-in-quality-between-teams-getting-narrower-isl-8-promises-to-hold-an-unusual-competitive-edge/articleshow/87787906.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The ministry of panchayati raj (MoPR) is planing to write to the states to rid the hurdles and notify the rules over the next few months. The provisions of the Pesa Act seeks to empower local self - governments in the Schedule V areas of the country to help safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of the tribal communities. The draft model Pesa rules had been circulated by (MoPR) in 2009 to the 10 Pesa states. Six states — Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Telangana — have notified their state Pesa rules. The remaining four (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha) on Thursday informed the ministries of panchayati raj and tribal affairs that they are in the process of considering these rules of implementation. The update of the challenges being faced was shared by them at the national conference organised by these ministries to review Pesa implementation and measures to enhance welfare of tribals. Minister of rural development and panchayati raj, Giriraj Singh and tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda made it clear that there was no scope for any further delay. At the conference, both ministers said that if required they will take up this matter with the governors, chief ministers and ministers of these four states. The deliberations and outcomes of this conference will be placed at the minister-level conference, proposed to be held in January next year. The tribal affairs minister asserted the need for a convergence model for schemes of the ministries of panchayati raj, tribal affairs and environment, forest and climate change that apply to tribals. Outlining the spirit of Pesa, Munda said, "Pesa seeks to protect the principle of Jal, Jungle , Jameen (Water, forest and land) for the tribals. The strengthening and empowerment of the Gram Sabhas is imperative under Pesa." He also stressed upon the need to prevent land alienation of tribals for which a well organised data base must be maintained and the need for convergence between Pesa and the execution of the Forest Rights Act. Singh said that while preparing the gram panchayat development plan (GPDP), they should create a new model of development for the tribal community through convergence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-asks-laggard-states-to-expedite-notification-of-pesa/articleshow/87787932.cms||Ambika Pandit

The anti-corruption wing stumbled upon the demonetised notes while conducting a raid at the house of Rusinath Baral, an assistant executive engineer (RD division) of Ranpur in Nayagarh district following allegations that he amassed disproportionate assets (DA). “When we were searching his residence, we found the banned Rs 500 notes worth Rs 35,000 under a bed cushion. We strongly suspect it was his black money,” a vigilance officer said. Further search led to recovery of huge movable and immovable assets to the tune of about Rs 2.51 crore owned by Baral and his kin. The vigilance found a 3-storey building at Chandrasekharpur in Bhubaneswar, a single storey house in Dhenkanal, seven plots at Sadangi in Dhenkanal district and two plots in Bhubaneswar. The vigilance officials also seized Rs 1.30 lakh in cash from his home. Baral has been detained. Same day, the vigilance carried out three more operations against corrupt officers. Assets worth over Rs 1.3 crore were detected in the name of a section officer of the office of Sonepur sub-collector. A revenue inspector was arrested in Sambalpur for allegedly accepting Rs 15,000 bribe. Another revenue inspector was arrested in Koraput district for allegedly accepting Rs 10,000 bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/five-years-after-demonetisation-scrapped-notes-seized-from-odisha-engineers-home/articleshow/87786751.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||India||Abhijit Banerjee flags methodology used for Global Hunger Index rankings||NEW DELHI: India should not take the drop in its Global Hunger Index ranking "seriously" as the methodology used for the exercise is 'model-based' and not survey-based, renowned economist and Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee said on Thursday. Addressing virtually an event organised by industry body CII, Banerjee further said the credit mechanism does not work well in India as banks do not want to give loans to small and medium enterprises.  According to the 2021 Global Hunger Index (GHI), prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hungerhilfe, India has slipped to the 101st position out of 116 countries, from its 2020 position of 94th.  It is now behind its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.  "I think they are essentially model-based. I don't think there is any survey that says anything.  "We should not take those numbers (GHI) seriously, they put them out, but they have no idea where they are getting them," he said while replying to a question on the dip in India's rank in the Global Hunger Index.  Banerjee said there was no on ground survey by publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report.  "This (GHI) is coming entirely from small surveys here and there. But scaled surveys that we need, had not happened, so we don't really know," he opined.  Banerjee, currently a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in countries like Ghana and Kenya there is no way to get these (undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting) data.  "All model based, it's sort of calculation of this much income and then in India, this means these people will be pushed below the poverty line... phone based survey, which have their own biases because many people don't have phones," he observed.  The GHI score is calculated on four indicators -- undernourishment, child wasting (share of children under age of five who are wasted i.e. who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition), child stunting (children under age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (mortality rate of children under age of five).  Banerjee further noted that there was a demand shortage in India, especially coming from the low income population in the last five years.  "Under MNREGA, the government should announce that people will have an option of 150 days of wage employment if they want to...I think they won't use it if the economy recovers, but people will feel confident to spend.  "Giving people the confidence to spend, is what the small scale industry sector needs," he said.  The renowned economist emphasised that even a short term demand stimulus would help.  "Shrinking of small scale industries has benefited the formal sector," he added.  Talking about high inflation in India, Banerjee said inflation has always been complicated in the country.  Referring to a recent SBI report, which had said about 80% of the economy is now formal following the digitisation drive and the pandemic, he said the number does not make sense.  "...that number, if we take it seriously, which I loathe to do, would be so depressing but that would mean we have lost something like 20% GDP or something for that to happen.  "GDP must have gone down by that much. If the other sector has not grown by... so much, and one sector has dropped by 30 percentage of GDP, you see what that means, you get something like 15-20 per cent drop in GDP net," he pointed out.  Banerjee said he hopes this has not happened and stressed that data collection in India really needs to improve.  According to the SBI Research report, the digitisation drive and pandemic-induced emergence of the gig economy have led to a faster formalisation of the economy, with the share of the informal sector shrinking to just 15-20 per cent in 2021 from 52.4% in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/abhijit-banerjee-flags-methodology-used-for-global-hunger-index-rankings/articleshow/87787964.cms||---

The survey also shows that 57% in the same age group and 45% of people above 40 years of age feel that education is the biggest determinant of success. Nearly 58% of the youth believe that children today experience more pressure to succeed. "The Changing Childhood Project", is a first-of-its-kind survey to ask multiple generations for their views on the world and what it is like to be a child today. It surveyed more than 21,000 people in the 15-24 and 40 years and above age group in 21 countries in early 2021. Respondents from India were surveyed before the second deadly wave of Covid-19 this year. "In India, where an overwhelming number of the world’s young people reside, it is heartening to see the optimism and value attached to education," said Yasumasa Kimura, Unicef India representative. The survey shows that 64 per cent of young people aged 15-24 in India are likely to believe that the world is becoming a better place. This was higher than the average across 21 countries, which was 57%. However, the survey found half the young people polled from India were concerned about personal information being collected when using the internet. 60% also believe that meeting someone in person after meeting them online is very risky. The report shows that 55% younger people have heard of climate change compared to 42% older people – the biggest overall gap across 21 countries. The younger generation is much more likely to blame companies for climate change. 65% of young respondents from India believe that it is very important for politicians to listen to children’s voices. Almost 57% of young people believe the legal marrying age for women should be older than 18 years. The survey findings from India also show some perception gaps between younger and older respondents. For instance 57% of young people use the internet daily, compared to 27% of older people – the fourth largest generation difference among 21 countries. Besides India, the other countries surveyed include Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, United Kingdom, Ukraine, USA and Zimbabwe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/73-indian-youth-in-unicef-poll-say-quality-of-education-has-become-better-now-than-in-past/articleshow/87788001.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha signs MoU with Save Life Foundation to improve road safety||BHUBANESWAR: The state transport authority (STA) on Thursday signed an MoU with Delhi-based Save Life Foundation (SLF), an NGO working in the field of road safety, to reduce accident deaths. SLF has been tasked to identify accident-prone stretches, find out the causes of accidents and recommend remedial measures to create ‘zero fatality corridors’ in the state. STA said the MoU aims at reducing road deaths in the next three years. "Road safety is a very high priority area for us. SLF has improved road safety situation in various states. I am sure our combined efforts will bring good results in Odisha as well. Once the remedial measures are suggested and implemented, we hope the fatalities will be reduced by around 30-50 per cent,” STA chairman and transport commissioner Arun Bothra said. Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO of SLF, said his agency will work on the ‘zero-fatality corridor’ model through a 360 degree intervention across engineering, emergency trauma care, enforcement and education. The development came close on heels of chief minister Naveen Patnaik launching a road safety initiative under the banner of Rakshak- a first responder’s training programme on November 10. At least 30,000 volunteers, staying or working at eateries and different business establishments located near accident-prone spots, are being trained as first responders to road accidents. It must be noted that road accident-related deaths have increased by nearly 21% from 3,931 deaths in 2014 to 4,738 in 2020 in the state. This despite the Supreme Court committee on road safety directing the state government to bring it down by 50% by 2020. According to the transport department, the accident fatality rate increased abnormally by 25% in the first half 2021 as compared to the first six months of 2020, despite the Covid-induced lockdown. Wary of an alarming rise in road accident deaths in Odisha, the centre recently urged the chief minister Naveen Patnaik to consider adopting a road safety model of Tamil Nadu, which has succeeded in reducing accident fatalities by 54% in the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-signs-mou-with-save-life-foundation-to-improve-road-safety/articleshow/87787062.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The religious event has become an eye-feast to the devotees who were left surprised in a manner it was organized to mark the holy Karthika Pournami. The event was supervised by the founding trustees of the temple PV Krishna Reddy and Sudha Reddy couple. Temple committee members P. Vira Reddy, Vijayalakshmi, Kommareddy Bapi Reddy, Vijaya Bhaskaramma couple, Sumalata, Prasanna and other family members, relatives, villagers, devotees especially women were present in large numbers.  Temple trustees Krishna Reddy and Sudha Reddy handed over the necessary pooja items to the participants of the Koti Vattika Dipotsavam. Archana and special pujas were performed early in the morning at the Mahakshetram ahead of the commencement of Koti Vattika Deepotsvam in the evening. According to the Vaikhanasa Bhagavatshastra at the Mahakshetram, Vedic scholars have organised the Koti Vattika Dipotsavam to mark the Karthika pournami in the month of Karthika. The temple trustees organize daily, partial, monthly, half yearly and annual festivals at the Mahakshetram. On special days like Karthika Pournami and Varalakshmi Vratam, it has become a tradition to organize special pujas seeking the divine support for the welfare of the people in the country and the state, especially around Dokiparru. Priests explained that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu were specially worshiped during the month of Karthika. “Kartikam means lamp. The lamp signifies the divine form of Lord and inner-self. If a single lamp is lit during the month of Karthika, it is as if crore lamps are lit. One should always keep their inner-consciousness lit to do good to the society,” observed the priests. They said that Koti Vattika Dipotsavam was celebrated to keep the devotees alert about their duties towards the God as well as the society. Temple premises was virtually sparkled with thousands of lamps lit by the devotees to mark the Karthika pournami. Temple and surroundings were specially decorated with colourful lights.

The exhumation order came in response to surging anger across Kashmir over the authorities’ initial refusal to hand over the civilians’ corpses to their families for the last rites. The bodies had been buried in Handwara by the police and were being moved to Srinagar, officials were quoted as saying by PTI. Apart from the families of the slain men, Opposition political parties, too, had demanded that the bodies be returned to the families for burial. The two civilians were Altaf Ahmad Bhat, the owner of the building in which the terrorists were hiding, and Mudasir Gul, a dentist by training who was running a call centre on the same premises. Gul, according to the authorities, had been aiding the militants. The J&K police chief, DGP Dilbag Singh, said the police was "open to corrections if anything has gone wrong". He told reporters that they would look into the demands of the families. "We will find out what happened in the Hyderpora encounter. We are for the safety of the people and will not shy away from a probe," the DGP said. The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), meanwhile, demanded a "judicial inquiry" into the killing of civilians in the Hyderpora encounter. It said the same administration could not "act as judge, jury and executioner" and that a judicial inquiry was needed. The police had said that Bhat had been killed in the crossfire and that Gul was an overground worker (for the terrorists), a claim rejected by Gul's family. The other two men killed were identified by the police as foreign terrorist Haidar and his local associate, Amir Ahmad of Banihal. Amir’s family, too, had contested the police claim that he was a terrorist. Srinagar deputy commissioner Ajaz Asad appointed ADC (Srinagar) Khurshid Ahmad Shah as the inquiry officer for the Hyderpora encounter and asked him to submit his report within 15 days. "It has been felt expedient to conduct a magisterial inquiry into the matter so as to ascertain the facts and circumstances related to the incident and the cause of death," the deputy commissioner’s order said. He said a case (FIR vide No. 193/2021) was registered on November 16 at Police Station Sadder, Srinagar "and is under investigation by an SIT". Meanwhile, the ADC (Srinagar) issued a general notice asking the general public or any person who had knowledge of the incident, and was willing to record his/ her statement or wanted to give any other information about the incident, to come to his office for recording of statements within 10 days. Bhat and Gul’s families had staged a sit-in protest in Srinagar demanding the return of the bodies but the protest had been dispersed by the police in the middle of the night. "I am grateful, and also thankful, to L-G Manoj Sinha for ordering a magisterial inquiry into the Hyderpora encounter. I am hopeful that the probe will be taken to its logical conclusion and the truth will come out under the supervision of L-G Sahib," Bhat’s brother, Abdul Majeed, said. "My brother has little children who want to see their father one last time," Majeed had said earlier. Gul’s wife, Humaira, who was there at the sit-in protest in Srinagar along with her 18-month-old daughter, said the police must come up with proof that her husband was an OGW. She said if this was proved, the "police can kill her along with her daughter and one would raise their voice then". National Conference vice-president and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, too, had led a sit-in protest at a local park at Sonwar, close to his Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar, against the government not handing over the bodies of the civilians killed. "I had decided not to stage a sit-in but to knock on other doors, but the way the families of the slain were treated yesterday (Wednesday) evening, I couldn’t control myself and decided to raise my voice," Omar said, adding, "The families were first called to the SP’s office, and then to the PCR, and then asked to wait for two-three days. So I had no option but to join the families in protest." He said that at this stage he has nothing to do with the inquiry ordered into the Hyderpora encounter. Asked about hybrid militants, the former CM said, "I have read so many intelligence reports, and I do watch happenings across the world, but I haven’t heard about hybrid militants. Someone should make me understand what it means," he said. Peoples Conference leaders had also staged massive protests in Srinagar over the killing of the civilians and had demanded that their bodies be immediately handed over to their families for burial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-orders-magisterial-probe-into-hyderpora-encounter-civilians-bodies-exhumed-after-outcry/articleshow/87788049.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Varanasi||Akhilesh Yadav must apologise for his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark: Sant Samiti||VARANASI: National general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (AKSS) Swami Jitendranand Saraswati on Thursday demanded an apology from Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav for his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark, telling him to “either express an apology to the seers’ fraternity or get ready to face their ire”. On Wednesday, in an apparent attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘saffron politics’ at a rally during the fourth phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ on Purvanchal Expressway at Pakhanpura area in Ghazipur, Akhilesh had reportedly called holy saffron-clad saints ‘chillumjeevi’ (users of pipe used for smoking tobacco or intoxicants) and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of one particular colour).” Swami Jitendranand said, “In his bid to target the BJP and its leadership, the SP chief has insulted the saffron-clad seers and their fraternity by terming them as ‘chillumjeevi’ and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of the same colour).” The Swami also defended chief minister Yogi Adityanath in view of the SP chief’s remark. “Yogi Ji is the head of one of the prime peeths of Sanatan Dharma which is worshipped and honoured since ancient times. Nobody has the right to victimize Yogi for the sake of dirty politics and just because he has become a chief minister,” said Swami Jitendranand. “The SP chief should immediately apologise for the remarks and avoid dragging seers in the political battlefield for petty electoral gains,” said Swami Jitendranand, cautioning Akhilesh that “he will have to face the ire of saffron-clad seers as they will go door-to-door to expose his views”. He added that the “Sant Samaj (seers’ community) will soon launch a campaign against the Samajwadis and Congress leaders targeting the seers’ fraternity for political gains”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhilesh-yadav-must-apologise-for-his-chillumjeevi-remark-sant-samiti/articleshow/87786743.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||India||PAGD demands judicial inquiry, says magisterial probe unacceptable as govt can’t act as ‘judge, jury & executioner’||SRINAGAR: The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) demanded on Thursday a "judicial inquiry" into the killing of civilians in the controversial "encounter" at Hyderpora. It said the magisterial inquiry ordered was unacceptable because "it is the same administration which killed and it cannot act as judge, jury and executioner". The PAGD, while demanding that the two civilians’ bodies be returned to their families for burial, said, "This is a constitutional right and not a favour." "We reject the magisterial inquiry… We demand a credible inquiry, and to our belief it can only be a judicial inquiry. Those who are responsible should be brought to book. This is our demand," PAGD spokesperson Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said after an alliance meeting at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah here. "Mehboobaji (PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti) could not come because she was placed under house arrest, which is unfortunate and condemnable," Tarigami, who is a leader of the CPM, said. "We have demanded in our separate statements that there should be a halt to such destructive incidents. This is not only our concern but of every citizen. The local citizen cannot feel secure in such a situation and there is continuous breach of law by law enforcers, which is unacceptable," he said, adding, "We can have differences of opinion on the political front, but whatever is happening, and in particular this grave tragedy, it remains the important issue for all of us (sic)." The PAGD demanded a judicial inquiry in a time-bound manner. "Those who have been killed cannot be brought back but their families and kin should get justice," he said, adding, "We want to ask questions of the government of India. Is killing innocent civilians necessary for national security, have we come to such a pass? This is our question," Tarigami said. Tarigami said a letter was being sent to the President of India and that the alliance was demanding "a credible inquiry". The PAGD said if its demand was not met, then "our parliamentarians, such as Farooq Sahib, Masoodi Sahib, and Mohammad Akhbar Lone will meet the President. They will take other opposition leaders into confidence and inform the President about the situation in Kashmir". "I want to tell that the government to stop, stop this," he said, adding, "This is a historical fact that when the glass is filled to capacity, water overflows, and the same is the case with patience. Don’t construe patience as silence. You are not gauging things in the right perspective. Irrespective of differences on the political front, we are together and won’t allow Kashmir to turn into a graveyard. This is our belief and this is our appeal to the government to listen to this voice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pagd-demands-judicial-inquiry-says-magisterial-probe-unacceptable-as-govt-cant-act-as-judge-jury-executioner/articleshow/87788096.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Thane||Thane civic body promises to waive property tax||THANE: The Thane general body on Thursday evening passed a resolution to waive off property tax for residential flats measuring up to 500 square feet. The proposal was moved by Shiv Sena corporator Ram Repale and was seconded by party colleague Vikas Repale. The move, timed ahead of the civic elections scheduled early next year, saw minimal resistance from all party netas who supported the same. Following majority netas supporting the proposal, mayor Naresh Mhaske announced the same will now be sent to the state government for implementation. “The Shiv Sena had promised Thane residents staying in houses measuring upto 500sft of tax waiver ahead of the 2017 polls. We had tried to implement the same earlier but are now positive of getting the same implemented by the state government. Once okayed, it will provide relief to lakhs of residents,” he said. Meanwhile, the administration said it will have to analyse the impact of the waiver, if implemented, on the civic treasury considering that a notable chunk of revenue comes from this segment. Interestingly, the House, on Thursday afternoon, had discussed the fragile financial condition of the corporation due to Covid impact with barely Rs 7 crore available in the kitty. A civic official said the volume of flats measuring till 500sft was notable and could possibly dent the corporation fortunes but said would wait till the approval came from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-civic-body-promises-to-waive-property-tax/articleshow/87786729.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The girl has also sought a compensation of Rs50 lakh. In the plea filed through advocate AK Preetha, the girl who belongs to the lower strata of the society and a member of a scheduled class said she was traumatized by the ‘public trial’ conducted by the civil police officer on Pink Patrol duty and had to seek medical treatment. She couldn’t sleep or attend online classes for around two weeks, the girl who is studying in third standard said in the plea. Following the ordeal, she was admitted as an inpatient at a mental health centre at Thiruvananthapuram on September 4th and had to take counselling sessions, as per the petition. Seeking action against the police officer and compensation, it is alleged in the girl’s plea that the state government and the police department engaged in a concerted effort to protect the police officer. The girl was waiting at Moonnumukku near Attingal along with her father to see giant machinery of ISRO being transported by road when the police officer who was in the Pink Police patrol car parked nearby accused her of stealing a mobile phone from the car. The officer tried to disrobe her and her father in the guise of a search and threatened to take them to the police station for a search, it is alleged. While putting them on ‘public trial’, the officer also insulted and intimidated them, the plea said while pointing out that a police official deputed to aid women and children acted in such a highhanded manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pink-patrol-horror-eight-year-old-seeks-rs-50-lakh-as-compensation/articleshow/87786987.cms||Mahir Haneef
---||Delhi||Diners rejoice, restaurateurs relieved, as Delhi restaurants gear up to remain open till 3am||Delhi restaurateurs say the new timelines will bring much relief to the industry ravaged by the pandemic, while diners add that it will improve their dining experience considerablyHow many times has it happened that you are out for dinner and by the time you’re ready for your meal after drinks, it’s already time for the last order? While most diners have complained about the “limited dining hours in Delhi”, restaurateurs have also argued that the 1am deadline was a deterrent for those planning an evening out after office hours on weekdays. To the relief of both parties, in July this year, the excise policy for 2021-22 – announced by the Excise Department on its website – stated that bars in hotels, restaurants and clubs will now be allowed to operate till 3am. The new policy came into effect on November 17, and restaurants are gearing up to remain open till 3am once the paperwork is sorted. Says restaurateur Rahul Singh, “It is already stated in the policy, which is in public domain, that restaurants can remain open till 3am, but we are just waiting for our new licences to reflect the new timings.” Huge relief for an industry impacted by pandemic: RestaurateursCalling it a progressive and much-needed step forward, restaurateurs say that the new timings will help the industry – that is finally getting back on its feet – gain more revenue after suffering losses for almost a year during the pandemic. “The extension in timeline is a huge relief even for diners. I would sometimes ponder over how something that is legal until midnight can suddenly become illegal post that hour? In today’s work-from-anywhere world, where shops are open 24/7, regulations need to keep up with the times. The new timeline will allow consumers to unwind in safer and licensed premises. Delhi is the most-visited city in India and needs to have a vibrant nightlife that caters to global tourists as well. At the same time, Delhiites should not be forced to gulp down drinks in their cars due to a clock monitoring them. The extended timings will also bring relief to the sector which has been ravaged by the pandemic,” says Rahul. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra, who owns multiple outlets in NCR, adds, “This (time extension) is in sync with the best tourist destinations in the world. It will help all stakeholders and aid in making Delhi one of the finest tourist destinations in the country.” Akshay Anand, owner of a restaurant, bar and nightclub, says that out of the many changes that the new excise policy will bring, “the two most-awaited are extension in timelines and the lowering of the drinking age in Delhi, as this will change the nightlife scenario in the city.” “On weekdays, and even weekends, people like to step out late and enjoy their evening without bothering about it being already time for the last order. The timing extension has come at just the right time for us, as it will help businesses, and also guests,” says restaurateur Sahil Sambhi. Extended timelines mean we’ll no longer have to hurry, can enjoy relaxed dining experience: DinersMost diners thought that restaurants’ operational hours in Delhi would change as soon as the new excise policy came into effect. They add that while they do not understand much about licences and business technicalities, this is a change that even they are looking forward to. “Most people in Delhi resort to drinking in their cars because they think that by the time they leave their workplace and drive to a restaurant, they will be left with little time to spend at the establishment. The extension of timings by just two hours will make a huge difference to the dining experience. After all, who wants to reach a restaurant at 10 pm, only to be told to place the last order at midnight?” says Namita Khanna, a resident of Pitampura. Ashish Mehra, a resident of Saket, adds, “As someone who finishes work mostly at 10pm and also works on weekends, I hardly have a social life. But now at least I will have the option to go out and have a few hours to enjoy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diners-rejoice-restaurateurs-relieved-as-delhi-restaurants-gear-up-to-remain-open-till-3am/articleshow/87784386.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||World||Black pastors rally outside trial over Arbery's killing||BRUNSWICK: Hundreds of pastors both rallied and prayed Thursday at the Georgia courthouse where three white men are on trial in the killing of Ahmed Arbery, gathering in response to a defense lawyer's bid to keep Black ministers out of the courtroom.  As testimony resumed inside the Glynn County courthouse, with its four huge columns, arched windows and shaded lawn, a group of mostly Black ministers gathered outside - a sea of dark suits and white collars.  Many carried signs reading, "Black pastors matter", and some wore buttons with Arbery's picture and the hashtag they were using for the case, "#JusticeForAhmaud". A vendor sold T-shirts under one tent while a woman under another offered water and snacks and asked people to put donations in a pickle jar.  The Rev. Al Sharpton announced the rally after a defense attorney intensified frustrations in the coastal Georgia community of Brunswick when he said he didn't want "any more Black pastors" sitting in the courtroom with Arbery's family.  As the crowd grew outside, the Rev. Jesse Jackson once again joined Arbery's family in the courtroom.  The Rev. Gregory Edwards was broadcasting a Facebook Live video back to his friends in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he is pastor of the Resurrected Life Community Church, United Church of Christ. As soon as the call for pastors to come to Brunswick went out, Edwards said, he rearranged his schedule to fly down.  "I would have walked," said Edwards, who also runs a multifaith, multiracial community organizing group. Edwards said he cried when he saw the video of the 25-year-old Black man's shooting death and thought of his three Black adult sons.  "Through technology we have been forced to bear witness to the public executions of our Black brothers and sisters," Edwards said.  A group of businesses in Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County joined together to provide a lunch of free barbecue sandwiches, shrimp and side dishes before the pastors rallied. Organiser Mike Mally said the group wanted to show that the community was united, not divided by race.  "We figured this was a good thing to do with all these visitors," Mally said.  Cellphone video of Arbery's death on February 23, 2020, leaked online about two months later, deepening a national outcry over racial injustice. The defence contends Arbery was killed in self-defense.  The man who shot Arbery, Travis McMichael, testified on Thursday that Arbery did not speak, show a weapon or threaten him in any way before he raised his shotgun and pointed it at him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/black-pastors-rally-outside-trial-over-arberys-killing/articleshow/87788329.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||YSRCP named MLC Koyye Mosenu Raju as candidate for legislative council chairman post||AMARAVATI: YSRCP named MLC Koyye Mosenu Raju as its candidate for legislative council chairman post. Mosenu Raju filed his papers little after the release of notification for the election of the council chairman on Thursday. Mosenu Raju is most likely to be declared elected unopposed on Friday as TDP had not fielded its candidate after dip in the party’s strength in the Upper House. Although, Mosenu Raju is the first-time legislator, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy decided to make him as chairman in order to ensure a dalit leader preside the Upper House. The post of chairman fell vacant following the retirement of MA Shariff of TDP as council member in May. Mosenu Raju, who hails from Kovvur in West Godavari district, was nominated to the state legislative council last year under the Governor’s quota. He has been a long-time loyalist of YSR family and contested as congress candidate from Kovvur assembly constituency in 2009 elections. He, however, lost the election to the TDP nominee TV Ramarao.  Although, he has been with YS Jagan since he floated YSRCP in 2011, Raju could not get the chance to contest assembly elections held in 2014 and 2019. As a reward to his loyalty, Jagan initially brought him to council and subsequently named him as chairman.  Mosenu Raju’s nomination was proposed by fellow legislators Balli Kalyan Chakravarthi, Duvvada Srinivas and Gangula Prabhakara Reddy. Raju handed over the nomination papers to legislature secretary Balakrishnamacharyulu. “It is the blood of YSR family to recognize and reward the loyal party activists,” said Raju after filing the papers. He said that he had never disappointed despite the fact that he had to wait for his turn for nearly a decade as he is aware of YS Jagan’s commitment to recognize the services of the sincere and dedicated activists.  Jagan has already made a Backward Classes leader – Tammineni Sitaram as the Speaker of the state assembly. It is reliably learnt that CM is contemplating to name either a muslim or Yadav MLC as deputy chairman of the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrcp-named-mlc-koyye-mosenu-raju-as-candidate-for-legislative-council-chairman-post/articleshow/87788284.cms||Samdani MN
---||World||Georgia's citizen's arrest law key to defense in Arbery case||A key defense argument for the three white men on trial in Georgia for killing Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger, is that they were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a Civil War-era law that was later repealed amid an uproar over the shooting. The defense can still use the repealed law in their defence because, as one lawyer said, it was "the law of the land" at the time of the February 2020 shooting. It was legal in Georgia for people to arrest someone where they had "reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion" that the person had just committed a felony. Lawmakers now limit citizen detainment to specific circumstances, such as shopkeepers who see a theft or restaurant workers seeing a "dine-and-dash". Most US states have codified some form of a law allowing citizen's arrests. Ira Robbins, a law professor at American University in Washington, wrote in an academic paper, "While recruiting citizens to aid in eradicating crime is a noble idea, strict safeguards are needed to prevent the law being abused."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/georgias-citizens-arrest-law-key-to-defense-in-arbery-case/articleshow/87788395.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Coast Guard rescues five fishermen from sinking fishing vessel||PANAJI: The Indian Coast Guard rescued five fishermen who were in distress in a sinking fishing trawler around 30 nautical miles off Goa’s coast on Thursday. The fishing vessel, which was taking on water in its engine room, was stabilised by the crew of ICGS Sujeet and then towed back to Mormugao harbour for repairs. The Indian Coast Guard received a distress message at 12:45pm and ICGS Sujeet, which was patrolling the area was asked to search and assist the Karnataka registered fishing trawler Madhava Mangala. “On receipt of the message, the ship immediately proceeded for rescue despite the rough seas and strong winds due to the low pressure persisting off Goa. The ship rendered assistance by sending the technical support team to the boat for deflooding the engine room and brought the fishing boat to floating condition,” said a coast guard official. ICGS Sujeet towed the fishing vessel through the rough weather conditions and brought the vessel towards Mormugao harbour, from where another vessel, the ICGS Amal, assisted in bringing the fishing boat alongside. IMD had warned of thunderstorms accompanied with lightning for the current week, and had advised fishermen not to venture out to sea. Squally weather with wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph are likely to prevail along the Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka coast, the IMD warning had said. Subsequently, with the help of MPT, the fishing vessel was shifted to Khariwada fishing jetty and later handed over to the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-coast-guard-rescues-five-fishermen-from-sinking-fishing-vessel/articleshow/87788407.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||World||Ahmaud Arbery murder trial: Killer testifies the Black man never threatened him||BRUNSWICK: The man who killed Ahmaud Arbery testified Thursday that Arbery did not speak, show a weapon or threaten him in any way before he raised his shotgun and pointed it at the 25-year-old Black man.  Under cross-examination by the prosecution on his second day of testimony, Travis McMichael said he was "under the impression" that Arbery could be a threat because he was running straight at him and he had seen Arbery trying to get into the truck of a neighbour who had joined in a pursuit of Arbery.  "All he's done is run away from you," prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said. "And you pulled out a shotgun and pointed it at him."  Cellphone video from the February 23, 2020, shooting - replayed in court Thursday - shows Arbery running around the back of McMichael's pickup truck after McMichael first points the shotgun while standing next to the open driver's side door. Arbery then runs around the passenger side as McMichael moves to the front and the two come face to face. The truck blocks any view of them until the first gunshot sounds.  McMichael's remarks Wednesday marked the first time any of the three white men charged with murder in Arbery's death speaking publicly about the killing. He testified Wednesday that Arbery forced him to make a split-second "life-or-death" decision by attacking him and grabbing his shotgun.  Dunikoski noted Thursday that's not what McMichael told police in an interview about two hours after the shooting occurred.  "So you didn't shoot him because he grabbed the barrel of your shotgun," Dunikoski said. "You shot him because he came around that corner and you were right there and you just pulled the trigger immediately."  "No, I was struck," McMichael replied. "We were face to face, I'm being struck and that's when I shot."  McMichael said he had approached Arbery because neighbours indicated something had happened down the road in his coastal Georgia neighborhood of Brunswick and he wanted to ask Arbery about it. Arbery was running in the neighbourhood at the time. He said Arbery stopped, then took off running when McMichael told him police were on the way.  Asked how many times he had previously pulled up behind strangers in the neighbourhood to ask them what they were doing there, McMichael said never.  "You know that no one has to talk to anyone they don't want to talk to, right," Dunikoski asked.  The prosecutor also pressed McMichael on why he didn't include some details of his testimony Wednesday in his written statement to police, namely the part about his telling Arbery police were on the way.  McMichael said he was "under stress, nervous, scared" at the time of his police interview and "probably being choppy".  "What were you nervous about," Dunikoski asked.  "I just killed a man," McMichael responded. "I had blood on myself. It was the most traumatic event of my life."  "You were nervous because you thought you were going to jail, right," Dunikoski asked.  "No. I gave them a statement," McMichael said.  McMichael and his father Greg armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck after he ran past their home from the house under construction. A neighbour, William "Roddie" Bryan, joined the chase in his own truck and recorded cellphone video. Arbery's killing deepened a national outcry over racial injustice after the video of his death leaked online. Meanwhile, outside the Glynn County courthouse Thursday, hundreds of pastors gathered in response to a defense lawyer's bid to keep Black ministers out of the courtroom.  The Rev. Jesse Jackson again joined Arbery's family in the courtroom, even as Bryan attorney Kevin Gough renewed his request to keep pastors like Jackson out. The issue was brought up outside the jury's presence, and Judge Timothy Walmsley declined to take it up again, noting he'd already rejected the same motion twice.  "The court's position is already in the record," Walmsley said.  Gough first asked the judge last week to remove the Rev. Al Sharpton from the court, saying the civil rights activist was trying to influence the jury, which is disproportionately white. The later called Gough's remarks "reprehensible."  Prosecutors contend there was no justification for McMichael and his father to arm themselves and chase Arbery when he ran past their Georgia home. The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery was a burglar because security cameras had recorded him several times in the unfinished house on their street.  Prosecutors say the men chased Arbery for five minutes and used their trucks to prevent him from fleeing their neighborhood before Travis McMichael shot him. They say there's no evidence that Arbery - who had enrolled at a technical college to study to become an electrician like his uncles - had committed any crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ahmaud-arbery-murder-trial-killer-testifies-the-black-man-never-threatened-him/articleshow/87788533.cms||---
---||World||Oklahoma governor spares death-row inmate in last-minute reprieve||Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt on Thursday halted the high-profile execution of death-row inmate Julius Jones, hours before he was scheduled to die for a 22-year-old murder, in which doubts about his guilt have been raised.  The governor's eleventh-hour reprieve followed the clemency recommendation of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which voted 3-1 on November 1 that Jones' sentence should be commuted to life in prison.  "After prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case, I have determined to commute Julius Jones' sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole," Stitt said in a statement.  The commutation was filed just over four hours before Jones was to die by lethal injection of a three-drug cocktail that his lawyers had challenged as inhumane in a separate last-minute appeal.  Jones, 41, was convicted of fatally shooting insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking in his driveway.  But his lawyers have cited evidence that he was home with his family when the murder occurred, which they said the jury never learned because his lawyers at the time failed to fully investigate it.  The case, which has drawn widespread interest from celebrities, including Kim Kardashian West, and anti-death penalty activists, sparked several protests and vigils across the state in the past two days.  A crowd outside the state penitentiary in McAlester where Jones was scheduled to be put to death erupted in cheers after learning of the governor's decision. Supporters chanted Jones' name, hugged and wiped away tears, video posted on Twitter showed.  Amanda Bass, an attorney for Jones, said she regretted that the governor did not adopt the board's recommendation to allow Jones the possibility of parole, but was grateful Stitt did not allow "an irreparable mistake" to take place.  "Governor Stitt took an important step today towards restoring public faith in the criminal justice system by ensuring that Oklahoma does not execute an innocent man," she said in a statement.  Jones was among five condemned inmates who won stays of execution from a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit US Court of Appeals on October 27.  But the US Supreme Court lifted the stays the next day, allowing the state to resume executions for the first time since 2015 by putting to death John Grant, another of the five inmates, hours later by lethal injection.  Witnesses said Grant convulsed and vomited before dying, while the state Department of Corrections said there were no complications.  Grant had been a plaintiff in a lawsuit set to go to trial next year challenging the three-drug protocol that ended his life as inhumane, but the state refused to postpone his execution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/oklahoma-governor-spares-death-row-inmate-in-last-minute-reprieve/articleshow/87788564.cms||---

The new enclave of 60 buildings in the Shi Yomi district, which did not exist in 2019, has come up “six km inside” the territory claimed by India “in the region between the LAC and the International Boundary” shown on Indian maps, as per NDTV, which accessed the satellite images. The Army, on being contacted by TOI, however, said the “location in question lies north of the LAC” as per the coordinates. An officer, in turn, added that “there has been no such construction within our perception of the LAC”. The 3,488-km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, is the demarcation that separates the Indian-controlled territory from the Chinese, though the two sides have “differing perceptions” of the line with Beijing refusing to “jointly clarify” it till now. China, of course, continues with its salami-slicing tactics to nibble away territory of its neighbours like India and Bhutan. This is the second such newly-constructed Chinese village that has recently come to light on the disputed territory in Arunachal Pradesh. The first was the 100-home village constructed on the banks of River Tsari Chu in the Upper Subansiri district last year, which lies 93 km west of the second enclave. The disputed area in the Upper Subansiri district has been under China’s “adverse occupation” since the Longju incident in 1959. As reported by TOI earlier, China has been building as many as 628 ‘xiaokang’ model border defence villages to fortify the borders of the Tibetan Autonomous Region with India and Bhutan over the last few years. Though a lot of these “dual-use” villages lie on the Chinese side of the LAC, some are on disputed territory with India. “After the Doklam face-off in 2017, China has also constructed some new villages on Bhutanese territory,” said an official. Responding to the Chinese village constructed in the Upper Subansiri district, the external affairs ministry on November 11 said, “China has undertaken construction activities in the past several years along the border areas, including those that it has illegally occupied over the decades. India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/second-chinese-village-along-arunachal-border-sat-images/articleshow/87788526.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court orders CBI probe into HZL divestment in 2002||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered registration of a regular case for a full-fledged CBI inquiry into alleged irregularities in the sale of 26% of government stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd to Sterlite, a subsidiary of the Vedanta Group, for Rs 445 crore in 2002 when its value was alleged to be Rs 39,000 crore. Faulting the closure of CBI’s preliminary enquiry (PE) despite listing numerous irregularities in the sale in the PSU while brushing aside the CAG’s critical report, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna ordered CBI to conduct full-fledged investigations into 18 suspicious grounds surrounding the deal. “There is sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26% disinvestment of HZL by the Union government in 2002. The CBI is directed to register a regular case and proceed in accordance with law. The CBI is directed to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this court. The aforesaid reports shall be submitted every quarter, or as otherwise directed by this court,” the bench said, while green-signalling the selling of the government’s residuary 29.5% stake in HZL, a decision taken in 2012 by the UPA government. The sale had taken place during the tenure of the Vajpayee government. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, “The Union government is a shareholder of HZL. The control and management of HZL does not vest with the Union government which has a residual stake of 29.54%. The shareholding of Sterlite Opportunities and Ventures Ltd (SOVL) stood increased to 64.92% after the exercise of the first call option in 2002. During the course of hearing, this court has been apprised by Sterlite that it does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the share purchase agreement. “It is in this backdrop that a decision has been taken by the Union government to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market. The Union government, in its capacity as a shareholder of HZL, is entitled to take such a decision. The fact that the Union government is amenable to the norms set out in Part III of the Constitution would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, so long as the process of disinvestment is transparent and the Union government is following a process which comports with law and results in the best price being realised for its shareholding.” The bench further said, “The Union government has stated through the solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the residual shareholding shall be divested in the open market and shall take place in accordance with the rules and regulations of SEBI to ensure that the best price is realized for the sale of the shareholding.” The Centre first divested 24.08% of its stake in HZL in 1991-92 when Manmohan Singh was finance minister and scripted the liberalisation of the Indian economy. In April 2002, the Centre had sold off 26% of its share for Rs 445 crore to SOVL. Sterlite acquired another 20% of HZL share from the open market, raising its shareholding in the erstwhile PSU to 46%. Under the 2002 shareholders’ agreement, which envisaged two call options, Sterlite exercised its first one for 18.92% of HZL equity in August 2003, which was transferred in its favour in November 2003. Sterlite became majority shareholder with 64.92% stake in HZL. In 2012, the Centre had decided to disinvest its residuary shareholding of 29.54% in HZL. On November 6, 2013, the CBI had initiated a PE investigation into suspected irregularities in the course of the disinvestment of the 26% equity holding of the Union government to Sterlite in 2002. The CBI special prosecutor, director of prosecution and the special director had concurred on closure of the PE. But the CBI additional director had insisted on converting the PE into a regular case. After scrutinising the reasons given for closure of PE, the bench said, “Upon perusal of the aforementioned reports and recommendations, it is our considered opinion that the disinvestment in 2002 evinces a prime facie case for registration of a regular case.” It then listed out 18 counts on which a regular case should have been registered, while agreeing with advocate Prashant Bhushan for a full fledged CBI probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-orders-cbi-probe-into-hzl-divestment-in-2002/articleshow/87788642.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Will back calls taken in national interest: PM to bankers||NEW DELHI: Weeks after the arrest of former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri rattled the financial sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to stand like a rock behind decisions taken by bankers in the national interest. “The ground is ready (to leapfrong). The most important thing that I have repeatedly said: I am with you, I am near you and I am for you on every step that is taken in national interest, with an honest intent. If there are mistakes when you take decisions that are honest, authentic and in the national interest, if you ever face difficulty, I am ready to stand like a wall. But we need to fulfil our responsibilities to take the country forward. Generations will not spare us if we waste the opportunity when there is such a strong foundation, a huge opportunity, with possibility that sky's the limit,” he said at a meeting of state-run bank executives. The statement comes amid concerns from top bankers following the arrest of Chaudhuri who had joined an asset reconstruction company (ARC) after his retirement from SBI. The ARC was trying to recover the dues from a loan given by SBI for a hotel project in Rajasthan. Chaudhuri is currently out on bail. Several bankers have expressed reservations over sanctioning loans, fearing adverse action by probe agencies after several years. The government has repeatedly sought to comfort them, even as it has gone about recovering loans from several defaulters and sought action in cases such as Kingfisher and Bhushan Steel, among others. Modi suggested that the efforts, including the enactment of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, had helped banks recover Rs 5 lakh crore extended as loans to defaulters. “In our attempt to bring back fugitive (economic offenders), we relied on policies, law and also used diplomatic channels. The message is very clear -- return to your country. We are continuing these efforts,” he said. The PM said the government expected around Rs 2 lakh crore of stressed assets to be resolved in the coming years following the establishment of the National Asset Reconstruction Company, with government guarantee of Rs 30,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-back-calls-taken-in-national-interest-pm-to-bankers/articleshow/87788714.cms||---
---||World||Biden says US considering diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics||WASHINGTON: The United States is considering a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics, President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, a move that would be aimed at protesting China's human rights record, including what Washington says is genocide against minority Muslims.  "Something we're considering," Biden said when asked if a diplomatic boycott was under consideration as he sat down for a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  A diplomatic boycott would mean that US officials would not attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.  A US decision not to send diplomats would be a rebuke of Chinese President Xi Jinping just days after Xi and Biden worked to ease tensions in a virtual summit, their first extensive talks since Biden took office in January.  Activists and members of Congress from both parties have been pressing the Biden administration to diplomatically boycott the event given that the US government accuses China of carrying out a genocide against Muslim ethnic groups in its western Xinjiang region, something that Beijing denies.  White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told a regular briefing on Thursday that US consideration of a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics was driven by concerns about human rights practices in Xinjiang province.  "There are areas that we do have concerns: human rights abuses," Psaki told reporters. "We have serious concerns."  "Certainly there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be," she said, while declining to provide a timeline for a decision.  "I want to leave the president the space to make decisions," she said.  Sources with knowledge of the administration's thinking have told Reuters there was a growing consensus within the White House that it should keep US officials away from the Games.  Last week, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington was talking to countries around the world about "how they're thinking about participation," but left a deadline for a decision unclear.  A bipartisan group of the US senators in October proposed an amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would prohibit the US State Department from spending federal funds to "support or facilitate" the attendance of US government employees at the Games.  Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also called for a diplomatic boycott, saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.  Some Republican lawmakers have been calling for a complete boycott of the Olympics.  Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas told a news conference on Thursday that a diplomatic boycott of what he called the "genocide Olympics" would be "too little, too late" and said no US athletes, officials, or US corporate sponsors should take part.  Nikki Haley, a Republican former US ambassador to the United Nations, also had called for a complete boycott, saying attending would send a message that America was willing to turn a blind eye to genocide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics/articleshow/87788755.cms||---
---||India||Government moots exempting exploratory oil drilling from prior CRZ nod||NEW DELHI: The environment ministry has proposed to exempt exploratory drilling operations for oil & natural gas and development of associated facilities in inter-tidal areas from “prior Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance”. A final decision in this regard will be taken once the ministry analyses comments and views of stakeholders after two months. The proposal was coincidentally issued as draft notification in a gazette on November 1 at a time when the country was negotiating its position on various issues, including use of fossil fuels and its fair share in carbon space at the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK. Stakeholders and experts are expected to share their views on this draft proposal with the ministry by the end of next month. The ministry had in January 2019 issued a notification declaring certain coastal stretches as CRZ, restricting setting up and expanding industries, operations and processes in the ecologically-fragile zone along coasts. However, now it proposed easing out such restrictions for oil & natural gas drilling operations, acting on requests of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, and other stakeholders, and subsequent recommendation of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA). “In post-liberalisation India, regulatory instruments like CRZ were introduced to balance the government’s economic priorities with the duty to protect environment and ensure social welfare. These instruments have always been amenable to introducing amendments in favour of specific projects or sectoral demands. However, the proposed changes to the CRZ is unapologetic about foregrounding the demand of the oil and gas industry as a justification, and contravenes the objective of the notification set up to ‘conserve and protect’ coastal stretches and ensure ‘livelihood security’ of fisher and other communities,” said Kanchi Kohli, senior researcher at the Delhi-based think-tank, Centre for Policy Research (CPR). “It is also important to locate this (proposed) amendment along with the series of changes made to the impact assessment and public hearings procedures for the oil and gas industry over the last two years. The sector has been recognised for production maximisation by the government. Amendments such as the one proposed can be understood to be responding to this call, and are not intended be based on studying the socio-ecological implications of this deregulation,” she added. The ministry through its draft has also proposed other changes in the CRZ notification, 2019, such as retaining “purely temporary and seasonal structures (shacks)” during the monsoon season with adequate precautions, and giving regulatory power to concerned coastal zone management authority in the state in case of giving clearances to stand-alone jetties, breakwaters, salt works, slipways and manual erosion control bunds. This move of decentralisation may speed up the process of creating such structures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-moots-exempting-oil-drilling-from-prior-crz-nod/articleshow/87788753.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Biden kicks off North American Leaders Summit with one-on-one meet with Trudeau, EV dispute discussion on cards||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden kicked off the North American Leaders Summit on Thursday with a one-on-one meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling their two countries' relationship one of the easiest in the early going of his presidency.  But as Biden and Trudeau sat down for talks, he also confirmed that the two leaders would discuss their differences over proposed electric vehicle tax incentives in his massive social services and climate bill that is causing concern in Ottawa.  "We're going to talk about that," Biden said. "It hasn't even passed yet in the House."  Biden was meeting later with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and the three leaders were also to meet together as they revived a near-annual summit that went dormant during President Donald Trump's time in office. Trudeau and Lopez Obrador were also meeting separately with Vice President Kamala Harris.  A provision in the United States spending plan would offer American consumers a $7,500 tax credit if they buy electric vehicles through 2026. The following year, only purchases of electric vehicles made in the US would qualify for the credit. The base credit would go up by $4,500 if the vehicle was made at a US plant that operates under a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement.  The union provision has sparked pushback from some non-union shops and lawmakers. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden "is pretty committed to the bill providing good-paying union jobs."  Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland on Wednesday called the incentive a clear violation of an updated trade agreement among the three countries that aimed to protect US jobs and products made in North America.  Trudeau, Freeland and other Canadian ministers met with the US officials on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to express their concerns. And Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said she raised concerns about the electric vehicle provision with secretary of state Antony Blinken last week.  Freeland said that for Canada, "Job one here in the US this week is to really make our American counterparts aware of the extent to which their current approach to this issue is a problem for Canada and to really explain to them that the way they have formulated this incentive really, really has the potential to become the dominant issue in our bilateral relationship."  As Biden, Trudeau and Lopez Obrador resume the tradition of the North America Leaders' Summit, the three allies also face deep differences on migration and climate issues.  There's "not that much in common between them, at least in their vision for what they want for their countries," said Kenneth Frankel, president of the Canadian Council for the Americas. "Not just what they want for their countries, but what they can deliver for their countries."  Thursday's meetings at the White House marks the first trilateral get-together for North American leaders since a June 2016 gathering of Trudeau, Barack Obama and Enrique Pena Nieto in Ottawa. The gatherings took a hiatus under former president Donald Trump who feuded with Trudeau and Nieto during his tenure.  Biden has made some progress in repairing relations with the US neighbors after the turbulent Trump years. But many significant strains remain - and some new ones have emerged.  Mexico's priorities heading into the summit were to obtain concrete advances on immigration and more equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.  The tradition of three-way meetings started when George W Bush played host to Mexico's Vicente Fox and Canada's Paul Martin in 2005 for talks at his ranch in Waco, Texas.  Biden has already held separate virtual meetings with Trudeau in February and Lopez Obrador in March.  The US and Canada, meanwhile, have expressed frustration that Lopez Obrador has failed to get on board with global efforts to curb climate emissions. The Mexican president skipped this month's UN climate summit in Glasgow.  Lopez Obrador's government, for its part, wants promised US development funds for the Northern Triangle countries of Central America to be firmed up. The Mexican leader continues to press the US to fund an expansion of his tree planting program to Central America.  Mexico has worked with the United States - under both Trump and Biden - to control migrant flows and assist in returning migrants to Central America. The two countries are still negotiating the court-ordered re-implementation of a Trump-era policy known as Remain in Mexico, which forced asylum seekers to wait out their U.S. asylum process in Mexico. Psaki said that the policy was not expected to be a major topic of discussions at Thursday's meeting.  Lopez Obrador has also mentioned on multiple occasions his interest in the U.S. government expanding its temporary work visa program so more Mexicans and Central Americans can fill the demand for labor in the U.S. The temporary workers in turn could have access to the higher pay they seek in the U.S. without becoming part of the illegal immigration flow.  Arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his government would focus on three issues: the pandemic, economic integration and immigration. On immigration, Ebrard said Mexico would try to rally support for two of Lopez Obrador's signature social programs - tree planting and youth job opportunities - to reduce the push factors of migration. Ken Salazar, the US ambassador to Mexico, recently expressed "serious concerns" about the Mexican government's attempts to limit competition in the electrical power sector.  Trudeau and Biden are also expected to discuss the future of an oil pipeline that crosses part of the Great Lakes and is the subject of rising tension over whether it should be shut down. Biden is caught in a battle over Enbridge's Line 5, a key segment of a pipeline network that carries Canadian oil across the U.S. Midwest.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and Biden ally, has demanded closure of the 68-year-old line because of the potential for a catastrophic rupture along a 4-mile section (6.4 kilometers) in the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. The Biden administration has not taken a position but is under increasing pressure to do so.  Canada last month invoked a 1977 treaty that guarantees the unimpeded transit of oil between the two nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-kicks-off-north-american-leaders-summit-with-one-on-one-meet-with-trudeau-ev-dispute-discussion-on-cards/articleshow/87788915.cms||---
---||World||Divided House debates Democrats' expansive social, climate bill||WASHINGTON: A divided House finally launched debate Thursday on Democrats' expansive social and environment bill, with party leaders hoping that cost estimates expected from Congress' top fiscal analyst would nail down moderate lawmakers' votes and allow passage by week's end.  Two weeks after centrists' objections forced Democrats to delay the measure, the Bill began moving amid optimistic signs from leaders and lawmakers that their divisions were all but resolved - for now. Facing uniform Republican opposition, Democrats can lose no more than three votes to prevail in the House.  The package, a top priority for President Joe Biden, would bolster child care assistance, create free preschool, curb seniors' prescription drug costs and beef up efforts to slow climate change.  Biden and other Democratic leaders have said the 10-year, $1.85 trillion measure would pay for itself, largely through tax increases on the wealthy, big corporations and companies doing business abroad.  A cost estimate on the bill, promised by Friday from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, was expected to show a modestly higher price tag and deficits of perhaps $200 billion over the coming decade. Early signs were that those differences were unlikely to derail the legislation, which exceeds 2,100 pages.  "Each of these investments on its own will make an extraordinary impact on the lives of American families," said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., ticking off the bill's initiatives. Noting that savings would come from higher levies on the rich and corporations, he added, "It's a helluva deal."  Republicans said the legislation would damage an economy already racked by inflation, give tax breaks to some wealthy taxpayers and make government bigger and more intrusive. Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Budget Committee's top Republican, used alliteration from Biden's name for the measure - Build Back Better - to mock it.  "Bankrupts the economy. Benefits the wealthy. And it builds the Washington machine," Smith said.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she was hoping the chamber would vote on the measure later Thursday, reflecting Democratic plans to approve the measure before leaving for a weeklong holiday break. "This is going to be a wonderful Thanksgiving," she said.  The debate came with Democrats hoping to move toward delivering a badly needed victory for Biden. For months, the bill has been delayed by infighting between party moderates and progressives over the measure's cost and the policies it should include.  Biden this week signed a $1 trillion package of highway and other infrastructure projects, which he's spent recent days promoting around the country. But he's been battered recently by falling approval numbers in polls, reflecting voters' concerns over inflation, supply chain delays and the persistent coronavirus pandemic.  After months of talks, lawmakers appeared eager to wrap it up, shelving lingering differences to begin selling the package back home. House Democrats said they were planning 1,000 events across the country by year's end to pitch the measure's benefits to voters.  Democrats have struggled to explain the far-reaching scope of the bill, with its health, child care and other provisions affecting millions of Americans. The internal battling has often overshadowed the actual bill, weighing down Democrats as they prepare for potentially difficult midterm elections next year.  House passage of the social and environment bill would send it to the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats have zero votes to spare. Significant changes there are likely due to cost-cutting demands by moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.  Senate talks could take weeks, and the prospect that Manchin or others will force additional cuts in the measure was making it easier for House moderates to back the legislation Thursday. The altered bill would have to return to the House before going to Biden's desk.  Even as lawmakers debated the legislation, Democrats were set to change it before the House votes to make sure it doesn't run afoul of Senate rules. Democrats are using special rules that would let the bill pass the Senate by a simple majority, not the usual 60 votes, but such legislation must follow certain budget constraints.  When moderates delayed House passage of the bill two weeks ago, they said they wanted to make sure the CBO's projections for its costs were similar to White House numbers, which showed the measure essentially paid for itself.  Some differences, however, were expected between the CBO and White House estimates.  A chief discrepancy was expected to be over a White House estimate that giving the IRS an additional $80 billion for stepped-up enforcement would yield $480 billion in new tax collections over a decade, a net gain of $400 billion. The CBO, using stricter estimating guidelines, was expected to envision half that amount in new revenue.  The House's addition of a paid family leave program was also expected to increase the legislation's cost. That program faces objections from Manchin and seems likely to be dropped by the Senate.  Some moderates have already said projections over IRS savings are always uncertain and would not cause them to oppose the measure. Others have said the measure's roughly $555 billion in tax credits and other costs to encourage cleaner energy need not be paid for in the bill because global warming is an existential crisis.  Critics have said the bill's overall cost would exceed $4 trillion if Democrats hadn't made temporary some of its programs they would actually like to be permanent. For example, tax credits for children and low-earning workers, top party priorities, are extended for just one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/divided-house-debates-democrats-expansive-social-climate-bill/articleshow/87788932.cms||---
---||India||India, China agree to go for more military talks||NEW DELHI: After the LAC disengagement talks between senior commanders last month ended on a sour note with both sides blaming each other for the continued deadlock, India and China were back on the dialogue table Thursday with another round of diplomatic talks to resolve the situation in eastern Ladakh. The 23rd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) saw India seeking early and complete disengagement from all friction points along the LAC in the western sector and the two sides agreeing to have another round of military talks soon. There was no sign of any breakthrough though with both India and China reiterating their respective positions in separate statements after what was the 9th meeting of WMCC since the Galwan incident last year. The Chinese readout also didn't mention complete disengagement even as it spoke about efforts to settle the remaining issue and to shift from "urgent dispute settlement" to regular border management and control. They recalled the agreement between foreign minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi during their meeting in September in Dushanbe that military and diplomatic officials of the two sides should continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. Accordingly, India said in its readout, the two sides had candid and in-depth discussions on the situation along the LAC in western sector of India-China border areas and also reviewed the developments since the last meeting of the senior commanders of both sides last month. "In this regard they agreed on the need to find an early resolution to the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols so as to restore peace and tranquility. The two sides also agreed that both sides should in the interim also continue to ensure a stable ground situation and avoid any untoward incident," said the government. "It was agreed that both sides should hold the next (14th) round of the Senior Commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols," it added. According to China, both sides called for continuous efforts to further de-escalate the border situation, and said they would strive to shift from "urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control at an early date". "Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels, actively prepare for the 14th round of Senior Commanders Meeting, and make efforts to settle the remaining issues in the western sector of the China-India border," said China in its statement. "The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent developments in the China-India border areas, and agreed to consolidate the existing outcomes of the disengagement, strictly abide by the agreements and protocols and the consensus reached between the two sides, prevent the situation on the ground from relapsing," it added. After the last round of military talks, the government had accused China of ignoring India's "constructive suggestions" and not coming up with any forward-looking proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-china-agree-to-go-for-more-military-talks/articleshow/87788971.cms||---

India never joined the review trial because of Pakistan’s refusal to grant unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Jadhav and to allow India to appoint an Indian lawyer for him. India has maintained since the Bill was introduced in Pakistan’s Parliament that any new law will not help until Islamabad agrees to provide what it calls remedial consular access to Jadhav in line with the spirit of the ICJ judgment. “We have seen reports of Pakistan enacting into law the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. “Nothing could have been further from the truth. As stated earlier, the ordinance did not create the machinery for an effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-rejects-pakistan-law-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-says-it-will-be-of-little-use/articleshow/87789110.cms||---

They were not allowed to board the flight even though they took Rapid RT-PCR tests at the airport for Rs 3,000 each. All Indian passengers headed to the UAE must clear this pre-departure test, besides carrying RT-PCR negative reports not older than 48 hours. Rukhsar Memon, 28, husband Suhail Syed, 39, and his mother Mamtaz Munawar, 63, had come to Bengaluru for their annual holiday at their Nandidurga Road home on October 9 this year. On Tuesday morning, the family went to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to board the IndiGo flight 6E 95 from Bengaluru to Dubai scheduled to take off at 1.15pm. As per pre-departure requirement for UAE travelers, the three, including 13-week pregnant Rukhsar, took Rapid RT-PCR tests outside KIA and secured negative reports for Rs 9,000 before reaching the IndiGo check-in counter around 10am on Tuesday. Then came the one-minute shocker. “We were denied boarding for the 1.15pm flight on Tuesday as the IndiGo ground staff said our initial RT-PCR test reports showed that our samples were collected at 1.15pm on Sunday,” recalled Suhail, who works as a sales executive with a Dubai-based health insurance firm. The airline calculates the 48-hour validity period from the time of sample collection. The IndiGo ground staff told the family that by the time the flight takes off at 1.15pm, their RT-PCR reports will be “aged one minute over the mandated 48 hours”. “We requested the IndiGo manager at the airport to kindly consider us since we were well within the 48-hour validity when we reached the airport. My pregnant wife and my elderly mother were travelling with me. The employees were rude to us, especially the airline manager, as they dragged us for three long hours and finally denying us boarding,” said Suhail on his family’s ordeal. Sources with IndiGo’s ground staff confirmed the incident and said they were following the Covid protocol rules.

A bench of Justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi quashed two judgments of the Bombay high court which had held that "skin to skin" contact was essential for the purpose of proving the charge of sexual offence under Pocso and held that a narrow interpretation of "physical contact" would defeat the purpose of the Act, which was framed to protect children. The high court ruling had caused widespread consternation as it could have allowed offenders to exploit the reference to escape the ambit of the law. "The act of touching any sexual part of the body of a child with sexual intent or any other act involving physical contact with sexual intent could not be trivialised or held insignificant or peripheral so as to exclude such act from the purview of 'sexual assault' under Section 7," the bench said. It noted use of gloves, cloth, or contact through clothes, or even use of condoms, could have been excluded in the light of the HC orders despite sexual intent. The HC verdict passed in January had led to considerable outrage and it was attorney general K K Venugopal who challenged it before the Supreme Court saying the order was outrageous and will have wider ramifications on 43,000 Pocso cases registered every year in the country. It is the only second time in the history of the SC that the attorney general moved court against an HC order. The first was in 1985 when the then AG challenged a Rajasthan HC order directing execution of death sentence by public hanging. The National Commission for Women and Maharashtra government had also subsequently filed appeals against the HC verdict. "Restricting the interpretation of the words 'touch' or 'physical contact' to 'skin to skin contact' would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision contained in Section 7 of the Pocso Act, but it would lead to an absurd interpretation of the said provision. 'Skin to skin contact' for constituting an offence of sexual assault could not have been intended or contemplated by the legislature," Justice Trivedi, who penned the judgment for herself and Justice Lalit, said. "The very object of enacting the POCSO Act is to protect the children from sexual abuse, and if such a narrow interpretation is accepted, it would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act, inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent, would not amount to an offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Pocso Act. The most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Act is 'sexual intent' and not 'skin to skin' contact with the child," she said. In a separate but concurrent verdict, Justice Bhat said that the fallacy in the HC's reasoning is that it assumed that indirect touch is not covered by Section 7 or, in other words, is no touch at all. He said the section covers both direct and indirect touch. "In plain English, to touch is to engage in one of the most basic of human sensory perceptions. The receptors on the surface of the human body are acutely sensitive to the subtleties of a whole range of tactile experiences. The use of a spoon, for instance, to consume food, without touching it with hand, in no way diminishes the sense of touch that is experienced by the lips and the mouth. Similarly, when a stick or other object is pressed onto a person, even when clothed, their sense of touch is keen enough to feel it. Therefore, the reasoning in the high court’s judgment quite insensitively trivialises — indeed legitimises — an entire range of unacceptable behaviour which undermines a child’s dignity and autonomy, through unwanted intrusions," Justice Bhat said. The bench said that HC ignored surrounding circumstances — like the accused having taken the victim to his house, unzipping his pants, contact with sexual organs and attempt to remove clothes of the victim — all of which justified the conclusion about the culpable mental state of the accused. "...whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of 'sexual assault' under Section 7 of the Pocso Act. In view of the discussion made earlier, the prosecution was not required to prove a 'skin to skin' contact for the purpose of proving the charge of sexual assault under the Act," the bench said while convicting both the accused under the Pocso Act. While one convict was given three years of imprisonment, the other was awarded a five-year jail term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/skin-to-skin-touch-not-a-must-for-sex-assault-supreme-court/articleshow/87789433.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The proposals come after a panel set up by the regulator found that there are 1,100 loan apps in various app stores, of which 600 are illegal. The suggestions come in the wake of complaints of harassment by digital lending apps, many of which have turned out to be unauthorized and operated by offshore entities. Some of the borrowers have also committed suicide, blaming the apps of harassment. There have also been reports of digital lenders repatriating unlawful profits outside the country. The recommendations, submitted by a working group on digital lending including lending through online platforms and mobile apps chaired by Jayant Kumar Dash, executive director, RBI, include having a nodal agency to verify all the digital lending apps and setting up a self-regulatory organisation. The group has also suggested tighter norms for “buy now pay later” loans, a form of credit given at time of purchase. The proposal is to treat them as part of balance sheet lending, if it is not in the form of operational credit by merchants. “Since these products do not meet the requirements of traditional credit facilities, a suitable notification may be issued by the government of India in this regard,” the group said. “The recommendations seek to protect the integrity of the system against entities that are not regulated and are not authorized to carry out lending business. The onus of subjecting third-party lending service providers to a standard protocol of business conduct would lie with the regulated entities to whom they are attached. Further, an institutional mechanism is envisaged to ensure the basic level of customer suitability, appropriateness and protection of data privacy,” the report said. The panel said that the digital lending ecosystem comprises both balance sheet lenders (those who lend their own money) and marketplace lending (a platform that allows others to lend). Within these two forms of lending, there are peer-to-peer lending platforms, neo banks, and “buy now pay later” players. “It is observed that lending through digital mode relative to physical mode is still at a nascent stage in case of banks (Rs 1.1 lakh crore via digital mode vis-à-vis Rs 53.1 lakh crore via physical mode) whereas for NBFCs, a higher proportion of lending (Rs 0.2 lakh crore via digital mode vis-à-vis Rs1.9 lakh crore via physical mode) is happening through digital mode,” the report said. The FinTech Association for Consumer Empowerment, which was launched last year, and comprises digital lending platforms such as EarlySalary, KreditBee, Kissht, CashE and LoanTap, welcomed the proposed regulations. “SRO is the call of the hour to structure the industry and to set the rules for the fintech members and customers. FACE members have always abided with the disclosure of all relevant information including the interest rates, as it believes in transparency and proactive commitment to consumers builds brand trust. Data privacy is of utmost importance and should be strictly adhered to,” FACE said in a statement. Experts, however, cautioned at regulations stifling innovation. “While subjecting third-party digital lending providers to certain standard protocols and regulations is key to protecting customer’s interest, this should not come at the cost of innovation and create entry barriers for startups in the fintech space,” said Jaikrishnan G, Partner, Financial Services Consulting at Grant Thornton Bharat. He added that new-age short-term liquid lending products have created a niche and are now filling in a critical credit void in the ecosystem. “A traditional lending framework cannot be applied on these products,” said Jaikrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-law-to-regulate-digital-lending/articleshow/87789536.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar said it would not be appropriate to intervene and disturb the entire process. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing CBSE, assured the court that all precautions would be taken for conducting the exams in the offline mode and also informed the bench that the number of examination centres had been increased from 6,500 to 15,000. The apex court noted that Term 1 board exams of the CBSE had already commenced from November 16, while Semester 1 of the board exams of the CISCE would begin on November 22. The top court was hearing a plea filed by six students seeking directions to the CBSE and the CISCE to issue a revised circular for conducting Class 10 and 12 board exams in hybrid mode, instead of offline mode only, in view of Covid-19. The court said the students must have faith and trust in the board authorities who will take all care to ensure that examinees and the staff are not exposed to untoward situations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-refuses-plea-for-board-exams-in-hybrid-mode/articleshow/87789576.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Three refused boarding as Covid-19 negative report lapsed by a minute||BENGALURU: A family of three, including a pregnant woman, was denied boarding on an IndiGo flight to Dubai, citing that the 48-hour validity of their RT-PCR negative test reports had lapsed by one minute. They were not allowed to board the flight even though they took Rapid RT-PCR tests at the airport for Rs 3,000 each. All Indian passengers headed to the UAE must clear this pre-departure test, besides carrying RT-PCR negative reports not older than 48 hours. Rukhsar Memon, 28, husband Suhail Syed, 39, and his mother Mamtaz Munawar, 63, had come to Bengaluru for their annual holiday at their Nandidurga Road home on October 9 this year. IndiGo termed the incident "unfortunate" and said that the passengers will be "suitably compensated" for additional expenses. Airline staff dragged matter for 3 hours: FlyersOn Tuesday morning, the family went to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to board the IndiGo flight 6E 95 from Bengaluru to Dubai scheduled to take off at 1.15pm.As per pre-departure requirement for UAE travelers, the three, including 13-week pregnant Rukhsar, took Rapid RT-PCR tests outside KIA and secured negative reports for Rs 9,000 before reaching the IndiGo check-in counter around 10am on Tuesday. Then came the one-minute shocker. "We were denied boarding for the 1.15pm flight on Tuesday as the IndiGo ground staff said our initial RT-PCR test reports showed that our samples were collected at 1.15pm on Sunday," recalled Suhail, who works as a sales executive with a Dubai-based health insurance firm. The airline calculates the 48-hour validity period from the time of sample collection. The IndiGo ground staff told the family that by the time the flight takes off at 1.15pm, their RT-PCR reports will be "aged one minute over the mandated 48 hours". "We requested the IndiGo manager at the airport to kindly consider us since we were well within the 48-hour validity when we reached the airport. My pregnant wife and my elderly mother were travelling with me. The employees were rude to us, especially the airline manager, as they dragged us for three long hours and finally denying us boarding," said Suhail on his family's ordeal. Sources with IndiGo's ground staff confirmed the incident and said they were following the Covid protocol rules. The passengers' RT-PCR reports would have lapsed by a minute if they had been boarded. The flight took off from Bengaluru at 1.41pm without the Bengaluru family. The family had to reschedule the tickets to Dubai costing Rs 25,000 each to Tuesday, November 23, by paying IndiGo an additional Rs 9,000. They will return to the airport next week with fresh RT-PCR test reports within 48 hours and will undergo Rapid RT-PCR tests once again at the airport by paying Rs 9,000 before boarding the IndiGo flight to Dubai. The family has lodged a complaint with IndiGo about the incident due to which they had to undergo humiliation and financial losses. There was no official response from the airline till Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-refused-boarding-as-ve-report-lapsed-by-a-minute/articleshow/87789732.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Yellow alert sounded after incessant rain batters Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Incessant rain through Thursday left Bengalureans longing for some sun and warm weather. The drizzle that often turned into downpour slowed traffic movement before intensifying into heavy showers as dusk set in. A tree each was uprooted in Vasanthnagar, KR Puram and Krishnayyanapalya and a branch fell near Thanisandra. Water-logging was reported from CMR College, Banaswadi; Brigade Road; Basappa Circle in Kalasipalya; KEB Junction in Nagawara; 12th Cross in HBR Layout and New Byappanahalli. Water entered a house in Canara Bank Colony of Vidyaranyapura. Though the damage was little till late evening, rain made matters worse for many Bengalureans, given the poor state of roads in most localities. The forecast of at least two more wet days added to the gloom. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert in the city and neighbouring districts for Friday. A yellow alert means people are required to be on watch and look out for updates. Civic works under way in Malleswaram, Banaswadi, Ramamurthynagar, Old Madras Road, Banashankari and Indiranagar only added to Bengalureans’ woes. “It’s been raining for the past two weeks. I have been using my car to reach office, but today (Thursday) morning the traffic was down to a crawl. It is quite difficult to drive at such times given the bad infrastructure,” said motorist Janardhana H, who was driving from his Banaswadi home to his workplace in Richmond Town. “It is difficult to even move around in our locality. Recently, Bescom dug up the road to lay cables. BWSSB dug up roads for installing new water and sewage lines. Neither has fixed the roads properly. When can we lead a normal life,” asked Sandesh Shetty, a resident of Banashankari 2nd Stage. As of 8.30pm, the city received 37mm of rain, whereas Kempegowda International Airport and HAL recorded 20mm and 39.2mm, respectively. With a depression forming over southwest Bay of Bengal, more rain and thunderstorms are expected in Bengaluru, neighbouring districts and coastal Karnataka in the next few days. According to the Met department, a depression over southwest Bay of Bengal, off North Tamil Nadu coast, is very likely to cross North Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coasts early Friday morning. Under the influence of these systems, Karnataka is likely to receive widespread rain for the next four days, with heavy showers at isolated places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-to-see-2-more-days-of-rain-schools-shut-today/articleshow/87789773.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Apple has created around 1 million jobs in India, says company VP||BENGALURU: Priya Balasubramaniam, vice-president of product operations in Apple, said the company supports around 1 million jobs in India, from its own employees to the fast-growing iOS app economy to its work with supplier partners. “The App Store is filled with incredible apps developed in India, while our App Accelerator in Bengaluru provides guidance to thousands of iOS developers," she said virtually at the 24th edition of the Bengaluru Tech Summit on Thursday. Balasubramaniam said manufacturing is being transformed by newer technologies like AI, machine learning, augmented and virtual reality, advanced robotics, and 3D printing. “What they add up to is a new form of manufacturing. Some call it Industry 4.0, the fourth Industrial Revolution. We call it smart manufacturing. Instead of using expensive optical inspection machines to measure part dimensions for quality assurance, we can use iPhone's A14 Bionic chip and camera to run machine vision algorithms. In milliseconds, we can capture product deviations,” she said. Smart manufacturing, she said, anticipates issues proactively and with predictive modelling, it could take corrective actions. Apple has been operating in India for more than two decades, and in 2017, it began manufacturing iPhones in Bengaluru’s industrial hub of Peenya where it started assembling the low-cost iPhone SE back then. Together with the two assembling facilities it has in Peenya in Bengaluru and Narasapura in Kolar, the company now has a substantial presence in and around Bengaluru. “…Since then, we've expanded that facility here and in Chennai, manufacturing several iPhone models for the domestic market and for export. Along with our supply chain, we are investing significantly in India to develop our operations, expand our reach and engage with more local suppliers,” Balasubramaniam said. Through the pandemic, she said, we have all realised the importance of resilient supply chains and the importance of manufacturing, not only to sustain the economy but to allow it to thrive. “Our systems will become more adaptable, fostering a more resilient economy. For example, one of the projects we are piloting in India as we speak is station monitoring with video ML. This will allow remote monitoring and control of production, increasing productivity,” she added. Last year, the Cupertino-based company launched its e-commerce store in India. “We are looking forward to expanding further with physical retail stores too,” she said. She said state-level policies and the Indian government's policies to promote manufacturing, along with efforts to support the ecosystem of startups, are already advancing Apple along the path to more opportunities and more investments. “We see an exciting opportunity for India to grow further and train its emerging workforce in the foundation of smart manufacturing, intelligent design and connected and optimized systems that are agile, proactive and sustainable,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/apple-has-created-around-1-mn-jobs-in-india-says-company-vp/articleshow/87789774.cms||---

With greater impetus, that can also go up to more than $410 billion, the report said.“A strong partnership between industry and government is vital in creating an ecosystem for the fabless startups and electronics products companies. We are proposing the creation of a $1 billion ESDM Innovation fund, move to high-value manufacturing through global partnerships, and creation of the National Institute for Semiconductor Electronics Research (NISER),” said Satya Gupta, vice chairman of IESA.The pandemic has highlighted the need to have a strong and robust electronics research and manufacturing ecosystem in the country as electronics forms the backbone of all strategic sectors like healthcare, security, defence, transportation, financial inclusion and agriculture. “The trend of AI and systems are getting more autonomous, whether it’s cars, homes, work environment or appliances, as the products have gained capacities to send everything, know everything and handle the situations seamlessly. The landscape of electronic and semiconductor units is changed completely by the modern technologies like EV, AI, industrial IoT, augmented reality, security, safety and big data,” Santosh Kumar, MD of Texas Instruments, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/electronics-mfg-can-double-contribution-to-eco-by-2025/articleshow/87789775.cms||---

The usually fractious poll battle turned shriller this time with many candidates openly flouting their caste and political affiliations while trying to leave no stone unturned to garner support from the community that is largely into promotion of Kannada language and literature. Even in terms of expenditure, insiders admit the money spent by some of the candidates is all set to cross Rs 1 crore each.The Parishat has 3.5 lakh members across the state and, of these, 3.1 lakh have voting rights. Reaching out to these voters with an appeal through post would cost around Rs 13 lakh for a candidate. Some candidates have sent appeals three or four times apart from visiting all districts to meet important local influencers and littérateurs.With only three days left for the polling on November 21, aspirants are busy wooing the votersto improve their chances of getting the coveted post. The candidates include Mahesh Joshi, Shekargouda Mali Patil, Va Cha Chennegowda, poet Saraswathi Shivappa Chimmalagi, Mayanna and K Ratnakara Shetty. Senior writer and former Parishat president Hampa Nagarajaiah said only 6-8 candidates would usually be in the race.According to special election officer ST Mohan Raju, 3.1 lakh of the Parishat’s 3.4 lakh members are eligible to vote. Members get the eligibility to vote three years after getting membership.About 4,800 voters in other states like West Bengal, Manipur and Gujarat and countries like Germany, the US and Singapore vote through postal ballots. Postal ballots have already reached the office of the special election officer. The counting of votes is on November 24 and results will be announced the same day.New app for voters“A new app, Kasapa election 21, has been introduced to facilitate voters to find their polling booths easily. If a member enters his/her name after opening the app, it will show the booth where he or she has to vote,” Mohan Raju said. A few candidates have complained to the election officer that some contestants are distributing suitcases, silver articles and other things. Former president of the Parishat Nalluru Prasad said: “Any member who has love for Kannada and commitment towards Kannada can contest the elections. There should not be any political interference in the election or functioning of the Parishat.”Hampa Nagarajaiah, however, said: “Election is an election and whether it is for the assembly, corporation or panchayat, factors like political interference and caste inevitably come into the picture. But the person elected for the post must meet the expectations of Kannadigas and efficiently work for the development of the language, land, culture and literature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/record-21-in-race-for-sundays-sahitya-parishat-election/articleshow/87789777.cms||---

While it witnessed 2,987 cases till September 15 this year, 2,516 more were recorded till November 17. The 84% increase is due to untimely rain giving rise to mosquito breeding, say doctors. The state also reported the year’s first dengue deaths, five, on October 21. Since the beginning of November, Karnataka has seen 441 new cases. However, there has been no death so far this month. “Incessant rain and water stagnation in pits and dug-up areas lead to breeding of mosquitoes,” said Dr Ramesh K Kaulgud, joint director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), state health and family welfare department. Of the five patients who died, two were from Ramanagara and one each from Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada and Belagavi. More than one lakh people with symptoms of dengue underwent testing in the state in 2021; 40% of the tests were done in Bengaluru alone. As per data with the health department, Bengaluru has seen 1,038 cases this year and accounts for 19% of the state’s total dengue burden. From November 1 to17, 110 persons in Bengaluru tested positive for the infection. After Bengaluru, the highest number of cases have been reported from Shivamogga (393), Kalaburagi (386), Udupi (312), Koppal (278). However, there are discrepancies in the data of the state NVBDCP and that of BBMP. As per Palike figures, there were 1,051 cases of dengue in the city from January to to November 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dengue-cases-state-sees-84-rise-in-2-months/articleshow/87792834.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Teen taking selfies from train falls in Mandya, body found 8 days later||BENGALURU: A 19-year-old boy taking selfies while leaning out of a moving train’s door fell into a canal after he was hit by the railing of a bridge near Srirangapatna in Mandya district earlier this month. His body was found 6km downstream of the canal on Monday. Abhishek AS, a resident of Annechakkanahalli in KR Pet taluk of Mandya and helper at a bar and restaurant in Gandhinagar, Bengaluru, was on the way to his village when the accident took place around 2am on November 7. Abhishek’s fatal misadventure went unnoticed by his four friends travelling with him. As Abhishek did not come home, his parents filed a missing person’s complaint with Upparpet police in Bengaluru on November 8. Cops learnt about his death during probe and found his body on November 15 near Srirangapatna. Sanjeev M Patil, deputy commissioner of police (west), said Abhishek had taken up the helper’s job three months ago. A temple inauguration was scheduled in his village on November 7. Abhishek took permission to attend the function and invited four of his friends. All five gathered at Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna railway station in Bengaluru by 10pm on November 6 and boarded the train around midnight. “They started taking photos and selfies on their mobiles after the train left the city. They were standing near the door of a compartment. Later, the other four went to their seats. Investigation revealed Abhishek clung on to an iron bar in the train and bent his body outside. He may have failed to notice the train approaching a bridge on the canal and was hit by the railing. He fell into the canal and was washed away at least 6km from the spot where he fell,” a police officer said. Patil said, “His friends noticed Abhishek was missing near Pandavapura. They got down from the train and searched for him in a nearby area. They got scared and hence two of them went to their villages, and the others returned to the city. They did not inform anyone about his disappearance.” The DCP said Abhishek had informed his family members that he would attend the temple inauguration and they called him at noon to know his whereabouts. His mobile was switched off, so they rushed to Bengaluru and enquired with his employer and learnt he had left the hotel to go to his village. His relative Manjegowda filed a missing person’s complaint on November 8. Upparpet police swung into action and traced the friends who travelled with him. They told police they were on the way to Abhishek’s village when he went missing.

Nanda Kumar, 52, a JC Nagar resident and TV technician, was immediately shifted to Bowring Hospital and his condition is stable, according to police. Cops said Kumar was facing family feud and was upset with police for not acting against his wife and kids. “Kumar had filed a complaint against his wife and others with JC Nagar police. Cops had summoned them and let them off after counselling. But Kumar wanted police to arrest his wife and others. Alleging that no police action had been taken against them, he attempted to end his life,” said an officer. Police said Kumar came near room 106 and suddenly drank the sanitiser, kept for the public outside. Home guards and police snatched the bottle from him. Kumar reportedly gained entry into Soudha by recording that he wanted to meet home department officials to discuss a police case.

On Wednesday, Kharge had said 0.08 bitcoins seized from accused Robin Khandelawala by Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths had vanished from the police wallet where they had been moved.  Kharge had also objected to police taking technical help from Unocoin, a bitcoin exchange company, during the investigation as it had approached cops saying their website had been hacked. “These are absolutely false claims. We clarify that 0.08 bitcoins along with three cryptocurrencies (worth Rs 2.5 lakh) were seized from the account of Robin Khandelawala and transferred to the police wallet. The same was duly intimated to the court. This fact has been prominently mentioned to the court along with the chargesheet. The currencies are safely placed in the police wallet under the knowledge of the court,” it said. It stated though the Unocoin account was hacked for a small amount, there was nothing adverse against the company making them ineligible to assist in the probe. “The company is a victim in the case, not the accused.

The marks cards have not come as the tender for non-tearable ones has been delayed. It is allegedly stuck in a tussle between the vice-chancellor and some syndicate members — one group favouring tearable and the other non-tearable marks cards — for several months. “We had called for a tender of non-tearable marks cards. Three companies had applied, including Mysore Sales International Limited. While MSIL had quoted Rs 41 per marks card when we procured a smaller number, it quoted Rs 43 a piece when we ordered 10 lakh answer scripts. While I was questioning this and negotiating, a syndicate member wrote to the governor (chancellor) alleging corruption. The governor sought a response and we have sent a reply. Now the chancellor has to respond on how to take this forward,” explained KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor, BU. “Students have to wait or else we will temporarily issue tearable marks cards. We will try to upload their results on the website which can be used by the students,” the vice-chancellor added. However, some syndicate members said non-tearable marks cards have to be issued as it is mandated by the government and is in the best interest of students. Colleges point out that the delay in taking a decision will cost students. “They will finish their final semester soon. They have to start applying for jobs and higher education. Where are the marks cards?” said the principal of an affiliated college. However, an official concerned said marks cards of all semesters of the PG students will be issued as soon as the fourth semester results are out. “The students anyway have to wait for the fourth semester results to take the next step in their career. By then, we will have their marks cards ready as printing for 10,000 students will not take much time. We will do it in tearable marksheets,” he said. Apart from the 2019-20 PG students who are graduating soon, the colleges said marks cards of fourth and fifth semesters of 2018 batch undergraduate programmes are also pending. The batches from 2019 have not received any marks cards at all. “Marks cards up to fourth semester have been dispatched. The ones for fifth semester will be sent by this week. Once sixth semester results get announced, we will send those too. The university has started printing UG results in tearable marks cards. We will finish the process very soon and proceed with PG,” said the official. The third semester results of the 2019-20 PG students are yet to be announced due to delay in valuation of some open elective programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iv-sem-bu-pg-students-yet-to-get-i-sem-marks-cards/articleshow/87789786.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

In a series of tweets, the BJP published a picture of Rakesh Siddaramaiah with Sunish Hegde and Hemanth Muddappa, while targeting the former CM over trying to cover up when Sriki and his associates were arrested in 2016. The party’s official handle also asked Siddaramaiah why he took a U-turn on Wednesday, when asked if he had any proof of the case. ಮಾನ್ಯ #Bitcoinಬುರುಡೆರಾಮಯ್ಯ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಅವಧಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ಈ ಹಗರಣವನ್ನು ಮುಚ್ಚಿ ಹಾಕುವುದು ನಿಮಗೆ ತೀರಾ ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯವಾಗಿತ್ತು.ಅಪ್ರಿಯ… https://t.co/fh2nCNAy7a— BJP Karnataka (@BJP4Karnataka) 1637219662000“During your tenure, it appears that you were very keen on closing the cases. Irrefutable truth in this picture suggests that your direct involvement may be in question. Fearing that the truth shall come out, did you take a U-turn?” the BJP questioned. Reacting to the tweets, Siddaramaiah said: “The BJP has shown it has no shame or honour by accusing a dead man of wrongdoing. They have shown their true colours. Is there any point in accusing Rakesh? He is dead.” .@BJP4Karnataka is trying to hide their corruption by bringing the name of my deceased son.I urge @CMofKarnataka… https://t.co/9GgPzCJ7e5— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) 1637234801000He later went on to tweet: “The Karnataka BJP is trying to hide their corruption by bringing the name of deceased son. I urge the CM to order a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court to investigate the scam including our term.” He even tweeted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with another fugitive, Nirav Modi, at the 2018 World Economic Forum. “BJP alleged that my son Rakesh was seen with Sri Krishna’s friend Hemant Muddappa. Then how can we interpret the photo of PM Modi with Nirav Modi during the 2018 World Economic Forum?”he asked. He added BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel may know the “important” leader who supposedly received bitcoins as quid pro quo for mediating the release of Muddappa when he was arrested with Srikrishna, the hacker. Former CM BS Yediyurappa said the bitcoin scam was being probed and there was no intention to protect anyone. “The PM will ensure that none of the accused is spared.

---||India||Ensure cryptos don’t end up in wrong hands, PM Narendra Modi urges world||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for democratic nations to work together on cryptocurrency to ensure it “promotes trade, investment and the larger good” rather than ending up in the “wrong hands”. In his keynote address at the first Sydney Dialogue, organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Modi described the current age as one of profound changes, that happens once in an era. “The digital age is changing everything around us. It has defined politics, the economy and society. It is raising new questions on sovereignty, governance... and law. It is reshaping international competition, power and leadership. But, we also face new risks and new forms of conflicts across diverse threats from the sea-bed to cyber to space.” India, he said, was developing indigenous capabilities in telecom technology such as 5G and 6G, in what is being seen as a significant development because of the keenness of many outside players to be part of India’s 5G rollout. Both India and Australia have kept Chinese firms out of its 5G structure. Highlighting a recent government initiative, Modi said India was now focusing on “hardware and creating packages to become key manufacturers of semiconductors”. India has been known to have an edge in artificial intelligence and semiconductor design. The PM’s remarks seem to signal India’s desire go further into fabrication and manufacturing. Modi called on democracies to jointly invest in “research and development of future technology”. He also spoke on India’s digital revolution and the country’s efforts in becoming one of the “leading nations in artificial intelligence and machine learning”. Modi said, “technology and data are becoming new weapons. The biggest strength of democracy is openness. At the same, we should not allow vested interests to use this openness against us.” He called for collaboration in “research and development in future technology” — for trusted manufacturing base and trusted supply chains. The PM also called for deeper “intelligence and operational cooperation on cyber security, protect critical information infrastructure.” He flagged the importance of combating the power of subversive cyber activities that attempt to manipulate public opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ensure-cryptos-dont-end-up-in-wrong-hands-pm-narendra-modi-urges-world/articleshow/87789793.cms||---
---||India||SC rejects Anil Deshmukh’s plea to examine CBI’s PE report which gave him clean chit||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh's plea for the court to examine CBI's preliminary inquiry report against him which allegedly granted him a clean chit. The court, however, allowed him the liberty to raise the issue before an appropriate court. At the outset of hearing, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Deshmukh, referred to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on whose plea CBI probe was ordered against the former minister and said the court had passed the order placing confidence in him but the cop was himself absconding now. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said, "It is very unfortunate for the institutions. It shows lack of faith in the system." The bench, thereafter, proceeded with the hearing of Deshmukh's plea and raised the question of how he could approach directly to the apex under Article 32 jurisdiction. Sibal contended that SC passed the order against Deshmukh on the presumption that the evidence against him was found by CBI after holding a preliminary probe and subsequently FIR was filed, but as per media reports the politician was given clean chit in PE report. Sibal contended that the court should ask CBI to place before it 65-page PE report along with file noting to find out the truth. He said that if it was true that "nothing was found against me" in the preliminary report then it was clear that there is political motivation behind lodging FIR The bench, however, raised a question on how much credence could be given to media reports and said it was not inclined to entertain the petition. It allowed him to raise the issue before a competent court. Deshmukh had approached the SC through his lawyer Avadh Kaushik. "The present petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is based on the premise that the orders passed by the Court on the rationale that the preliminary enquiry may have material against petitioner. As per certain newspaper reports the Petitioner is stated to have been given a clean chit. Therefore, they have called for all records...We are not inclined to exercise jurisdiction under Article 32 in this scenario. It is always open for the petitioner to raise the issue before a competent court," the court said. Deshmukh (71) was arrested by the ED on November 1 after questioning in the case, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 this year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations that demands of Rs 100 crore by way of bribes from Mumbai's hotel and restaurant owners were sought by the former minister were levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The ED case is that Deshmukh, while serving as the state's home minister, misused his official position and through dismissed police officer Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-rejects-anil-deshmukhs-plea-to-examine-cbis-pe-report-which-gave-him-clean-chit/articleshow/87789811.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Say where you are, then we’ll hear you, SC tells Param Bir||NEW DELHI: “No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the Supreme Court on Thursday told former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and made it clear that it will not entertain his plea if the IPS officer does not disclose his whereabouts. Minutes after dismissing former Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh's plea for documents relating to the CBI investigation and having expressed concern over the former Mumbai top cop not having faith in the system, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan and Kaul M M Sundresh took up Param Bir Singh's petition and asked his lawyer to first inform about Singh's whereabouts. "Where are you? Are you in this country or outside? Where are you? We will come to the petition. First, we need to know where you are," the bench asked Senior Advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Singh. Bali replied that the filing counsel could answer the court's query but the advocate-on-record told the bench that the petition has been filed by the holder of power of attorney for Singh. The bench then observed that it was getting an impression that Singh was sitting abroad and would come to India after getting a favourable order from the court. The bench again pointed out lack of confidence shown by the top IPS officer in the system and made it clear that he will not be treated differently. “You are seeking protective orders; nobody knows where you are. Suppose you are sitting abroad and taking legal recourse through power of attorney then what happens. If that is so then you will come to India if the court rules in your favour, we don't know what you have in mind. No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the bench said. A magistrate court in Bombay on Wednesday declared Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city. Singh had last attended his office in May this year after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay High Court last month that his whereabouts were not known. The police action had followed his sensational charge that Deshmukh had asked for collection of Rs 100 crore as bribes. Bimal Agrawal, a real estate developer and hotelier, had alleged the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on two bars and restaurants which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them. The incidents are said to have occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed. Following his complaint, a case was filed under IPC Sections 384 and 385 (both pertaining to extortion) and 34 (common intention) against six accused. Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too. The IPS officer was shunted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March 2021 after Waze was arrested in the case of explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai residence 'Antilia' and the subsequent mysterious death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/say-where-you-are-then-well-hear-you-sc-tells-param-bir/articleshow/87789829.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The officials of my department and those from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) should have zero-tolerance against such practices,” he said. While addressing the ‘Eat Right’ walkathon organised by FSSAI, west region, here, Shingane said mobile testing labs and other initiatives were being implemented by the government to detect adulteration of food and beverages. “In today’s hectic life, the intake of good food has gained supreme importance for achieving health goals. The FDA is committed to helping citizens in getting healthy and hygienic food to achieve good health,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said youth should avoid eating junk food. “The youth should become aware of healthy eating habits at an early age. Such awareness can only ensure good health in later phases of life,” he said. Organised by FSSAI on the occasion of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, an initiative of the Indian government to commemorate 75 years of the country’s Independence, the ‘Eat Right’ walkathon also saw awareness measures involving food vendors from Aurangabad. An exhibition-cum-sale of different food items was also held at Kalagram as part of different activities spanned over two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stern-action-against-adulteration-practices/articleshow/87786096.cms||---

While piling work is going on for some new buildings, column and beam casting for other structures are also in progress. The construction work is being undertaken in phases so that healthcare services at this largest hospital of the state are not affected. Once the number of beds at PMCH is increased from the existing 2,000 to about 5,500 after its redevelopment, it will emerge as the largest government hospital of the country. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said piling work on multi-level car parking, central utility block, nurse hostel and hospital building was being done. Columns and beam casting under the structural erection plan is also in progress at Jeevak Hostel. Foundation stone for this ambitious project was earlier laid by chief minister Nitish Kumar. However, after demolition of some of the buildings identified for the first phase, the foundation stone for beginning of piling work was laid jointly by the additional chief secretary of health department Pratyaya Amrit and the superintendent in the presence of P K Jha, managing director of Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited and other officials on October 30. Dr Thakur said the hospital has been catering to the needs of patients from all over the state for decades. “Even during the peak of Covid pandemic, doctors and other healthcare staff provided services in all the departments and the emergency units risking their lives,” Dr Thakur added. Altogether 148 pillars for the first multi-level parking, which is being constructed after demolition of the superintendent quarter, 129 for central utility block, 48 for hospital building and 35 for nurse hostel were complete by Wednesday. Important buildings which were demolished for the first phase of development are Quaidi ward, Lavaris ward, A and B-grade nurses’ quarters and class IV quarters.

The state government has, consequently, decided to begin an awareness campaign after the ongoing panchayat elections as part of which the villagers will be told about the advantages of using toilets and maintaining cleanliness. State rural development department’s principal secretary Arvind Kumar Chaudhary told this newspaper, “As sufficient number of toilets have been made available in almost all the villages under the ‘Lohiya Swachh Bihar Abhiyan’ launched by the government, concerted efforts are being made to ensure their use by the people. An intensive campaign in this regard will be launched in different parts of the state after the elections are over and new panchayat committees constituted,” he said. He further pointed out that the government organised weeklong awareness campaigns at the village level every month to motivate the people to use toilets. However, they were temporarily stopped due to the panchayat elections. “The department has also started constructing at least two community toilets in every panchayat for those who do not use the ones in their houses,” Chaudhary said, promising that community toilets would be built in many panchayats and villagers trained in solid waste management soon. Patna University economics department’s former head Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “As many as 3.6 billion people in the world are still living without access to safely-managed sanitation. When some people in a community do not have safe toilets, everyone’s health is threatened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-government-to-launch-campaign-to-promote-cleanliness/articleshow/87786549.cms||B K Mishra

Stating that his father has been struggling with an injury on his left hand and had undergone a surgery on Nov 15, Chaitanya requested the CBI to provide him relief and medical assistance. He also attached a letter written by his father to the CBI director on Wednesday, denying the statement given by Shaik Dastagiri, who served as Viveka’s driver and is an accused in the case but has turned an approver now. The CBI arrested Devireddy following the statement of Dastagiri. “I am innocent. I have been implicated in the case at the instance of others,” Devireddy wrote. He claimed he was tortured when the special investigation team, constituted during the TDP regime, interrogated him. He said he has been cooperative in the investigation after the CBI took up the case. Devireddy was arrested on Wednesday and produced before a judge in Pulivendula court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/father-innocent-pleads-devireddys-son-in-letter/articleshow/87786682.cms||---
---||Patna||Chancellor’s office knew of VC’s shady deals in March||PATNA: Three senior officers of Magadh University (MU) had written to chancellor’s office in March this year against vice-chancellor Dr Rajendra Prasad, accusing him of pressuring them to clear payment of Rs 16 crore for printing of question papers, answer booklets and OMR sheets without any tender. The three officers were the then registrar Dr Vijay Kumar, financial adviser Madhusudan and financial officer S K Bajpai. The trio had sent a joint letter to the chancellor’s principal secretary on March 9 this year, urging him to order inquiry into “serious financial irregularities”. A copy of the letter is with TOI. They had also alleged in the letter that the VC, after calling them at his official residence on March 3, threatened to get them removed from their posts while using abusive language after they refused to clear payments. Surprisingly, the registrar was sacked just 10 days after he wrote the letter on the basis of a report sent to the chancellor by the MU VC. The governor’s secretariat had issued a notification on March 19, stating that the registrar was sacked for “unlawful activities, actions which undermined the prestige of the university and acts in violation of terms and conditions of his service”. On the same day, the governor’s secretariat issued another notification transferring Madhusudan to Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University in the same capacity. Bajpai, who was the third person to sign the letter, had resigned on April 1. Notification regarding acceptance of his resignation was issued by the governor’s secretariat on April 13. Patliputra University registrar Jitendra Kumar and Veer Kunwar Singh University financial officer Om Prakash were given responsibilities to look after MU’s affairs afterwards. The SVU sleuths had conducted the raids after lodging an FIR against the VC, his personal assistant Subodh Kumar, Om Prakash, Jitendra Kumar, two private firms named M/s Poorva Graphics and Offset Printers and M/s XLICT Software Private Limited and other unknown persons in a case of financial irregularities worth Rs30 crore. The SVU raid on VC’s private residence at Azad Nagar East in Gorakhpur on Wednesday had led to recovery of official files which showed only 47 private guards were working at the varsity while money for salary payment was being withdrawn for 87 guards. Officers in the chancellor’s office could not be contacted despite repeated attempts by TOI. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said the chancellor was the competent authority to take action against the VC involved in financial irregularities. He said the people involved in the process of selection of VCs must be vigilant so that only men of honesty and integrity are appointed to the highest office in the universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chancellors-office-knew-of-vcs-shady-deals-in-march/articleshow/87786829.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said the acts of financial corruption of MU VC and others have put the entire teaching community to shame and raised serious doubts over the credibility of people being appointed as VCs or pro-VCs in different universities. The findings of the SVU’s raid on VC’s residence have also revealed serious flaws in the process of selection of VCs, they said. They further pointed out that earlier there was a well-established practice to obtain police verification reports of the persons prior to their appointment to any high office. “It seems this practice has not been adhered to in recent appointments. Today, the VCs wield more powers than a cabinet minister, but unfortunately the power is not being used in improving the academic and administrative affairs of the university,” they said. They urged the chancellor to ask all the VCs and other officials dealing with university finances to immediately declare their assets so that the universities are saved from financial irregularities. Bihar State Progressive Intellectuals’ Forum convener Shiv Jatan Thakur has welcomed the move of the state government to order SVU raids on MU authorities for uncovering financial irregularities worth crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-should-ask-vcs-to-declare-their-assets/articleshow/87786841.cms||B K Mishra

A notification regarding Pathak’s new assignment after his return from central deputation was issued on Wednesday. Pathak held a brief meeting with the officials of the department on Day 1 and inquired about the steps taken by them to enforce the prohibition law in the state. “He looked calm and sombre during his maiden meeting,” an officer, who did not wish to be identified, told this reporter. Another officer said, “All the employees of the department reached office in time because everyone knows that Pathak sir is a no-nonsense officer.” According to sources, Pathak’s return to the prohibition department after a gap of about five years has sent shivers down the spine of the liquor smugglers, who have allegedly been operating in and outside the state in cahoots with some officials and politicians. Meanwhile, Pathak’s posting has resulted in an intensive war of words between the leaders of opposition parties and those of the ruling alliance. Leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, quipped, “Why did the government remove him earlier when he was to be given the same assignment again?” Responding to Tejashwi’s remark, SC/ST welfare minister, Santosh Kumar Suman, said, “It appears that Tejashwi has a lot of information about the liquor trade and its supply chain. Has he or his men invested in the illegal trade?” The minister’s response, however, irked Congress MLC, Prem Chandra Mishra, who said, “If the government has any evidence against Tejashwi, why is it not taking any legal action against him? It should arrest those involved in violating the new prohibition law and Tejashwi is no exception.” Mishra added, “The government should pay attention to the matter put forth by the opposition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-ramps-up-war-of-words-over-pathaks-posting/articleshow/87786879.cms||Ramashankar

Chaudhary said Rs 180 crore received through the State Finance Commission grant had been released two months ago for the purpose. The state has as many as 8,067 panchayats. Each panchayat had to be manned by a computer operator and an accountant in consonance with the condition of the 14th Finance Commission (for the period 2015-20), as it had recommended direct transfer of funds to the panchayats and urban bodies. Chaudhary said against the demand of 8,067 computer operators for the panchayats, as many as 7,800 posts had been filled. “We have put the requisition for filling around 300 vacant posts of computer operators,” he said, adding that the number of accountants who have been appointed is 1,300, with each of them having been given the responsibilities of more than one panchayat. Chaudhary said the state government has already decided to open panchayat level public service counters under the Right to Public Services (RTPS) Act. Accordingly, 8,067 RTPS counters have to be opened at the panchayat level. “We are going to appoint 8,067 more computer operators to run the RTPS counters in the panchayats,” he added. The salaries of the computer operators and accountants have been pending for the last six months. The minister said attempts were being made at the government and department levels to further strengthen and improve the panchayati raj institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/salary-dues-of-computer-operators-to-be-cleared-after-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87786986.cms||Abhay Singh

Naidu and party legislators walked from Venkatapalem to the assembly building at Velagapudi. TDP members raised slogans criticising the government for ‘not providing’ relief from price rise to the common man. Naidu demanded that the state government start reducing the prices of petrol and diesel. He said it was unfortunate that Jagan had not realised the burden on the common man despite the fact that AP is the only state with such high prices in the country. “The highest fuel prices have caused an unbearable rise in prices of essential commodities. The chief minister should also take back the decision on collecting tax on garbage,” demanded Naidu. TDP MLAs K Atchannaidu, Nimmala Ramanaidu, Gorantla Butchaiah Chowdary and others took part in the foot march. Soon after the commencement of the legislative council session, the TDP legislators staged a walkout . The MLCs demanded that the chairman accept their adjournment motions as the issues they wanted taken up for discussion were very important. With the chairman refusing to budge, TDP MLCs led by Yanamala Ramakrishnudu and Nara Lokesh staged a walkout. Later, Lokesh visited Amaravati and Pedakurapadu police stations and extended support to TNSF activists detained by the police while taking up their ‘Chalo Assembly’ march, demanding immediate withdrawal of the government’s decision to take over aided educational institutions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-mlcs-walk-out-of-legislative-council/articleshow/87786923.cms||Samdani MN

Doing so will be considered a “leak”. A Board circular to this effect has reached principals. “Even if there is any mistake in the question paper/answer key, the OMR will be evaluated as per the answer key provided by CBSE. Necessary action to rectify the mistake will be taken by the Board,” the circular said. Principals have also been instructed to only upload the number of correct answers and not the marks. In another circular, the bo-ard told principals that apart fr-om blackening the right circle on the OMR sheet, kids should not use a tick or cross. If they are told to answer 45 of 50 questions, and a kid answers all 50, the last five will be considered not attempted. “Best of 45 will not be considered,” it said. “We have informed students,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School, who is also a co-ordinator. CBSE has also made it mandatory for principals to send OMR answer sheets to regional offices via registered speed post.

However, a status report of land acquisition for laying a pipeline for CNG supply revealed the project remains a distant dream. Currently, a limited amount of CNG is being supplied in cylinders and transported by trucks, pushing up its cost in the city. The pipeline laying received a fillip after NGT intervened following the case filed by green activist Subhas Datta. But, the status report submitted by the district administration revealed that land acquisition is unlikely to be complete before next August, after which the pipeline laying work would resume. The eastern regional bench of Justice Amit B Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) ordered the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to file an affidavit on the pending issues relating to notification for acquisition of right of user in land. The bench also directed Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL) to file its affidavit on the action taken with respect to the districts concerned in which mouzas with land valuations have been handed to GAIL before January 6, the next date of listing. Since 5.7km of the pipeline will pass through the forest area in Purulia, the bench has directed the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to file its reply addressing these issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cng-pipe-laying-hits-land-hurdle/articleshow/87787621.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

This comes in the wake of the death of 12 Covid patients in a fire that broke out in the Ahmednagar civil hospital on November 6. Deshmukh said after a review on November 30, necessary action would be taken against hospitals not complying with the fire audit norms. “Both the private and government hospitals have been directed to submit the compliance report,” he said. Chief fire officer of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority Devendra Prabhakar Potphode told TOI that 737 Covid hospitals had completed the fire audit.

In an interview with TOI, Sharma speaks of how he has faith in the Indian markets and how he plans to reassure investors through explanation and execution of the company’s plans. You got emotional during the listing. Why was the listing so important? The national anthem was playing at the beginning of the listing process and there is a line that goes ‘Bharat Bhagya Vidhata’ – the one who owns the fortune of the country. It comes upon a generation to change the fate of a country and I would have never believed that in my life I would see a chance to bring a huge impact on such a large scale. That India from being digital-negative would become a digital-native country where mobile payment and Paytm has become mainstream. And then today we have been able to bring the company to the stock exchange. I did not see this only as fund-raising. In fund-raising, we get capital to expand the business and have people who buy into the business model. In the listing, we welcomed one million new shareholders to the Paytm family and that is important. But the investors would be disappointed with the listing day performance. What would you say to them? No investor invests for one day. If they invest only for a day, they are not investors. One day is not a game and this is not a loss either. I believe it is important for us to remember that we are in a business that a lot of people do not understand because there is no other business like this in the stock market. There is a lot of explanation and a lot of execution that we will bring in to make people understand the business. I cannot comment on the outcome of a tournament in a long-haul game based on day one. I do understand what you have to say and the concern, Let us see how we execute the new business plan to hold up to the opportunities. You have compared the listing to losing an early wicket in a long-haul tournament... The stock price for an investor is important. For a company, it is important to be sincere in its business mission. There we are happy with our business and plan. When we execute that is the time when investors and potential new investors understand us. Obviously, this (listing price) is not an indication of what we want to be looking at in the long haul. There is a lot that will happen in the business going forward and that is when people will understand and appreciate it. Our business model, which is payments leading to financial services, is a new concept to the stock markets. One analyst said that we are doing too many things. That is the difference between a platform and a point business. Once you have people who understand platform business, new things happen. Once we have a platform showing outcome, magically things begin to compound. You have the base in terms of customers. When will the network effect kick in? In our key revenue lines, items like credit, wealth, and insurance, some are showing revenue growth at an incredible pace. Some of them are still in the investment phase. Next quarter and the quarter after that, we have an incredible amount of traction. We are restrained by quarterly result obligations. Once we start announcing the numbers a lot can be understood. Payment leading to financial services is a proven model in other parts of the world. Once we start showing key performance indicators people will understand that this is not just cost-effective but highly scalable. Now that you are subject to quarterly results and analyst meets will things get more boring or will the excitement continue? It is going to be absolutely thrilling and even more exciting. The good thing is we can see traction on payment-led financial services. If telephony penetration happened through cellular phones, the magic was in how smartphones took over and mobile internet took over. Likewise, if payments are driving the beginning of financial services the magic will be in the actual financial services. Are you happy with the advice you have received from bankers? Yes. I would say that the process of bankers, regulators, lawyers, lead managers is phenomenally gratifying. I can tell you that India has the best in the world ecosystem for IPOs, I am betting on India becoming the second-largest tech IPO market after Nasdaq. I believe that is possible because of the scale, support of the regulator, bankers, and the ecosystem put together. I think that is what India should head toward — becoming the second-largest market after the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-forecast-long-haul-games-outcome-based-on-day-1-show/articleshow/87788542.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Vijayawada||Will only examine decision-making process: Andhra Pradesh HC||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Thursday said that it would not evaluate the suitability of one city over the other for the establishment of the capital. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice D V S S Somayajulu observed that they were only concerned with the legality of the impugned legislations and they would only adjudicate whether there were any shortcomings in the decision-making process. On the fourth day of the daily hearing on the batch of petitions filed challenging the twin legislations brought in by the state government to trifurcate the capital, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao argued on behalf of the farmers saying that besides violation of doctrine of legitimate expectations and promissory estoppel, there was no basis and rationale for bringing twin legislations in the name of decentralised development. He argued against reasons cited by the state government stating the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act was bad in law as there was resentment in other regions of the state on the centralised model of the capital. He said that the very statement was opposite of the truth as actual resentment came after the twin legislations were made. There was no objection from anyone in the state to the location of the capital, land pooling scheme and the notified master plan and the resentment started after the state government tried to undo the capital. Unnam Murlidhar Rao, who also argued for the farmers, said the allegation by the state government that the location of the capital was decided without considering the recommendations of Sivaramakrishnan committee was false. The state government even consulted the Sivaramakrishnan committee before taking the decision on the location of the capital. The land pooling scheme was one among the three alternatives suggested by the Sivaramakrishnan committee report to acquire required land for the purpose of the construction of capital. Even the doubts expressed by the Sivaramakrishnan committee over legal problems that may arise if the land pooling option is exercised by the state government without legislative backing were also addressed by enacting APCRDA Act. So, the genesis for APCRDA Act flows from Sivaramakrishnan committee that was constituted by the Union government as part of the State Reorganisation Act, he said.

Thambelu Seeta, alias Nirmala (25) from Kotagunnalu village, and Pangi Lachi, alias Shailu (20) from Thatidavulu village under Kudumusari panchayat in Chintapalli mandal of the Agency area joined the Maoist ranks three years ago and worked as party members of Pedabayalu area committee squad, which was one of the strongest committees in the AOB area but has now been considerably weakened following the surrender of its commander Chikkudu Chinna Rao recently. Visakha rural SP B Krishna Rao said Nirmal and Shailu joined the party at a young age and served as militia members for six months before being inducted into the squad. Both were important members of the squad as they belong to local primitive tribe group and have good knowledge of the remote villages and forest routes. Nirmala was reportedly involved in a recent IED blast in which two shepherds died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/two-woman-maoists-lay-down-arms/articleshow/87786877.cms||Siva G

This is the first time that many teaching hospitals will get new wings and regular posts of faculty after several decades. While all teaching posts, including professor, associate and assistant professors will be filled through regular recruitment system, nurses and other staff will be roped in through a contract system. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has been very particular about streamlining the public healthcare system since taking over the reins of the state. The state government has already launched the modernisation and upgradation of infrastructure in medical colleges and government hospitals under the Nadu-Nedu project. Taking the challenges posed by Covid-19 into consideration, the chief minister directed the officials not to keep the vacancies in the health department unfilled for years together. In fact, the state government had appointed nearly 10,000 staffers including medical officers and paramedical staff on temporary basis during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. With a long-term vision to upgrade the government medical colleges into national level premier institutions, the chief minister asked the health department to strengthen them as per the National Medical Council (NMC) standards. He wanted that no government medical college forego seats for want of faculty or infrastructure. Following the chief minister’s instructions, director of medical education (DME) conducted a comprehensive survey in all the medical colleges and readied a blueprint on existing vacancies and new departments to be established in view of the growing needs of patients. Similarly, director of public health and commissioner of AP Vaidya Vidhana Parishad (APVVP) have also carried out a study on the vacancies of doctors and paramedical staff in the district hospitals and primary healthcare centres (PHCs). After going through the requirements, the government has granted green signal to all three wings of the health departments to recruit nearly 10,865 staffers, including professors, in the medical colleges. Interestingly, the government has allowed for filling about 7,390 posts, which have been lying vacant for several decades. Another 3,475 posts have been newly created in view of the latest requirements of the medical colleges and hospitals. The YSRC government has already readied proposals for construction of 16 new medical colleges in the public sector. Three medical colleges have been given the green signal from the Centre and the state government is waiting for the Centre’s nod for the remaining medical colleges. The new medical colleges have been proposed taking the proposed formation of new districts into consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-hospitals-to-get-over-10k-docs-nurses/articleshow/87786658.cms||Samdani MN

The accused constable, identified as Shravan Kumar and attached to Vadapalli police station, was apprehended while he was attempting to bypass the security by driving the patrol vehicle. He was arrested when cops found 650 bottles of liquor in the patrol vehicle. Koteswara Rao, a notorious liquor smuggler from Narasaraopet, who was in the vehicle was also arrested. Cops said there were allegations of liquor smuggling against Shravan in the past as well which prompted them to search the vehicle when it was transiting the check-post. A case under relevant sections of AP Excise (Amendment) Act 2020 has been filed against the two at Dachepalli police station. Meanwhile, a departmental inquiry has been initiated against the accused constable who has been placed under suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/constable-held-for-smuggling-liquor/articleshow/87786906.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: As cops strengthen anti-drug drive, more traffickers come under scrutiny||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to anti-drug enforcement drives, Andhra Pradesh saw a 119% increase in cases registered under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and an 86% increase in the number of those arrested this year compared to 2020, according to official data from AP Police. A total of 2,039 cases have been registered from January to October 2021 and 5,411 persons were arrested. Out of these, a total 2.69 lakh kilograms of ganja have been seized. The figures stand as a major record based on a comparative analysis of ganja enforcement data during the last 10 years. For instance, compared to 2019, ganja cases in 2021 saw a 151% increase. District-wise data show Visakhapatnam at number one position with 972 cases registered against accused dealing with ganja. East Godavari follows at second place with 319 cases. Interestingly, Guntur stands third, with 138 cases. Official sources indicate that Guntur and Krishna districts stand as a major transit point due to two National Highways, 16 and 65, crisscrossing the region. With the introduction of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) last year, ganja enforcement in the state saw a huge boost as the agency alone accounts for 14% of the ganja cases this year. In terms of other hard drugs, Andhra Pradesh saw a marginal four cases being registered. The seizure of hard drugs this year include 66 grams of LSD, 1 kilogram of MDMA, 15 Zolpidem SMG and 25 Pramadol. Officials note that they aren’t just focusing their enforcement on the supply side alone and in cities like Vijayawada, they are also focusing on the demand side by tracing details of the end-consumer. In Vijayawada, cops traced 550 alleged ganja addicts and provided counselling with the help of clinical psychologists and other experts. Most of the ganja produced in Agency areas are transported to metro cities like Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. “We have focused on enforcement strategically and apart from just hitting at smugglers, we have now began destroying ganja plantations in Agency areas; Rs 165 crore worth of ganja has been destroyed in four different mandals in Agency areas,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-cops-strengthen-anti-drug-drive-more-traffickers-come-under-scrutiny/articleshow/87786668.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The general secretary of the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, Indrajit Singh, told this newspaper on Thursday that hundreds of devotees walked through the lanes from Guru ka Bagh to Patna Sahib gurdwara as part of the ‘nagar kirtan’ ritual. “The ‘akhand path’ is over and the entire gurdwara has been illuminated with colourful lights,” he added. A large number of devotees have already arrived here from Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and other states to pay obeisance to Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. “What makes the occasion more auspicious is the fact that quite a few people belonging to other religions also visit the gurdwara and pray to Guru Nanak Dev ji,” Indrajit said. Talking about the four-day ‘Prakash Parv’ from January 6 to 9 in 2022, Indrajit claimed, “A larger number of people are expected to participate in the 355th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh leader, next year. Therefore, the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee will make elaborate arrangements for the devotees.” Meanwhile, the district administration has geared up to ensure the safety and well-being of the devotees during the 552nd ‘Prakash Parv’. The SDO of Patna City, Mukesh Ranjan, pointed out that adequate number of magistrates and policemen had been deployed near the gurdwara and its approach roads. “Since a huge crowd will assemble at the Kangan Ghat on the occasion of ‘Prakash Parv’, teams of National Disaster Response Force have been deputed there. Medical teams have also been roped in to ensure the safety of the devotees,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prakash-parv-gurdwara-decked-up-to-welcome-15k-devotees-today/articleshow/87786490.cms||VK Tripathi

The court also stayed the order of the single judge setting aside the memo issued by the panchayat raj department withholding 21% of the amount on the basis of vigilance inquiry. The high court earlier disposed 1,013 petitions that alleged the state government was not clearing the bills. The court directed the government to clear bills within a stipulated time. When the bills were not cleared, after considering the interlocutory applications moved by some of the petitioners, the court directed to pay the bills with interest. Challenging the single judge orders, the state government moved an appeal petition. Arguing on behalf of the government, advocate general S Sriram said there is no rule in MGNREGS that bills have to be paid with interest. He said the vigilance inquiry found large-scale irregularities where incomplete works were shown as completed on paper. The HC bench comprising Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice B Krishna Mohan issued notices to respondents to file counter affidavits and granted interim relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stay-on-single-judge-order-on-nregs-dues/articleshow/87786674.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Babu, speaking to reporters after attending a National Commission for Schedule Castes (NCSC) hearing, said he is yet to receive Rs 10 lakh compensation for serving nine years of prison sentence for a crime he did not commit and also two acres of land.

The police branded me (a rapist and murderer),” he said. Babu had filed a complaint against Vijayawada police with the NCSC in 2019 alleging he was being harassed under the guise of a ‘history sheet’ opened against him in 2012 while he was in jail. The NCSC issued summons to Vijayawada police and an assistant commissioner-ranked officer was sent to attend the hearing.

Without taking their names, Nitish came hard on leaders of the opposition parties who have been critical of the implementation of the prohibition policy and kept pointing to the unchecked movement of the vehicles that carried liquor after crossing the interstate borders. “They also have responsibility to make the prohibition policy a success as they were party to the making of the Act and had taken pledge to support it,” Nitish said, adding that the BJP that was in the opposition in 2016 had also supported it, and the department’s minster was from the Congress. Denying that he had any other engagement other than the check-up of his eyes in Delhi, Nitish said he would only visit Bihar Bhavan and the new building, Bihar Sadan, that has come up in the national capital. He added that the use of the word ‘bhakchonhar’ by RJD chief Lalu Prasad to describe Congress leader Bhakta Charan Das and the abuse hurled by deputy CM Renu Devi against agitating job seeking youths will not dent, damage or affect the image of Bihar. “Instead, those who have used those words have tarnished their own image,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-leaders-should-help-govt-check-illegal-liquor-trade-says-cm/articleshow/87786863.cms||Abhay Singh

Most vegetable shops in the city have stopped selling tomatoes considering their high price. Incessant rains due to the recent cyclone had an impact on tomato plantations in Chittoor district. Madanapalle, the biggest tomato market in the state, has seen poor yield and, as a result, traders are procuring tomatoes in Madanapalle for an all-time high price of Rs 95 per kilogram. The arrival of tomatoes at the Rajiv Gandhi Wholesale Market, Kaleswara Rao Market and at rythu bazaars across the city has come down significantly in recent days. “The price of tomatoes is nearly competing with that of gold. It is becoming tough for us to find fine quality tomatoes. Many farmers are harvesting poor quality tomatoes with a motive of earning some profits. But we are unable to sell them at meager margin,” said Akiveedu Rambabu, a wholesale trader in Kaleswara Rao market. Agriculture marketing authorities estimate that the cost of tomatoes may cross the mark of Rs 140 per kilogram in the next ten days as weathermen have predicted that another low pressure area is forming over the Bay of Bengal. Meanwhile, most retailers have stopped selling tomatoes. Many people have struck tomatoes off their shopping lists. “Petrol and diesel prices are much better than tomatoes. We are now making curries without tomatoes. Government should procure tomatoes from farmers and take necessary measures to control the price,” S Naga Ramya, a homemaker, demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/buyers-strike-tomato-off-shopping-lists/articleshow/87786887.cms||Venu Lanka

Sand reaches have been closed for the last three months due to floods in the Krishna river. The non-availability of sand, in particular, has slowed down construction activity. Sand is usually sold for Rs 350 per metric tonne at sand reaches. But an agency appointed by Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) is selling sand stored at stock yards after sand trucks were washed away in the Krishna river at Chevitikallu sand reach. The agency has fixed the price at Rs 680 per tonne, which is almost double the price at sand reaches. “It is not viable to buy sand from stock points. Cost of 10 metric tonnes of sand from Keesara stock point to Vijayawada city costs around Rs 12,000. We have stalled our constructions temporarily and are waiting for the price to come down,” said K Venkata Nagaraju, a member of Capital Region Builder Association (CRBA). “The cost of cement has crossed Rs 390 per bag in the city and we urge the government to consider our problems,” he said. Masons, daily labourers, carpenters, and workers involved in iron bending and painting have been hit with the slow down. “Construction activity has reduced drastically in recent times. Painting works are done at the final stage and the majority of constructions have been stalled midway. It may take several months to revive the activity. We are going for domestic works to feed our family,” said K Rambabu, a painter from Maruti Nagar. Building workers’ associations have strongly opposed the sand supply system and demanded the state government regulate the prices of sand and cement.

They observed that a sizeable number of patients, who have had Covid in the past, were forced to approach private practitioners and hospitals and bear out-of-pocket expenditure, as the specialised OPD service had been shut at most civic and government-run hospitals. Apart from fatigue, breathlessness and lung diseases, members of the Covid task force and doctors have identified diabetes as yet another complication of the disease. Against this backdrop, there was a growing need for special OPD services for post-Covid patients, the experts were unanimous. “Quite a few of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run hospitals have closed post-Covid OPDs overall active Covid cases took a nosedive post-August this year. But they should realize that a sizeable number of patients still require these services as long-term after-effects are known in Covid even after months of full recovery,” said public health expert Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter. The trend of active Covid caseload has dropped to below 2,000 in Pune district for the first time despite a lot of mingling and overcrowding during and after the recent festive period. Sanjeev Wavare, nodal officer of the PMC’s Covid mitigation plan, said, “There were seven PMC-run hospitals offering post-Covid OPD services till recently. Currently, the PMC’s Naidu hospital and state-run Sassoon hospital offer post-Covid OPD services. We will resume services at the other centres, if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-want-pmc-to-resume-post-ncov-opds/articleshow/87787644.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The agitating students also warned SP members not to use the name of the varsity for their “political benefits”. A research scholar of the university, Imran Khan, said that recently some people had joined SP in Lucknow in presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav, and Azmi portrayed them as AMU students. “Students of Moradabad Hindu College were shown as AMU students which is incorrect and unacceptable,” he added. “We will expose the politicians who betrayed the Muslim community,” Khan said, adding that they will remind their community members that "whatever happened in Gujarat was repeated in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar, and that they should never forget this when they cast their votes in the upcoming assembly elections." The 2013 riots happened just about a year after SP swept the UP polls. The ruling party was blamed for mishandling the situation when communal riots broke out in the district. Showing posters that read ‘AMU never supported Akhilesh Yadav', the students categorically denied any announcement of support to the opposition party. Former cabinet member of AMU students’ union Mateen Ashraf, who is pursuing post-graduation, said Akhilesh and Azmi had shown no concern about their community members for the past four-and-a-half years, but suddenly they have started using the university's name for political gains. “How could they use the name of the varsity on their own?” he questioned, adding that they were trying to establish a different narrative ahead of the state elections. In the 2017 assembly elections, Muslim representation plummeted from 17.1% in 2012 to 5.9%. India’s most populous state has 38.4 million Muslims. In 2017, 24 Muslim candidates were elected to the legislative assembly, and of these 14 had won earlier from the same constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-students-deny-sps-claims-of-their-support-to-party/articleshow/87786856.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolkata||Schools in Kolkata plan to shift tests offline for classes IX & XI||KOLKATA: Many schools in the city, after discussions with parents, have decided that students of classes IX and XI will no longer write their exams online. This transition will help wean them off the virtual mode where students started taking exams lightly and had lost the habit of sitting in a hall scenario to write their papers. Since IX and XI are pre-board years, they need to be jerked out of the comfort of inertia. Schools feel that a big learning gap has already set in because of the virtual exams where marks were easily scored because of the myriad unfair methods that children had adopted. Meetings with parents revealed they are also looking forward to kids writing “real” exams now. “Travelling to school, sitting in an exam hall without any support, comprehending a question paper and tackling it is a positive struggle that each school child should physically go through. Online exams were a part of the online classes, which have had their day,” said Seema Sapru, principal of The Heritage School. Here the term exams are beginning for classes IX and XI on Monday — exclusively in the physical mode. Parents are supportive of the move. If someone is sick, the child can take another physical exam after recovering. The unit tests for classes IX and XI will begin in the physical mode at South City International School from December 6. On Thursday, a webinar was held where principal John Bagul told Class XI students, with parents in the background, that all exams will now be in the physical mode. “Students were habitually taking the exam easy. With the help of parents, we are trying our best to help them shake it off. There will be initial adjustment problems, which will definitely be overcome,” he said. Since more than 80% of children have started coming to school in classes IX and XI, DPS Newtown has decided unit tests should be shifted to the offline mode. “Children are back in large numbers, so there is no reason why they should write the test from home,” said principal Sonali Sen. Two sets of question papers will be prepared by Asian International School and classes will be split into halves for the physical tests for classes IX and XI. “Parents are eager that children start writing “real” tests,” said principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar. There used to be at least 20 toppers every time an exam was held online, be it a unit test or a term exam, said John Ghosh, secretary and principal of St Thomas Boys School, Kidderpore. “We have over 90% children of classes IX and XI attending and so exams will only be offline,” he said. Tirthankar Sarkar, whose son Ayushman is a student of Class XI at DPS Ruby Park, said, “Since my child is back on campus, the next best thing is to write exams on campus.” Ritwick Bhattacharjee, whose daughter Yashamoti is in Class XI at GD Goenka School, said, “Unless they start writing exams in the physical mode again, they will not be able to shake off this lethargy towards studies.” More buses on roads soon:Several bus owners have said reopening of schools and colleges have led to them deciding to increase frequency on all routes except in Esplanade and Sector V, where response is poor. Swapan Ghosh of Minibus Operators’ Coordination Committee said they have finalized routes which will see a 10%-20% augmentation in order to begin services from 7am next Monday. Tapan Banerjee of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate said they will run a few buses early in the morning as there was “positive feedback regarding college students”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-plan-to-shift-tests-offline-for-classes-ix-xi/articleshow/87787591.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

A mass order placed by Kolkata Municipal Corporation has also accentuated the demand. Seizing the opportunity, shops have hiked prices. Some shops in Hatibagan and Gariahat ran out of mosquito nets and had to reorder after they failed to anticipate the rise in demand. “Usually, we sell around 25-30 mosquito nets during this season and have another 20-odd in stock. But this time, the entire stock was exhausted earlier this week. We are now getting fresh stock,” said Dhiren Das, a salesman at a bedding store in Hatibagan. At the city’s mosquito net hub in Chetla, where shops do both wholesale and retail business, sales are up nearly 8%-10%. “People seem to have suddenly realised the utility of mosquito nets,” said Swapan Sarkar who runs a store there. Park Circus resident Sneha Mukherjee is among many who have begun using mosquito nets. “I last used one around three decades ago. The only alternative was the suffocating mosquito coil. But after the introduction of mats and liquid repellants, use of mosquito nets ceased. But with fever causing so much anxiety since the pandemic, I decided to revert to mosquito nets,” she said. Admitting that overlapping symptoms of Covid, malaria, dengue and flu made it difficult to understand what was happening till diagnostic tests were carried out, doctors said people should take precautions against mosquito bites just like wearing masks against Covid. Nizam Khan, who sits at the familyowned five-decade-old wholesale store in Chetla, said a KMC order added to the demand spurt this year. Alarmed by the rise in malaria and dengue cases, KMC ordered 20,000 mosquito nets for distribution among slum- and pavement dwellers. “We have been distributing them in the affected boroughs with help from cops,” said a KMC official. This year, 8,000 people across four boroughs have tested positive for malaria, a rise of 60% against last year. Over 60% of these cases are falciparum or malignant malaria. Some areas where the number of infected is high include Burrabazar, Jorabagan, Beadon Street, Rabindra Sarani, College Street, Elliot Road, Entally, Park Circus, Taltala, Amherst Street and Bidhan Sarani. Similarly, dengue cases have also gone up with around 1,000 people testing positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mosquito-nets-in-demand-prices-go-up-as-dengue-fear-strikes-city/articleshow/87787610.cms||Saikat Ray

The man had taken a loan of Rs 3.81 lakh and claims to have repaid Rs 4.65 lakh, but two moneylenders are saying that he still owes them Rs 24 lakh. The moneylenders have allegedly threatened to kill him if he fails to repay the loan. According to police, the victim identified as Jai Prakash Sharma, a native of Jheegar Badi village in Sikar district, has lodged a complaint of extortion against two persons. “In this complaint, Sharma stated that he had taken Rs 3.81 lakh loan from one Murlidhar Sharma and another person and had paid Rs 4.65 lakh to them on time. However, both the accused have told him that he still owes them Rs 23.61 lakh. In the complaint he has also stated that both the persons have threatened him to kill if he fails to pay the amount they are asking for,” said police. Sharma in the complaint added that he had taken the money on February 7, 2018 and had also given them two blank cheques and one blank stamp paper. “Both have also threatened him that they will deposit the cheques given by him and when the cheque would be disowned by the bank, they will drag him in a case of cheque bounce,” the officer added. He has added that both have also threatened that either he should transfer his land to them or should pay Rs 23.61 lakh. “The victim lodged a complaint when his father was abused by the accused.

If you want to catch a glimpse of the deadly jaws residing in Vishwamitri river, then join in the Croc Walk organized as a part of the People’s Heritage Festival on Sunday. In a bid to spread awareness about the crocodiles that have been co-existing with Barodians since decades, a first-of-its-kind crocodile walk has been organized in the city. “Barodians usually see or hear about crocodiles during the monsoons when many reptiles venture out on the roads. But not many know about the crocodiles, their habitat, how they survive in Vishwamitri and why the river is important for the city’s eco-system,” said Vishal Thakur who has organized the walk. “So, we decided to organize a crocodile walk and take people along the Vishwamitri river bank,” he added. “Apart from getting a closer look of the reptile, participants will also get an idea about how crocodiles have been coexisting with humans. It will help in spreading awareness about the crocodiles and other living beings of the river,” Thakur told TOI.  The forest department census conducted last year revealed that about 270 crocodiles reside in Vishwamitri river. Apart from the Croc Walk, a heritage tree walk has been organized by Dr Jitendra Gavali and Chandrashekhar Patil on Saturday on the ONGC Road wherein the duo will talk about the trees planted along the road, their diversity and fruiting season. “Vadodara is home to a variety of trees including many rare ones. The tree walk will be about the diversity and importance of these trees,” Patil said. Sanjay Soni will also organize a heritage walk on November 22 wherein he will take people on Navnath Temple tour explaining the importance of all the nine temples of Lord Shiva in the city. On Sunday, art historian Sandip Joshi will also organize a Baroda Museum Walk wherein he will take citizens through the museum in Sayajibaug and explain the sculptures and paintings. On November 22, numismatic expert Zubair Motiwala will organize a Coin Museum Walk on Ajwa Road. Samir Gaiwkad has organized a heritage cycle ride wherein the riders will be taken to the step wells in different areas of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/get-up-close-with-the-deadly-jaws/articleshow/87787121.cms||Tushar Tere

SHO of Kasim Bazaar police station Dharmendra Kumar said at least 20 rounds were fired by the two groups. “One of the groups was from side of would-be-bridegroom G P Yadav who had organised a ‘tilak’ ceremony in the village. Several guests had reached his residence from Sandalpur and neighbouring areas. The bikes of these guests were parked on a village road which led to the dispute,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-shot-dead-over-parking-dispute-in-munger-five-injured/articleshow/87786998.cms||---
---||Patna||Make abolition of prohibition RJD’s poll plank: JD(U) to Tejashwi||PATNA: JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjn Singh alias Lalan Singh on Thursday dared leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to include abolition of prohibition in the election manifesto of the RJD. Reacting to Tejashwi’s charges against the state government, Singh said, “If Tejashwi is so vocal about prohibition in the state, he should include abolition of prohibition in his party’s election manifesto.” The Munger MP, however, reiterated that prohibition would continue in the state. “The government is serious about the effective implementation of prohibition law in Bihar. Adequate measures are being taken for this purpose,” he added. Referring to opposition’s remarks over appointment of senior IAS officer K K Pathak as additional chief secretary in prohibition, excise and registration department, the JD(U) national chief said, “It’s the prerogative of the state government to appoint officials. Will the state government now seek suggestion from Tejashwi before posting officers? It’s none of his business.” He clarified that Pathak was posted as excise commissioner when the draft for prohibition in the state was prepared in 2016. Tejashwi had earlier alleged that smuggling of liquor continued in dry state with the tacit support of the senior officials of the state government. He also alleged that the purpose of prohibition has been defeated with unabated bootlegging. Meanwhile, HAM(S) headed by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has decided to convene next national working committee meeting at Valmikinagar in West Champaran on December 16 to discuss various issues, including effective implementation of prohibition in the state. HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan said besides the party’s national chief, the minister for SC/ST welfare department, Santosh Kumar Suman, and executive committee members of other states would attend the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-abolition-of-prohibition-rjds-poll-plank-jdu-to-tejas/articleshow/87786905.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Experts: Exercise regularly, say ‘no’ to steroids||PATNA: With the onset of the winter season, doctors have advised Patnaites to perform physical exercise and yoga every day. They have, however, cautioned youngsters against the use of artificial supplements and steroids. According to weather experts, the minimum temperature of the city has been hovering around 14-16 degrees Celsius during the last few days. Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, a physician, urges people to follow healthy habits and exercise in order to remain fit. “Cardiac patients should, however, avoid early morning walks because the blood pressure tends to rise in the winter season. People suffering from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should also avoid exposure to cold weather,” Dr Diwakar says, adding that precautions should be taken to prevent flu. Dr Shashi Pratap Sahi, the principal of A N College, echoes similar views and asks people to walk or perform yoga regularly. He claims, “I have been walking in the Patna zoo for the last 20 years.” Health experts also advise people, especially youngsters, to work out in gyms, but caution them against the consumption of steroids and artificial supplements. The former director of the health department, Dr R N Pandey, points out, “One cannot lead a healthy life solely by building muscles. Being healthy means that a person is mentally, physically and spiritually fit.” Shamsad Alam, a physical trainer at a gym on Ashiana-Digha Road, says, “There are many trainers who advise people to take steroids, but they can sometimes be fatal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-exercise-regularly-say-no-to-steroids/articleshow/87786600.cms||---

---||Business||Paytm’s 27% crash on debut worst among IPOs over Rs 1,000 crore||MUMBAI: The much-anticipated listing of Paytm, which had raised Rs 18,300 crore in India’s biggest IPO, ended on a bitter note with the stock crashing 27% from its issue price of Rs 2,150, closing at Rs 1,564. At the debut-day close, the plunge in Paytm stock was the worst for any newly listed company that had an IPO of over Rs 1,000 crore. The sharply lower closing also eroded about Rs 38,000 crore worth of investors’ wealth. From a market capitalisation of Rs 1.39 lakh crore (about $20 billion) at the IPO price, the company, a pioneer in tech-enabled payment solutions, is now valued at Rs 1.01 lakh crore (about $13.6 billion) that makes it the 52nd most valued company in India. The listing was for One 97 Communications that operates Paytm. The closing price was 20% below the price discovered during the hour-long pre-listing session. Technically, the stock closed at the lower circuit, which is also leading to fears among marketmen that it may fall further on Monday when trading begins after the extended weekend. What has added to those fears is a report by Australian financial services major Macquarie that put a price target of Rs 1,200 for the stock. Despite the sharp value erosion on its debut session on Dalal Street, Paytm still has a market capitalisation that is more than that of large companies like Hindalco, Coal India and BPCL. At Thursday’s close, Paytm is valued about Rs 6,000 crore more than Coal India, the largest coal producer in the world that so far had India’s biggest IPO when in October 2010 it raised about Rs 15,200 crore. However, in contrast to Paytm’s sliding stock price on listing, on its market debut in early November 2010, Coal India had rallied nearly 40%. Currently, Paytm is worth below the $16 billion valuation that the company had got in 2019, when it raised $1 billion from SoftBank, ANT and other investors. When the bidding for Paytm IPO closed on November 10, the offer was oversubscribed 1.9 times, mainly on the back of institutional and retail investors. After setting a listing price of Rs 1,955 during the pre-open session, the stock lost ground through the session and closed at the day’s low. The Macquarie report, titled ‘Too many fingers in too many pies’, noted that the company had a “complicated organisation structure, related-party transactions, churn in top management and a thinly staffed board with 75% of members being based out of India”. Analysts at Macquarie believe that for Paytm, obtaining a small finance bank licence could be difficult “given that Chinese-controlled firms own more than a 30% stake” in it. The Paytm management said that the analysts had never approached the company to understand its business model. The sharp selloff in Paytm after listing also affected the pricec of some of the recently listed companies, market players said. Policybazaar closed 8% lower, while Zomato closed 1.3% lower and Nykaa lost a marginal 0.3% on Thursday, BSE data showed. The day’s session also saw the sensex close 372 points lower at 59,636. In the last three sessions, the index has lost nearly 1,100 points as inflation in the US has risen sharply and foreign funds have been on a selling spree in recent weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytms-27-crash-on-debut-worst-among-ipos-over-rs-1k-cr/articleshow/87788510.cms||---
---||Pune||WFH helped men to see women in new light||PUNE: A business analyst working in Bengaluru returned to Pune to live with his parents after he was given the pink slip a few months after the pandemic hit India. He was worried and tense but his mother and sister came to his rescue by starting a tiffin service and making enough money to run the house without his contribution. “I never knew that my sister and mother had an entrepreneurial spirit in them. As an MBA graduate, I volunteered to help them with the business side of things but found that they already had a well-functioning system in place. The women of the house have been the breadwinners since and I see them in a new light now,” said the 27-year-old resident of Hadapsar. With the theme of the International Men’s Day, celebrated on November 19, being ‘better relations between men and women’, TOI turns the spotlight on the changing dynamics between men and women since the pandemic started. As work from home became the norm during the initial months of the pandemic and the lockdown, it helped many to change their notions of household work and about the role played by their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters as they juggled different roles with courage, confidence and professionalism --- attributes generally associated with men. Karthik Agarwal, IT professional manager, said, “I have always avoided confrontation with my colleagues. But while working from home I saw my wife, a purchase manager, boldly voicing her opinion with her colleagues and clients and managing difficult situations with confidence.” Krishna TN found that housework was no joke as he started participating in household chores. “I learnt that whether it is spreading out the laundry, dusting the furniture, sweeping, mopping or doing the dishes, there is a science and art to everything, which women do effortlessly.” Suhail Badri , a tourism entrepreneur, said,“Ever since my daughter started working two years ago, I thought she was splurging all her money on shopping online. But during the pandemic, my 23-year-old was working from home, cooking and distributing food to Covid-affected families, volunteering with various groups to facilitate vaccination, and running our house, all with her own savings.” But while some took the initiative to share household responsibilities and supported their professional ambitions, others found it a tad difficult to get along. “Many couples have had problems arising from ego issues,” said psychologist Aishwariya Sanavaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wfh-helped-men-to-see-women-in-new-light/articleshow/87787674.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Ahmedabad||63-year-old man’s throat slit in Acher||Ahmedabad: A 63-year-old man from Chandkheda was found with his throat slit at another house belonging to him, at Thakorvas in Acher, in the wee hours of Wednesday, police said. The officers investigating the murder said the victim may have been killed due to a dispute in his homosexual relationship and they have zeroed in on the suspect. According to the FIR filed at Sabarmati police station, the deceased, Devendra Rawat, a resident of Dhartinagar Society in Chandkheda, had retired from his job at a private firm in Vadodara in 2018. “On Tuesday at around 3pm, Rawat got a call from a man who told him to accompany him to a jewellery shop so he could buy a gold chain for his mother. Rawat’s wife Geeta Rawat told cops about the man, whom she does not know,” said a police officer. The officer said Rawat’s wife asked him about the man and he responded that he lived in Vatva and had got a bonus and wanted to buy a gold chain for his mother. At around 5pm on Thursday, Rawat left home to meet that man and did not return till 8pm. After this, his wife called her nephew Manoj Chaudhary and expressed concern about Rawat, who was incommunicado. Chaudhary, who was in Kalol at the time, told her that he would go to Rawat’s other house in Thakorvas at Acher and would inquire about him. At around 1.15am on Wednesday, Chaudhary reached Rawat’s home in Thakorvas where he found him lying in pool of blood with his throat cut. Rawat’s family informed police about the murder and a team of Sabarmati police reached the spot and began an investigation. Rawat’s wife told the cops that her husband’s gold chain, mobile phone and motorcycle were stolen from the house in Acher. Police officers first began inquiry on the angle of robbery but after they found Rs 200 cash in his pocket and spoke to local residents, they learned the murder took place due to a dispute in Rawat’s homosexual relationship. The officers said only Rawat’s cellphone and motorcycle were taken by the killer. Sources in the police said they have zeroed in on the person who called Rawat before he went incommunicado.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/63-year-old-mans-throat-slit-in-acher/articleshow/87766772.cms||---

---||Meerut||2 UP journos, booked for 'rioting' in 1987, discharged by court 34 yrs on||MEERUT: Rakesh Garg and Rakesh Goel, two journalists who worked at a Hindi daily in Saharanpur, UP, have been discharged by a civil court 34 years after they were booked for "rioting". Goel died in 2018 after a prolonged illness. Garg is now 64. The court said that discharging the two accused in the "ancient" case "did not harm public interest" as the UP government in 1991, under chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, had already asked the court, via an affidavit, to take back all charges against the accused. The Saharanpur court in its order, a copy of which is with TOI, said that the government had initiated proceedings to take back the case in March 1991 but the affidavit had "some technical errors". The court started proceedings to discharge the accused 11 years later, in 2002, after receiving a revised affidavit from the government. Proceedings continued for the next 19 years and the accused kept making rounds of the court. “It took 34 years for the court to discharge the two and come to the conclusion that the charges framed against them shouldn’t have been there in the first place. The government had already asked the court to revoke the charges against the accused. It took over three decades for the judiciary to give them a fair chance,” said Abhay Saini, lawyer of the two and president of the local bar association. The journalists were accused of "raising provocative slogans" during a procession that was passing near a Saharanpur mosque in 1987. They were sent to jail and the police booked them under sections 147 (rioting), 153 (provocation to riot), 153(a) (promoting disharmony), and 353 (assault to deter public servant) of the IPC. The then Congress government of chief minister Vir Bahadur Singh had also initially slapped charges against the duo under the National Security Act, 1980. The journalists spent time behind bars for a month, before those charges were taken back. The case then proceeded under relevant sections of the IPC. Garg, who was 30 at the time of the incident, said that he was on a reporting assignment and wasn’t participating in the procession. He said the charges pressed on him deprived him of a permanent job, bank loans, and compromised his reputation in society. He told TOI that the procession was the Ram Rath Yatra, which is an annual affair at the Gangoh area of Saharanpur. "That particular year saw more festivities as the Vishva Hindu Parishad's movement was picking pace," he added. “I was the one who was pacifying the crowd, asking them not to raise slogans. All I did was urge the administration to allow the procession to move forward, based on the request of the organisers of the yatra. Police booked me for no reason. I think I became a victim of politics,” Garg said. Police, while booking the two journalists, said they "raised anti-minority slogans and pushed PAC personnel".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-up-journos-booked-for-rioting-in-1987-discharged-by-court-34-yrs-on/articleshow/87786890.cms||Ishita Mishra

Tirth Devang Shah, who recently cleared his HSC examination, died of brain haemorrhage on November 17 at New Era Hospital. Tirth had a fall from his bike due to some dizziness on November 14. This was followed by episodes of vomiting in the evening. However, he was fine. He had his dinner and went to sleep. On November 15, his grandfather went to his room to wake him up, but he had stopped responding by then. Family members got him admitted to New Era hospital. Despite 3 days of treatment, his condition deteriorated and the team of doctors declared him brain dead on November 17. “The young boy had a fall due to bleeding in brain but it was not realized as he started feeling better. When he reached the hospital in critical condition, probably after 24 hours of the fall, it was very difficult to save him,” said neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal. After doctors declared him brain dead, his parents Darshana and Devang as well as grandfather Jayantibhai took the decision to donate his organs. After being formally counselled by Dr Ashwini Choudary, they agreed to donate all organs, including heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and eyes. Zonal Transplant Coordination Center’s (ZTCC) Nagpur team sent a national alert for heart and lungs. “The heart was allotted to a patient admitted to MGM Hospital, Chennai. But as the recipient could not afford the chartered flight cost, the offer was declined. Similarly, lungs could not be transported due to logistic reasons,” said ZTCC coordinator Veena Wathore. “Even after death, Tirth moved into a new life by being the hero who donated his organs and gave the gift of life to three people,” said Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital where one kidney and liver was transplanted to needy patients on Thursday. “The enthusiasm and preparedness of the parents and relatives for donating all organs needed to be seen to be believed. They were disheartened as the heart and lungs could not be donated due to logistic reasons,” said Dr Sanjay Kolte, secretary of ZTCC. ZTCC President Dr Vibhavari Dani said the time has now come to mull over logistical cost hindrance, especially at government level. “Serious rethinking is necessary for lowering such costs to save lives of the needy and underprivileged sections of the society,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/family-takes-lead-to-donate-organs-of-18-yr-old-braindead-son/articleshow/87787684.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Varanasi||Sant Samiti seeks apology from Akhilesh Yadav over his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark||Varanasi: National general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (AKSS) Swami Jitendranand Saraswati on Thursday demanded an apology from Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav for his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark, telling him to “either express an apology to the seers’ fraternity or get ready to face their ire”. On Wednesday, in an apparent attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘saffron politics’ at a rally during the fourth phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ on Purvanchal Expressway at Pakhanpura area in Ghazipur, Akhilesh had reportedly called holy saffron-clad saints ‘chillumjeevi’ (users of pipe used for smoking tobacco or intoxicants) and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of one particular colour).” Swami Jitendranand said, “In his bid to target the BJP and its leadership, the SP chief has insulted the saffron-clad seers and their fraternity by terming them as ‘chillumjeevi’ and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of the same colour).” The Swami also defended Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in view of the SP chief’s remark. “Yogi Ji is the head of one of the prime peeths of Sanatan Dharma which is worshipped and honoured since ancient times. Nobody has the right to victimize Yogi for the sake of dirty politics and just because he has become a chief minister,” said Swami Jitendranand. “The SP chief should immediately apologise for the remarks and avoid dragging seers in the political battlefield for petty electoral gains,” said Swami Jitendranand, cautioning Akhilesh that “he will have to face the ire of saffron-clad seers as they will go door-to-door to expose his views”. He added that the “Sant Samaj (seers’ community) will soon launch a campaign against the Samajwadis and Congress leaders targeting the seers’ fraternity for political gains”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sant-samiti-seeks-apology-from-akhilesh-yadav-over-his-chillumjeevi-remark/articleshow/87788350.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Varanasi||NEET solvers’ gang mastermind ‘PK’, aide arrested in Varanasi||(Revised copy with updates) Varanasi: The Commissionerate police on Thursday arrested Pravin Kumar alias ‘PK’ alias Neelesh, the Patna-based mastermind of the solvers’ gang busted during NEET (UG)-2021 here on September 12, and his close aide Ritesh. Their arrest took place a few hours after the announcement of a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on PK, against whom a local court had issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW). Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “PK and Ritesh were arrested from the Ring road under the limits of Sarnath police station area. Ritesh, a clerk in culture and youth affairs department and posted at the secretariat of Bihar government in Patna, is married to PK’s sister Priya, who is a doctor at a PHC in Chhapra. Her involvement in the gang has also come to light in the ongoing investigations.” “PK, who belongs to Chhapra district and posed as a doctor, had settled in Patna following the retirement of his father from the industry department in 1990,” police said. “He had formed the solvers’ gang about six years ago. With the help of Ritesh he used to get the exam papers of different competitive examinations of UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar or arrange impersonators for gullible aspirants after charging huge amounts — from Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 49 lakh. With the wealth created from these illegal activities, he had constructed several multi-storied buildings in Patna, Danapur, purchased plots and luxury SUVs,” the police added. The process for announcing the cash reward on PK had been initiated after issuance of NBW against him and it was approved on Thursday morning. Before announcing the cash reward on PK, the CP said that cash rewards of Rs 20,000 had also been announced on each of his accomplices — Mrityunjay Debnath and Dr Afroz — as they were also absconding and have not surrendered before the court so far. With the progress in investigation, a medico of KGMU Osama Shahid, Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia, Raju Kumar of Jehanabad in Bihar and father of an aspirant Tapan Saha from Tripura have been arrested so far. The arrests started after the gang was busted by the police with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from a NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under the limits of Sarnath police station in Varanasi. Of the 25 aspirants in contact with the gang, 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine skipped the exam. The National Testing Agency withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for two years from appearing in the exam. “Police summoned the 16 candidates for recording their statements and to take their fingerprints. They have started appearing before the investigation team and their statements are being recorded with videography,” the CP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-mastermind-pk-aide-arrested-in-varanasi/articleshow/87788361.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Meerut||Good Oct rains make Haiderpur Wetland ideal for migratory birds: Experts||Bijnor: With water bodies brimming due to heavy rainfall in October, the forest department expects a good turnout of migratory birds from Europe and central Asia this winter in Haiderpur Wetland. Spanning an area of 12,00 hectares across Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor districts, the wetland is part of the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. The wetland lies in the Central Asian Flyway and is an important stopover for the avian visitors such as Bar-headed goose, Ruddy Shelduck, Gadwall, Eurasian Wigeon, Spot-billed duck, Northern Shoveler, Northern Pintail and Eurasian Teal. The forest department is making all-out efforts to attract tourists and bird-watchers to visit the wetland to see the feathered visitors wintering. Over 16,000 birds of 114 species were spotted in Haiderpur Wetland and at least 3,600 were sighted in Bijnor district on World Wetland Day last year. Two years ago, over 20,000 birds were spotted. Last year, there was a fall in numbers of birds as water in the Ganga and its adjacent Haiderpur Wetland had decreased drastically. But this time around, there is enough water. The Ganga is flowing with 36,000k cusecs of water. Joel Lyall, author of ‘Jungle Tale’, said, “The wetlands have enough water to retain the birds’ interest." Over the past one week, migratory birds have been spotted on the banks of the Ganga and various lakes like Haravili, Pili Dam and in the Afzalgarh area. Migratory birds were also spotted In some parts of Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said the department is making efforts to enlist the help of the villagers living along the Ganga and its tributaries that flow through the wetland to help in protecting and conserving the birds. Informers have been alerted against the movement of poachers. “We have urged the villagers not to dump garbage or animal carcasses near the banks of the rivers or lakes. We have appealed to them to avoid using pesticides in farmlands close to the wetlands to ensure a safe and clean environment for the migratory birds, “ said Semmaran." The Bijnor administration has even launched a campaign to adopt organic farming at the 25 villages along river Ganga. Umesh Mishra, district magistrate, said, "We are running a campaign to make the farmers aware about organic farming. Recently, during the Gangoysav programme, the farmers were trained to practice organic farming."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/good-oct-rains-make-haiderpur-wetland-ideal-for-migratory-birds-experts/articleshow/87786931.cms||Harveer Dabas

The date is fixed on November 26 after court work is over,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said. Earlier, Patil submitted DGCA’s certification along with the pursis informing that all NFC posts are filled up, every machinery is put in order and all aircraft are also in flying condition, except for CESSNA 172-R, as its one part is to be replaced/repaired. He added even this aircraft will be brought back in order within a week. “These documents show that DGCA has granted its approval for conducting flying training courses as specified in the certificate. Issuance of the certificate is a significant development and paved the way for NFC’s actual revival. Now, according to the Patil, nothing remains to be done and the club can start its training operations immediately,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing till December 2. Patil further informed that the decision will be taken for issuing advertisement for inviting applications from the interested candidates for joining the training programmes.  “The courses for which approval has been granted are Private Pilot License (PPL), Commercial Pilot License (CPL), IR Instrument Rating, Assistant Flying Instructor Rating (AFIR), Flying Instructor Rating (FIR) and extension of aircraft ratings on single engine. All these courses now shall be initiated,” he said. “We have accepted Patil’s submissions and appreciate efforts taken by the authorities for expediting the NFC’s revival. We also appreciate the promptitude shown by DGCA in considering the matter and granting certificate of approval,” the bench said. The court was hearing a PIL (No13/2016) filed by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate which was later pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the government’s apathy in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-judges-to-visit-flying-club-on-nov-26-with-petitioner-div-commissioner/articleshow/87787693.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

E-GP systems cater to the procurement and tendering requirements of various government departments and organizations. This partnership aims to ease the hassle of the existing systems by making more than 50 operational e-GP systems across the country interoperable, which, till now, work in silos. Director IIT-K Prof Abhay Karandikar said, “I am delighted for the team of CRUBN, who have come forward to help in developing a key blockchain network across the country to enrich the existing e-governance systems. This will help IIT-Kanpur in realising the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat in state-of-the-art technologies and making India a technology super power.” This blockchain network will be used for validating the claims of suppliers along with their identities. The proposed system will connect all the e-GP systems through a network and help retrieve and validate relevant supplier data between various e-GP Systems in use within India. The system will also digitize bank guarantees by powering them using the trust-based automation of Blockchain. When fully operational, this system will be a pan-India system that would reduce the time and cost associated with public procurements made using e-GP systems. CRUBN was incubated at IIT-K for phase-III of National Blockchain Project, funded by the National Security Council Secretariat and envisioned to build e-governance solutions using blockchain technology. IIT Kanpur’s C3i Center, funded by the SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board) is India’s first cyber security research and education centre in the field of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. Further, the C3i Hub (The Technology Innovation Hub funded by DST’s National Mission on Cyber Physical systems) established at IIT Kanpur helps in empowering the research, education, start-up ecosystem, and industrial collaboration in the field of cyber security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-incubated-crubn-to-ease-hassles-of-existing-e-governance-systems/articleshow/87788363.cms||---

Buses of state roadways would have to mandatorily carry a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate or face challan. A coordination meeting was held by the transport department with Delhi Traffic Police and district magistrates to enforce the ban. Delhi Traffic Police also issued an advisory prohibiting entry of trucks and said they had deployed teams at all pickets and 15 border areas to enforce the ban. Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Manish Kumar Agarwal said they were implementing all necessary measures advised to curb pollution. “We are talking to other departments, truck unions, drivers and owners to make adequate arrangements for proper parking and halting of vehicles outside Delhi’s borders. We have suggested that they use warehouses and transport hubs till further orders,” said Agarwal. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that 14 enforcement teams had been deployed by the government at the border entry points. The DMs had been asked to coordinate with their counterparts in the neighbouring districts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh so that trucks not destined for Delhi were diverted to expressways. In a letter to the neighbouring states, Kundra said, “Our enforcement teams have been given a clear mandate to impound and scrap any diesel vehicle older than 10 years found plying on Delhi roads. All stage carriage buses are required to carry a valid PUC certificate. The enforcement authorities are issuing challans to all vehicles found without a valid PUC in Delhi.” The letter also mentioned that, according to Supreme Court orders, the governments of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan were required to provide large billboards at exit points towards alternate highways to inform commercial traffic of diversions. Till Thursday, at least 500 trucks had been stopped at Delhi’s borders. A police officer said they had discussed the action plan with traffic police in Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad.

---||Pune||Pune: Woman gets life imprisonment for poisoning 3-year-old son to death||PUNE: The court of additional sessions judge G P Agrawal here on Thursday convicted and sentenced Swati Vikram Malvadkar (29) to life imprisonment for poisoning her three-year-old son to death at her house at Rupeenagar in Nigdi on August 2, 2016. The court also imposed three years and six months sentences on Swati for administering poison and attempting suicide, under Sections 328 and 309 of the Indian Penal Code, respectively. The sentences are to run concurrently with the main punishment, the court said. Swati, who was granted bail on September 24, 2016, was taken into custody after the sentencing and sent to jail. Additional public prosecutor Leena Pathak told TOI, “The convict wanted to live separately from her joint family, and this was the cause of frequent quarrels with her husband, Vikram, whom she married on May 3, 2013. ” Judge Agrawal said that the minimum sentence for a conviction under Section 302 (murder) is life term and since the present case did not fall within the ambit of “rarest of rare case” to attract a death penalty, the convict shall suffer life imprisonment. The judge expressed anguish over “the manner in which a child was killed by his own birth giver.” On the day of the incident, Swati’s husband, who was at work, called his brother Shrikant around 1.45pm and asked him to check why Swati was not responding to his calls. When Shrikant reached home, he found both the three-year-old and Swati lying motionless. A saree was found entangled with the bedroom ceiling fan. The two were rushed to a nearby hospital where the child was declared dead, and Swati was referred for treatment. A post-mortem was conducted on the child and a chit, purportedly written by Swati was found in the pocket of the child’s pant. The Nigdi police registered an FIR and subsequent investigation led to Swati’s arrest on August 20, 2016. The police also recovered two bottles of Khatnil, an insecticide, and Temprid SC, used for controlling bed bugs, from the spot. The accused was subsequently charged for offences under Sections 302, 328 and 309 of the IPC. During the trial, the accused had taken a defence of false implication as her father-inlaw was a former police officer. She also referred to a domestic violence case she had registered against her husband and in-laws. The court, however, found substance in the prosecution’s argument that the domestic violence case, registered after Swati regained consciousness in the hospital, was an afterthought. Besides, her claims were not supported by apt evidence. On the contrary, the 13 witnesses examined by the prosecution, besides the evidence were found reliable, unshakable and credible, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-gets-life-imprisonment-for-poisoning-3-year-old-son-to-death/articleshow/87787696.cms||Vishwas Kothari

More than 300 employees of the civic body, equipped with heavy machinery, are involved in the drive. For the first time, such large-scale action against encroachments is being carried out here. Over the past couple of months, the KMC had carried out surveys. The focus was on encroachments in basements reserved for parking of vehicles for the visitors as well as encroachments along nullahs that cause obstruction to the natural flow of water. So far, seven basements in different parts of the city have been cleared. The basements had been rented out for commercial purposes, thus forcing visitors to park their vehicles along the roads. This caused traffic congestions in residential and commercial localities. Harshit Ghatage, KMC’s deputy city engineer, said, “The owners or operators of the establishments were asked to get the encroachments removed by themselves. Some did so, but many did not. Therefore, we had to strike down on the encroachments. Most of the basements were converted into shops and warehouses, which is illegal. We found such encroachments in hospital buildings and lodges also.” During the June floods, the issue of encroachments along the nullahs, especially the Jayanti nullah, was raised by the activists. “The survey, showed several temporary sheds and shop cabins. We demolished such encroachments,” said Ghatage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/major-drive-to-get-rid-of-encroachment-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/87786168.cms||---

More than half of the daily tests are rapid antigen tests (RAT) or done at private labs. This means that the workload on public facilities has drastically reduced giving them the liberty to perform other tasks.Civic health officials said as the testing facility doesn’t need much personnel, they are being sent for vaccination drive where more manpower is needed.The urban primary health centres (UPHCs) continue to offer RT-PCR and antigen tests which have sufficient stock of kits, but a few takers. Some additional centres which were started due to huge demand in second wave have been clubbed with nearby UPHCs or Covid Care Centre (CCCs).Zone officials said people needing a negative RT-PCR certificate for travelling to certain cities and some having symptoms of cough and cold are coming, but the numbers are pretty low. “We had discontinued services of additional manpower requisitioned from NUHM as per government directives. But now, they have been called again as the workload under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ is huge,” officials said.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said swab collection is going on. “As people are not coming for tests, we delegate other work to the staff. Yet, if someone needs a test, they can visit the UPHC,” he said.Medical microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed, who runs a private lab, said overall there is drop in footfalls. “Sometime back, pregnant women used to come regularly but now they seem to be preferring antigen tests. We mostly have people who wish to travel or have developed symptoms after returning from outstation. Some concerned local residents too come but as compared to others, they are very few in numbers,” he said.Testing over the monthsMonth -------------- TestsApril--------------6,90,983May --------------5,34,771June --------------2,74,488July --------------2,19,094Aug --------------1,45,368Sept --------------4,86,292Oct--------------98,592Nov* -------------- 81,372* Nov data till 17th.

Meanwhile, letters have been issued to the management of event organisers — hotels, restaurants, banquet halls, resorts, farmhouses, etc. — asking them to obtain a “bar licence” before serving liquor at the party and warning that if they are found serving liquor without prior permission in a party, FIR will be lodged against them. Following district magistrate CB Singh’s order to check illegal serving of liquor in wedding parties, the district excise department has swung into action. District excise officer (DEO) Uday Prakash said, “It is mandatory to get a single-day liquor licence issued after paying Rs 11,000. Thus far, three applications seeking a one-day licence have been received. Meanwhile, three teams from the excise department are searching event organisers’ premises to check illegal serving of liquor.” The DEO added that the licence could be obtained from the department after applying and paying the fee online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/muzaffarnagar-admin-makes-licence-mandatory-for-serving-liquor-in-weddings/articleshow/87786937.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Before this, the proposal will go to the Syndicate and it will be taken forward after approval. However, Syndicate members must first satisfy themselves that the vacancies created will not be questioned or deficient. When the National Asessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) team visited PU in 2015, the student-teacher ratio was found to be low, which was affecting students and increasing the burden on teachers. The NAAC team called for rectification of the situation at the earliest. However, PU did not follow this up for two to three years. Two years ago, vacancies of 26 assistant professors were removed but the Syndicate put a stop to it, raising several objections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-may-recruit-26-asst-professors-in-jan/articleshow/87787705.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Sans permission, BJP holds rally for cancelling Gunthewari GR||Nagpur: As the next year’s civic polls is fast approaching, the BJP seems to have started targeting the opposition parties, particularly the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents. On Thursday, the saffron party has organised a protest rally at Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) demanding to cancel a government resolution (GR) of October 18 through which the MVA government had hiked Gunthewari charges by three times. Last week, it had targetted the government over failure to reduce VAT on fuel. However, no permission was taken out of for Thursday’s rally, where large number of BJP activists gathered at NIT office in Civil Lines, despite the fact that Section 144 of IPC prohibiting gathering of four or more persons is at a place was enforced in the city in the aftermath of Amravati riots. “We had taken permission for our earlier protests related to same issue, but today’s rally was having small numbers so did not seek it. On Wednesday, NCP organised a slew of programmes for their supremo Sharad Pawar at a hotel and other places where hundreds of their party workers and other citizens participated. No one asked them on whether they had sought permission and how they were allowed to gather despite Section 144 was in place. How law can be different for ruling party and opposition,” MLA Krishna Khopde said. Under Khopde’s leadership, the BJP delegation submitted a representation to NIT chairman Manoj Suryawanshi which was actually directed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to cancel the “black GR” of October 18. The delegation warned that if the MVA government failed to act, they would intensify their protests. The delegation comprising BJP MLA and other top functionaries apprised of the NIT chief that about five lakh citizens would suffer due to three-fold hike in Gunthewari charges from Rs56/sq ft to Rs168. According to them, the decision was taken without consulting the elected representatives.

On Thursday, in view of the proposed visit of additional chief secretary panchayati raj and rural development, chief development officer, Kanpur Dehat, Soumya Pandey, reached Bhainsaya village, where the families will reside, and took stock of the arrangements with regard to their accommodation. Accompanied by teams of revenue and development departments, Pandey gave necessary directions to the officials concerned. In this sequence, CDO inspected the work of the rejuvenation plan done in the school built there. She directed the concerned authorities that the work which is incomplete should be completed soon. Later, she also inspected the ‘gaushala’ built there and directed the officials to provide green fodder, straw, water and bran to the cows. She said that in view of the fast approaching winter season, the ‘gaushala’ should be covered with tarpaulins so that the animals remain safe. To recall, the state government has decided to rehabilitate Bengali Hindus who migrated in the 1970s from East Pakistan (Bangladesh). The state cabinet on November 10 had cleared a proposal for the rehabilitation plan for 63 Hindu Bengali families displaced from East Pakistan in 1970 on 121.41 hectares of land available in the name of the rehabilitation department in village Bhainsaya, under Rasulabad tehsil in Kanpur Dehat district. Official sources said the families would be allotted two acre each for farming activities, and 200 sq. metres of land for residential purposes for which Rs 1.20 lakh would be allotted per family to construct a house under the Mukhya Mantri Awaas Yojana, said the sources and added further that “they would also get land reform and irrigation facilities under MGNREGA as per requirement”. Those who migrated from East Pakistan were rehabilitated under the provisions of The Displaced Persons (Claims) Act 1950 & The Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act 1954 brought by the Indian Government. “In Odisha and Budaun, 332 families were rehabilitated while the remaining 63 Hindu Bengali families were provided jobs in a cotton factory in Meerut and settled there,” said official sources further. However, the mill shut down on August 8, 1984 following which 63 families were awaiting rehabilitation. There were originally 65 families but members of two families had died since, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/63-bengali-hindu-familiesbeing-settled-in-rasulabad/articleshow/87788380.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat private school told to issue leaving certificate||AHMEDABAD: Since the lockdown, a lot of students shifted from private schools to government-run schools due to the financial stress caused by the pandemic. Little Arman in Jamnagar was not lucky enough to have a smooth transfer to a government school. His father had to wage a year-long legal battle with the school for his school leaving certificate so that he could get admission to the government school, and this happened only after the intervention of consumer courts. According to the case details, a resident of Jamnagar, Chand Alam Ansari decided to move his son Arman, a student of Class 3 at St Francis School, to a government school after the lockdown. In July 2020, he requested the school to provide the school leaving certificate. Ansari told the school that it had begun teaching online but he had only one Android phone. He could not afford the expenses and wanted to shift the child to a government school. The private school asked Ansari to pay fees for the period of March to July, but Ansari refused, saying that his son was not taught anything in this time due to the lockdown. The school refused him the certificate and the child could not be admitted to the government school. Ansari dragged the school management to the Jamnagar District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission alleging deficiency in service and seeking directions to the school to issue the certificate. He also demanded compensation from school for wasting his son’s precious time by not issuing the certificate. The school management, on the other hand, insisted that Ansari’s son got admission for the academic year 2020-21. For the certificate, Ansari had first to pay Rs 5,400 as fees for the last quarter, which he had not done. After hearing the case, in August, the district commission concluded the by not issuing the school leaving certificate, the school had shown a deficiency in service. But it was also held that Ansari was liable to pay the fees. The commission found a way out, and ordered Ansari to pay Rs 5,400 to the school but also directed the school to pay Rs 1,400 to Ansari as compensation for not issuing the certificate and Rs 4,000 extra for legal expenditure he had to incur. The commission, in this way, settled the account. This was not acceptable to the private school and it filed an appeal in the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission against order of the district commission, but did not succeed. The school’s appeal was rejected in the last week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/private-school-told-to-issue-lc/articleshow/87787702.cms||---

---||Mumbai||SC rejects ex-Maharashtra home minister’s plea to examine CBI report on him||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh's plea for the court to examine CBI's preliminary inquiry report against him which allegedly granted him a clean chit. The court, however, allowed him the liberty to raise the issue before an appropriate court. At the outset, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Deshmukh, referred to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on whose plea a CBI probe was ordered against the former minister and said the court had passed the order placing confidence in him but the cop was himself absconding now. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said, "It is very unfortunate for the institutions. It shows lack of faith in the system." The bench, thereafter, proceeded with the hearing and raised the question of how he could directly approach he apex under Article 32 jurisdiction. Sibal contended that SC passed the order against Deshmukh on the presumption that evidence against him was found by CBI after a preliminary enquiry (PE) and an FIR was filed, but as per media reports the politician was given a clean chit in the PE report. Sibal contended that the court should ask CBI to place before it the 65-page PE report along with file notings to find out the truth. He said if it was true that "nothing was found against me" in the PE, then it was clear that there was political motivation behind lodging an FIR The bench, however, asked how much credence could be given to media reports and said it was not inclined to entertain the petition. It allowed him to raise the issue before a competent court. "As per certain newspaper reports the Petitioner is stated to have been given a clean chit. Therefore, they have called for all records...We are not inclined to exercise jurisdiction under Article 32 in this scenario. It is always open for the petitioner to raise the issue before a competent court," the court said. Deshmukh (71) was arrested by the ED on November 1 after questioning in the case, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 this year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations that demands of Rs 100 crore by way of bribes from Mumbai's hotel and restaurant owners were sought by the former minister. The allegations were levelled by Param Bir Singh. The ED case is that Deshmukh, while serving as the state's home minister, misused his official position and through dismissed police officer Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-rejects-ex-maharashtra-home-ministers-plea-to-examine-cbi-report-on-him/articleshow/87789015.cms||---

With no fresh violence during the the last five days, normalcy seems to be returning to the city. People stepped out to buy essentials as police gave a six-hour relaxation in curfew from 11 am on Thursday. Bonde said that he was still firm on his statement that riots do not happen in states ruled by BJP. “It is in Congress or Left-ruled states that rioters are protected,” he said. The former guardian minister said that law and order situation in Maharashtra has collapsed and such statements (by Malik) are being made to divert people’s attention. “Though the home minister of the state is a good-natured man, he is helpless. We have every right to protest when a violent mob pelts stones at shops and beats shopkeepers,” he said. With no fresh violence during the the last five days, normalcy seems to be returning to the city. People stepped out to buy essentials as police gave a six-hour relaxation in curfew from 11 am on Thursday. Banks and government offices resumed their working but transactions were stalled as internet services remained suspended. Curfew was clamped and internet was barred after violence broke out in the city on November 12 and 13. Administration is taking all efforts to restore normalcy.

Sarkhej resident Amjad Sipai, 41, in his complaint with Vejalpur police on Wednesday stated he had a shop in Bopal, which he had set up with tin sheets.

The complainant stated that the structure was dismantled and the metal sheets and pipes were left at the spot. On Wednesday, he saw the sheets and pipes of his shop at a scrap shop in Sarkhej. He found out that a youth had come a month ago and sold the sheets and pipes, stating that his shop in Bopal had been closed down and he was disposing of the material. The scrap dealer paid Rs 12,000 for the sheets, pipes and a device for breaking ice.

The party alleged that the BJP government led by CM Bhupendra Patel is trying to cover up the scam. Party spokesman Manish Doshi said, “During the lockdown, a scam regarding siphoning off ration worth more than Rs 100 crore using 62,000 fake identity documents was reported in Surat. The government has not taken any action so far in the case or even dared to inquire into the scam in other districts through same modus operandi.” “In Surat, using fake identity documents of over 62,000 ration card holders under the National Food Security Act, rations worth crores of rupees was stolen. Though a similar scam could have easily been done in other districts, the Gujarat government has avoided taking any action,” Doshi said. He added, “Cases of siphoning of ration meant for distribution to the poor for free have been reported in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Rajkot, Jamnagar and other districts. The BJP government has not done anything yet to stop this massive corruption. A few top officials of the civil supply department are allegedly behind the scam and we demand that the BJP government take action,” Doshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/congress-alleges-scam-in-free-ration-scheme/articleshow/87787717.cms||---

---||Pune||Panel to frame education policy for minority institutions in Maharashtra||PUNE: A 16-member state-level committee under education commissioner Vishal Solanki has been set up to discuss and recommend a policy for the education of minorities in the state. Experts from the communitiesand educators are expected to submit the report within three months. The government gives various grants and has implemented many schemes for students of minority communities and their educational institutes. An independent education policy for minority communities is necessary. The committee will look into the existing schemes and new ones to improve minority education and submit its recommendations, the government resolution released on Wednesday said. The resolution further said that the Supreme Court has passed four judgments explaining various clauses in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 which are not applicable to the minority institutions. The committee is expected to study this and other judgments regarding minority institutes and formulate administrative and educational policies related to schools, students and teachers in minority institutes. Markus Deshmukh, an advocate and also educational consultant for many minority schools, said, “Till now, there has not been any policy specifically for minority education. This has created some issues because there are ambiguities when it comes to implementing some Acts. Such a policy will help clear them. Secondly, there are many schemes available but implementation may be an issue because the educational department officers do not know them well. Their training is a must. Thirdly, there are areas in the education of minority communities where we can do better as a state. This will also be studied and a draft policy will be recommended.” In its report that was out in August, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), sought the extension of the RTE Act, 2009, to include minority institutions. The child rights body had demanded that the states issue guidelines for minority schools to set aside a minimum percentage of students admitted from minority communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panel-to-frame-edu-policy-for-minority-institutions/articleshow/87787730.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Nashik||Nashik Municipal Corporation to spend Rs 400 crore to overhaul water pipe network||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to completely overhaul city’s underground water pipeline network at a cost of over Rs 400 crore. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the civic body is in the process of appointing an agency to help the NMC prepare a master plan for the ambitious project to ensure city’s water needs are taken care of for the next 30 years. Jadhav said this exercise is important as city’s population is increasing rapidly due to Nashik’s thriving economy. The NMC is already in the process of floating a request for proposal (RFP) to appoint the agency. “The RFP will be floated within a week,” he said. The task of the agency would be to prepare a plan and methodology that would be adopted for the underground water supply pipeline from Gangapur dam to the city. An NMC official said the existing direct pipeline between Gangapur dam to Bara Bungalow water filtration plant, a distance of around 12 km, is to be replaced with new ones. The pipeline will be further extended by another 8-km till Gandhinagar water filtration plant and the proposed work is estimated to cost Rs 175 crore. Currently, Nashik Road division gets water from Chehedi weir of the Darna dam. However, Waldevi river that connects to Chehedi weir is supplying contaminated water to the jackwell from where the NMC lifts water. Due to complaints from residents about contaminated water the NMC was forced to stop water supply from Chehedi on many occasions. Last year, the NMC could lift only 16 mcft of water from Chehedi weir even though the water reservation in Darna dam was 400 mcft. Hence, the NMC has plans of laying new pipeline to lift water from Darna dam. A 20-km pipeline will be laid between Darna dam to Gandhinagar water filtration plant via Pathardi area of the city. The work is estimated to cost around Rs 150 crore. Further, 25 new overhead water tanks would be established at various locations that are witnessing population growth at a cost of Rs 60 crore. Moreover, the NMC has two water filtration plants in Gandhinagar and Nashik Road divisions. The civic body has plans to connect both the water filtration plants through a six-km pipeline at a cost of Rs 19 crore. Presently, the NMC supplies 650 million litres per day (MLD) of water for the entire Nashik city. The daily water requirement of the city is likely to increase by over 1,500 MLD during the next 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-spend-rs-400-crore-to-overhaul-water-pipe-network/articleshow/87786188.cms||Tushar Pawar

According to senior officials of MSRTC’s Nashik division, passenger count has been increasing for destinations like Pune and Dhule, for which buses ply every hour. However, at the moment, the movement of buses is affected due to the ongoing strike called by the MSRTC employees. The MSRTC authorities are trying to persuade the employees — the drivers, conductors and other workers — to call off the strike, but that has not helped resolve the issue. However, the administration was able to run the Shivshahi buses taken on lease by the corporation to various destinations. “The number of buses on the road is limited. The bus sent from Nashik to Pune despite stone-pelting, as an experiment, is now bearing fruits. We now have hourly service from New CBS terminus of Nashik to Pune and Dhule,” the senior officer of the MSRTC said. The MSRTC started the Borivali bus services from Mahamarg bus terminus in the city, which is also receiving good response from the citizens. The leased buses have drivers on contract. A similar experiment can also be carried out with Aurangabad, where the bus service is likely to be started in the next few days. The MSRTC officials said they have also issued notices to 58 of the 69 employees working on ‘nominal muster roll’ (NMR), which is a step before they are inducted into the services completely. “Since they failed to take up their duties, we have now issued them show-cause notice for their action and they will be terminated for the job if their replies are not satisfactory,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-msrtc-to-start-buses-to-aurangabad/articleshow/87786164.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) will complete the remaining electric work at the STP within a few days. The new STP, built on eight hectare, has the capacity to process 32 million litre per day (MLD) of sewage. There are currently 10 STPs in the city with a total sewage treatment capacity of 360.5 MLD. The civic administration has prepared an action plan for sewage treatment needs of the city for a population of 30 lakh by 2026. NMC would have to increase the capacity of the STPs from 360 MLD currently to 440 MLD. To this end, NMC has planned two more STPs in the city, at Makhmalabad and Kamatwade. The STP at Kamatwade will be built on 6.5 hectares and will have a capacity of 36 MLD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-start-new-stp-in-one-month/articleshow/87786203.cms||Tushar Pawar

The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board in Udupi has taken note of this development. In 2017, yellow rain was witnessed in Amasebail in Kundapur Taluk. Professor Arun M Isloor, who teaches chemistry at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) in Surathkal, said that “unless the samples are examined, we cannot conclude the exact cause for the yellow rain”. The professor listed various reasons for why a place could receive “yellow rain”. It may occur because of fine dust particles that had accumulated in the air because of heavy construction work. It could also be due to the pollen grains of a particular plant. This could happen if a particular species of plant runs into thousands of acres. Fungus concentration could also be one of the reasons, he said. Another possibility could be chemical industries. When coal with high sulphur content burns, it emits sulphur dioxide and when this meets the moisture in the air it becomes sulphur trioxide that is converted into sulfuric acid. This is also known as acid rain. This can be confirmed only after lab analysis, he said. “As there is no report from the public about skin burning complaints, I don’t think its acid rain,” he added. Ganesh Puthran, a businessman and social worker, said that around 1 pm on Wednesday, the family of Punadalika Bangera noticed yellow drops on clothes they had put out for drying, as well as on the ground and on leaves. A few other people from the region also reported seeing “yellow rain”, he said. Uday Gaonkar, a science teacher in a government high school in Siddapur, said that while a scientific study is essential, the yellow-coloured drops could be because of some fungus in the air. Kerala too had witnessed yellow rain a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/yellow-rain-reported-in-udupi-experts-yet-to-ascertain-cause/articleshow/87787636.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Level-playing field for local producers of def items soon||Nagpur: A policy to bring a further level-playing field for domestic players against foreign entities dealing in defence items is being worked out, according to Sanjay Jaju, the additional secretary for defence production. This would also deal with aspect of trials needed for clearing an item. Subject to the approval of the cabinet, it is expected to be included in the defence procurement policy. “A decision on this is expected in a short time,” said Jaju who was in here to chair a seminar on MSME’s participation in defence sector. It was organized by Vidarbha Defence Industrial Association (VDIA) and JSR Dynamics. Jaju said it is easier for a foreign vendor to sell a product in India. “For the same item, it is like baptism by fire for an Indian manufacturer. If its a foreign manufacturer, often the basis is that the product is already established in the country. Do we really go and see? If it is an Indian entity, the product is subject to be proven on multiple parameters,” he said. A number of steps have been taken to encourage Indian industries. “Over 200 items have been included in the no-import lists. This includes even artillery guns leaving a big slice for Indian companies,” said Jaju. Jaju stressed on better coordination between the armed forces for churning out a product. “The Army gives a certain requirement and by the time a manufacturer comes up with an item, its often said that it’s not in lines with the specifications. The question is that why wasn’t any corrective action taken during the development process,” he asked. Air Vice Marshall (retd) SB Deo, now running a defence industry after retiring as IAF’s vice-chief, said Nagpur is emerging as an “explosive capital” of the country. Lt General (retd) Vinod Khandare, who recently retired as the military advisor to the National Security Council, also stressed on the need for promoting private industries. Citing an example of one of the actions in which he took part, Khandare said, “Out of 500 M36 grenades lobbed, around 400 did not explode. The army had been using the grenades of World War II make. It will finally be replaced with the latest multimode grenades. The soldiers will be grateful for that.” Nagpur’s Solar Group has got an order to make 10 lakh multimode grenades for the Army.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/level-playing-field-for-local-producers-of-def-items-soon/articleshow/87787734.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Dengue impact continues, but cases reported sporadically||PRAYAGRAJ: As the impact of the dengue outbreak continues, the tally of dengue cases in the district has already crossed the 981-mark. The cases reported this year are 17 times more compared to the previous year when Sangam city had reported only 56 cases. However, officials of the health department claimed that there is currently not a single hotspot in Prayagraj district and sporadic cases being reported are from random locations. About 72% of the total 981 cases have been reported from city locations, health department officials said. Several teams of the health department and municipal corporation have conducted surveys of over 2.75 lakh houses in the city limits to find out the reasons behind spread of the vector borne disease to take corrective measures accordingly. Officials admitted that about 40% of houses with deserted coolers, flower pots and abandoned or unused articles dumped on roofs were found to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes in city areas. Officials said that owners or tenants of houses were least bothered to clean their coolers, flower pots, or even dispose of unused articles kept on the side of the roof of houses for a month. Also, the number of drains and areas witnessing water logging due to various reasons have also turned into areas for mosquito breeding. District Malaria Officer (DMO) AK Singh told TOI on Thursday, “Municipal corporation and health teams conducting door-to-door survey found that larvae were thriving in a number of spots inside residential premises, including abandoned objects kept on rooftops, flower pots, deserted coolers and old tyres. Moreover, open plots in low-lying areas and areas showing water logging have also turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes.” The fact is that there is no area, mohallah or colony left in the city which has not reported dengue cases. “House owners or tenants should regularly clean water sites in their houses. If it is not possible to drain out water, a little kerosene can be poured in it to kill larvae,” the DMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dengue-impact-continues-but-cases-reported-sporadically/articleshow/87788404.cms||---

A division bench of justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare have warned of strict action if the CEO fails to appear in person before the court. Primary teacher Gajanan Uplanchiwar under Zilla Parishad, Chandrapur, had died in 2009. His wife Sangeeta applied for a job on compassionate grounds to her eldest son Aditya immediately. According to the petitioners, Aditya’s name was on the waiting list in 2009, but he was not given a job till 2014. In the meantime, Aditya suffered an ailment leading to failure of both his kidneys in 2013-14. He is taking regular dialysis treatment since then and also had to give up his education. In 2014, Sangeeta prayed that the job be given to her second son Dhruv but he was only 15 then. The petitioners stated the ZP administration assured to recruit him as soon after he turns 18 and his name was registered on the waiting list. Dhruv turned 18 in 2017, but the petitioners stated that despite repeated requests his name was not included in place of Aditya till 2020. Later, his name was removed and his job claim was rejected stating that the regulation in this regard has changed on May 20, 2020, and Aditya’s name cannot be replaced, stated the petitioners. Advocate Arvind Waghmare appearing for the petitioners stated that Dhruva’s application was filed before the change in rule and pointed out that HC had earlier quashed similar proceedings by passing two judgments. Sangeeta and Dhruv filed the petition in March after which, the HC issued a notice in August, but the ZP had already issued an order to appoint Aditya in July. When HC sought an explanation, ZP neither replied nor its advocates appeared before the court. Additional government pleader Shishir Ukey held brief for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/job-on-compassionate-grounds-hc-summons-chanda-zp-ceo/articleshow/87786208.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nashik||Nashik: Probe against contractor over wage issue||Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni has directed the civic administration to conduct a probe into alleged violation of the Minimum Wages Act by a contractor, who had provided 700 sanitation workers to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) on contract basis. The directive from the mayor came after corporators, cutting across party lines, sought termination of contract with the aforesaid contractor during Wednesday’s general body (GB) meeting. The corporators alleged that the contractor is paying lower salaries to the workers even though the NMC is making full payment as per the Minimum Wages Act. The elected representatives also alleged that the contractor had taken a deposit of Rs 15,000 from every sanitation worker hired by them. An NMC official, during the general body meeting, said there had been complaints against the contractor concerned regarding the same issue. “The contractor concerned has also submitted an affidavit to the civic administration, admitting that he had accepted the deposits but the money was later returned to the workers,” the official said. BJP Corporator Dinkar Patil said if the contractor has accepted that he had taken deposit which is not in the agreement, the NMC administration should terminate the contract. Corporators also alleged that when NMC is making full payment to contractors for the workers as per Minimum Wages Act, the contractor is paying only 50% of the salaries to the workers0 which is injustice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-probe-against-contractor-over-wage-issue/articleshow/87786239.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||BJP localizes state-levelissues ahead of civic polls||Nagpur: Over the last one month, the BJP has been busy taking up state-level issues that have local ramifications as well, thus giving it a leg up in preparations ahead of next year’s civic polls. Right from housing for the poor scheme to Gunthewari rates to Monday’s morcha over ration card holders, the BJP’s strategic localization of state-level issues is helping it target all the three members of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) while connecting with voters in the city. Involving ration card or Ramai Awaas Yojna beneficiaries in their morchas has helped the BJP to reach out to the end beneficiaries. Officially, BJP leaders have denied that any of these steps are connected to the upcoming civic polls but their own workers say that the saffron party has already started running the warm-up lap, way before the race begins. Devendra Fadnavis is meeting booth level workers at their homes, which is a big morale booster for those who have their feet on the ground. Similary, almost all city MLAs and MLCs are seen in press conferences and morchas, thus projecting a ‘united’ front though factionlism is rampant in every party. Congress party member Vivek Nikose said BJP is trying to divert issues. “They have not done anything while in power between 2014-19 and are putting the blame on others. Why did BJP not ensure the housing for poor scheme is implemented properly or that ration card holders do not face logisitical issues. BJP could have solved these problems but kept them pending for reasons best known to them. To counter this, BJP is picking state-level issues and forcibly putting a local spin on them,” said Nikose. BJP’s city president Pravin Datke said if the the main MVA constituents have so many issues then they should hit the streets. “The state machinery belongs to them so what is stopping these leaders from protesting on the streets. If there’s corruption in NMC then ask the police to investigate. All they are doing is indulging in allegations without follow up,” said Datke. He thrashed the notion that his recent political agitations were in anyway connected to the 2022 civic polls. “Now our opponents will say that the BJP worked during the Covid-19 pandemic only to garner votes. We are always working to resolve people’s issues and never with polls in sight. The fact is that none of the three parties have any issues to raise before voters,” said Datke. Prakash Gajbhiye, NCP leader and fromer MLC, said, “There is no dearth of issues with anyone. It’s actually the BJP which is painting an incorrect picture. For five years they were in power in the state. What have they done for people who are below the poverty line.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-localizes-state-levelissues-ahead-of-civic-polls/articleshow/87787746.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The petitioner challenged commissioner of police’s notification of August 25 on prohibiting prostitution activities within 200 meters of public places in the city’s infamous red-light area. The notification issued under Section 7(1)(b) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, is without jurisdiction, as the power to issue it, notifying prohibited public places vests to the state government, he contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-notices-to-govt-cp-over-pil-on-ganga-jamuna-restrictions/articleshow/87787757.cms||---

---||Delhi||Court takes strong note of delay in filing of FIR||New Delhi: A Delhi court has directed the DCP concerned to appear in person on the next date of hearing in a case after noting that the investigation procedure in lodging an FIR was alien to law provisions. The directions came after the court was informed that a police complaint seeking registration of FIR in a property dispute case was made on July 7. The FIR, however, was registered after a lapse of more than two months on September 18. The complainant’s counsel submitted to the court that police had claimed that enquiry was being conducted before registration of the FIR based on certain internal guidelines and office orders. The person against whom the complaint was made had moved the court seeking anticipatory bail on the apprehension of his arrest in the case. Advocate Sanjay Sharma, appearing for the complainant, claimed that despite repeated visits, the SHO concerned failed to initiate registration of the FIR and kept the matter for “enquiry”. It was further alleged that the FIR was registered only after visiting the office of the DCP concerned. “The procedure adopted by police officials concerned is alien to the provisions of CrPC…. Such incidents are coming time and again before this court. This has a direct bearing as the uncertainty created by such practice adopted by the investigating officer are resulting in the filing of bail applications of the present nature,” Additional Sessions Judge Naveen Kumar Kashyap said in an order on November 12.

While partly allowing a writ petition filed by one Km. Anju Singh and another of Hapur district, a division bench comprising Justice Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi directed the police concerned to grant protection to the couple after verifying all documents. The petitioner, Anju Singh and her live-in partner, who filed the petition jointly, submitted before the court that they are major girls and same-sex couple who wanted a live-in relationship. They alleged that they would be harassed and would not be permitted to live in peace by their family members if protection is not granted to them. They also submitted that their parents threatened to kill them if they do not end their relationship and also threatened to falsely implicate them in a criminal case. Against this backdrop, the court while stressing that it is not against live-in relationship, directed the police of the concerned district to grant them protection after verifying all the documents. While passing this directive in its decision on November 2, the court also referred and relied upon Supreme Court’s rulings in the cases of Gian Devi vs. The Superintendent, Nari Niketan, Delhi, and others, Lata Singh vs. State of UP and another and Bhagwan Das V State (NCT of Delhi). The court also referred and relied on the government order (GO) dated August 31, 2019. According to the said GO, police protection will be given to those, who entered into inter-caste or inter-faith marriages. Further, the district magistrate or superintendent of police concerned shall prosecute those persons who tried to create fear in the mind of such couples, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/not-against-live-in-relationship-hc-tells-same-sex-couple-of-hapur/articleshow/87788430.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh, UK to conduct joint study on decarbonising city transport||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration, in association with the British Deputy High Commission, which represent the UK government in Chandigarh, will conduct a study to decarbonise the city’s transport. Various aspects of the study were discussed during a meeting held under the chairmanship of UT adviser Dharam Pal, in the presence of secretary, transport Nitin Yadav and MC commissioner Anandita Mitra. Madhuchhanda Mishra of the British Deputy High Commission apprised UT officials that the project would be funded by the UK government for a duration of 12 months and would tentatively start from January 2022. He said that the project is aimed at providing support to decarbonise the city’s transport and contribute towards efforts to stem climate change. The study will also focus on suggesting alternative eco-friendly transport for the city. The adviser appreciated the British High Commission proposal for the study and accorded its concurrence to initiate the project. UT adviser Dharam Pal said that the UT and UK government would work together on the study. He added that the alternative eco-friendly transport system would also be part of mass rapid transport system (MRTS), on which UT administration is also working. UT adviser Dharam Pal recently sought a report on the new mobility plan. In August, the UT administration decided to go for a fresh mobility plan for mass rapid transport system (MRTS) as officials of Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) had conveyed to the UT administration that the 2009 plan could not be updated with the Centre issuing new guidelines. To solve the city’s urban transport problem, the UT administration had fixed a meeting with RITES officials, in which options of mass rapid transport system (MRTS) like metro, monorail and skybus were discussed. Before moving ahead on this front, the UT adviser had directed UT transport department officials to get the updated RITES 2009 study. The last mobility plan for MRTS was prepared by RITES in 2009. Since then, many things like volume of traffic, entry of vehicles into the city and rush on routes have changed drastically. In 2019, the UT had rejected a detailed study conducted by the French company, Systra for the city’s mobility plan under the Smart City project. Citing wrong methodology for carrying out the study, aimed at suggesting ways to solve traffic congestion and offer possible modes for mass rapid transport system, the administration suggested to close the study. The French agency had suggested three Tricity corridors and a combination of bus rapid transit system (BRTS), light rail transit (LRT), modern tram and monorail as possible modes of transport along these three corridors. The UT administration got the study checked by a team of Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and other experts and found that the methodology and various other figures were not correct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-uk-to-conduct-jt-study-on-decarbonising-city-transport/articleshow/87787747.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Allahabad||HC calls upon Central Govt to implement mandate of Article 44||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the Central government to consider the constitution of a committee/commission for implementing the mandate of Article 44, which says that the “State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”. The court also directed the marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners, without, insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar passed the order while allowing a batch of petitions (17 in number), pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehend threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Standing counsel appearing for the state government submitted that the conversion is for the purpose of marriage, approval of the district magistrate has not been obtained before conversion, and/or, contracting marriage and marriage cannot be registered without the district authority making an enquiry, as to whether the conversion is voluntary and not induced by coercion, allurement and threat. Further, the petitioners were not entitled to any relief from this court, they should approach the competent district authority and obtain approval, in the first instance, with regard to their conversion. The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the citizens have a right to make choice of their partner and faith, the conversion of religion/faith, followed by marriage under the personal law is on free will without coercion, threat or inducement. Interference by the state or by the private respondents (family members) would tantamount to encroaching upon their constitutional right to freedom, choice, life, liberty and to live life on their own terms as man and woman. The prior approval of the district authority followed by registration of marriage is not sine qua non before conversion and marriage.

To ensure that “gullible buyers are not left to be cheated by unscrupulous people operating in construction business, the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal on Wednesday asked the three municipal corporations, DDA and Delhi Police Commissioner to inform it of such pending projects where mandatory registration as mandated under Rera Act has not been done. “The registry of the tribunal also points out that they had addressed a couple of communications to the commissioner of police seeking details of the FIRs registered in respect of societies/individuals offering membership of housing projects and fraudulently collecting huge amounts of money from gullible buyers within the jurisdiction of Delhi and especially in areas falling under the landpooling policy of DDA. Details are stated to have not been received till date despite lapse of considerable time and also a reminder,” observed the bench chaired by justice Chander Shekhar. The tribunal cited Section 2 of the Act to reiterate that no promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite people to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera). It further pointed out that registration under Rera is critical for projects where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square metres or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed eight inclusive of all phases. “Despite the clarity of the provisions of the Act regarding their applicability, there is a rampant non-compliance of these provisions within the city,” the bench noted, explaining its decision to initiate a suo motu case in regard to unregistered projects in the capital. The major objective of Rera is to regulate and promote the real estate sector, but ensure transparency in the real estate business by insisting mandatory disclosure of project details to the property buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rera-to-crack-whip-on-norm-violators/articleshow/87787765.cms||Abhinav Garg

The workers continued to protest at the MSRTC bus stand for their demand of the transport utility’s merger with the state government. No buses have been plying from any of the 12 depots in Kolhapur. Uttam Patil, the head of MSRTC workers’ association, said, “Even after 11 days of the strike, no positive sign can be seen from the state government. No member of the MVA government has come here to support us or even listen to us. More than 40 employees in the state have lost their lives during the pandemic. To awaken the state government, five of our suspended members from the Kolhapur department will take jal samadhi in the Panchaganga river. This is final ultimatum from us and the government should not test our limits.” Meanwhile, passengers continue to suffer and hope that the strike is called off soon. Sachin Vankudre, a commuter, said, “The state government and the MSRTC employees are both firm on their stands and the normal public is facing the heat. Private buses are charging almost double the rate compared to MSRTC buses.

---||Allahabad||Mull forming a panel to bring in Uniform Civil Code: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Dealing with a batch of 17 petitions pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners and seeking protection from the court, the Allahabad high court on Thursday called upon the Central government to consider setting up a panel for implementing the mandate of Article 44, which says that the “State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India”. The court also directed marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners without insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar, who passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by one Mayra alias Vaishnavi and 16 others pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners, further called upon the Union government to initiate the process as the stage has been reached. “The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made purely voluntary as was observed by Dr BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community. The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code,” the court observed. “Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law,” the court further added. The court, in an attempt to envisage the possible effect of Uniform Civil Court (UCC) on the Indian population if implemented, referred to the Hindu Family Code (HFC), which in the court’s opinion, acted as uniform civil code and integrated the citizens into an integrated and united Indian citizenry, on terms that is equal and uniform, insofar as the law regulating family law is concerned. Stressing that the impact of HFC on Hindu society has been phenomenal, the court opined that HFC has not encroached upon the religious custom, culture, practice, and propagation of the minuscule minority, i.e., Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, included within the definition of Hindus. The HFC can be said to be the UCC governing the Hindus and the communities, falling within the ambit and definition of Hindu and that it covers and has sway over 80% of the population. Significantly, the court noted that the HFC laid the foundation of transforming the traditional Hindu society, and the legislations lifted and transported the Hindu personal law from the shastra/religion and placed it within the domain of Parliament. “Parliament through HFC in a single stroke provided the legal platform where Hindu citizens could interact with each other on equal terms irrespective of rigid caste, jati, creed, gotra and the concept of purity, pollution in marriage and dining. The HFC has been largely instrumental, (apart from other factors viz education, mobility, health services), in facilitating and creating what the sociologist refer to as a Hindu social class and or a Hindu citizenry,” noted the court. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehended threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, they had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Box: Key Observations | The issue of UCC, though constitutional, rakes political overtures whenever raised or debated in the public domain and calls for its implementation in the wake of a multiplicity of marriage and family laws in place. | A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the minority community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. That has been the consistent official stand of the government within the country and in international forums. A Common Civil Code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws that have conflicting ideologies. | No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the state which is charged with the duty of securing Uniform Civil Code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uniform-civil-code-a-necessitycannot-be-made-voluntary-hc/articleshow/87788442.cms||---

Twenty-year-old victim, Jayesh Rawal, who works as a casual labourer, was dragged from his house on Wednesday afternoon and lynched by four accused identified as Kiran Mali, Mohan Mali, Ramesh Mali and Kalidas Mali. Rawal was in a relationship with Kalidas’s daughter Aarti. Kalidas had warned Rawal around two months ago of dire consequences if he continued meeting his daughter or even tried to speak to her. However, the girl’s mother spotted the lovebirds talking near Kalidas’s farm on Wednesday afternoon. Though Rawal ran back to his home, his fears of being attacked turned horrifyingly true soon after. The four accused dragged the youth near their house and flogged him mercilessly with sticks before making him wear a saree and tying him to a tree. All four accused took turns to beat Rawal and even kicked him on his private parts, despite the youth’s constant pleading to let him free. The violence continued due to which the youth soon lost consciousness. Sometime later, when Rawal’s cousin got to know about the incident they rushed to his help, seeing which the four accused fled the spot. Rawal was untied and an ambulance was called, while his cousin kept splashing water on his face. However, Rawal failed to respond and doctors at the government hospital in Vadu declared him dead on arrival. Later that same night, mother of the deceased youth, Ramila, lodged a complaint of murder, abduction, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy against four accused at Vadu police station. On Thursday, the four accused were detained and kept in quarantine. Police said that they will be taken for Covid-19 test on Friday following which they will be formally arrested. An unidentified person recorded the whole flogging incident on a mobile phone and circulated the video, which went viral on Thursday. Police said that besides working as a casual labourer, Rawal also used to play ‘dhol’ during weddings in the village, while his father is a castor oil trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/youth-tied-to-tree-beaten-to-death-over-love-affair/articleshow/87787209.cms||---

In a raid at the farmhouse, the police had seized 38.7kg of raw material used to make mephedrone, and manufacturing machines of a total value of Rs 2.35 crore. Two of his aides had been arrested. The first arrest was of Maglin — alias Christina alias Ayesha — who was held with 50gm of the drug in Andheri recently, the caretaker of the farmhouse, Nikhil Lohar, was nabbed from the farmhouse. The police said that Rajhuns made a profit of at least Rs 12 lakh by selling a kilo of the drug. “It cost him Rs 2 lakh for a kilo, but he sold it for anywhere between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh,” said an officer. The police have got a list of at least 10 of his clients from Mumbai, Thane and Pune. While a car belonging to the lawyer has been confiscated, two others — one of them a BMW 5 — have been identified as his possessions, said officials of the Anti-Narcotics Cell. “Rajhuns procured ingredients to manufacture the drug while his caretaker helped in its manufacture,” said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade. A police team on Thursday searched his Kolhapur farmhouse and his Andheri office. A probe is on to check if his law degree is genuine. Rajhuns has claimed he had, during his legal practice, come across a few criminals who taught him how to make the drug. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-held-in-malad-after-drug-bust-at-his-farmhouse/articleshow/87789018.cms||S Ahmed Ali

Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications, said the 28-minute film dealt with various construction-related challenges faced by DMRC during its third phase of expansion. “In Phase III, DMRC constructed about 190km new lines and had to encounter innumerable challenges such as construction in the congested Old Delhi, passing through an extremely busy road intersection at Ashram and constructing its deepest station at Hauz Khas,” he said. With the help of graphics and interviews of the engineers who executed the project, the film brings to light the efforts put in by DMRC to expand the Metro footprint in National Capital Region. Dayal said extensive shooting of various locations, along with retrieval of archival footage, was undertaken. “Anticipating the film, the entire construction process was documented in the form of videos and photographs for about five-six years across all under-construction corridors,” he said, adding that the film took over a year’s time. “It is also an important document for transit rail engineers and researchers as it sheds light on a variety of issues that construction of such a mammoth infrastructure encounter. The film is available on DMRC’s official YouTube channel,” he said. A film on the challenges faced during Phase II had won the National Award in the Best Promotional Film Non-Feature films category in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-docu-to-be-screened-at-film-fest/articleshow/87788453.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is also the first in the state over the past four months. The last reported death in the city was on July 31 and last death in the state had happened on June 30. “The child was brought to our hospital in a serious condition, we shifted the baby to RUHS hospital,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. The baby had difficulty in breathing along with other complications. He was on ventilator at JK Lon Hospital. His condition continued to deteriorate and succumbed to the virus. “He had fever, altered sensorium and difficulty in breathing. We straight away put him on a ventilator.

---||Jaipur||Another Jaipur private school student tests positive for Covid-19||JAIPUR: Another student from a private school in the city tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. With this, four children from three private schools have contacted the virus in three days. Chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Jaipur II, Hansraj Bhadaliya, said, "The 12-year-old student of Neerja Modi School, who tested positive for the virus, had not been attending school since November 8." "Her mother had tested positive earlier and now she got infected. We are tracing her contacts," he said. However, Neerja Modi School principal Indu Dubey said, "The girl had attended school till November 15 as per the attendance register." "After receiving information regarding this, we have decided to discontinue offline classes for three days for her class. On Saturday, our teachers will teach that class virtually. We have advised parents not to send their children if they show any Covid-related symptom," said Dubey. This incident has increased fear among parents and they have demanded provisions for online classes instead of compulsory offline ones. Earlier this week, two students from Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya and one from Jayshree Periwal International School were found to be Covid positive. The schools’ authorities have suspended offline classes, but parents from all schools in the city have started vouching for offline classes. Director of Secondary Education, Bikaner, Kana Ram, said, "The standard operating procedure (SOP) does not mention that the schools cannot provide online classes. It is up to the schools and parents to keep that option open. If parents are not comfortable with offline classes, they must approach the school authorities." According to Manish Vijayvargiya, convenor of Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh Rajasthan, the SOP had kept an option open for the private school not to provide online classes and most of the schools were adhering to that. "We need a firm order from the government to make it compulsory for every school to provide online classes and let the parents decide. Else, the government is unnecessarily risking the lives of the students." According to the guidelines issued by the state government, if a student is found positive, the classroom has to remain shut for 10 days. However, schools are keeping the rooms shut just for a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/another-city-pvt-school-student-tests-ve-for-covid/articleshow/87788449.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: ‘No intention to kill or injure the cop at gunpoint’||NEW DELHI: Shahrukh Pathan, arrested for allegedly pointing a gun at a Delhi police constable during the northeast Delhi riots, claimed before a city court on Thursday that he had no intention to cause injury or to kill and had merely wanted to scare him. Pathan’s counsel claimed that police had not brought any witness who speaks of the offence of attempt to murder, under which he has been booked in the case and no potential victim has been presented by them, except police officer Deepak Dahiya, at whom the gun was allegedly pointed. “It is through him (Pathan) the state consistently improves on the case that they don’t have,” the counsel told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat and sought his discharge in the case. Senior Advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for Pathan, played video footage and said that even though he had fired a shot, it was not intended to injure or kill the policeman seen in the video. She submitted that Pathan and Dahiya had a heated conversation and then they retreated. Guruswamy also questioned the introduction of a witness at a later stage of investigation without any test identification parade. She further claimed that Pathan had ample opportunities to fire at the policeman but instead, he asked Dahiya to stand back and fired in the air and towards his right. “We have seen from the two videos that simply shooting is not indicative of murder,” submitted Guruswamy. Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa opposed Guruswamy’s arguments, saying Pathan had clearly pointed the gun at Dahiya. “Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?” Handa argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-intention-to-kill-or-injure-the-cop-at-gunpoint/articleshow/87787773.cms||Usha Das
---||Kolkata||A day after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s rebuke, 32 cops control traffic at Chingrighata crossing||KOLKATA: As many as 32 police personnel—those from the Kolkata Police, Bidhannagar Commissionerate and civic volunteers—have been deployed to man vehicular traffic as well as pedestrians’ movement at the Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass-—stretching 850m on one side from Captain Bhery to Beliaghata Building More and 900m on the other, from the Beliaghata auto stand on Canal Side Road to the Sukanta Nagar intersection. A day after senior police officers, led by acting DGP Manoj Malviya, reviewed the traffic arrangement at the Chingrighata crossing following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s stern instructions that deaths at this important stretch of EM Bypass would no longer be tolerated, the presence of police personnel were increased. Besides, both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police have lined up a series of plans to discipline motorists as well as pedestrians at the spot. Back-to-back accidents at the Chingrighata intersection on EM Bypass, some of them fatal, led to the review of the traffic plan there and the CM’s directive to streamline the vehicular flow. As an immediate step, Kolkata Traffic Police has doubled the manpower on the spot, increasing the number of personnel from 12 to 24. “We used to keep six civic volunteers only to tackle pedestrians. Two sergeants were in charge of vehicular flow. In addition, we kept cops at the Bidhannagar cut and Chawlpatty cut. Now, we will deploy personnel at all the seven big and small cuts in and around Chingrighata. We have introduced police beats at Jalvayu Vihar and Captain Bhery,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Cops have also decided to shut the slip road near the Metropolitan crossing on the south-bound flank of Bypass from 9.30pm, instead of the current 10pm, till the end of winter. “We are increasing the number of retro reflective signs that are visible through fog. We are are installing LED blinkers on the road between the Metropolitan and Chingrighata crossings,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Some long-term changes have also been proposed. “A proposal, dating back to the times of former commissioner Rajeev Kumar, has been revived. Under it, Kolkata Police will be asked to take over 550m, from before the Chingrighata bridge on Bypass to the crossing from Bidhannagar Police in order to allow seamless monitoring of traffic. Since this will need the legislative nod, this is being discussed at the highest level,” said a Lalbazar officer. Separate channels for cycles and other slow moving vehicles have also been proposed from the Beliaghata Canal Road towards Nicco Park. Cops say once work on the subway begins, as proposed by experts from IIT-Kharagpur, they will use the FOB as a pedestrian crossover. “Once KMDA completes installing the escalators on the upcoming FOB and it is ready for use, no person will be allowed to use the road to cross and jaywalkers will be heavily fined,” said a police officer. Earlier, to stop accidents on the north-bound flank of Bypass, traffic police had introduced two signals, at Maa flyover and Avani cut, out close to Metropolitan. Cops now look to fix the signal cycles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-cms-rebuke-32-cops-control-traffic-at-chingrighata/articleshow/87787975.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Protesting students said the administration should call students of all semesters for offline classes first, after which they should conduct offline examination. Writing to the vice-chancellor they said offline exams were unfair as online classes were held the entire semester and the varsity could not expect students to do well in practical exams under the circumstances. In a letter to the vice-chancellor, SFS members said that that the university should issue an official notice regarding online examination or promote students and start offline classes in the next semester. Earlier, protests were held to get officials to start offline classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hold-offline-classes-before-offline-exams-pu-student-bodies/articleshow/87787775.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court order on Sameer Wankhede’s father's plea against Nawab Malik on Monday||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday took on record two sets of documents, submitted by minister Nawab Malik and Dnyandeo Wankhede, father of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and posted for order on Monday Wankhede senior’s petition to restrain the NCP leader from posting defamatory content against his family. Justice Madhav Jamdar, expected to pass an order at 5.30pm on November 22, said “parties are requested not to produce anything till Monday”. Countering Malik’s public claim that his name was Dawood and his son is Muslim, Wankhede submitted Sameer’s birth certificate issued by the BMC. It shows Sameer’s date of birth as December 14, 1979, and his father’s name as Dnyandeo Kachruji Wankhede. Through his lawyers Arshad Shaikh and Diwakar Rai, he also submitted a caste certificate of July 1974, saying he belongs to a ‘scheduled caste community’, and a 1995 tenth standard school leaving certificate, where ‘Wankhede Sameer Dnyandev’s’ caste is ‘scheduled caste’, and his ‘progress in studies’ and ‘conduct in school’, both ‘good’. Malik, through senior counsel Atul Damle and Jay & Co Advocates, submitted an E ward health officer’s letter on November 15 saying that in 1979, the father’s name was registered in birth registration records as ‘Dawood K Wankhede’ and “corrected’’ to ‘Dnyandeo Kachruji Wankhede’ in May 1993 by a sub-registrar after a ‘declaration dated April 26, 1993’. In an additional affidavit submitted on Thursday, Malik said the birth certificate details show the religion of the newborn, Sameer, as ‘Muslim’. Malik also submitted a set of ‘certified copies of documents’ from the NCB officer’s schools. These documents include two primary school (standards I-IV) leaving certificates of 1986 and 1989, which say ‘Muslim’ in the religion column and his father’s name as ‘Dawood’.  The 1986 certificate says Sameer Wankhede’s conduct was ‘good’ and progress ‘satisfactory’. A third school document was an ‘admission form’ of a school in Wadala dated June 1986 where his religion is mentioned as ‘Muslim’. Relying on these documents, Malik sought dismissal of Wankhede’s plea. He went by a November 10 order, saying he can produce additional information. But Wankhede’s advocate Shaikh questioned the relevance of Malik’s documents, saying the father’s name was corrected in 1993 in the BMC records and the final tenth standard school leaving certificate bears all the correct details. Pointing out that Malik sought documents from BMC on November 13, he cited a Delhi HC ruling that said “before posting tweets… it was incumbent on the defendant to carry out preliminary due diligence’’. He argued that when posting the alleged defamatory content, Malik had no verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-order-on-wankhede-srs-plea-against-malik-on-mon/articleshow/87789038.cms||---

Since the Railways is now replacing all such shuttles with the Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains, it has an advantage of faster pickup and braking system thus cutting travel duration between the point of origin and destination. “The shuttle service between Bhusawal and Badnera and Bhusawal and Itarsi have been restored and replaced by the MEMU trains. On the same lines, we expect the permission of operating the train on Devlali – Bhusawal route,” senior officials from the divisional railway manager’s office said. This train had stopped plying in March last year following the Covid pandemic. “Nashik has a large number of people from Jalgaon district working in the industrial areas and even staying here. We are the biggest beneficiary of the shuttle and re-starting it will bring an easy and safe travel alternative,” Sanjay Barhate, a city businessman, said. Sangeeta Bhangale, another resident of Nashik city, said that road travel proves costlier. “Only special trains are running. The alternative is to take road transport, which is very costly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/re-start-shuttle-train-serviceto-bhusawal-demand-citizens/articleshow/87786306.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Addressing a press conference, AAP leaders said that the party will approach the court to challenge the suspension of the councillors from the House. EDMC mayor on Wednesday said he suspended 17 members of the opposition AAP from the House for 15 days as they “indulged in misconduct” during the proceedings. However, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in EDMC, Manoj Tyagi, informed that he has information about the suspension of only 15 of his party councillors. “AAP has repeatedly exposed the true face of BJP in front of the people of Delhi, only for it to ignore and continue indulging in blatant corruption and misgovernance,” said Atishi. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, however, said that the action was taken after prior warning for at least two times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/atishi-councillors-suspended-for-highlighting-corruption/articleshow/87787803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Buried labourer rescued after eight hours in Jaipur cave-in||JAIPUR: A labourer, who was buried after sand caved in on him at the under-construction building near the Brahmpuri Khurra area under Nahargarh police station Thursday evening was rescued late night. His condition is said to be serious. SHO Devendra Kumar said that the labourer, Hanuman Sharma, was buried under sand while digging for the construction of pillars for a house. The rescue operation was halted late at night after there was apprehension that it may cause structural damage to nearby buildings. A civil defence team was dispatched to the scene immediately after the Nahargarh police received the first report of the tragedy around 4pm. “The incident took place at Fakiro ki Dhani area where construction work was underway when the mishap took place. Labourers were digging when the sand suddenly crashed on them,” said a witness. Mahendra Sevda of the civil defence team told TOI that the labourer must be buried at least under 15 feet deep. Rescuers said that there were several multistoried buildings adjacent to it which impeded their operation. “We had begun digging up the basement in search of Sharma when some debris fell from nearby houses. It posed an immediate danger to the structure of other houses due to which the rescue operation had to come to a halt,” said an official who is part of the rescue effort. Locals told officials that at least two other labourers were present near the site moments before the incident, but managed to escape unscathed. Several JCB machines and other equipment were moved to the site. Till late night, rescuers were struggling to resume operations to rescue the worker. An official informed TOI that they had sought technical advice from disaster relief experts. “Residents from nearby buildings may have to be evacuated to ensure that there is no untoward situation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/buried-labourer-rescued-after-8-hrs-in-city-cave-in/articleshow/87788485.cms||---
---||Delhi||56-year-old’s case shows how some can benefit from partial knee replacement||NEW DELHI: A 56-year-old woman recently underwent a partial knee replacement surgery at a private hospital. Unlike the conventional procedure where surgeons use a fixed bearing joint, the artificial joint used in this case was mobile, giving the patient better mobility, claimed Dr Yash Gulati, chief orthopaedic surgeon of Apollo hospital who conducted the procedure. Instances of osteoarthritis are going up in India and, therefore, the need for knee replacement, Dr Gulati said. However, he clarified, all such patients do not require a total knee replacement; a partial knee replacement using innovative techniques is gaining acceptance. “Our knee joint is made up of three compartments: one inner, one outer and one with the kneecap. Quite often, especially in the Indian population, it is only the inner compartment that gets affected. Such patients can benefit from a partial knee replacement. However, due to the lack of awareness, many people continue to get total knee replacement done,” the doctor said. In the current case, he added, the woman had extreme arthritis of one compartment (medial arthritis) and she had been offered total knee replacement by some hospitals. “We found it fit for a partial replacement. It was done using a small incision and required the least bone damage as compared to total knee replacement,” Dr Gulati explained. Partial knee replacement is offered at many other hospitals, too, such as AIIMS. In the UK, doctors say, about 25% of all knee replacement cases are the ones in which only one compartment is changed. “In our country, orthopaedic surgeons have started to recognise this, but a lot of awareness is still required,” said a senior doctor. “Once it is established that only one compartment is involved, it is logical to change only that part,” another doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/56-year-olds-case-shows-how-some-can-benefit-from-partial-knee-replacement/articleshow/87788495.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The unseasonal showers are likely to affect the fruit orchards. Rohan Salvi, a farmer from Pandharpur, said, “Due to these unseasonal showers production of fruits like pomegranate and guava will be affected. These fruits develop black spots and many times attract caterpillars. If it rains further, then grape production will also get affected.” The low pressure area and associated cyclonic circulation over the Arabian sea has been the reason behind the unseasonal showers in the region. Meanwhile, weather in Kolhapur remained humid owing to the cloud cover and few spells of rain in parts of the district. As per IMD, Kolhapur district received 4.3mm rainfall between Wednesday and Thursday morning. Ajara region received the highest rainfall of 11.1mm, while Gaganbawda region received the least 1.1mm rainfall on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/more-rain-likely-in-kolhapur-till-sunday/articleshow/87786330.cms||---

Skoda opened bookings for the model, manufactured at its Chakan facility near Pune, on Thursday, and said the price would be released in the first quarter of 2022. Slavia becomes the third newly-launched vehicle in India as a part of Skoda-Volkswagen’s India 2.0 market revitalisation strategy, which aimed at taking up to 5% of the Indian auto market share. The model will be available in two engine variants, as well as automatic and manual transmission editions. Skoda said while Slavia was primarily aimed at the Indian market, the company might consider the export market in certain jurisdictions, but as knocked-down cars. “In our India 2.0 strategy, we also focus on a high degree of localization of inputs of up to 95%. But we have also been dealing with the semiconductor chip shortage issue, like everyone else in the auto industry. No one makes chips in India, and thus the entire supply must be imported, and it is an industry requiring high investments. We hope that the situation resolves somewhat in the middle of 2022, and completely by the end of next year,” said Gurpratap Boparai, managing director of Skoda India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/skoda-returns-to-premium-sedan-space-with-slavia/articleshow/87787830.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

During lockdown in 2020-21 and 2021-22, schools remained closed for a long time. The government had been saying it would verify whether schools had conducted online classes. But verification of online teaching and textbook distribution is a time consuming process that would be done on a random basis by the administrative department in private schools. The order said for verification, the process of formation, training and verification teams at the district level is likely to take some time. In such a case, there will be a delay to make payments. Therefore, for 2020-21 session, the finance department had sent a proposal to pay 25 per cent of the amount for online teaching conducted under RTE to the institution as an advance. This advance amount will be adjusted against the last payable amount and in case the advance amount exceeds the last payable amount, this excess amount will be adjusted against the amount payable in the next financial year, said the government order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-releases-25-fees-under-rte/articleshow/87788505.cms||---

The delay came after the ministry announced to hand over the railway station development work to Ambala division, and the Chandigarh railway station is yet to be formally handed over to it, said Ambala divisional manager Gurinder Mohan Singh. The dissolution of the IRSDC was announced in October this year. Special purpose vehicle of IRSDC was constituted in 2012, after which the corporation took over city railway station in 2019, but since then no work was done. Now everything will be redesigned and re-planned once Ambala division takes over. Singh said, “After it is officially handed over, we will chalk out new plans to construct Chandigarh as a world-class railway station.” As part of an amenities overhaul, the Chandigarh railway station was to get new CCTV cameras and emergency talk-back systems. Currently, 35 CCTV cameras are installed at the station, but their recordings and resolution are of poor quality. These will be replaced with high-resolution IP cameras, which don’t require a recording device. Singh had earlier said that they plan to have a system of 80-100 cameras to cover the premises. Along with beautification, the Rs 136-crore makeover project aimed at bringing an “air concourse”, on the lines of airport terminals, at all six platforms, and subways to segregate passenger flow. While this was earlier set to be finished by December 2021, now the work is to start afresh. IRSDC was also to manage passenger amenities and other infrastructures, like better platforms, waiting rooms, washrooms, eating and food stalls, drinking water facilities, keeping coaches clean, and adequate parking facilities with latest technologies. In the second stage, the construction part of the station was to be taken up in which state-of-the-art lounges, restaurants, serais and buildings were to be constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/upgrade-of-cameras-at-railway-station-delayed/articleshow/87787832.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||India||Soldiers ready to protect every inch, says Rajnath Singh||NEW DELHI: India’s brave soldiers are capable of protecting every inch of Indian territory, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday, while dedicating a revamped Rezang La war memorial in eastern Ladakh to the nation amidst the continuing 18-month military confrontation with China there. “The renovation of the memorial is not only a tribute to our valiant armed forces, but also a symbol of the fact that we are fully prepared to protect the integrity of the nation. This monument symbolises the government’s stand of giving a befitting reply to anyone who threatens our sovereignty and integrity,” said Singh. The Rezang La memorial commemorates the unparalleled valour displayed by a company of 13 Kumaon led by Major Shaitan Singh — who was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra — against the numerically-superior Chinese Army at an altitude of over 16,500-feet on the Kailash Ranges during the 1962 war. “The historic battle of Rezang La is difficult to imagine even today. Major Shaitan Singh and his fellow soldiers fought till ‘last bullet and last breath’ and wrote a new chapter of bravery and sacrifice,” said the defence minister. “I am saluting the 114 Indian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in the 1962 war after reaching Rezang La,” added Singh, who also met Brig R V Jatar (retd) who was part of the battle of Rezang La as a captain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soldiers-ready-to-protect-every-inch-says-rajnath-singh/articleshow/87789913.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Murder suspect alleges being framed for Rs 10 lakh bribe||Panchkula: One and a half months after the murder of a 27-year-old man at Majri chowk, one of the victim’s acquaintances, whose name figured in the call details and who was called for questioning as a suspect, alleged that an inspector and an ASI-level officer demanded Rs 10 lakh from him to clear his name from the case. He said they threatened to press murder charges against him if he failed to pay up. A video of him levelling the allegations is doing the rounds on social media. The man, identified as Shekhar released three selfie videos demanding a “fair investigation” into the murder case. He alleged that two police personnel demanded Rs 10 lakh from him and another person involved in the incident. In his one 3-minute video, Shekhar said, “Two cops are threatening to make me the prime accused in Rinku’s murder case when I denied giving them Rs 10 lakh. Both the cops are not calling me but are sending some private person to my home and demanding Rs 10 lakh saying I own a good house and can pay. I told them I did not have money and asked them to probe the matter fairly but to no avail.” He said in the video that all he did was to call the murder victim and two to three others after he came to know that a fight was likely between them. “My concern was to stop the fight, but accusing me of murder and harassing my family for not giving Rs 10 lakh is going to ruin my life”, he said. In the video, Shekhar sought the intervention of police commissioner Saurabh Singh, DCP Mohit Handa and home minister Anil Vij. He requested them to order a fair investigation and give him stern punishment if he was found guilty. Police personnel were unavailable for comment. Early on September 27, around 10 to 12 persons attacked the victim, Rinku with swords, slashing his face and head at Majri Chowk. Rinku died while two of his friends took shelter at Kharak Mangoli and called the cops. A case was registered under section 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment for murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees or more) of the IPC at Sector 7 police station. Further investigations are on. It was the victim who named a few of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/murder-suspect-alleges-being-framed-for-rs-10-lakh-bribe/articleshow/87787853.cms||---

---||Delhi||E-charging stations set up at eight sites||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has finally set up e-charging stations for two-wheelers at eight sites after obtaining permission from the public works department (PWD), said an official. The sites are South Extension I & II, Bhikaji Cama Place, Sant Nagar and Lajpat Nagar 2. However, only one station at South Extension I has been made operational, while work for laying electricity cable is pending at other places due to the construction ban. “We will complete the work as soon as the ban is lifted and made them operational. People can charge their vehicles and pay bill online. Most of the stations will have facility to operate with the help of solar energy,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner of SDMC’s remunerative and project cell. To motivate people to use e-vehicles, the corporation decided to set up charging stations at 109 locations on main roads. The installation work for two-wheeler stations was to be carried out at 35 locations by Telecommunications Consultants India Limited. “But now the number of locations will be reduced to 30 as a consensus on the rest could not be reached with PWD. There is apprehension that the stations may hinder widening of roads in future,” said the SDMC official. While the work for two-wheeler stations started in October, the project was put on hold for some time. “We wrote to PWD that maintain the roads and issues were sorted out,” said the official. A PWD official also confirmed that the permission had been granted for these sites. While SDMC has already set up e-charging stations for four-wheelers, it is stressing on two-wheeler stations as they occupy less space. Electric two-wheelers are also economical and travel 80-100km after one full charge. “The two-wheelers contribute to two-third of the vehicular pollution in cities. Our stations are on Ring Road or Outer Ring Road to encourage their use for last-mile connectivity,” said Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-charging-stations-set-up-at-eight-sites/articleshow/87788521.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Supreme Court pulls up Gujarat government over payment of Covid ex gratia||AHMEDABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday pulled up the Gujarat government for making the disbursement process of Covid-19 death compensation cumbersome and for trying to “overreach” its directions by issuing a notification for Covid death compensation. The court termed the state’s notification “just contrary” to the “clear” directions issued to pay Rs 50,000 ex gratia compensation in Covid death. The SC insisted that it has issued clear directives that compensation amount should be paid on production of RT-PCR certificate and the death certificate showing that the death has occurred within 30 days. There is no further requirement at all, the SC reiterated. The bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice B V Nagarathna ordered the state government to simplify its procedure for disbursal of compensation among the Covid-affected families. The judges have sought response from the state authorities by November 22 on issuing a notification which is not in accordance with the SC directions and “to take remedial steps and come out with a clear and simplified formula/notification so that the amount of compensation as ordered by this court is paid to the victim at the earliest and without any further harassment”. The SC made it clear that the state government must issue new notification in accordance with its directions issued on October 4, and said, “Any deviation shall be viewed very seriously.” It insisted, “Even the procedure for compensation should be simplified and the form should be very simple and should not be clumsy.” The court was upset with the state government forming a scrutiny committee for issuing death certificates, which has made the affected families run from pillar to post. The apex court felt that the Gujarat government tried to overreach its directions. A practising advocate from Ahmedabad, Amit Panchal, raised objection to October 29 notification pointing out that the state has formed a Covid-19 Death Ascertaining Committee, which is contrary to the SC’s directions. The applicant has sought contempt of court proceedings against the health and family welfare department officials for issuing such a notification, “which is wilful disobedience of the directions of the court”. The SC perused the notification and said that it felt that it is just contrary to court directions. “It appears that an attempt has been made to overreach the directions issued by this court,” it noted. The judges further said that the state government was not required to constitute the scrutiny committee for the purpose of awarding compensation. The SC direction was for constitution of a Grievance Redressal Committee in case compensation is not paid and family members are aggrieved about death certificates. The court had not ordered the formation of a scrutiny committee for the purpose of issuing death certificates for getting compensation. The court said, “Our direction was very clear that the amount of compensation to be paid on production of the RT-PCR certificate and the death certificate showing that the death has occurred within 30 days. There was no further requirement at all.” It further said that death within 30 days of Covid-19 positive report entitled family members to compensation without any further conditions. “No further condition and/or requirement is provided. Still, such a notification has been issued without application of mind which can be said to be over-reaching the directions issued by this Court,” the court order reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-trying-to-make-process-cumbersome/articleshow/87787845.cms||---

---||Kolkata||As footfall rises, missing trolleys, unclean toilets back to haunt Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: From missing trolleys to unclean washrooms and faulty charging points to overcrowding on transit buses — old problems are back at Kolkata airport as it is pacing towards the pre-pandemic level footfall, clocking 50,000-plus passengers on an average over the last few days. Since the withdrawal of capacity restrictions on domestic flights last month, airlines in Kolkata increased their flights to full capacity, leading to a surge in footfall from the start of this month. Airport officials said that by next month it will have 60,000-plus domestic passengers daily, just like the pre-pandemic times. TimesViewFlyers coming back but Covid protocols still being there together make for a sure-shot recipe for disruption. The airport here has been spared the type of chaos that Mumbai experienced during the Diwali festive season. But the airport management and airlines must try to anticipate the problems and take preemptive measures.Issues related to “missing trolleys” top the complaint chart. This had bothered the Kolkata airport authorities earlier till it plugged the gap with an addition of 5,500 trolleys three years ago. While some of the trolleys conked off during the period, the drop in number of passengers due to Covid ensured there were enough trolleys to fill the demand. But with the footfall rising, passengers have started ruing about missing trolleys again. “Most pathetic experience in Kolkata airport. No trolley available, a drunkard was selling trolleys. No airline assistance was around to help and unreasonable charges for luggage, no support at queue,” read a tweet by Swagoto Chaudhuri on November 15. Another twitter user, Sanjay Gupta, was upset about another issue — unclean washrooms. “Request, the people in charge of maintaining washrooms in Kolkata airport to keep it clean. It’s the worst maintained airport in the country. Where does the user development fee, that we pay, goes to. Can the Kolkata airport authority reply?” Gupta had tweeted last week. Passengers have also highlighted faulty charging points at the airport. Among other issues that have returned to haunt the passengers are illegal parking of VIP and other vehicles belonging to cops and other dignitaries that clutter the area in front of the arrival section of the terminal and overcrowding of passengers in transit buses that take passengers from the terminal to the aircraft. On November 11, Harsh Nawal had posted a video of a crowded transit bus on Twitter tagging one of the airlines. Airport director C Pattabhi said he would take action to address the issues. “We have enough trolleys. But, I feel that at times trolleys are not returned to the bay on time, inconveniencing the passengers. We have also deployed extra men to ensure washrooms remain clean but there are occasions when some users soil the washroom,” said Pattabhi. About faulty charging points, Pattabhi said he has asked his personnel to look into it. “Overcrowding on transit buses is a real problem. I have asked the airlines to address this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-footfall-rises-missing-trolleys-unclean-toilets-back-to-haunt-airport/articleshow/87787858.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Work starts to construct tank to increase water File storage capacity||CHANDIGARH: The work has started to construct a new tank of 2-million-gallon water storage capacity at Sector 39 water works. It is the only new tank coming up at the water works under the project to increase water storage capacity from half-day to one-day supply. Besides, work is also going on to increase the capacity of the existing eight water storage tanks. “The new tank project aims at storing more water. Senior MC engineering officers are monitoring the work, which is being carried out as per specified designs and drawings,” sources said. As the water storage capacity has to be increased from the existing 48 MGD to 92 MGD a day, all the tanks will be reconstructed so that they can store almost double water. “Of the existing eight water tanks, capacity of one (number 8) has been enhanced and of two (number 6 and 7) will be increased in some days,” said an official. All the tanks are not being reconstructed simultaneously. “Since water is stored in the tanks, work can’t be started in all together. It will be done one by one,” the official added. The project will be completed in two years after which the city will have one-day water supply storage capacity. The supply comes from Bhakra Canal. The estimated cost of the project was Rs 37.37 crore. But as the successful bid was around 6.50% less, it was allotted for Rs 34.94 crore. The Chandigarh administration has already given the fund-starved MC around Rs 26 crore for the project. The rest of the amount will be paid by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) and has been approved by its board of directors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/work-starts-to-construct-tank-to-increase-citys-water-storage-capacity/articleshow/87787846.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||Dhapa plant boost to solve Kasba-Patuli water woes||Kolkata: To ward off water crisis in large areas off EM Bypass, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to augment the capacity of Jai Hind water treatment plant at Dhapa. The KMC water supply department needs to spend around Rs 126 crore for the augmentation of the treatment plant in next two years, said a KMC water supply department senior official. The KMC water supply department has also planned the construction of a water treatment plant in Garia-Patuli belt to improve the supply of potable water for the residents of large areas of Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt. Speaking at length on the civic body’s water augmentation policy, the chairman of the KMC board of administrators, Firhad Hakim, on Thursday said that the civic body was determined to take safe drinking water to large areas off EM Bypass and to lakhs of people residing in Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt. The present capacity of Dhapa water treatment plant is 30 million gallons per day (MGD). It caters to over 8 lakh people with filtered water in large areas (from Beliaghata to Patuli) off EM Bypass. The plant had started functioning in 2015. Hakim on Thursday said the capacity of Dhapa water treatment would be augmented by 20 MGD, taking the capacity to 50 MGD to supply potable water to at least 15 lakh houses. According to plans, the civic body will draw additional water from Mayer ghat in Bagbazar and the same will be treated at the Dhapa plant. The treated water will be sent to households in different areas off Bypass through major water pipes that will be laid soon. “Though we are supplying filtered water from the Dhapa water treatment plant, it is not sufficient to cater to the growing needs due to rapid urbanization,” said a civic official. According to a KMC official, after completion of the augmentation, the residents of Topsia, Anandapur, Naskarhat, Kasba, Madurdaha, Kalikapur, Mukundapur and Patuli will be benefited. “We have built water reservoirs in Anandapur, Mukundapur and Patuli,” said a civic official. The civic body will also focus on the construction of capsule or mini water booster pumping stations in the Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt to reach drinking water from the proposed treatment plant at Garia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dhapa-plant-boost-to-solve-kasba-patuli-water-woes/articleshow/87787870.cms||Saikat Ray

The dispensary and shelter home will be run in association with non-governmental organisation People for Animal and will offer medical treatment for pets at nominal charges, and sterilisation of stray dogs and cats. The agenda approved by the general body also allows owners to be fined Rs500 if they do not clean up after their pets in public. Corporators discussed the matter with NCP leader and former mayor Yogesh Bahl alleging that there were irregularities in the sterilisation of stray dogs by three firms during the pandemic. “We got to know via Right to Information (RTI) that the sterilisation of 5,000 stray dogs in the civic limits conducted by three firms during the pandemic was fake. Only bills were produced. NCP corporator from ward number 9, Vaishali Ghodekar, said the civic body must maintain records of pets. “Shelter experts and the PCMC must find a better way to manage the issue of stray animals,” said Ghodekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-general-body-approves-animal-shelter/articleshow/87787863.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Having received such conflicting replies from zones of the AMC, RTI activist Alpesh Bhavsar has filed an appeal with the civic body. Bhavsar had sought information on patients treated by private designated Covid hospitals and the amount that the AMC paid to these hospitals in lieu of the treatment. An almost identical reply was received from six AMC zones. “Information sought is not public information according to section 4 of Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. Since this information is confidential and work has been done in good faith, this information cannot be considered public information under RTI Act until the pandemic is not over,” read the replies. The central zone of the AMC, however, thinks otherwise. It provided Bhavsar with the names of private hospitals which were designated as Covid hospitals, the number of beds available for Covid-19 treatment in these hospitals and the amount that the AMC reimbursed to the hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. Bhavsar had sought these details for the period from April 2020 to June 2021. “It is a known fact that Covid-19 patients were fleeced by private hospitals who were designated as Covid-19 hospitals. Since the AMC has received funds from multiple agencies for Covid-19 treatment, these details ought to be part of proactive disclosure,” said Bhavsar. # Zone-wise details of how many and which private hospitals were designated as Covid-19 hospitals. # How much money did each hospital receive from corporation? Including details on costs incurred per patient. # Number of cases where private Covid-19 designated hospitals charged more than the fixed rates for treatment. Steps taken by the AMC to enforce rates which had been fixed. # How many persons were vaccinated by private hospitals for the first and second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and how much money did they earn?

---||Delhi||Delhi: New liquor stores in illegal colonies too||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has permitted retail liquor stores in unapproved markets in unauthorised colonies and rural areas. The excise department issued an order on Wednesday following a cabinet decision on November 5 that allowed the opening of retail liquor vends in non-conforming areas. The order facilitates opening of at least two liquor stores in each municipal ward as mandated under the new excise policy. Meanwhile, the city continues to grapple with liquor shortage even on Thursday with many swanky new stores — nearly 200 have opened in two days — not having enough stocks. Under the new policy, 850 liquor stores are going to open while all existing shops were closed on November 16. The Wednesday order stated that applications for retail liquor store licence might be considered provided no conforming area category existed in that particular ward. “Further, two mandatory vends may be permitted to be opened in those wards that have no conforming area, i.e. have 100% non-conforming areas only,” it added. The applicants will have to furnish an affidavit stating that the ward concerned doesn’t have any conforming area, which refers to commercial and industrial areas notified or approved by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) or a municipal corporation. “In case, any municipal ward is found to be having a conforming area, the licensee shall be bound to shift his retail vend to a conforming area in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence within 30 days of issue of notice by the department,” the order pointed out. The liquor stores in the unapproved markets will not be smaller in size as compared to the approved markets. The minimum carpet area for all stores is 500 square foot. “The opening of a retail vend in non-conforming areas is subject to obtaining the requisite approval from DDA and the municipal corporation concerned by the licensee,” the order stated. The excise department has asked the zonal retail licensees to promptly apply for the grant of the retail licence for their vends in the municipal wards without any conforming area and submit a physical copy of the application with necessary documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-liquor-stores-in-illegal-colonies-too/articleshow/87788534.cms||AlokKNMishra

In places which did not receive rains, there was cloud cover throughout the day. Jhadol (Udaipur) received 28 mm rain, the highest in the state. Because of the cloudy conditions, day temperatures remained below 30°C in majority of the places. Churu remained coldest logging 5.6°C. Farmers, who have either finished sowing or are doing it, are jittery and apprehensive as they believe the rainfall might be a spoilsport for crops. “We have sown mustard almost a week ago and if the rainfall is moderate, it will spoil it and we will have to sow again. That means the seed cost would be lost,” said Ganpat Lal Saini, a farmer from Suroth village in Sikar district. Attributing the climatic change to active upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office said till Saturday, mild showers will occur at some places in Udaipur and Jaipur divisions. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning with a minimum temperature of 14.2°C. The maximum temperature of the day was 23.8°C, almost 8 degrees below normal. It was coldest afternoon of the season so far in Jaipur. Churu was followed by Sikar where a minimum temperature of 6.8°C was recorded, Pilani (7.6°C), Hanumangarh (7.9°C), Alwar (9.7°C), Sriganganagar (9.9°C) However, in rest of the districts, the minimum temperatures remained between 10°C and 15.0°C. In its forecast, Jaipur Met office said mild to moderate showers will occur at many places in southern and eastern Rajasthan in the next 24 hours.

Now, feta cheese, which is made from goat milk, will soon hit the market with Surendranagar’s Sursagar Dairy chalking out elaborate plans to make this milk product. Sursagar Dairy will soon have a meeting with Sahjeevan, a voluntary organization working with pastoral families in Saurashtra and Kutch and apprise the Gujarat Milk Marketing Co-operative Federation (GCMMF) to finalize the launching of feta cheese in December. GCMMF, which markets the Amul brand, has already shown interest in selling feta cheese, which has no fat. Manoj Mishra, executive director of Sahjeevan, told TOI: “We had a meeting with GCMMF officials last week about the launching of feta cheese. They tested a smaller volume production of cheese and are going to test the production from 2,000 litres of milk.” Mishra said the launch is being planned in the first or second week of December. GCMMF, Sursagar Dairy officials and Sahjeevan team will meet soon to finalize the date and they are planning to invite Parsottam Rupala, union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, for the launch. Feta cheese is made in a few select places and India imports this cheese from Denmark and France. Goat milk has almost nil fat and that’s why it’s useful for making cheese. There are many pastoral families in Surendranagar engaged in goat breeding. Currently, they sell goat milk in the open market and some of them also mix it with cow or buffalo milk. Sursagar Dairy, which procures milk in the district, has already identified 17 pockets in Sayla and Chotila talukas to procure this milk. This milk will be initially procured in existing bulk milk chillers (BMC) and if required, they will also have mobile BMC which can keep milk cool for six to seven hours. There are some 500 families engaged in goat breeding and the dairy can procure 8,000 litres milk per day but in the initial stage they are planning to procure 2,000 litres. Gurdit Singh, managing director, Sursagar Dairy said, “I got a message from GCMMF that they will launch feta cheese. We have provided them goat milk for trial and we have infrasture ready to procure this milk.” GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi said, “We are positive about marketing goat cheese which is our initial planning. We are doing trials and the date of launching is yet to be finalized.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/feta-cheese-to-hit-shelves-across-gujarat-soon/articleshow/87787109.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kolhapur||Satej files MLC poll nomination||Kolhapur: District guardian minister and sitting Congress MLC Satej Patil on Thursday submitted his nomination papers to contest the MLC elections for the Kolhapur local body constituency. Patil was flanked by the key leaders of MVA parties, making it clear that they all stand in unity to ensure Patil’s win. In 2015, Patil had won the MLC seat with the support of NCP and smaller fronts. Then, Shiv Sena was with BJP. Now, since the Sena is with him, he expects landslide victory. After filling the nomination papers, Patil said, “At present, we have the support of 250 electors. In the next few days, the number will cross 270. The overwhelming response is due to the work done by the MVA in the past two years.” The members of the local bodies are the electors for the MLC election. As many as 416 electors are eligible to vote and the halfway mark to win is 209. After the nomination papers were filled, the MVA leaders addressed the party workers. Several leaders who were not with Patil during the recent Gokul cooperative dairy polls, were on the stage to support him. The Congress MLA PN Patil and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana president Raju Shetti were in opposition to the panel led by Patil and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif. Their presence showed that Patil has managed to take both on board. Patil and Mushrif made PN Patil’s son Rahul Patil the president of Kolhapur Zilla Parishad, despite demand from their own supporters to make one of them the ZP president. Despite criticising MVA led government for not heeding to the demands of flood-affected farmers, Shetti shared the dais with the MVA leaders. He said, “The flood-affected farmers and common people are unhappy with the MVA. As a part of MVA, we are with our candidate in this election. However, please do not ignore the plight of the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-files-mlc-poll-nomination/articleshow/87786390.cms||---

The flank will remain shut for the next three days and will open at 6am on Monday. The KMDA had been seeking a weekend closure of the Bypass-bound flank from the police to conduct the test after several cracks along this stretch were repaired earlier this year. Officials said that the test after its repair was necessary to assess whether the flyover has regained the desired structural strength to take the load of vehicles. Cops have put up a notice board on the entry point of the Bypass-bound flank, where the flyover starts ascending on VIP Road, asking motorists to take the slip bridge that connects VIP Road with Salt Lake near Hudco crossing or to take the diverted route through Ultadanga and Hudco crossing to move towards Bypass. The VIP Road-bound flank of the flyover remains open for motorists to move from the Bypass. On Thursday, there was some traffic congestion on the Bypass from Hudco crossing as the vehicles had to take the stretch below the Ultadanga flyover. The flyover had been repaired temporarily in 2019. But the full-fledged repair was taken up this year by the KMDA, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/closed-flank-of-ultadanga-flyover-to-open-on-monday/articleshow/87787877.cms||Suman Chakraborti

From January 1, 2022, bells will ring in theatres across the state during regional rounds of the 60th Maharashtra State Marathi Theatre Festival. In Vidarbha, it will be held at nearly 20 centres including Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Chandrapur. Forms are available online and date sheet for Marathi, Hindi, Sanskrit and Children’s theatre events are also out. Maharashtra is the only state in India where the government conducts state-level theatre competition for amateur artistes. Groups from all parts of Maharashtra as well as Marathi speaking parts of neighbouring states like MP, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Telangana, and Karnataka also participate in it. The competition called ‘State Theatre festival’ was conducted uninterruptedly since the formation of Maharashtra in 1960. But the final round of the festival that began in 2019 could not be held due to Covid-19. In 2020, the entire competition was cancelled. Bibhishan Chaware, director of cultural affairs, Maharashtra, said that theatre groups across the state were waiting for the announcement. “We were getting inquiries this year as the pandemic has now receded. While we have kept the format of Marathi theatre festival same, the Hindi and Sanskrit theatre festivals will be held at one centre as the final state-level round this time,” he said. While Nagpur is the preferred centre for Hindi theatre festival, Ratnagiri or Pune take the leas in the Sanskrit event. Nashik has already proposed to host the final round of Marathi theatre festival in March 2022. As far as the regional rounds are concerned, Nagpur’s Scientific Society Hall will be the centre for both Marathi and Children’s theatre festivals. Participants from Vidarbha should submit their documents along with the form at the divisional officer of the directorate at central museum in Nagpur. “The amateur theatre awaits this annual event as it’s the only competitive platform for them,” said senior theatre activist Ashok Ashtikar. “Last year, we missed it. This time, we are preparing with double enthusiasm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amateur-theatre-bells-ring-maha-festival-to-resume-this-season/articleshow/87787889.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Over 50,000 hectare of sugar cane fields across Kolhapur district was waterlogged for over two weeks in June. After intervention from district collector Rahul Rekhawar it was decided that the mills will crush 40% flood-affected sugar cane and the remaining not affected by floods on a daily basis. The mills will also have to ensure that all sugar cane affected by floods in their respective jurisdiction is crushed. Shivaji Mane, president of Jay Shivray, Jay Kisan farmers organisation from Hatkanangle tehsil, said, “No mill in our tehsil is ready to crush the sugar cane affected by floods. We have submitted a petition to local authorities to ensure the directions given by district collector are followed in letter and spirit. In 2019, same situation had arrived, however the mills then had cooperated by crushing the flood-affected sugarcane on priority.” Mane said that his outfit has given one-week deadline to the mills to follow directions or they will stop harvest and stop sugarcane transport to the mills. Meanwhile, the mills have raised several concerns to the district authorities. They claim that crushing flood-affected sugarcane will affect sugar recovery and if it is less at the start of the season then the collateral loan given by cooperative banks will be less and thereby will affect payment to the farmers. Also, the cutters have cited difficulties posed while cutting of sugarcane from farms along the river banks. Rekhawar, however said that the mills are cooperating. “The mills are cooperating and have provided us village-wise schedule of crushing till January.” Farmers, who are already under financial distress due to floods, have demanded that sugarcane should be cut at the earliest and keeping it for long time will yield less sugar and thereby less income for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-outfits-mills-refuse-to-crush-cane-affected-by-floods/articleshow/87786410.cms||---

To ease the process and motivate the owners to take up the restoration and repair works, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) would launch a drive to provide all services at a single window. To mark the UNESCO World Heritage Week, celebrated annually from November 19 to 25, the fees of the application would also be waived, said AMC officials. The historic city of Ahmedabad had become India’s first UNESCO World Heritage City in 2017. AMC municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, “The single window clearance will provide encouragement to private heritage homes and havelis to take advantage of the TDR (transferable development rights) extended to them in the Walled City. We have tried to cut down on the process, which we expect will help us conserve more buildings.” “The owners need to approach the cell at Sardar Patel Bhavan, Danapith with stipulated application form, ownership documents and architectural plans,” said a heritage cell official. Ashish Trambadia, director of the Ahmedabad World Heritage City Trust (AWHCT), said that the heritage cell provides technical guidance to the heritage homeowners on restoration, and so far about 40 such homes are either restored or are in various stages of restoration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/opening-a-window-to-usher-in-heritage-conservation/articleshow/87787927.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Lucknow||Irate students call off 18-hour agitation as univ raises compensation for death||Lucknow: An 18-hour long protest by Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMNRU) students, including many physically challenged ones, on Thursday forced the varsity officials to increase the compensation announced for the family of a visually challenged student who was crushed to death by the institution’s bus on Wednesday. The university had announced Rs 5 lakh compensation on Wednesday evening after students protested for over 10 hours demanding justice for BA student Ruksaar Jahan, who was killed when the driver of the bus reversed the vehicle carelessly at high speed. Later, the driver was also arrested in the night. Following these developments, the students had withdrawn their protest. However, after reaching the hostel, the students had a meeting in which they came to the conclusion that the compensation was less, hence decided to resume the protest. Around midnight, a group of students sat at the university gates for a demonstration. Soon, they were joined by other students. At around 1 pm, Jahan’s parents also arrived on the campus to take the body of their daughter. Students brought them to the demonstration venue as well. In the morning, students blocked the road outside the campus and raised slogans against the university authorities. The students demanded Rs 40 lakh compensation for Jahan’s family and a job for a member. Vice-chancellor Prof Rana Krishna Pal Singh came to meet the demonstrators at 6pm. He announced to increase compensation to Rs 6 lakh and assured that since varsity is incapable of paying Rs 40 lakh, it will request the government to give the same under the Motor Vehicle Act. He appealed to university employees to donate a day’s salary for Jahan’s family. Jahan was a resident of Siwan in Bihar and a talented student. Her father Rashid Aleem, who is a shopkeeper, said that he wanted justice for his daughter who was killed due to carelessness of a driver. “I was stopped by the police administration when I was coming to the university to join the protest. University authorities wanted me to stay in a hotel. How can I stay in comfort with the pain of losing my young daughter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/irate-students-call-off-18-hour-agitation-as-univ-raises-compensation-for-death/articleshow/87788602.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Medical certificate racket in jail busted by Delhi cops||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police Special Cell busted a racket involved in the supply of fake medical certificates to incarcerated undertrials, which were used to seek bail or parole. A man claiming to be a doctor is being interrogated in custody, sources said. The accused was identified as Ram Krishna Gupta, a resident of sector 75 in Noida. He is the alleged mastermind of the racket. More arrests are likely and the cops suspect the involvement of a middleman and an advocate too. Raids are being conducted to nab others. The ‘doctor’, whose credentials are being verified, is suspected to have made over a dozen certificates for undertrials till date for pecuniary gains. Cops suspect he is a quack and impersonating a practicing doctor on the basis of forged documents. As per his remand application, police have invoked sections of impersonation, providing false information to court, cheating and forgery, against the accused. Gupta allegedly charged Rs 50,000-Rs 1,00,000 for each report based on the profile of the undertrial seeking the application. During initial investigation, cops have established his involvement in five such cases, a source said. “During interrogation, the accused conceded preparation of several medical reports to aid undertrial prisoners, but he claims to be unable to recall their particulars. We are digging further,” said an investigator. The cops had started this investigation on the directions of Delhi High Court, which had flagged a case of a fictitious medical report during the hearing of a bail application of a drug trafficker, Rais Khan, who was arrested with 329.5kg of drugs in 2019. An FIR was registered and a team was formed to investigate the matter. Cops tried to trace the alleged doctor who had issued the fake medical certificate to the undertrial, but found him untraceable. Several raids were conducted to nab him. Proclamation proceedings were then initiated to declare him an absconder. On Thursday, the cops received information that the suspect in the case was in Noida. Technical surveillance was mounted and the suspect was tracked down and arrested. During questioning, Gupta claimed that he was diagnosed with a brain-related ailment and was operated upon by a neurologist over the left temporal region for a brain tumour in the year 2002-03. He was then exposed to the working of doctors and decided to impersonate one. The accused has been produced before a court and taken on remand for four days, his custody application states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/medical-certificate-racket-in-jail-busted/articleshow/87787973.cms||Raj Shekhar

The vaccination drive for pregnant women began in August and since then, 4,357 women across the district have been given the first dose, while 1,082 have been administered the second dose. Dr Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer and vaccination incharge said, “In Anjaneri PHC, the vaccination was carried under the special campaign and all the pregnant women registered with the health department have been administered at least the first dose. Leena Bansod, the ZP CEO, monitored the vaccination drive.” Bhoye pointed out that there are many pregnant women who have received vaccines, but were not categorized separately by the staff. “The number is only from the special campaign. Those who took vaccination at other centres were not categorized and hence, we have asked the officials to count them,” he said. The health officials said that on average, every year, 80,000 pregnant women register themselves with the health department. “Given the target, the vaccination numbers are low. The exercise of counting the vaccinated pregnant women is now being undertaken with the help of ASHA workers,” the official added. Malegaon taluka is leading in administering the first dose to 1,109 women, followed by Dindori taluka where 617 women have been given the jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-pregnant-women-under-anjaneri-phc-got-1st-covid-vax-dose/articleshow/87786463.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||Goons buy sharp weapons online, keep cops busy with seizures||Nagpur: The city police is finding it tricky to tackle crimes in city as goons are increasingly using e-commerce portals to purchase sharp weapons under the label of ‘kitchenware’. Known as ‘Chinese’ weapons, these are popular among youngsters, it’s learnt. In two years, there has been a sharp 81% increase in the seizure of arms, including a substantial number of weapons procured online. Till October 2019, 433 sharp weapons were seized by police. This year, 783 sharp weapons were seized till October. During a recent research done by the National Law University on crimes in Nagpur, a substantial rise in the trend of hurt cases and murders was observed. Though the traditional sources and routes of smuggling firearms from Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh mostly remained unchanged, the modus operandi of procuring sharp weapons has seen a sea change with easy availability of such materials on e-commerce sites. The sharp weapons are delivered at the doorsteps after being purchased online. CP Amitesh Kumar had in December last year issued a notification under Criminal Procedure Code 144 banning sale, purchase and delivery of any arms or weapons through e-commerce portals which do not conform to the norms under the Indian Arms Act. The top cop said that several purchasers of sharp weapons were pulled up and warned of serious actions in a drive towards the end of last year. The weapons were confiscated too. “Along with them, strict action will be taken against e-commerce portals too if it’s found the weapon used in a crime had been purchased and delivered from their sites, especially if it violates specifications of the Indian Arms Act,” he said. As per the Indian Arms Act, any sharp weapon beyond nine-inch in length and two-inch in width will be categorized as illegal. During a recent action, city police had recovered nine sharp weapons purchased online. The CP said the e-commerce portals have been advised to refrain from violating the instructions. “Shopping portals are dealing mostly in kitchenware and these sharp weapons are many times packaged as crockeries and vegetable knives. We are thinking of legally binding them,” he said. He also said the crime branch and police stations have been directed to take separate and joint drives against illegal arms, criminals known to keep and use arms and such armed gangs. “All the criminals on record having offences of possessing or supplying arms and known to have used them are being repeatedly checked and slapped with preventive actions,” said the top cop. Sources in the police stated that some shrines too have shops selling swords and small knives for religious purposes. “Goons many times mislead the shopkeepers for buying swords and knives by masquerading as member of a community,” said the source. A community near Rani Durgawati Chowk manufactures sharp weapons ‘on order’ and delivers it within few hours fearing police raids. “A mini factory of blacksmiths at Mominpura also delivers sharp weapons if an order is placed. After a raid, the place is being operated clandestinely,” said a source and added, “Some shops in Mominpura had earlier faced actions for selling Chinese weapons.” Sharp weapons seized 433 | Till October 2019 489 | Till October 2020 783 | Till October 2021||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goons-buy-sharp-weapons-online-keep-cops-busy-with-seizures/articleshow/87787959.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) is in talks with the Railways authorities to introduce a rail block to assist the work as the girder would be launched above the tracks and overhead traction. MahaMetro plans to complete the work in a week, with a few hours of block every day. As per the alignment, the Metro viaduct is aligned along the old Pune-Mumbai road till Khadki railway station, after which it would cross the tracks and enter the Range Hills area. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “It is delicate work and will require a rail block. We have already approached railway authorities with our plan. The girder is ready. It will be launched in phases. The entire work is expected to take about a week. We have teams of experts who will be working along with railway authorities to see that work is completed at the earliest”. A MahaMetro official said the Metro viaduct will be high enough as to not disturb railway operations; there will be an adequate clearance between the viaduct and the railways’ overhead traction. The girder will cater to both the up and down tracks. All necessary precautions will be followed during the launch of the girder, the official said The official said MahaMetro launched steel girders at other locations on the Metro routes in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The girder over the railway tracks had to be specially designed considering the railways’ requirements and technical aspects. After crossing the tracks on both ends, the girder will again be connected to the viaduct. The work of viaduct has already been expedited on both sides of the tracks. Officials from railway administration said that the proposal was being studied and that a plan for the launch would be finalised soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-web-girder-to-cross-rly-tracks-at-khadki-ready/articleshow/87787967.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: It’s still a messy ride on Tonk Road as revamp claims by traffic cops fall flat||JAIPUR: The city traffic police’s plans to remove bottlenecks along Tonk Road seem to have fizzled out very fast. Police officials, last month, had announced a slew of measures for a seamless movement of vehicular traffic on the road, including removal of encroachments outside SMS Hospital, nudging bus drivers to stop at earmarked spots, and proper parking facilities to remove bottlenecks. Cut to today, a reality check on the city’s important arterial road includes all signs of the old chaos, bottlenecks, and long snarls. The police had claimed that no bus would be allowed to halt at the Rambagh Circle. Contrary to claims, a row of buses was spotted on the same spot on Thursday, leaving a trail of stranded motorists honking for a corner to move ahead. There was a similar scene on the SMS Hospital Road, where multiple tie-ups brought the traffic to a crawl. Police had assured that vendors, unauthorized e-rickshaw parking spots will be removed to alleviate the problem. There are more than a dozen eateries, fruit vendors, illegal parking spots, dairy booths, and hawkers selling everything from masks to biscuits. The encroachment has led to buses, visitors and ambulances jostling for whatever little space they can find to advance before lights turn red, ahead on the intersection. At the glass factory stretch of the Tonk Road, police had assured that barricades will be put on a cut. No such arrangements were there as drivers continued to take a U-turn, thereby slowing down the traffic pouring in from Gopalpura. Near the Tonk Road flyover, peak hour traffic jams continue due to haphazard parking alongside the road, forcing people to take small alleys through residential blocks. Additional commissioner of police, law-and-order, Haider Ali Zaidi said a multi-departmental effort was needed. "The civic bodies and police need to come together, we are looking into the issue," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/its-still-a-messy-ride-on-tonk-road-as-revamp-claims-by-traffic-cops-fall-flat/articleshow/87788617.cms||---
---||Delhi||Chloroform OD killed two house workers||New Delhi: The investigation into the murders of two women from Darjeeling has revealed that they were given an overdose of chloroform. Investigators also claimed that the accused watched videos online to learn the use of chloroform. On Monday, the bodies of two house help were found in a house in the K block area of Jangpura Extension. Police on Wednesday arrested five people in the case and claimed that robbery was the primary motive. The key conspirator was a former help’s nephew. Investigators claimed that the accused did not have any knowledge about chloroform. “They purchased a one-litre bottle on the pretext of usage in a laboratory. Later they started watching videos on the internet on how to use chloroform on a person,” an investigator said. After they entered the house, they applied the chloroform on the faces of two maids. “To ensure they don’t wake up, they sprayed too much chloroform on the women’s pillows and gagged them with tape,” an investigator said, adding that they recovered the bottle. During the probe, investigators found that one accused was the nephew of a previous help, who worked for around two years in the house. “He learned the house’s topography from her and learnt that the house had Rs 30 lakh-40 lakh in cash,” said a police officer. The men expected only one help in the house but used the same strategy with chloroform to subdue both women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chloroform-od-killed-two-house-workers/articleshow/87787985.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Season’s 1st fog may surprise you today||Lucknow: Even as air quality continued to remain poor in the city on Thursday, people might witness pre-winter season’s first fog on Friday. Though the fog is expected to be shallow and that too only in the morning hours, experts fear that it may aggravate the air quality further. State met director JP Gupta said that easterly winds due to a low pressure area over Arabian Sea are feeding moisture into the state's atmosphere, resulting in overcast sky. This moisture may cause shallow fog/mist in the morning due to drop in temperatures at night, he explained. However, he added, possibilities of rains are low The maximum temperature on Thursday dropped to 25.8, three units below normal because of the cloudy sky. The minimum temperature was 14.2 degrees Celius, 1.3 degrees above normal. The met department forecast also said that there can be a brief spell of rain in some areas of East UP. Shallow fog/mist is expected in the rest of the state as well. Meanwhile, according to Central Pollution Control Board data Lucknow’s Air Quality Index increased to 241 on Thursday from 237 on Wednesday. This falls under the category of poor air quality, which may cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure. Experts said that tiny droplets of water in fog and mist combine with particles of pollutants to form smog or haze, which remains suspended in the air for a longer period, deteriorating the air quality further. Rain or increase in wind speed, however, helps in clearing the pollutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/seasons-1st-fog-may-surprise-you-today/articleshow/87788621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After having taken charge last month, Chakankar said she directed her staff to sort out all cases and has assured that the cases will be cleared after they are heard at the earliest. The state had last month issued orders that Chakankar would hold the post for three years commencing from October 21. The previous chairperson, Vijaya Rahatkar, resigned in February 2020 and the post has been vacant for the last one-and-a-half years. The national commission for women had expressed displeasure over the vacancy and finally, the government had issued the orders. She told TOI that overall, between April 2020 to October 2021, 7,001 cases registered with the commission of which 6,485 have already been cleared and only 516 cases have to be cleared. “The moment I took over, my first directive to the staff was to sort the cases out so that they can be heard and cleared at the earliest. We will try to ensure all cases are heard and cleared,” she said. Chakankar has also directed all establishments in the state with 10 or more employees to set up an internal complaints committee as per the guidelines of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, 2013. “Establishments that do not adhere to the law can face termination of the company licence,” she said. Speaking on the rising incidences of child marriage, especially in villages and rural areas, said accountability of the sarpanch and gram sevaks is important, and if they do not stop such child marriages, they will have to resign. A proposal has been forwarded to the government to include this recommendation under the Child Marriage Prevention Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/500-pending-cases-with-womens-panel-to-be-cleared-in-a-month/articleshow/87787977.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The searches were in connection with an exchange of fire which took place in 2019 in Tiriya village of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district between Maoists and security forces. The gun battle had resulted in the deaths of six insurgents and one civilian. The searches on Thursday were conducted at the residences of 15 persons who are suspected to have links with CPI-Maoists. The persons were allegedly involved with the outfit previously or are suspected to be over ground sympathisers of its activities. According to NIA officials, the searches were conducted in Uppal, LB Nagar, and Alwal’s Subhashnagar area in Telangana while similar operations were undertaken in Andhra Pradesh’s Prakasam, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, and Nellore districts. In Hyderabad, the searches were conducted against couple Ravi Sharma and Anuradha in LB Nagar who were previously arrested for being directly involved with the outfit, and Telangana Praja Front president K Ravi Chander. In Alwal, Amarula Banhumitrula Sangham member Bhavani’s residence was searched. Most of the persons whose residences were searched had been previously questioned by various security agencies in different cases. In AP, searches were conducted against Revolutionary Writers Association (RWA) member Kalyan Rao in Guntur, Annapoorna in Visakhapatnam and others. “An NIA official called me at 6.30 am today (Thursday) and informed me that they wanted to do search my locked house.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cops up vigil, peddlers jack ganja price to new high||HYDERABAD: Ever since chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed police to crack down on ganja trade and usage following the rape and murder of a minor in Saidabad, the price of the contraband has gone up manifold. For instance, in August, a sachet of 10 gram of ganja was available for Rs 200. Now, it costs Rs 500. Following increased vigilance on transportation of ganja and peddlers since September, peddlers too jacked up the price. While their buying price has increased only marginally, the peddlers reportedly are citing scarcity of ganja and the greater risk involved in selling it in the backdrop of heightened police enforcement as reasons for charging steep prices. Though police in all the three city commissionerates claim the supply of ganja has come down considerably, cops continue to come across instances of peddlers bringing huge quantity of ganja into Telangana. The stock is mostly sold to local users or is in transit to other states, especially Maharashtra and Haryana. “One doesn’t know how much ganja is slipping away from police radar and clandestinely reaching abusers from peddlers,” an investigator said. An ACP-rank officer from Old City confirmed that a ganja sachet of 10 gram now costs Rs 500. “Presently, price is being decided by desperation of the buyer and seller’s exploitation of the situation. In upscale areas, the price is much higher than Rs 500,” he said. After realising that the existing enforcement to nab peddlers was not sufficient, Hyderabad and Rachakonda police and prohibition & excise officials are taking the help of expert counsellors. “For persons who are arrested abusing ganja, we want to help them come out of the addiction and also stop them from relapsing. There is a provision in the NDPS Act which allows security agencies to give counselling to drug abusers if they are serious about de-addiction. Curtailing the supply through enforcement and reducing the demand by helping the victims to avoid abusing drugs through de-addiction is our strategy,’‘ Rachakonda commissioner of police Mahesh Bhagwat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-up-vigil-peddlers-jack-ganja-price-to-new-high/articleshow/87788290.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disha rape and murder case: Panel examines CCTV footage of crime scene||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court-appointed inquiry commission examined the CCTV footage of the Disha rape and murder case during oral arguments of investigating officer (IO) ACP V Surender’s advocate on Thursday. The commission also sought clarity on ‘arrest and re-arrest’ of the accused as mentioned in the case diary. The commission members checked the video footage at Thondupally toll plaza on November 27, 2019, to verify if it showed the accused carrying Disha to a secluded place adjacent to their parked truck next to the highway. The IO’s counsel Keerthi Kiran Kota played the CCTV footage of Disha crossing the road to get into a cab in the evening and later returning to the spot at night and going towards her parked scooter. Visuals of the accused riding Disha’s scooter along with their truck between Thondupally and Shadnagar and Md Arif with the truck next day were also shown. A YouTube video of Disha’s belongings near Thondupally toll plaza where she was assaulted were also played before the commission. After perusing the CCTV footage, the commission said that they could not see any visuals of the victim being carried by the accused in the clips shown. Earlier, while explaining the arrests, Kota said as per the IO’s orders the then Shadnagar SHO Sridhar Kumar apprehended the accused on November 29 afternoon from Jaklair and Gudigandla villages and affected their arrest before the IO at 5 pm at Shadnagar police station. The advocate cited arrest memo to substantiate his argument. But when the commission asked him to explain why the case diary mentions that the accused were arrested at around 1 pm and then re-arrested at 5 pm at Shadnagar, he clarified that they were picked up at around 1 pm. On being quizzed by the commission if the case diary mentioned that procedure was not followed because of law and order issue, the advocate replied in the negative.

During arguments by advocate for the three handlers, the commission ascertained that unlike other police witnesses, the three never said that ACP ordered firing in the direction of the sound or claimed being threatened by NHRC during recording of statements. Appearing for SI Sk Lal Madhar, SI K Ravi and head constable Md Sirajuddin, who had fired during the alleged encounter on December 6, 2019, advocate Sk Mastan Vali told the commission: “As per IPC Sections 76 and 79, the acts of my clients do not amount to an offence. My clients were discharging public duty as per the orders of their superior officer.” Mastan Vali said they were ordered to fire by the ACP after the accused continued to fire at them despite warnings shots in the air. During arguments of advocate T Bala Mohan Reddy appearing for handlers D Janakiram, Balu Rathod and D Srikanth, the commission queried if his clients had also stated being threatened by the NHRC team when their statements were recorded after the alleged encounter. The advocate said that they had not mentioned about threats from NHRC because no question was asked about it. Then, with advocate Reddy’s assistance the commission went through the deposition of ACP V Surender who had stated that NHRC team had threatened him and commented, “He himself said and we pursued it because it is a serious issue. But he did not lodge any complaint about it.” Advocate Reddy then pointed to the commission that NHRC team member Arun Tyagi had voluntarily mentioned during his deposition that he drew the sketch of the encounter site, while NHRC officials had admitted examining ACP V Surender beyond midnight to record his statement, which was a violation of human rights. “The statements recorded by NHRC can’t be given any importance,” the advocate argued.

The heart was being transported from the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) hospital in Punjagutta to AIG Hospital in Gachibowli, a usually busy stretch prone to traffic blocks. The donor was a 31-year-old brain dead patient, Nakirakanti Shekhar, who hailed from Nadimpally village in Mahabubnagar. The recipient of the heart was a 45-year-old from the city. Shekhar had been injured in a hit-and-run accident near Achampet in Mahabubnagar on November 13 while he was on his way home after work. He was rushed to the local government hospital first and later shifted to NIMS. “He was in the intensive care unit for four days. His condition deteriorated and was declared brain dead on the night of November 18. Jeevandan appreciates the donor family members for their noble act,” said Dr G Swarnalatha, head of state-run Jeevandan organisation. Dr Swarnalatha said that a Jeevandan coordinator had provided grief counselling to the family and also explained the importance of organ donation. Following the counselling, Shekhar’s brother and sister consented to donate his organs under Jeevandan programme for patients who may be in need. Apart from the heart, seven other organs were retrieved from Shekhar. These organs were sent to the Osmania General Hospital (liver and a kidney), another kidney was kept in NIMS for a transplant, two lungs were sent to KIMS hospital and two corneas given to the Sarojini Devi Eye bank.

Lawyers and judicial staff rescued the ADJ and held the two police officers hostage. Krishna is the station house officer of Ghoghardiha police station in Madhubani, while Sharma is his subordinate. The ADJ had ordered special training for Madhubani SP and SDPO earlier this year for their “poor knowledge” while denying bail in a case which he had termed as rape case but police had not filed chargesheet invoking POCSO Act. Patna high court had seized his judicial powers on September 24 for his “unusual” judgments. At the time of filing of report, the SIs were still kept confined in a room inside the court premises by lawyers. Senior authorities, including Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar, were at the spot to pacify the lawyers. “There was a complaint against the SHO after which ADJ’s steno had rang him asking to come to the judge’s office. Heated arguments took place between both sides after which physical assault took place,” said Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar. Patna high court Chief Justice Sanjay Karol took suo moto cognizance of the incident and formed a special division bench to hear the matter. Late in the night, state police ADG (headquarters) J S Gangwar had to physically appear before the bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah which heard the matter and described the incident as an attempt to “jeopardise the independence of judiciary”. “The DGP is directed to remain present in the court on the next date of hearing on November 29. He should file a status report in a sealed cover,” the bench observed. Meanwhile, Darbhanga range IG told TOI over phone that the ADJ has lodged an FIR against both SIs for assaulting him physically and with their weapons.

---||Kolkata||CM’s Kona E-way decongest prod after investors’ appeal||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the chief secretary to work out a plan to manage traffic on Kona Expressway better after investors in Howrah urged the authorities to decongest the road, which gets clogged after evening due to trucks parked on the side. “I understand the problem. Truck drivers park their vehicles along Kona Expressway as the Kolkata Police doesn’t allow entry of heavy vehicles into the city before 9pm. But that creates jams and commuters headed for Kolkata are often stuck there. The jam continues for four to five hours,” the CM said at the Howrah administrative meeting on Thursday. The CM asked chief secretary H K Dwivedi and home secretary B S Gopalika to work out a de-congestion plan. “We have to find an alternative route to disperse the traffic via Nivedita Setu or some other bridge where the traffic load is low,” Banerjee said. Complaints of traffic jams on NH2 reached the state headquarters at Nabanna ahead of the Howrah meeting. Ambulance operators complained about being stuck in snarls while ferrying critical patients to city hospitals. The CM said in the meeting that efforts were on to create dedicated lanes for ambulances and motorists. Banerjee also pointed out travel on the opposite direction—from the bridge towards Howrah—via Kona Expressway in the morning was a trouble due to congestion at the Santragachhi rail overbridge. The Chandernagore Police Commissionerate roped in the Hooghly rural police to handle the traffic often diverted through Dankuni, instead of being allowed straight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cms-kona-e-way-decongest-prod-after-investors-appeal/articleshow/87788032.cms||---

Laxman Savalkar, a 60-year-old Covid patient, died at a private hospital early on Wednesday morning. He was on ventilator. “His death was not due to the burns.

---||Lucknow||Obesity increases threat of Covid severity, death: Docs||Lucknow: Individuals with Covid-19 and obesity have an increased risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death, said experts in an educational and awareness programme organised at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) on Thursday. They said that obesity weakens the immune system, making the individual susceptible to infectious diseases. Besides, they said, often obese patients also suffer from coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthama that make them vulnerable to Covid severity. Head of gastrosurgery department at RMLIMS, Prof Anshuman Pandey said, “About 35 obese patients, who had gone through bariatric surgery (surgery to modify the stomach and intestines to treat obesity and related diseases) at RMLIMS in last two years, beat Covid-19 better than others with the same problem during the second wave. The main reason behind this was that comorbid conditions such as diabetes, respiratory disease, blood pressure, thyroid and arthritis had improved after surgery.” HOD anaesthesia, Dr Deepak Malviya highlighted the different problems faced by obese patients who had to be admitted on ventilator. HOD cardiology, Dr Bhuvan Tiwari put forth the ill effects of Covid-19 on the heart of obese patients. He said, “Obesity is a modifiable risk factor of Covid-19 and our public health bodies goal should be to achieve a healthy weight at the population level that might reduce adverse outcomes in near future.” Meanwhile, doctors interacted with the participants including those who underwent Covid treatment. The participants who also suffered with comorbidities explained how they fought with the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/obesity-increases-threat-of-covid-severity-death-docs/articleshow/87788667.cms||---

The ACB caught lawyer Bhaatkumar Bhagwatiprasad Yadav (35) a resident of Abrama in Valsad, red-handed accepting cash from the owner of a wine shop outside the mamlatdar (revenue) office in Valsad town. ACB has registered a case against Yadav and Valsad city woman police sub-inspector Y J Patel under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to ACB, Patel had demanded Rs 1.5 lakh from the wine shop owner for not arresting his son who is booked in a prohibition case lodged in Valsad town police station. The shop owner alerted the ACB that laid a trap and caught Yadav red-handed. As per the case details, Patel was investigating a prohibition case at Valsad city police station last year. This is when the name of the wine shop owner in Silvassa city of union territory Dadra and Nagar Haveli cropped up. The owner got anticipatory bail from the court. But PSI Patel allegedly started threatening the wine shop owner and demanded Rs 1.5 lakh from him for not pursuing the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lawyer-held-for-taking-rs-1-5l-as-bribe-on-behalf-of-woman-cop/articleshow/87787298.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t know what you have in mind, SC tells Param Bir||New Delhi: The Supreme Court bench observed on Thursday that it was getting an impression that Param Bir Singh was sitting abroad and would come to India after getting a favourable order from the court. The bench again pointed out lack of confidence shown by the top IPS officer in the system and made it clear that he will not be treated differently. “You are seeking protective orders; nobody knows where you are. Suppose you are sitting abroad and taking legal recourse through power of attorney then what happens. If that is so then you will come to India if the court rules in your favour, we don't know what you have in mind. No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the bench said. A magistrate court on Wednesday declared Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city. Singh had last attended his office in May this year, after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay high court last month that his whereabouts were not known. The police action had followed his sensational charge that Deshmukh had asked for collection of Rs 100 crore as bribes. Bimal Agrawal, a real estate developer, had alleged the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on two bars and restaurants which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them. The incidents are said to have occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed. Following his complaint, a case was filed under IPC sections 384 and 385 (both about extortion) and 34 (common intention) against six accused. Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too. Singh was shunted from the post of Mumbai police chief in March after Waze was arrested in the case of explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-know-what-you-have-in-mind-sc-tells-param-bir/articleshow/87788690.cms||---

Builders will now have to repair the damaged portions before they are granted a completion certificate for the projects. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee came up with the idea at the Howrah administrative meeting held at Sarat Sadan on Thursday. “I am not against developers. But they often dump construction materials on pavements or stock materials on a portion of the road. It damages the roads. I would ask officials to conduct an on-site survey and see that the developer undertakes road repairs before issuing the completion certificate for the building,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/to-get-cc-builders-must-repair-roads/articleshow/87788048.cms||Rupak Banerjee

---||Delhi||Target 2025: Infusing life back into Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Determined to clean the Yamuna before February 2025, Delhi government has started work on a war-footing to ensure that the river gets its life back. Various measures being taken up include enhancing the sewage treatment capacity, monitoring creation and treatment of industrial waste and ensuring processing of domestic sewage before the treated water flows in the Yamuna.  Four new sewage treatment plants are being built — Okhla facility with a capacity of 124 million gallons a day, Coronation Pillar site 70MGD, Rithala 40MGDs and Kondli plant, 45MGDs. The existing 19 STPs are being upgraded to boost their treating capacity.  The government is also going for in-situ treating of sewage in the Najafgarh drain, Supplementary drain, Barapullah drain and Shahdara drain. “The running water is being cleaned inside the drain itself instead of in an STP,” explained a government official. TimesViewIt is good news that the Delhi government is embarking on a time-bound plan to clean the polluted Yamuna. But the truth is that a lot of money has been spent in the past to that end without much success. It is essential, therefore, that the plan must be carefully and regularly monitored on a quarterly basis to ensure its efficacy.Waste generation in 33 industrial clusters is under watch. “In 17 industrial clusters, wastewater flows to 13 common effluent treatment plant. Wastewater from locations not linked with a treatment plan will be tapped in the sewer line and sent for cleaning,” the official said.  The government has directed the industries department to act against units that do not channel their waste through a pipeline going to a treatment plant. “If they do not put the wastewater in treatment plant drains, the units will be shut down,” warned the government. Industrial units that discharge water into the sewers without treatment will also be closed down. There are many manufacturers, such as of plastic pellets, that dump waste into sewer lines. Improper disposal of waste in this manner will also attract strict punishment, the government stated.  The community toilet complexes in JJ clusters across the capital are connected to stormwater drains and not to the sewage network. All wastewater in such clusters flows into the the stormwater drains too. On Thursday, Delhi government stated, “It has been decided that even the smallest drain coming out of JJ clusters will be connected to the nearby sewer line so that wastewater can be treated at the STP. The target is to get sewer lines for 1,799 unauthorised colonies in Delhi by 2024.”  The plan also wants to prevent household toilet waste from going into sewage drains. “East Delhi now has provision for connecting all households to a sewage network. Yet, there are many small and big waste-carrying drains, whose contents are dumped into the stormwater drains. After this, that water then flows into the Yamuna through the bigger drains,” noted the government statement. This filthy water flows down the big drains spreading a foul smell across large areas, creating a breeding ground for flies and mosquitoes and contaminating the groundwater before eventually polluting the Yamuna.  Delhi has a sewer network that is 9,225km long, and Delhi has started the process to unclog all of them. “Wastewater from households contains silt which continually builds up inside the sewer line,” said a government official. “If the pipeline gets choked anywhere along its length, the dirty water flowing in it is blocked and overflows onto the roads and again eventually reaches the river through the stormwater and drains.  The target before the government in the next six months is to clear the sewer lines of accumulated silt. “Any area in which the sewer line is found to be clogged from 10% to 50% will be cleaned and desilted. After this, the wastewater is more likely to reach the STPs for treatment,” the government stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/target-2025-infusing-life-back-into-yamuna/articleshow/87788089.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Surat||Passenger footfall, flight numbers take off in Surat||Surat: The Diamond City flyers, after being forced to keep low due to the pandemic, are flying high and importantly, frequently again. In October, the Surat airport witnessed a footfall of 87,008 passengers compared to just 1,616 recorded in May 2020. With the increase in number of passengers, the flight traffic at Surat airport too is getting busier by the day. Just a week back, Go First’s inaugural flight on the Delhi-Surat route got the traditional water cannon salute at the Surat airport. After the Covid enforced lull, the start of the year saw flight activities picking up in Surat. In February 2021, Surat airport saw a footfall of 96,949 passengers, while last month it was 87,008. With no major disruption in sight, experts feel that the passenger numbers are likely to go as high as 1.5 lakh this month. Working for better connectivity, increased flights and better amenities for passengers is a group that goes by the name of ‘we work for working airport at surat’. The group has a big presence on social media with its Facebook page boasting of close to 92,000 members. The group has regular interactions not only with the officials of the Surat airport but also that of different airlines. Sanjay Jain, a businessman dealing in construction material, is an active member of the group. “We started this group in 2011 to get proper flight facilities from Surat. Due to our efforts now major airlines including Air India, Air India Express, Indigo, Spice Jet, Go First, Star Air and Ventura are operating flights from Surat airport for domestic flyers while Air India Express is operating the Surat-Sharjah flight,” Jain said. Jain said that Surat has now got flight connectivity with major cities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Coimbatore and Indore. He is confident that the footfall at Surat Airport will reach 1.5 lakh passengers this month. Aman Saini, airport director, Surat too said the number of flyers are increasing after the second wave of Covid-19. On November 14, a total of 42 flights (21 arrivals and 21 departures) — carrying 5,369 passengers — operated from Surat airport, Saini informed. “We are working to increase air traffic at the airport,” Saini added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/passenger-footfall-flight-numbers-take-off-in-surat/articleshow/87787309.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Majithia’s petition in multi-crore drug case bid to delay matter: AAP||Chandigarh: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has attacked Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia over his application to become party in the multi-crore drug racket case in the Punjab and Haryana high court, calling it an “attempt to delay the matter beyond the 2022 state assembly polls”. AAP state president Bhagwant Mann on Thursday alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government and Majithia were helping each other in deceiving Punjab and its people by adopting new tactics to delay the matter. He alleged that the Congress government had been making efforts to save the drug mafia and their political masters by not making the special task force (STF) report public, under the guise of its being sealed. He said in the 124-page petition, just a few days before the state assembly elections, Majithia’s demand to make himself a party in the case was just a conspiracy. The Sangrur MP also said the sealed report was just an excuse and if the government wanted, action could still be taken against drug smugglers. He said that chief minister Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa should tell whether the court had stayed the action against the drug smugglers. He argued that the state government and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) could take further investigation and decisive action against drug smugglers, bureaucrats and political leaders because the court had not restrained them from taking action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/majithias-petition-in-multi-crore-drug-case-bid-to-delay-matter-aap/articleshow/87788687.cms||---

This despite the fact that the Nainital HC has been issuing orders regarding the community’s resettlement. The HC on Wednesday reprimanded the state for not effectively executing the works of forming a committee as directed in August 2020 and asked it to form an all new committee, including DMs of respective districts, and once again restart the entire rehabilitation work. The court was unsatisfied by the representation of the state government and ordered principal secretary social welfare department, principal chief conservator, forests (wildlife), and DMs of Dehradun, Haridwar, Uttarkashi, Pauri, Tehri, Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital to be present in-person before the court on November 24. Panic has gripped Van Gujjars as uncertainty hovers over their future because the landscapes on which they live for six months and then migrate to higher altitude during summer are gradually being encroached upon for construction works, they claimed. Speaking with TOI, a Van Gujjar from Shivpuri in Rishikesh, Gaami Gujjar, 42, said, “At Shivpuri, around 200 families are being asked by forest department to leave as our permit has expired.

The deceased ran a business at Narsan in Haridwar,” Ishtwaal said. He added that Aakash was lucky that his cries for help reached the staff of a nearby hotel on the highway, who then informed police. “It is his good fortune that the water level of the river did not rise and submerge the rock to which he was clinging.” An SDRF personnel said that Aakash was in a state of shock and trauma when he was rescued. “He has been admitted to a health facility in Srinagar and is currently under observation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-clings-to-rock-for-2-hours-after-car-plunges-into-river-near-badrinath-rescued-later-cousin-dies/articleshow/87786544.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||Two days after a leopard killed a five-year-old girl in Nainital, another four-year-old taken away by big cat in Rudraprayag||Dehradun/Nainital: With the onset of the winter season, human-leopard conflict incidents have again started surfacing in Uttarakhand. In the last 48 hours, the hill state recorded two cases where minor girls were attacked by big cats. In the most recent incident that took place in Rudraprayag, a four-year-old was attacked by a leopard while she was playing in the backyard of her house on Wednesday evening. “The girl suffered minor injuries on her forehead but is stated to be out of danger. She is recuperating. We have sought permission to trap and relocate the leopard to some other area. Meanwhile, villagers have been alerted to stay away from the forest area,” said Vaibhav Singh, DFO, Rudraprayag. He added, “The leopard probably ventured into the house for their pet dog but the young girl must have come in its way.” In an earlier incident, a five-year-old was mauled to death by a big cat in Jeolikote, Nainital. The incident took place on Tuesday (November 16), a day before the girl's fifth birthday. Following the incident, the forest department installed cages in the area and declared the leopard a ‘man-eater’. The exercise bore result as an adult female big cat on Thursday morning walked into the cage set up by the forest department in Jeolikote, a town around 15 km from Nainital. However, forest officials are unsure whether the captured feline is the man-eater. DFO Biju Lal TR told TOI, “We will conduct the DNA and pregnancy test of the leopard. As of now, we cannot ascertain if this is the same leopard that was involved in the killing of the minor girl.” He also said that a compensation of Rs 3 lakh has already been given to the bereaved family and the remaining Rs 1 lakh will be paid soon. “The trapped big cat is being given medical attention as she has an injury on her paws. Meanwhile, we have increased patrolling in the area to prevent more such incidents,” the DFO added. According to wildlife experts, the incidents of leopards entering human habitations for easy prey increase in winters when they struggle to find food and water in forests. Consequently, sightings of leopards have become a routine affair in Rishikesh, Pithoragarh, Almora, Haridwar and Nainital districts. A range officer from the Garhwal region, requesting anonymity, told TOI that defragmentation of forests is also pushing these wild animals to venture into human habitations. This year, about one-and-a-half dozen people have already lost their lives to leopard attacks in Uttarakhand.

Babies born before 37-week gestation, at least three weeks earlier than the expected date of delivery, are termed premature babies. “More than three-quarters of premature babies can be saved with feasible and cost-effective care. Care of the newborns, delivered preterm, includes essential newborn care for all babies, including thermal care, breastfeeding, infection prevention and neonatal resuscitation,” said Dr Aparna C, clinical director, neonatology and senior consultant neonatalology and paediatrics, KIMS Cuddles. Though there might be no obvious cause for premature birth, often there are common risk factors. “Some risk factors include having a previous premature birth and being pregnant with multiples. Complications associated with premature birth include immature lungs, difficulty regulating body temperature, poor feeding and slow weight gain,” said Dr M Niharika, consultant fertility specialist, Kamineni Fertility Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/interventions-and-care-key-to-save-preterm-babies-experts/articleshow/87788066.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: For 1 bottle of liquor, 70% of what you pay is tax||HYDERABAD: While diesel and petrol have a significant VAT component as part of the price, liquor prices have climbed four times since the state formation, resulting in a substantial amount of taxes on each bottle. According to an estimate, 70% of the price of a liquor bottle is tax, which is paid to the state. For the same reason, the state government earned Rs 54,000 crore in the last two years of the liquor policy, which is about to be completed. For example, the manufacturing cost of 650 ml beer is approximately Rs 22, but it is sold to consumers for Rs 140. The state government receives the lion’s share of the Rs 99, with the remainder going to the retailers as a margin. “The prices of inexpensive booze include 80 % taxes, while branded liquor includes 70% taxes, as a result, there is a gap of at least Rs 40 to Rs 50 when compared to the pricing of liquor in neighbouring Karnataka,” sources added. The state government got Rs 54, 583 crore in revenue from liquor sales in the previous policy’s two years, along with Rs 38, 200 crore in tax revenue, and another Rs 3,000 crore in application and licence fees. Since the state formation in 2014, taxes have been raised four times. Rates were raised by 8% in 2015, 10% in 2017, and 20% in December of 2019, with the state government imposing a Covid- 19 cess of 22%.

Governor Anandiben Patel called on Mayawati at her residence on Thursday and offered her condolences on her mother’s demise. “I returned to Lucknow on Wednesday night after the last rites of my mother in Delhi. On Thursday, Governor Anandiben Patel visited my residence to express condolences on my mother’s death,” Mayawati said. Later in the day, the former UP chief minister held meetings with party workers and assessed the preparations on the ground for the 2022 polls. She met the representatives of four west UP divisions and reviewed booth-level preparations and cadre meetings being held in every block and directed them to immediately address the loopholes and problems reported from there. A senior party worker said meetings have begun to finalise Mayawati’s campaign schedule and dates of her rallies are expected to be announced soon. The party is on the verge of finalising all candidates, and rallies are likely to start immediately after announcement of candidates. In a tweet, Mayawati said she took stock of the election commission’s drive of revision in voters’ list. “I gave directions to party workers to track the changes most carefully and ensure that all eligible names are there in the list and these are as accurate as possible,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-returns-after-mothers-last-rites-goes-into-poll-mode/articleshow/87788705.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Monkey menace forces ryots to stay away from other crops||Hyderabad: Paddy farmers in Pochampally are not averse to the idea of growing alternate crops as asked by the government, but what about the monkeys? Farmers said they can’t go for alternate crops such as pulses or vegetables as monkeys would destroy them. Hundreds of monkeys ravage any crop that is grown in Poachampally with calls to the forest department and local authorities falling on deaf ears. “If not paddy, what else should I cultivate? Monkeys are going to destroy everything and I am going to be left with nothing in the end,” Bikshapathi C, a 75-year-old farmer told TOI. He said protecting paddy for the monkeys itself is a herculean task and added that vegetables, corn, or pulses would not survive the monkey menace. “The monkeys will eat a part of the vegetable and will throw the rest,” he added. Many farmers said that they are yet to cultivate the land this time. Almost all farmers in Pochampally village that TOI met at the market said they would rather grow think it is better to not grow anything at all instead of opting for alternate crops. They said that the water too is not suitable to grow vegetables or pulses as it comes from the Musi river. “Using them for growing vegetables can be hazardous,” said Ram Goud, another farmer. With the state not yet procuring paddy from them, the farmers said that they don’t have the required capital to cultivate now. “I have decided not to cultivate my two-and-half acres of land this time. Growing anything else will not be feasible. Instead, I will start selling vegetables in the market. I will at least earn Rs 150 to Rs 200 every day,” said Lakshmi G, a farmer, who lost her husband five months back. The farmers said that it would cost them about Rs 20, 000 to cultivate an acre of land. Another farmer Lalitha G, who has 2 acres of land and has taken another five on rent, said that there is water on land 24*7. “If we try to grow vegetables, they get spoiled because of the presence of water throughout the day and night. This land is only suitable for paddy,” she added. An official from the agriculture department said that monkey menace is not just limited to Pochampally and that farmers should take extra care to produce alternate crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monkey-menace-forces-ryots-to-stay-away-from-other-crops/articleshow/87788081.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad professor opens new chapter on world of flexible electronics||HYDERABAD: A professor from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has written a textbook on flexible electronics, which he claims to be the first such book in the world. While one can find edited books or collated book chapters on specific topics of ‘flexible electronics’ written by different research groups or individuals, Aftab Hussain, principal investigator of the PATrIoT (Processes Architecture and Technologies Research in IoT) lab at IIIT-H, discovered a void in electronics literature with the lack books documenting it from start to finish, when he kick-started a course on flexible electronics at IIIT-H in 2018. “Book chapter collections are a good compilation of the current state-of-the-art in a specific area and are definitely very valuable but they are not a substitute for textbooks,” he said. Having to design and structure a course from scratch based on all his years of training and research in the area, Hussain realised that an old-fashioned textbook could be written following the same structure. His dedicated efforts over 2 years have now resulted in a 19-chapter first look at the world of flexible electronics. Divided into five parts, the textbook titled ‘Introduction to Flexible Electronics’ covers topics from a simple introduction to why things are flexible to the materials and their properties that make up all electronic devices. The final chapter also provides a sneak-peek into another emerging world of stretchable electronics. With the primary target audience being senior undergraduates or graduates in electrical engineering, electronics, material sciences, chemistry and communication engineering, the professor’s textbook aims to be an easy read. “This style is by design because the other edited book chapters are very technical and detailed, making them a heavy read. It is nice of course to read such detailed research if you are a PhD student but as an introduction to the field or as a course reference, there was nothing out there so that’s why I kept it extremely simple,” said Hussain, adding that it has been specifically designed to help educators in developing a course in flexible electronics. “My wish is that a lot of faculty in India and abroad use this book to structure their curriculum around it and use the exercises in it to set semester-end exam papers so that their students can refer to it as a textbook,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-professor-opens-new-chapter-on-world-of-flexible-electronics/articleshow/87788083.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Villagers take cue from ODF, dispose of plastic waste||LUCKNOW: The Open Defecation Free (ODF) scheme has gone beyond making villages free of open defecation and now its extensions even motivate villagers to manage their plastic waste. After construction of toilets in every household under Swachh Bharat Mission to make villages ODF, a new component — Plastic Waste Management (PWM) — under ODF plus scheme of Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G), is being implemented in Uttar Pradesh since plastic waste and polythene are a menace in villages too. It has been a month and a half since the villages chosen under the first phase of ODF + scheme are getting their plastic waste collected at a point from where it is sent for recycling and reuse. About 38 villages in Hardoi are implementing PWM. State IEC consultant, SBM-G, panchayati raj department (PRD), Sanjay Singh Chauhan said, “The department has appointed Swachhta Sainiks who collect plastic from households and dump it in the plastic bank, which consists of an iron mesh within which the waste is stored.” The department has made a provision of Rs 16 lakh to set up a collection centre in every block to store the plastic waste from where it is dispatched to recycling units. One-fifth of the villages will be covered in the first year of the ODF+ scheme for PWM and other components. The ODF scheme launched in 2014 to construct toilets in every household concluded in 2019, after which Centre launched ODF+ and ODF++ having more components including solid waste management (SWM) and liquid waste management (LWM). ODF+ villages make toilets sustainable by constantly monitoring their maintenance, use and covering the new emerging families under the scheme. ODF++ villages also ensure safe collection, conveyance, treatment, disposal of faecal sludge and sewage besides proper maintenance of toilets. “We also inform villagers about the hazards of plastic, its proper disposal and motivate them by telling its benefits,” said Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/villagers-take-cue-from-odf-dispose-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/87788723.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Delhi||Clean Yamuna: Not lacking for effort, Delhi has spent over Rs 1,500 crore, but cleanup battle is far from won||NEW DELHI: An analysis done by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says Delhi has already spent over Rs 1,500 crore on cleaning the Yamuna, excluding the cost of the common effluent treatment plants built in the city. CSE says this is possibly the highest amount spent on river cleaning in the country, but it has not worked as is evident from pollution data. CSE had analysed the data received from Yamuna Action Plan (YAP), which was launched to reduce the pollution load in the river with the first phase being started in 1993. In 2005, the Rs 380-crore YAP-II was sanctioned for Delhi. About 50% of this was to be used to rehabilitate 30.2km of defunct sewers by 2008. In 2006-07, Delhi Jal Board introduced its interceptor plan to lay over 60km of sewers along Najafgarh, supplementary and Shahdara drains. “This massive hardware programme, however, has not proved effective in terms of controlling pollution. An analysis of biological oxygen demand (BOD) indicates that nothing has changed in terms of pollution load in the river,” said the CSE analysis, which added that BOD load had gone up from about 129 tonnes per day in 1982-83 to over 261 tonnes per day in 2019. Explaining the issue of pollution in Yamuna, CSE said, “Delhi has already built 17 sewage treatment plants (STP), which together add up to 40% of the total installed sewage treatment capacity in India. But these plants remain grossly underutilised. The city does not have the drainage to convey all its excreta to the treatment plants. The untreated sewage from unauthorised colonies, which are unconnected to drainage, flows into open drains crisscrossing the city. But these are the same drains, flowing past colonies, in which the STPs dispose of their treated effluent. Hence, the illegal unconnected waste of the majority is being mixed with treated waste of the minority.” The report said the Yamuna could be cleaned when all sewage in the city was treated. It would require providing drainage to all colonies and sewage treatment for all. As Yamuna’s water quality could improve if there was more water for dilution of waste, CSE said, “Delhi can demand more water from Haryana, but this will be difficult. The second option is that Delhi can begin to reduce its own water demand and build harvesting for capturing rainwater for discharge in the lean season, so that it can allow water to flow in the river.” Sushmita Sengupta, senior programme manager, water and sanitation programme, CSE, said, “The treated effluent should not be put back into the same open drain that carries the untreated waste of the majority. We spend huge money first pumping sewage long distances for treatment and then waste this effort by dumping the cleaned water in unclean drains.” Among other measures suggested by CSE included treating sewage directly in open drains, building STPs close to the river banks to treat whatever waste remained in the drains and recycling and reusing treated waste to reduce the cost of pumping. The report also suggested treating all sewage by intercepting from open drains, not by building interceptors on existing drains and pumping waste to existing STPs. Yamuna conservationists said the river’s water quality had not seen much change. Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said, “Over the years, the Yamuna has gone from bad to worse. The only improvement seen in the Yamuna was in April 2020 due to the lockdown when industrial pollution was zero and there was good flow in the river. Yamuna then spoke what it actually required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-lacking-for-effort-delhi-has-spent-over-rs-1500cr-but-cleanup-battle-is-far-from-won/articleshow/87788098.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Scores of them, travel agencies say, have started queuing up to book themselves a place at the Qatar 2022 football world cup — scheduled to kick off on November 21, next year. “At the moment, counters have opened only for corporate bookings. They are most expensive and can go up to US $10,000 to US $15,000 (between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 11 lakh approx). But there are takers even for these packages,” said Suresh Kumar who is curating a trip for a gang of footfall enthusiasts from the city for 2022. According to him, the hot picks this season are the desert and cruise packages that will give visitors a chance to either stay in tents (in the desert) or luxury rooms on the cruise, after watching their favourite teams face off on the field. “There is a significant population from Hyderabad that goes for every football world cup. During the last one in Russia too, we had booked a huge group of 20 to 25 people. And most of them had opted for matches in the semi-final stages, with some staying back till the finals,” Kumar said, adding how the high cost of the experience is rarely a deterrent. Indranil Chowdhuri whose travel consultancy, Travel with Neel, is also set to take a team of people from Hyderabad, and other cities of India, to Qatar next November-December. “There is great demand this time also because people realise that this is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity for them to watch a football world cup at a venue that is so close to home. Right from the league matches right up to the semis and finals — it starts from $100 and $300 or more per match — there’s sure to be a rush for every game,” said Chowdhuri who himself has attended three FIFA tournaments so far. He has four confirmed travellers on board and is certain that the numbers will go up over the next few months. Also in talks with his agent is Mithilesh G, a businessman from Hyderabad who is hoping to have a ‘boys’ week out’ with his friends in Qatar. “Much like Russia, this time too we have decided to go during the semi-finals and come back after the final game. This is a ritual with us friends — about seven or eight of them — and we go irrespective of which team makes it how far,” the Brazil fan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-destination-qatar-for-hyderabadis-in-2022/articleshow/87788085.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The police are now investigating about the funding channel and also if the money was also used for anti-national activities. The entire racket got exposed after a converted man returned to his own faith and also filed a complaint about mass conversion of 100 people of 37 families of Kankaria village of Bharuch. Aamod police registered an offence and arrested four accused, namely Abdul Aziz Patel aka Ajit Chaganbhai Vasava, Yusuf Jivanbhai Patel aka Mahendra Jivanbhai Vasava, Ayub Barkatbhai Patel aka Raman Barkatbhai Vasava, and Ibrahim Punabhai Patel aka Jitu Punabhai Vasava. All the accused are residents of Kankaria village. The local court granted police five days custody of the accused for questioning. According to the cops, the four accused are small fries in the racket while the big fish are the smokescreen. Cops are now trying to identify other suspects who may have helped the racketeers directly or indirectly, said an official.

The daily routine of farmers now includes paying a visit to the ground where their paddy heaps are waiting to be weighed and see if there is any official who could answer when would the government procures paddy. They said that due to rains the crop is getting damaged and they are incurring additional expenses to store paddy for a longer duration. “I am among the first few to bring my paddy here. Every day, I come here and see if any official came here to weigh my produce. The crop is getting damaged, we can see small saplings growing in the paddy because of rains,” said a 66-year-old farmer, who is waiting for the government to procure paddy grown in his 4 acres of land. According to farmers in Pochampally, only in this market, there are 370 heaps of paddy waiting to be weighed and procured. “Every year, as soon as 50 to 60 farmers shift their produce to the market, the officials used to come and start weighing.

---||Lucknow||Nadda election blitz from Yogi backyard||Lucknow: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah setting the tone for BJP’s election campaign in the build-up to forthcoming state elections from the politically crucial east UP region, it’s the turn of BJP national president J P Nadda to set party’s gargantuan poll machine rolling in Purvanchal from the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath — Gorakhpur. The BJP boss is scheduled to reach Gorakhpur on November 22 to hold a meeting with booth-level presidents from 10 districts of east UP, including Mau, Azamgarh, Ballia, Deoria, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, Basti and Siddharthnagar. Sources said, around 27,000 booth-level functionaries, assembly seat conveners and divisional in-charges have been asked to attend the crucial meeting, which could potentially lay a formal template of BJP’s electoral campaign to take on political rivals. All top BJP organisational leaders, including party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh, UP election in charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, CM Yogi, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal are expected to attend the meeting. BJP’s Gorakhpur president Yudhistir Singh Saithwar told TOI the party chief is expected to hold a review of booth-level activity undertaken in past few months. “The attestation of booth-level committees that forms the basic unit of the party’s organisational is likely to be assessed by the party chief. He will give further directions before the party scales up its grassroots electoral spade work,” a senior BJP leader said. Nadda reaching Gorakhpur, the political nerve centre of Purvanchal, attains significance even as the Opposition, mainly the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party flexes muscle to take on the saffron outfit, especially in the east UP region. BJP also faces the fractious ally turned rival, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has allied “unconditionally” with the SP to sabotage BJP’s bid to return to power. Ostensibly concentrated in the east UP region, the Rajbhar community is being wooed by both BJP and SP as part of their electoral calculations. BJP sources said, the party plans to set out on a strategic note from east UP before launching a full-fledged campaign across the state. This will include organising ‘yatras’ in different organisational regions in coming days. BJP’s deft attempt to consolidate its position in east UP comes in the backdrop of the party’s worries in the restive west UP region, which remained affected by the farmer stir against the three new farm laws of the Centre. The Lakhimpur violence, which saw the killing of eight persons including four farmers, has only added to the worries of the BJP. Sources said the party was in no mood to relent and sought to chart out an adept strategy to take on the opposition which has been harping on a potential anti-incumbency against the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-election-blitz-from-yogi-backyard/articleshow/87788740.cms||Pankaj Shah

They’re offering Rythu Bandhu on hand, while taking away all other incentives from the farmers,” Rajender said. He went on to claim that the CM tried to avoid responsibility for his failure by blaming the Centre. Taking a dig at CM, he said: “Sometimes he says don’t cultivate paddy, other times he says go for very fine rice,” the former TRS health minister, who parted after a bitter fight said. Huzurabad legislator also said that CM had said in assembly that the Telangana government buys paddy more promptly than any other state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-row-to-hidehuzurabad-loss-eatala/articleshow/87788095.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Chandigarh||Despite hefty fines and close to 100 FIRs, crop burning cases rising across Haryana||Karnal: Despite imposition of over Rs 50 lakh fine and registration of around 100 FIRs against violators, paddy stubble burning cases continue to soar across the state of Haryana. On Wednesday, 101 fresh cases were detected by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (Harsac). With this, the total number of stubble burning cases (active fire locations) in the state has reached 6,094 since September 15. However, the number of stubble-burning cases is lower than the last year’s figure during the corresponding period. According to data provided by the agriculture department, Fatehabad has reported the maximum number of 1,299 cases so far, followed by Kaithal (1137), Karnal (935), Jind (757), Kurukshetra (535), Sirsa (349), Ambala (297), Panipat (192), Yamunanagar (144), Sonipat (153), Hisar (138) and Palwal (113). However, no farm fire cases have been reported from Charkhi Dadri, Gurugram, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Sirsa, Panchkula, and Rewari district so far. As per Haryana agriculture department, till November 14, it has recovered Rs 49.37 lakh fine from 2379 erring farmers and got 94 FIRs registered in the state. On the other hand, the air quality of 19 cities and towns in Haryana remained worse on Thursday. According to the Central Pollution Control Bureau (CPCB), the AQI level in 10 cities — Hisar (365), Rohtak (351), Faridabad 349, Bahadurgarh (341), Panipat (340), Manesar (330), Gurugram (323), Jind (310), Narnaul (305), Fatehabad (303)— was in ‘very poor’ category. Similarly, Karnal (294), Bhiwani (292), Yamunanagar (292) Ambala (288), Dharuhera (282), Kurukshetra (275), Ballabgarh (260), Kaithal (260), Sirsa (256), which falls in the “poor” category. Govt issues appeal The Haryana government has appealed to the farmers of the state to refrain from stubble burning as it leads to pollution, thereby increasing the risk of respiratory diseases and cancer. Not only this, the biological quality of the soil is also affected by it. Sharing information in this regard, an official spokesperson of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare said that 50 to 80 per cent subsidy is given by the state government on Crop Residue Management machinery. He said that if any person burns stubble in the fields, then he can be booked Under Section 188 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-hefty-fines-and-close-to-100-firs-crop-burning-cases-rising-across-haryana/articleshow/87788743.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Decision on odd-even today: Khattar||Karnal: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said straw burning was not the sole reason behind air pollution in Delhi as there were several other factors that are also responsible for it. The CM reached Karnal on late Thursday evening. Reply to a question about the allegation levelled by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that stubble burning in the neighbouring states was causing air pollution in Delhi, Khattar said the allegations were baseless as only accusing farmers for the crisis was not justified. Khattar said," I don’t deny that the straw burning was adding to the air pollution, but there are several other factors, including emission from vehicles and industry and construction activities, also responsible for the air pollution. Even the Supreme Court has also observed the same”. Khattar claimed that with the efforts of Haryana government, farm fire incidents had come down as compared to last year. The chief minister added that the decision on odd-even would be taken on Friday. He added that the government had introduced several schemes to encourage farmers for stubble management. Under the schemes, Rs 1,000 per acre for making bales and subsidy for machinery was also being provided to the farmers, the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/decision-on-odd-even-today-khattar/articleshow/87788741.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Not scared of cases, time for another movement against Centre, says K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said that he was not scared of cases as claimed by some BJP leaders at the TRS’ ‘Maha Dharna’ at Indira Park on Thursday. The fight was for farmers and not for power or political gain, the CM said, adding that he was not afraid of anything, indirectly mocking BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay’s remark that he (KCR) would soon know fear. Warning that there was no party like TRS when it came to fighting spirit, the CM said that the time had come for another movement against the Centre. The TRS, once it begins a fight, would take it to its logical end, the CM thundered at the ‘Maha Dharna’. “During the Telangana movement, TRS leaders quit their posts as ministers, MPs and MLAs, and faced bypolls for the cause of statehood. KCR is not scared of anything or anybody. We are asking the Centre to react to people’s and farmers’ issues. We will play politics later,” KCR said. The CM said the Centre has to clear stand on paddy procurement as farmers should not face difficulty after rabi season. He also appealed to farmers to not go for paddy and instead sow other crops suggested by agriculture officials. “I understand it is difficult to switch to other crops immediately, but it is essential,” he said. Earlier, ministers S Niranjan Reddy, G Jagadish Reddy, party secretary general K Keshava Rao, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, whip Gongidi Sunitha also spoke at the dharna. They said the fight was not between TRS and BJP or political, but it was between state and the Centre over farmers’ issue. “Telangana government brought back the agriculture sector on track by providing free power, investments support such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bheema, waiver of agriculture loans and above all irrigation. But policies of the BJP government has left the farming sector in doldrums over paddy issue,” Niranjan Reddy said. BJP chief Sanjay and said: “State government set up procurement centres and procured 11 lakh MTs of paddy in kharif season. Why is Sanjay creating problems? Farmers have taught him a lesson.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-scared-of-cases-time-for-anothermovement-against-centre-says-kcr/articleshow/87788100.cms||Koride Mahesh

Write to BMC before December 2||MUMBAI: BMC has invited objections/claims from tribals as 4.32 hectares (about 11 acres) of forest land is to be reserved for the proposed four-lane Borivli-Gorai bridge across Gorai creek.To construct the bridge, mangroves need to be removed for which BMCwill need permission of Bombay high court. The road was proposed in 2005 by MMRDA which was then the special planning body for Manori-Gorai. The notice states in 2012 the Centre amended the Scheduled Tribes & Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 and 2008 further amended in 2012 to be applicable in BMC limits. “On this land (4.32 hectares for the road) as per the Act if any tribals and other traditional forest dwellers have any pending claims, objections or litigation, the same are to be raised in writing before December 2 at the BMC’s R Central ward office.” While the road has been granted clearance by Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority, locals are opposed to it. “This road is for outsiders, not for locals. The four-lane road will connect to narrow village roads. Near the police station and the church, two buses cannot pass at the same time. There are houses that abut the road,” said advocate Godfrey Pimenta who represents villagers. The villagers, he said, need a hospital, water supply but these basic needs have been ignored by BMC and MMRDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-objections-to-gorai-bridge-write-to-bmc-before-dec-2/articleshow/87788782.cms||---

ATS sleuths also recovered cables, routers, laptops, and phone lines of a telecom company from the location. ATS officials said Mishra had been running the racket for the past two months and was diverting internet-based international phone calls, causing loss of crores of rupees to the government. The racket was busted in a joint operation with the department of telecom. The accused was arrested on inputs from a private telecom operator. The firm had informed authorities about the illegal exchange based on the inputs from its fraud management team. Sources in ATS said the company had provided a phone connection in the name of a woman hailing from Vadodara, Gujarat, for setting up a call centre for an IT firm. The telecom firm’s fraud management team found that this connection was being used for connecting international calls and diverting them to phone numbers in India as domestic calls. Sources in Anti-Terrorist Squad said Mishra seems to be a cog in the wheels and the ATS is hunting for the mastermind of the racket. Officials said Mishra, who hails from Purnia district of Bihar, was arrested on the charges of  cheating, criminal conspiracy, and provisions of the Indian Telephone Act 1885.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-busts-intl-call-routing-racket-1-nabbed/articleshow/87788760.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||FCI buying 20LMT of additional parboiled rice from Telangana: Centre||HYDERABAD: On a day when CM K Chandrasekhar Rao went all out on the BJP on the paddy procurement issue, the Centre clarified that it had already agreed to procure 24.75 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of parboiled rice from the 2021 rabi crop and the rest as raw rice. According to official sources in the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, the FCI currently has a stock of 46.28 LMT of parboiled rice and another 32.73 LMT is on the way. “By the time the season ends, the total stock of parboiled rice with the FCI will be around 79 LMT. About 20 LMT of parboiled rice is consumed annually from the FCI stock in parboiled rice-deficit states. It will approximately take four years to liquidate the parboiled rice stock available with the FCI,” sources said. Officials said that delivery of an additional 20 LMT of parboiled rice — in addition to the previously sanctioned 24.75 LMT of rice from the 2020-21 paddy — was permitted at the request of the Telangana government. Officials said Telangana consumes just raw rice but generates more parboiled rice, which must eventually be sent to parboiled rice-deficient states.Volume of its exports has declined overtime because of increase in output in parboiled rice-consuming states. Official sources said that it was agreed during a meeting held in August that Telangana’s procurement of estimate for kharif was 40 LMT rice, which was 22.47% more than previous year’s kharif procurement. However, in a letter to PM Narendra Modi, KCR had requested the Centre to procure 90 LMT of rice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fci-buying-20lmt-of-additionalparboiled-rice-from-t-centre/articleshow/87788106.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The scheme also covers those from other states and countries. The scheme – Nammai Kaakkum 48 (saving our lives in 48 hours) — announced on Thursday will be offered to all road accident victims for a year. It will be dovetailed with the Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme next year after review. Officials said the scheme will cover all those who don’t have insurance. The state has set aside Rs 50 crore for the first phase of implementation of the ‘Innuyir Kaappom Thittam’ (saving precious lives). “The procedures performed under the new scheme are not included in the current state insurance scheme,” said a senior official. After chief minister MK Stalin‘s review meeting on road safety with ministers and officials on Thursday, the government announced a comprehensive policy including legislation of emergency medical services and setting up a road safety authority. The state will frame a Medical Emergencies Act that will focus on five elements -- emergency response, rescue and resuscitation, damage control surgeries, bring people back to normalcy and rehabilitation. “The idea is to empower more people to help road accident victims, create awareness, set protocols and bring in standard of care. We will create emergency codes and detail things to be done in the act,” the official said. The state would involve students from schools, colleges, NGOs, and members of the public to convert road safety into a people’s movement, it said. The state will also set up a road safety authority that will offer administrative and financial support to implement road safety policies, maintain registry, research on causes for prevention of accidents and monitor road design and quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-accident-victims-to-get-free-care-in-609-govt-pvt-hosps/articleshow/87788108.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Farmers can’t be satisfied until Congress government implements full loan waiver, says Sukhbir Singh Badal||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Thursday that farmers as well as farm organisations can never be satisfied until the Congress government implements the promised full farm loan waiver. Sukhbir was speaking at a function in which Congress intellectual cell president Anish Sidana joined the SAD along with his team. The SAD president appointed him his political advisor for urban areas. Launching an attack on the chief minister, Sukhbir accused Channi of being the ‘biggest illegal coloniser’ in the state and responsible for the mushrooming of illegal colonies in the Kharar-Ropar belt besides holding control over the sand mining business in the area. “Chief minister was known to patronise illegal colonies as well as the sand mafia. This is the reason why Channi has played a farce on the people in the name of reducing sand prices,” alleged Sukhbir. People are not getting sand at Rs 5 per cubic feet as announced by the chief minister anywhere, but the state exchequer has lost Rs 50 crore advertising this falsehood, he added. He said the chief minister had also come up with false claims about making petroleum prices cheapest in the region and had also tried to hoodwink Punjabis by reducing power tariff by Rs 3 per unit till March 31. On the ongoing STF report case in the high court, Sukhbir said, “No one is stopping the Punjab government from nabbing the drug lords.” He said it was strange that instead of arresting the drug lords, the Congress government was politicising the issue in the same manner as it had done in the sacrilege case. He also challenged the state government to present a single shred of evidence against him in the sacrilege case. “The chief minister, home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and DGP IPS Sahota are liable to be held to account under Section 120 (b) for hatching a criminal conspiracy to frame me in a false case which has been exposed by the SAD.” On cancellation of bus permits of his transport company, Sukhbir said they had been cancelled even without issuing any notice to it. “We do not owe even a single rupee in taxes to the Punjab government. In direct contrast, companies of Congress leaders are defaulters, but are not being proceeded against,” said Sukbir, adding that the state also owes Rs 280 crore in taxes from buses of the state transport undertaking. The SAD president said he was surprised after the farmer organisations expressed satisfaction on meeting the Punjab chief minister on Wednesday. Sukkhbir said farmers expected the Kisan organisations to take up the issue of extreme shortage and black marketing of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser with the chief minister in their meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-cant-be-satisfied-until-cong-govt-implements-full-loan-waiver/articleshow/87788759.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 arrested without Delhi cops in loop, UP govt forms SIT||NEW DELHI: The Uttar Pradesh Police Wednesday told Delhi High Court that it has formed a special investigative team (SIT) to look into the arrest of two city residents by them without intimation of local police. The high court was also informed that the two family members of a boy who married a girl against her family’s wishes, have also been released and a closure report filed. The counsel for UP government submitted that the SHO concerned and the investigating officer involved in the incident have been suspended. “State (of Uttar Pradesh) has taken it very seriously. A DSP rank officer is heading the SIT. We will ensure justice is done. All wrongs will be inquired into at length,” the counsel told the court. Justice Mukta Gupta then asked UP Police to file a status report based on the SIT’s report and observed that when the FIR itself disclosed that the girl in question was a major, the officers concerned should have first recorded her statement to ascertain her will. “The fact is that the FIR says she is a major. First thing, you will record the statement of the girl. When the girl is a major and has gone on her own free will, where is the offence made out?” Justice Gupta asked. “I have seen the case diaries. I know what is there, what is the investigation carried out. I don’t want to interfere but if the petitioner’s version is correct (that the family members were arrested from Delhi by UP Police), it is very serious and the arrest is shown at some other place. What is your investigation on that?” the court asked UP Police and posted the matter for further hearing on January 11. The court was hearing a case where a couple had approached it saying they married of their own volition in July, against the wishes of the girl’s family and were now getting repeated threats from them. The petitioner also claimed that the father and brother of the boy were taken away by UP cops and for more than one month and their whereabouts were not known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-arrested-without-delhi-cops-in-loop-up-govt-forms-sit/articleshow/87788134.cms||---

Dozens of accused in the 11 chargesheets of the quid pro quo case have filed pleas seeking to discharge them from CBI and ED cases or to quash the case against them. All of them have now come before Justice Bhuyan, who may hear them by allotting some time. Judge reminded advocates that it was only after everyone agreed to argue their cases, the matters were listed and it will not be fair on the part of some advocates to seek adjournment citing various reasons. While some advocates contended they were of the view that the court may follow the old order where their cases were lying at the bottom of the list, some cited personal reasons. The judge, however, made it clear to all that they have to argue on the day their cases are listed. The judge also brushed aside the contention that the CBI has not filed its counter in some of the pleas. “No need of counters in quash pleas,” he said. Later, the judge began hearing in the Vanpic case. Senior counsel Vinod Kumar Deshpande argued the case of former IRAS officer KV Brahmananda Reddy, who was made an accused in the Vanpic chargesheet filed by the CBI in 2013. He came on a deputation to AP in 2012 and was made special secretary in the infrastructure and investments department of the state, he said.  Case was adjourned to November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-rs-50k-for-seeking-adjournment-t-hc/articleshow/87788123.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Thampy Kurien of Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union said this may reduce operational and maintenance costs by over 50%. He demanded that the government expedite setting up of electric battery swapping facilities at various locations along feeder routes in suburbs. “We are willing to cooperate with the government in the experimental run of electric autos on shared routes in the suburbs of Mumbai,” Kurien added. The city has 2.3 lakh autos of which several are on 100 share routes in the eastern and western suburbs. For auto as well as Kaali Peeli taxi drivers, CNG was now “more expensive” than what it was in January this year. CNG rate increased by around Rs 10 per kg in just nine months of 2021, escalating the operational expenses for cab owners by 20% despite getting a fare hike, a driver said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/share-autos-willing-to-go-electric-if-govt-helps-in-mumbai-union/articleshow/87790046.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers’ loans increased to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, says AAP||CHANDIGARH: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Thursday that the Congress government had promised in writing in 2017 to waive the entire loan of about Rs 90,000 crore of the farmers and farm labourers, but now the debt had increased to nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore. It included loans raised from government, cooperative and private banks, as well as, from the unorganized sector, it added. Leader of opposition (LoP) in Punjab legislative assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said for this promise, forms were also filled by farmers and labourers but as soon as the government was formed, the Congress showed its real “deceit”. If the Congress government had released Rs 300 crore of subsidies on time, it would have been in a position to say to have done at least a bit to save agriculture. The AAP leader said since SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, being then Union minister, had a role to play in all three agriculture laws passed in Parliament, the people of Punjab would teach a lesson to the Badal family in the upcoming assembly elections. Taking a dig at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Cheema asked whether he would waive the entire loan of farmers. “If you do, then declare its time limit and the entire loan of the farmers and labourers should be waived before the code of conduct is in force,” the LoP said. Reacting on withdrawal of cases against farmers for stubble burning, Cheema asked if Punjab government did not have the solution to stubble burning, should a case be registered against it as well. On the compensation amount of Rs 17,000 per acre to the farmers for cottomn crop damaged by pink bollworm, AAP said that the Congress government could not escape the questions of the farmers. Was the compensate amount enough when farmers had spent anything from Rs 60,000 to 70,000 per acre to grow the crop that was damaged by the bollwarm pest, he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/loan-of-punjab-farmers-has-increased-to-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-aap/articleshow/87788775.cms||---

Rajewal was in Karnal on Thursday to record his statement before the oneman commission formed of inquiry to probe the sequence of events that led to police lathi-charge at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal on August 28. Rajewal said, “Politics is not an agenda of Morcha. SKM leaders had requested him that he should not hold meetings in poll-bound state Punjab, but to no avail. Hence, we have decided to oppose Charuni in Punjab if he holds any political programme there. We will also show black flag to him like other political leaders.” Asked about agitation, Rajewal claimed that the agitation was going in the right direction and it will be successful and the government will have to accept their demand. Reply to a question about SKM’s proposed protest march from Ambala to Tikri on November 24, Rajewal said that the decision is being reviewed and the final decision is pending. The two senior leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, GurnamSingh Charuni and Balbir Singh Rajewal, have openly come against each other as a day before Charuni, without naming anyone, had said that Punjab farmer leaders were jealous of his increasing popularity in their state. Now, Rajewal openly said that they would oppose Gurnam Singh Charuni in Punjab due to his political motive. However, he denied any rift in the morcha and said all is good. When asked about his statement before the commission, the SKM leader said that he told the commission that he was not present at Karnal when the lathicharge took place. But he was in Karnal on the day of the mini secretariat was gheraod.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With eye on polls, BMC races to initiate GMLR project work||MUMBAI: Ahead of the BMC polls to be held early next year, the BMC is rushing to initiate construction of its ambitious Goregaon Mulund Link Road (GMLR). Two bridges meant to connect Western Express Highway with Eastern Express Highway will be built and an administrative process for it is in the final stages. Works on the challenging part — the tunnel to go below the National Park — will be taken up later. While one bridge will be built ahead of Oberoi mall towards Film City, the other would be built at Khindipada (Bhandup), connecting the tunnel to the Eastern Express Highway. A senior official from the civic bridges department said, “The inauguration of the work for the two flyovers that will connect the tunnel may take place very soon as the proposal has already been sent for administrative approval. Once construction begins, we even plan to push for the tunnelling works.” GMLR will pass under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), affecting about 19.43 hectares of the park. The loss of plantation was proposed to be compensated by the BMC in villages near Tadoba by acquiring a similar-sized plots. The total end-to-end length of the road starting from Western Express Highway in Goregaon up to Eastern Express Highway in Mulund is proposed to be over 12 km. The road will have two tunnels and the SGNP tunnel is expected to be 4.7 km in length. Meanwhile, a box tunnel through Film City in Goregaon has also been proposed which would be 1.6 km. The initial estimated cost of the GMLR project was pegged at Rs 4,700 crore which has now increased to over Rs 6,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-eye-on-polls-bmc-races-to-initiate-gmlr-project-work/articleshow/87790048.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sparring between parties continues outside court||The sparring between minister Nawab Malik and NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s family continued outside the high court on Thursday, reports Prafulla Marpakwar. While Malik claimed that he has submitted all the relevant documents to prove that Sameer is Muslim before the Bombay high court in a defamation suit filed by his father ‘Dawood’ Wankhede, Sameer’s wife Kranti Redkar Wankhede hit back, saying there seems to be a planned effort to malign Sameer’s image. As far as Sameer’s certificates are concerned, certain errors were made, but were later rectified by Dnyandev Wankhede with all legal formalities in 1989. “All along, Sameer Wankhede was claiming that he is scheduled caste and not Muslim. We have procured his school leaving certificate and school admission form, where it has been mentioned that his religion is Muslim and his father’s name is Dawood Wankhede. From the documents, it appears he is Muslim and not scheduled caste. Under such circumstances, all the benefits taken by him on the grounds that he is scheduled caste should be withdrawn forthwith,” said Malik. Another member of Wankhede’s family accused Malik of selectively leaking documents. When Sameer was being admitted to school, his mother had made certain errors. When they were brought to the notice of Wankhede’s father, they were legally rectified, the person said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sparring-between-parties-continues-outside-court/articleshow/87789339.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The yatra, that started from Ghazipur at 12:30 on Wednesday afternoon, concluded before daybreak (around 4am) on Thursday. Moved by the crowds waiting to welcome him on either side of the Expressway even after dark till beyond midnight, Akhilesh tweeted a photograph of himself waving at the crowds atop his Vijay Rath with thousands of people standing around. “But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep … ,” he wrote under the photograph that he tweeted around 1am. Hours later he tweeted again: “ … It’s now time for a new dawn, time for change” apparently referring to the upcoming assembly polls in UP. But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep…. https://t.co/OuxeuoGBnJ— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) 1637177473000Emboldened by the response to the Vijay Yatra on the expressway, which SP described as “unprecedented”, the former UP CM announced that more such yatras will be undertaken and the process will be repeated till SP government is formed in UP. “The historic response and support extended all along the Expressway from the people of Purvanchal and workers, office bearers and leaders of Samajwadi Party and alliance partners who stood by throughout the day and even at night – I heartfelt thank you to all,” Akhilesh tweeted in Hindi. He said the way people lined up all along the Expressway to express their support to SP was a befitting reply to ruling BJP’s move to remove the word Samajwadi from the name of the Expressway. SP chief said the expressway was originally named “Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway”, but the ruling BJP dropped the word “Samajwadi” from it. Now people lined up the entire length of the Expressway to express their support to the Vijay Yatra and have proved that “Samajwadi” was wrongly dropped from the name, Akhilesh said. Vijay Yatra that started from Ghazipur passed through Mau, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Ambedkarnagar, Sultanur, Amethi, Ayodhya and Barabanki before reaching Lucknow around 4:30am on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sps-vijay-yatra-ends-at-dawn-miles-to-go-tweets-akhilesh/articleshow/87788788.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

During her speech in Chitrakoot on Wednesday, Priyanka had quoted this poem to bolster the Congress’s campaign ‘Ladki hoon lad sakti hoon’ for the 2022 UP elections for which the party has promised 40% tickets for women candidates. Reacting sharply, Upadhyay tweeted from his handle @viYogiee: “I wrote this poem for women of the country… not for your petty politics… Also, neither I support your ideology, nor have I allowed you to use my literary creation for political use.” He concluded by questioning what the nation could expect from “someone who steals a poem”. Though he later removed the main tweet, he maintained his objection. In another tweet, he said, “The message is clear… poem ‘Suno Draupadi’ is not meant for political use.” “The message of this poem written in 2012 after the Nirbhaya case is totally different from your political frustration and has a much wider meaning. I hope that no political party will make it an instrument of politics in future,” he said in another tweet, adding that the subject should not be seen as a mere controversy but of a larger issue which is protection of literary property. Congress members reacted sharply. “Use of popular poems by social and political leaders is not new. It seems that the poet was simply playing with words when writing this because by targeting a woman who voiced the sentiments in his poem to voice the larger cause of women, he has defeated the cause of his own writing. Sadly, he has brought a bad name to the poets’ fraternity who p r actise to see the larger canvas of life,” said Surendra Rajput, All India Congress Committee spokesperson. MLC Deepak Singh said, “Poet Ramdhari Singh ‘Dinkar’ was a Congress MP and his famous poem ‘Singhasan khali karo ab Janata aati hai’ was used by leaders in the Opposition in his presence. Some like the author of Utho Draupadi are nothing more than sycophants,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/my-work-not-for-petty-politics-poet-after-priyanka-quotes-him/articleshow/87788790.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The process started from October 1 had bought in 4.98 lakh metric tonnes, against an announced target of 70 lakh metric tonnes, and instead of the promised 4,000 procurement centres, only 1,712 were running, it alleged. “Farmers are desperately selling their paddy at significantly lower prices in the open market at around Rs 1,250 per quintal, whereas the minimum support price was Rs 19,40 per quintal. While 6,42,224 farmers have registered themselves for procurement benefits, paddy procurement from only 71,352 farmers had taken place,” it claimed, adding that BJP had said that MSP was there, MSP was continuing and MSP would remain in future but it stood exposed fully. BKU Tikait, AIKS, AIKM, AIKMS were engaged in mobilising farmers for Lucknow ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ scheduled for Monday. SKM has also asked citizens to join the dharna at Hansi SP office on Friday in large numbers. SKM said Telangana chief minister, ministers and TRS leaders were insisting on paddy procurement by the Government of India. The state government was also now vocally critical of the Centre’s farm laws. The FCI reneged on its commitment to procure parboiled rice from Telangana in a callous fashion, pushing farmers in losses now, SKM claimed. It said that in a letter on November 12, United Nation’s Special Rapporteur on Right To Food Michael Fakri presented an analysis of the farm laws and raised questions about it with the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paddy-procurement-unsatisfactory-in-up-telangana-says-skm/articleshow/87788792.cms||---

Left with nearly 17,000 vaccine doses, the hospital has tied up with LIC HFL and NGO Golden Hour Foundation to fund the doses. The hospital will only provide Covishield doses and people can come for first and second shots. Till now, private hospitals have only vaccinated people living in slums for free with the help of CSR (corporate social responsibility) funding. “We will perhaps be the first in the country to roll out vaccination for people from all walks of life at no cost. It will be done with contributions from two agencies,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital. The hospital will bear the service charge of Rs 150, which means the agencies would be paying the hospital only the cost of the vaccine. “It will help us cover more people,” he said. The agencies have given Rs 50 lakh to the hospital. With paid vaccinations witnessing a drastic drop in demand since October, over 45 lakh doses are lying with private hospitals in Mumbai, Thane and Pune. Several experts have advised that the private hospitals should vaccinate for free or find CSR donors so that doses don’t get wasted or lie idle. But with an overall drop in demand for vaccination and the public sector too have abundant doses, private players are unable to find many takers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/free-vaccines-for-everyone-at-bombay-hospital-now/articleshow/87790070.cms||---

Farmers said they can’t go for alternate crops such as pulses or vegetables as monkeys would destroy them. Hundreds of monkeys ravage any crop that is grown in Poachampally with calls to the forest department and local authorities falling on deaf ears. “If not paddy, what else should I cultivate? Monkeys are going to destroy everything and I am going to be left with nothing in the end,” Bikshapathi C, a 75-year-old farmer told TOI. He said protecting paddy for the monkeys itself is a herculean task and added that vegetables, corn, or pulses would not survive the monkey menace. “The monkeys will eat a part of the vegetable and will throw the rest,” he added. Many farmers said that they are yet to cultivate the land this time. Almost all farmers in Pochampally village that TOI met at the market said they would rather grow think it is better to not grow anything at all instead of opting for alternate crops. They said that the water too is not suitable to grow vegetables or pulses as it comes from the Musi river. “Using them for growing vegetables can be hazardous,” said Ram Goud, another farmer. With the state not yet procuring paddy from them, the farmers said that they don’t have the required capital to cultivate now. “I have decided not to cultivate my two-and-half acres of land this time. Growing anything else will not be feasible. Instead, I will start selling vegetables in the market. I will at least earn Rs 150 to Rs 200 every day,” said Lakshmi G, a farmer, who lost her husband five months back. The farmers said that it would cost them about Rs 20, 000 to cultivate an acre of land. Another farmer Lalitha G, who has 2 acres of land and has taken another five on rent, said that there is water on land 24*7. “If we try to grow vegetables, they get spoiled because of the presence of water throughout the day and night. This land is only suitable for paddy,” she added. An official from the agriculture department said that monkey menace is not just limited to Pochampally and that farmers should take extra care to produce alternate crops. “It is advice from the government to go for alternate crops. If the farmers think there is no other alternative to paddy, they should be ready to explore the market to sell their produce in near future,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monkey-menace-forces-ryots-to-stay-away-from-other-crops/articleshow/87788168.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Dehradun||21 years on, asset distribution row settled by UP & Uttarakhand govts||DEHRADUN: In a crucial meeting at Lucknow on Thursday, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath resolved several asset distribution matters — pending for 21 years — between the two states. A major decision was to hand over Alaknanda hotel in Haridwar to Uttarakhand, once the construction of a new rest house of Uttar Pradesh was completed by December this year. Besides, UP has agreed to reconstruct two barrages – Banbasa and Kiccha – damaged due to heavy rains. Also, Uttar Pradesh state road transport corporation has agreed to clear dues of Rs 205 crore of Uttarakhand transport corporation.  In some other matters, 15 days’ time has been sought to arrive at a consensus. Both states have also agreed to withdraw the asset distribution cases pending in court, agreeing to mutually take a decision. “UP is like an elder brother and with the cooperation of CM Yogi Adityanath, we were successful in resolving matters pending for the past 21 years,” CM Dhami said. He further stated that soon more matters would be resolved. “The BJP government in both states has taken a positive step and it was with the cooperation of Uttar Pradesh that our efforts have fructified,” he added.  Since 2004, both states had been contesting a civil suit in the SC over the ownership rights of the Alaknanda hotel in Haridwar. In 2017, the apex court, had directed both states to resolve the issue and also pulled up the governments for “behaving in a childish manner”.  While both states had earlier agreed on the transfer, it was decided that the Alaknanda hotel would be handed over to Uttarakhand once a new tourist rest house building of Uttar Pradesh was constructed nearby. With the new tourist rest house building almost complete, possibilities are that the handover of the “old” TRH to Uttarakhand would be done in December. In the meeting, it was also decided that both states would conduct a joint survey on 5,700 hectares and 1,700 houses of Uttarakhand irrigation department to identify land and houses which would be suitable for UP irrigation department. UP has also agreed to clear Rs 90-crore dues of the forest department of Uttarakhand. The neighbouring state has approved the transfer of Kiccha bus stand land -- which is at present in the possession of UP irrigation department – to the Himalayan state.  UP has approved tourism and water sport activities in the water bodies of Dhaura, Baigul and Nanakmatta in Udham Singh Nagar district. The state has also given consent for water sport activities in the upper Ganga canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-yrs-on-asset-distribution-row-settled-by-up-ukhand-govts/articleshow/87786679.cms||Kautilya Singh

He added that among the four arrested is Chandan Singh Lodhiyal, a 27-year-old, from whom a pistol was seized. The other three have been identified as Umesh Mehta, 30, from Supi village, Krishna Singh Bisht, 30, and Rajkumar Mehta, 29, both from Mukteshwar. Kumaon deputy inspector general Nilesh Anand Bharane said three teams were formed to identify and arrest the accused who pelted stones, fired shots and set a part of the house on fire, adding that Rakesh Kapil, the first to be identified in the matter, and the remaining accused will also be arrested soon. “If the accused are not caught, a warrant will be issued against them,” the officer added. Teams of Bhowali, Bhimtal and Mukteshwar police formed under the circle officer are continuously conducting raids in order to arrest the suspects, Bharne said. Khurshid's house in Satkol, about 15 kilometres from Nainital, was vandalised on Monday amid the ongoing controversy over his book 'Sunrise Over Ayodhaya: Nationhood In Our Times' in which he draws a comparison between Hindutva and terror outfits like ISIS. After three days, police were able to trace some of the accused. During interrogation, the accused told police they had gone to the house of Salman Khurshid to burn his effigy. “We burnt the effigy and raised slogans. It was the caretaker who hurled abuses at us, which infuriated us and we opened fire and burnt a part of the house. After the incident, when we learnt that a case has been registered against us, we were going to Haldwani to arrange a lawyer for us but police arrested us,” one of the accused told police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/4-men-who-vandalised-khurshids-house-arrested-key-suspect-missing-cops/articleshow/87786708.cms||---

GSPCB has issued showcause notices to three ore beneficiation plants for functioning on the basis of “illegal permits” issued by the chief inspector of factories and boilers. Goa Foundation’s Claude Alvares had filed formal complaints on March 8 against the Vedanta beneficiation plants at Amona and Surla, and the Fomento plant at Santona, asking for their closure. Beneficiation is a process that improves the quality of the ore by removing the impurities, which results in a higher grade ore concentrate. The Union environment ministry has made it clear that such beneficiation plants cannot be granted consent to operate unless they have an environmental clearance under the EIA notification of 2006. “It has taken several months for the pollution board to act. Finally, showcause notices have been issued,” Alvares said. In the showcause notice, GSPCB member secretary Sanjeev Joglekar has directed Vedanta and Fomento to respond within seven days with reasons why the plants should not be shut. “Failure to comply with the aforesaid notice will compel the board to initiate stringent legal action,” Joglekar said.

In his petition, Singh said operation of the stone crusher has adversely affected the environment and has caused disturbance to wild animals, forcing them to move out towards the human habitat. The petitioner has made the state government, principal secretary of industrial development and mining department, pollution control board, district officer of Pauri and Manav Stone Crusher as parties in the PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-notice-against-stone-crusher-located-near-rajaji/articleshow/87786696.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jains rush to watch life-changing biopic on Shrimad Rajchandraji||MUMBAI: It’s the wake-up show. The one for which you shower, wear clothes fit for a temple and scurry to the closest cinema. Once there, slip out your footwear, sit in padmasana and join your palms and later walk out so inspired that life takes a turn. Jains across the city have been rushing to watch a biopic on Shrimad Rajchandraji that encapsulates his life: from his very first day in school when he wowed his teachers, to the last calm moments when his soul was slowly “absorbed in true nature”. Shrimadji’s 33 years offer teachings that are central to every being. Each moment lived was filled with an acute sense of consciousness, and capturing that state of absolute awakened being makes the biopic by non-profit Bhakti Trust a Jain blockbuster. Almost all shows for November and December are booked. “We conceptualised the idea 8 years ago. It has been a long journey of 2.5 lakh manhours and over 45 hours of computing time,” said Bhairav Kothari, a CA and devout Jain who wanted to introduce the world to Shrimadji, well known as the spiritual guru of Mahatma Gandhi, and lovingly called Krupaludev for his immense compassion. “From the fast corporate life of finance, this was a project I thought I would take up after retirement,” said Kothari. But this was not to be. From the fall of Krupaludev’s muslin kurta to the clean layers of the turbans, from the magical simplicity of those times to wholeheartedness that shone in the eyes of every follower, the power of detailing overwhelms every viewer, Jain or not. “We have over 350 character models in the movie and more than 200 different modelling versions of Krupaludev were created, to match him pixel to pixel, before which we were certain about one. We took two months only to get the pagdi (turban) right. We used a lot of actual photo images, did age regression or progression. We took a lot of time and effort to recreate even the stone texturing of Idar (in Gujarat) where Krupaludev used to meditate for hours,” he said. Scooping out the vital bits, this 100-minute-biopic, with the ceremonial half-time popcorn break, takes the audience back eons ago to Vavania in Saurashtra, close to modern-day Morbi in Gujarat. The idea of the movie also underwent iterations. Starting out of a garage with a two-member team, it was initially a low-cost project to be made by zooming in and panning out paintings. A little animation was then planned. Then the entire 2D movie was scrapped and a full-blown 3D animation biopic was planned, with generous contributions of hundreds of believers who read the storyboard and felt it came with a sense of purpose for mankind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jains-rush-to-watch-life-changing-biopic-on-shrimad-rajchandraji/articleshow/87790100.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra has 2 crore doses & 2 crore population awaits 1st jab but turnout dips||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has more than 2 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine available with public centres and incidentally an almost equal number of people waiting for their first doses. Yet, there are no long queues or blocked appointments, giving rise to concerns about the state approaching vaccination saturation. The current stock of vaccines is the highest it has ever had since the drive began in January. Maharashtra has administered the second-highest vaccine doses in India (10.5 crore) after UP, immunizing 77% of its eligible population with at least one shot and 38% with both. The state’s first dose coverage, though, is marginally below the national average (81%), with over 2.1 crore people yet to take first shots. Turnout at vaccine centres started to see a slump with the start of festivals in October. In the first week of November, after hitting a rock-bottom daily average of less than 2 lakh jabs, it showed a minor rise recently. However, the daily numbers have stalled at 6 lakh to 7 lakh, of which around 55% are second doses. Nationally, too, an inertia has been observed with the average shots in the past month dropping to 18.8 lakh per day against the target of 40.8 lakh. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said a slowdown is expected. “It happens in any public health campaign,” he said. “As vaccination coverage increases, every incremental percentage point will need much harder efforts as all low hanging fruits have been plucked,” he said and assured the state continued to do reasonably well considering its heterogeneous demographics. In terms of supply, even Covaxin is in abundance now. Dr Sachin Desai, the state’s immunization officer, said the state has been assured of 40 lakh doses. “Typically, we used to receive 15-20 lakh doses of Covaxin,” he said. Besides the 2 crore doses in the public sector, the private sector is estimated to have 45 lakh-50 lakh. Dr Naveen Thacker, a paediatrician and expert on vaccination, called the slowdown an expected phenomenon once coverage hits 70-80%, but also blamed complacency. “People are perhaps no longer afraid of Covid. Also, TV debates and announcements saying the third way may be blunted or not come at all, could be emboldening people to skip vaccination,” he said, cautioning protection against Delta would need minimum 90% coverage. “We should target 100%.” Out of 35 districts, Mumbai is the only one to have achieved 100% first dose coverage. While another three districts, Pune, Bhandara and Sindhudurg have achieved more than 90% coverage. There are nine districts in the 80% first dose coverage bracket and four in the 70% bracket. Majority districts (16) are in the 60% bracket and two (Beed and Nandurbar) have only reached 57%. Dr Thacker said that the time for awareness campaigns is over. What districts need are rapid surveys to understand the pulse of the community. While districts such as Aurangabad have linked vaccination to ration and fuel supply, most don’t want to take a hard stand yet. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said they have been struggling to achieve coverage in tribal pockets. “We are no longer convincing people and waiting for them to show up at centres. We are taking the mobile vans to their doorsteps. Anyone who is counselled and has shown any willingness, is vaccinated on the spot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-has-2-crore-doses-2-crore-population-awaits-1st-jab-but-turnout-dips/articleshow/87790004.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Experts from the minority communities as well as educational institutes are expected to submit the report within three months.The committee will look into the existing schemes and new ones to improve minority education and submit its recommendations, the government resolution released on Wednesday said. It further said that the Supreme Court has passed four judgments explaining various clauses in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which are not applicable to the minority institutions. The panel is expected to study judgments regarding minority institutes and formulate administrative and educational policies related to schools, students and teachers in minority institutes. “Till now, there has not been any policy specifically for minority education. This has created some issues because there are ambiguities when it comes to implementing some Acts. Such a policy will help clear them,” Markus Deshmukh, an advocate and an educational consultant for many minority schools, said. “Secondly, there are many schemes available but implementation may be an issue because the educational department officers do not know them well. Their training is a must. Thirdly, there are areas in the education of minority communities where we can do better as a state. This will also be studied and a draft policy will be recommended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/16-member-panel-to-recommend-edu-policy-for-minority-institutes-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87790108.cms||Ardhra Nair

At this rate, it is extremely doubtful how the department will be able to honour its commitment.” The bench also observed that the department’s communication to enforcement agencies to detect and book motor cabs that have not yet installed digital fare meters, was dated November 15, the same day the status report was submitted to the high court. “We expect the transport department/authority concerned to give greater details of the steps taken by agencies to detect and book motor cabs which have not installed digital fare meters, as well as the number of vehicles which are found plying without digital fare meters,” the bench comprising justices M R Dere and M Pitale stated. In the status report, transport director Rajan Satardekar said that the department would issue a public notice within five days, notifying all motor cab owners that they should not ply their vehicle without digital fare meters, and if any such vehicle is found plying, violations would be booked and strict action will be taken in terms of law. With regard to vehicles that have not yet installed or booked appointments for installation, the department stated that it has “blocked the process of renewal of permit and fitness certificate for such vehicle unless the digital fare meter is installed”. “The department is further in the process of compiling the data and within 15 days, the permits of all vehicles which have neither fitted nor booked an appointment for installation will be cancelled.” The department added that it would restore cancelled permits only once vehicles are fitted with digital fare meters. Till date, 4,109 vehicles have been fitted with the meters, and 2,631 bookings are awaiting installation, the director submitted. “Though the process was expected to be completed by October 31, 2021, the same is taking further time... The department has continued with the process of accepting bookings and installation of the meters to all vehicle owners who have come forward,” he stated. Satardekar added that the department has written to the enforcement agencies to detect and book motor cabs that have not yet installed digital fare meters. “The agencies have been requested to ensure that no motor cab plies without an installed digital fare meter,” the transport director added. At the last hearing, the Goa government assured the HC that licenses of taxi owners who failed to install digital meters by October 31, would have their licenses cancelled, and the transport director assured the court that the process would be completed by October 31. The state government had submitted to the court that it has taken a decision to subsidise the entire cost of the device (including backend and data service costs). The high court has closely been monitoring the installation of digital fare meters in taxis after the TTAG filed a second contempt petition within two years over the delay in their installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-pulls-up-govt-for-slow-pace-of-taxi-meter-drive/articleshow/87788200.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Delhi||Just 30% of Delhi pollution of its own making, says Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Pointing out that external pollution sources were hampering the city’s air quality and contribution from local sources was much lesser, environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday urged the Union environment minister to call a meeting with the NCR states to prepare an action plan to tackle pollution in the region. Rai asserted that over 69% of pollution in the city was due to sources in NCR towns or neighbouring states, while only 30% was generated locally. He cited a study conducted by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) based on data from ministry of earth sciences’ IITM, which had analysed per hour data of SAFAR to understand the sources of pollution. The minister said Delhi government had taken enough measures to control the local sources, adding that the study had shown reduction in pollution in the city. He further stated that Delhi government was taking a number of steps, from anti-dust to “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaigns, to control internal pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityCSE analysed data from IITM's Decision Support System between October 29 and November 8, which found that biomass burning contributed to 14.5% of the overall PM2.5, while the NCR districts added about 54.5%. Delhi’s local sources contributed 31% to the finer pollutants. The study also pointed out that transport was the biggest contributor of local emissions, followed by residential emissions, construction, industries, etc. “The contribution comes from 19 NCR districts as well as biomass burning in the neighbouring states. From November 2 to 6, the contribution of NCR dominated in the initial phase going till 70-80%, but its share declined during the smog episode post Diwali when contribution of Delhi’s own sources increased. Similarly, the contribution of biomass burning from other states remained low in the pre-Diwali phase, but peaked post Diwali,” the CSE study found. Citing a similar Teri study of 2016, Rai said while Delhi was doing its bid to control pollution, others must also join in. This study showed that 64% of pollution was due to external sources and 36% was because of Delhi’s internal sources. “Residents of Delhi can’t reduce the 69% external sources of emission. That’s why I’m requesting the Union minister to call a joint meeting of environment ministers from Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh,” Rai said. Alleging that construction activities were going on unabated in the neighbouring states, Rai pointed out that Delhi government had taken a slew of measures, like providing 24-hour electricity to reduce dependency on diesel generator sets, banning the entry of trucks, among others, till November 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-30-of-city-pollution-of-its-own-making-rai/articleshow/87788214.cms||---

The special drive, which began on Tuesday, concluded on Thursday. City police said the drive was held to find out buses which indulge in racing with each other and those who ply violating norms. The special drive by the city police commissionerate was held in collaboration with the motor vehicles department. City police in a statement said that the drive was held considering the rise in complaints by passengers. The rise in number of accidents due to the competition between private buses also led to the special drive. Police also said in the statement that due to the rash driving of private buses, other vehicles couldn’t travel safely through the roads. TOI had the other day reported about the rise in complaints against rash driving by private buses. Police said that cases were registered against private buses for driving rashly. Deputy commissioner of police, Kochi City, Aishwarya Dongre said that the police will ensure a situation in which commuters can safely travel in private buses and that the licences of conductors who misbehave with passengers would be suspended. The officer added that stricter action including revoking of permit would be taken against private buses if they are found to be in violation of the law. Police said they have got complaints about private bus staff not wearing proper uniform and about misbehaviour towards passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/281-cases-against-private-buses/articleshow/87787518.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa’s demand for power will double in next 15 years: Teri||PANAJI: The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) has said that power demand in Goa has increased steadily over the past six years, and is expected to double over the next decade and a half. The per capita consumption of power in Goa is almost double the national average, Teri found in a recent study. The institute added that despite achieving 100% electrification, various challenges continue to hamper the state’s efforts in ensuring 24x7 supply to all citizens.  The institute stated that it is important not only to meet the ever-growing demand for power, but also to progressively increase the share of renewable energy (RE) to achieve overall energy security. In the detailed study to identify strategies for ‘greening the sector and improving the reliability of power supply’, it said it was also important to meet the renewable purchase obligation as per the target fixed by the joint electricity regulatory commission (JERC) from time to time. TERI also identified strategies to ensure reliable power supply, which include deployment of smart grid technologies for peak load and outage management, promotion of consumer-side demand management interventions, upgradation and augmentation of transmission and distribution networks, and increasing local generation through renewable energy sources. “The importance of reliable power for a growing economy cannot be overemphasised, as the economy is becoming more and more dependent on electricity for everything,” said TERI associate director Narayankumar Sreekumar. “This study suggests a way forward for increasing the quality and reliability of power supply and greening the power sector for the state of Goa, which will be of immense value to policymakers in establishing the need for additional investments and identifying the appropriate mix of resources to meet the growing power demand of the state.” Important demand-side management measures include accelerated adoption of energy-efficient appliances among consumers, and carrying out comprehensive load research and integrated resource planning studies from time to time. It is also crucial to ensure grid modernisation utilising smart grid technologies as a fault-proof efficient distribution network for maintaining reliable power supply, the study states. There is a need for a long-term strategy based on cost-effectiveness and availability for increasing the ‘green’ energy share in the supply mix, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-demand-for-power-will-double-in-next-15-years-teri/articleshow/87788208.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The woman had met with an accident on November 11 and her condition kept on deteriorating. Rutvi Barot suffered an accident while returning home from gym in Karelibaug area of the city as the scooter she was driving collided with a truck. Rutvi was rushed to the SSG Hospital (SSGH) for treatment and from there she was taken to the Sterling Hospital. She lapsed into a coma and her lungs as well as heart were damaged badly. With no neurological improvement, chances of her survival became very slim. The doctors explained the grim situation to her relatives and also suggested that her organs could be donated. Former corporator and Rutvi’s uncle Ketan Brahmbhatt said that Rutvi had discussed organ donation with her father Manoj Rao a few days before she suffered the fatal accident. “The organs of a cousin of hers were also donated after he died in a railway accident,” said Brahmbhatt. The doctors did not find the lungs and heart fit for transplantation. The other organs are expected to save the lives of three or four persons. A green corridor was created by the police to ensure speedy transportation of the organs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/24-yr-old-dentists-kidneys-liver-donated/articleshow/87787259.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana will enforce odd-even traffic rule in four NCR districts||Gurgaon: The Haryana government on Tuesday decided to impose from next week the odd-even rule for vehicles in four NCR districts of the state — Gurgaon, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonipat. At an emergency meeting convened by additional chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal, it was also decided that government employees in 14 NCR districts of the state would work from home till November 22. Private establishments were asked to do the same. Industries, where such an arrangement is not possible, will have to take a special permission from the deputy commissioner. In the four NCR districts, work from home had anyway been advised till November 17. On Tuesday, officials attending the meeting with Kaushal decided to extend it to all 14 NCR districts till November 22. These 14 districts are Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat. Officials said the idea behind encouraging the work from home concept was to ensure there were fewer vehicles on the roads. “The transport department should implement the odd-even policy in at least four districts on a trial basis from next week. There will, however, be no restrictions on CNG vehicles,” an official said, quoting from the minutes of the meeting. Air quality across NCR has deteriorated to alarming levels. On Saturday, the Supreme Court took cognisance of the foul air quality in the region and directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent steps to reduce AQI levels, asking “how will people breathe?” Apart from the restrictions, the government also decided to fine heavy vehicles that are found carrying construction material uncovered. Vehicles once challaned will not be allowed to move until the amount is paid. A drive is also being planned to phase out vehicles that are more than 15 (petrol) and 10 (diesel) years old. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said he would implement all the decisions taken at the meeting on Tuesday. “Decisions on mitigating pollution are being taken by the higher authorities. We will implement the odd-even rule in keeping with the rule. Now that most people are working from home, it should not be too difficult to implement the scheme,” he added. The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM), meanwhile, carried out a meeting with representatives of Haryana and other NCR states on Tuesday to discuss the action plan on how to jointly deal with the deteriorating air quality. “We are preparing a short affidavit on the action we have undertaken and what we plan to do. We will submit the affidavit to the Supreme Court and CAQM. We have included all the decisions that were taken at the meeting, such as the implementation of the odd-even scheme and extension of work from home,” said S. Narayana, a member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). However, many HSPCB officials hoped that the AQI would improve again after reaching the “severe” levels. “Our AQI has improved from severe to very poor. We are hopeful that it will improve further if construction activities are stopped completely. AQI, however, depends on meteorological conditions as well. In addition to the restrictions, the weather conditions should also be by our side,” said Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer at HSPCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-will-enforce-odd-even-traffic-rule-in-four-ncr-districts/articleshow/87746633.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Delhi||That morning stroll in Delhi may do you more harm than good||NEW DELHI: Outdoor activities, including walks, should be avoided till 10am in the winter season. Reason: an analysis by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, found the PM2.5 level peaking between midnight and 10am. Experts said the calm wind, low night temperatures and low mixing layer height in this period cause accumulation of pollutants. The SAFAR analysis the hours between 2pm and 6pm, though also polluted, are relatively better than in the morning. According to SAFAR, the average hourly PM2.5 concentration at midnight in the days between November 12 and 17 was 246 micrograms per cubic metre. This rose to 304 micrograms per cubic metre by 11am, but reduced to 158 micrograms per cubic metre by 2pm and further to 128 micrograms per cubic metre by 4pm. It then climbed to 158 micrograms per cubic metre by 6pm and continued to rise further into the night. The SAFAR analysis is based on the average hourly PM2.5 concentration. This should not be confused with the 24-hour average PM2.5 readings. Gufran Beig, SAFAR’s founder-project director, said, “People should limit their outdoor activities during the peak hours of PM2.5 concentration. The period during the afternoon and evening is polluted, but relatively better than the peak hours.” Confirming this, Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said that over the past few days, PM2.5 levels were peaking in the evening and morning hours in Delhi due to relatively calm winds around those times. “Faster surface winds favour pollution dispersion, but relatively calmer winds impede their dispersal,” she said. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, explained, “The inversion conditions deepen during the night which intensifies trapping of pollutants. Due to cool, calm and stable atmospheric conditions, air cannot rise high enough for effective mixing and dispersion.” She added, “A relative improvement in the atmospheric conditions during the day allows better dispersion of pollutants. This is the reason why we see comparatively lesser buildup of pollution in the afternoons in winter.” Experts said exposure to high PM2.5 concentration can be harmful. Arun Sharma, who was earlier with University College of Medical Sciences and is currently director of ICMR-NIIRNCD, Jodhpur, said, “If a person with healthy lungs inhales large quantities of PM2.5, the small pollutant particles go past the windpipe and get deposited in the lungs. These toxic elements can cause difficulty in breathing. If the particles get deposited in the eyes, it causes itchiness and watery eyes.” Sharma cautioned that exposure to PM2.5 for a longer duration of around eight hours every day would allow particulate matter to get deposited in the lungs in a progressive manner and damage the lungs. “Besides, long exposure to PM2.5 can aggravate the health condition of people suffering from asthma and other lung diseases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/that-morning-stroll-may-do-you-more-harm-than-good/articleshow/87788231.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Nagpur||Nagpur power plants making water toxic: Study||NAGPUR: At a time when India has objected to coal ‘phase out’ at the recently concluded United Nations meet COP26, an in-depth investigation of the country’s two major coal-fired power plants has revealed that villagers living around their periphery are drinking and using highly contaminated water, with toxic elements exceeding the safe limit by 10-15 times. The two power plants found to be a threat for public health are Maharashtra State Power Generation Company’s (Mahagenco) Khaparkheda and Koradi thermal power plants. Both the power plants are in Nagpur district. Carried out by Nagpur’s Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) and Pune’s Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt. Ltd, the study found surface and ground waters contaminated with toxic metals like mercury, arsenic, aluminium, lithium and also recorded widespread contamination of air, water and soil due to unscientific disposal and handling of fly ash. The study — ‘Polluted Power: How Koradi And Khaperkheda Thermal Power Stations are impacting the environment’ — highlighted that the power stations and their ash ponds were discharging effluents directly into local streams and rivers including the Kolar and Kanhan. During the investigations, water samples were collected from 25 locations including surface and groundwater. “Almost every water sample, in every season including monsoon, failed to pass the standards set for drinking water by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the IS 10500:2012 (acceptable limits) and other relevant standards. Several water samples and dangerous elements like mercury which is is among the most toxic substances known to mankind and arsenic that can cause cancers of liver and bladder,” the study stated. The analysis further found presence of high level of turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in both surface and groundwater sources. Apart from this, antimony, aluminium, arsenic, boron, fluoride, iron, manganese, magnesium, mercury, molybdenum, lithium, lead, and selenium were found in dangerous quantities. The biggest concern is that contaminated ground and surface water is being used by local communities extensively, for all purposes including drinking (with and without treatment), domestic use, bathing, washing clothes, fishing, irrigation and for cattle. High levels of aluminium, boron, fluoride magnesium and lead in water used for drinking or domestic use has been known to cause serious health hazards like cancer, respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular disorders, according to inverventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat. “Short-term exposure to antimony in drinking water at extremely high concentrations (more than 30 mg/L) can produce nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Molybdenum concentrations in finished water can reach 200 g/litre in regions near molybdenum mining activities,” he said. Dr Arbat added that as per findings, high molybdenum consumption (10–15 mg/day) is linked to a “high incidence of gout-like illness, joint aches in the legs and hands, enlargement of the liver, gastrointestinal, liver, and renal diseases, increased blood levels of molybdenum and uric acid, increased xanthine oxidase activity, reduced blood levels of copper, and increased urine copper were all symptoms of the condition”. A questionnaire-based survey, which was also a part of this study, revealed that out of 21 villages surveyed, 18 are being affected due to fly ash depositing in various parts of the village. It also found that airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollution. “We initiated this study together given the long history of pollution due to these power plants and their related infrastructure like ash ponds and the complete failure of official agencies in addressing the problem,” said Leena Buddhe, director of CFSD and a co-author of the study. Shripad Dharmadhikary, co-author of the study and coordinator of Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said, “Till now, air pollution due to the plants had received some attention, but detailed analysis of water pollution was not available. Our study is probably the first such attempt to comprehensively map out the water contamination due to these power plants,” he said. WHAT THE STUDY FOUND - Villagers living near Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants drinking and using highly contaminated water - Toxic elements exceeding safe limit by 10-15 times - Contaminated water being used by villagers for drinking purpose too, major threat to public health - Doctors warn it can cause severe health ailments - Airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollution||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/villages-around-nagpur-drinking-heavy-metal-contaminated-water-due-to-pollution-from-koradi-khaparkheda-power-plants-study/articleshow/87787519.cms||Manka Behl

The corporation authorities couldn’t even complete the amendments in the street vending bylaw which they presented in the council a couple of months ago. Though the corporation authorities have been discussing the issue of fixing street vending zones and rehabilitating the vendors for more than five years, what the rulers could do in this regard so far is just completing the registration of the vendors. “After completing the registration, we have issued ID cards to more than 700 vendors. We have prepared a draft on the vending zones. It is up to the town planning committee to give final shape to it,” mayor M Anilkumar said. “The committee had been headless for some time. Now, a new chairman has been elected to head the standing committee. So, we will be taking measures to abide by the court order,” Anil Kumar said. Though the corporation presented street vending bylaw at the council, many of the members suggested changes in it. “So, a threemember committee comprising councillors Priya Prashanth, V K Minimol and P S Viju were authorized to make amendments in the bylaw. It is learnt that there required comprehensive changes in the bylaw. Now, amended bylaw should be considered by the town planning standing committee. The standing committee, with its suggestions, should place it before the council for detailed discussion and approval,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader, Kochi corporation. Unregulated street vending is causing hardships to pedestrians and the public. “Though street vending is a means of livelihood for hundreds, it causes problems for many. Pedestrians, especially aged, have to walk through the busy roads as footpaths are being occupied by the vendors. The authorities should take urgent steps for rehabilitating the vendors to street vending zone,” said T N Prathapan, an RTI activist. “I have lodged complaint before the state human rights commission seeking justice to the pedestrians,” he said. Meanwhile, there is a lobby which runs street vending stalls using benamis. “There are many genuine street vendors. At the same time, there are some people who own several street vending stalls. They would either deploy other persons to run the stalls offering salaries or would rent out such stalls,” said Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi president K S Dileep Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-yet-to-fix-vending-zones-for-street-vendors/articleshow/87787526.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Hyderabad||P Venkatrama Reddy still IAS officer, can’t contest MLC poll: PIL||HYDERABAD: A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court on Thursday challenging the acceptance of the resignation of P Venkatrama Reddy, who quit as an IAS officer recently, and requesting the court to issue a direction to the election authority to reject his nomination papers for the ensuing MLC polls.  The PIL, filed by J Shankar, an unemployed youth from Jagtial district, and R Subender Singh, a research scholar from Sangareddy, stated the IAS officer cannot be considered a free citizen to contest polls till his resignation is accepted by Union government The petitioners questioned the competence of the chief secretary to accept the resignation of the collector. Though senior counsel S Satyam Reddy made a mention before the court to take up the matter as a lunch motion, the HC declined to do so and asked him to first file the petition and come through the regular procedure. The petitioners said the Centre was the competent authority to relieve all India service officers. The resignation or voluntary retirement of an IAS officer was governed by Rule 5 of the All India Services (death cum retirement benefit) Rules, 1958, they said. They said that the state has to forward the resignation to the central government along with a vigilance report and a no dues certificate. The resignation cannot be accepted if the officer was under suspension, or in pending disciplinary proceedings. “The authorities have to verify whether accepting the resignation is in the public interest or not. The officer has to give the Centre three-month notice before resigning. Hence, it has to go to the Centre through the state,” the PIL said. In this case, the collector attended duties on November 14 and forwarded his resignation. It was accepted by the chief secretary on same day. On November 15, TRS chose him as its nominee for MLC seat and on the next day he filed his nomination, they said. A government servant cannot contest polls and, as on the date of nomination, he continued to be a government employee, and his nomination cannot be considered as valid, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/venkatrama-still-ias-officer-cant-contest-mlc-poll-pil/articleshow/87788219.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pocso court rejects plea to recall 12-year-old||MUMBAI: Dismissing the defence plea to recall a now 12-year-old girl, victim in a sexual harassment case, a special Pocso court recently held that the right of the accused has to be balanced with the act in the interest of the child, so that she does not have to relive the trauma by repeated testimonies. The child had completed her deposition against the 23-year-old deaf and mute accused in 2019. However, the defence wanted her back in court “to confront her with her statement given to the magistrate.” It said that this had to be done to bring out contradiction, omissions and improvements between the statements. While an opportunity was given to the defence in April, the lawyer did not turn up as he had a “cold”. “Though the application for recalling of the victim was allowed previously and the opportunity was granted to the accused, the accused failed to avail the opportunity... only a vague statement is made about the illness (of the lawyer) without any supporting evidence for the same. Therefore, the accused cannot claim that his right to fair trial has been extinguished,” the Pocso court said. The accused has been out on bail since April 2018. The accused lived in the child’s neighbourhood. The FIR was lodged in 2016. The court said that in March after the application to recall the child was allowed, it was informed that she was now in Surat. The court directed her to appear virtually. It further said that on April 8 the child was present virtually through WhatsApp from Surat for her cross-examination. However, the accused and his advocate were absent. The court noted that on the same day, the investigating officer had also come from Pune but had to go back without any progress in the case.  It said that from April 21 to October 4, the accused and his lawyer remained absent. Two days later they moved a plea for recalling the witness. The prosecution opposed the application and submitted that it was filed after six months without any reason. It submitted that the child should not be harassed by repeatedly calling her.

---||Goa||Goa frames rules to allow limited killing of wild boars||PANAJI: In a radical move, the state government has allowed site-specific culling of wild boars in private cultivated lands, after due assessment and authorisation by forest department officials. While the notification has brought smiles to the faces of farmers who complain about crop damage, it has evoked howls of protest from activists, who allege the tool could be misused and “will only hasten extinction of human species and all life forms”. For years, Goa’s farmers have been demanding that wild boar, peacock and bison be declared as vermin, alleging huge losses to crops. The notification authorises deputy conservators of forests for North and South Goa, who are wildlife wardens, to permit controlled killing of wild boars based on farmers’ complaints. Chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar said that both officials have been delegated powers to issue permits for hunting the wild animal after a site visit by the range forest officer (RFO), along with the farmer and a village panchayat member, and a requisite panchanama. “No permission will be granted for hunting of wild pigs in any protected area or government forest area. No permission will be granted for removal of squeaker and juvenile,” the order states. In turn, the RFO will submit a detailed report, if the culling is warranted, to the wildlife warden, seeking his permission. The permission — which will be accorded to experienced shooters — will be for a specific period, will be site-specific, and non-transferable. The animal carcass will be government property, and its disposal will be as per provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, for scheduled animals, and any breach will invite penal action. “No part of the removed wild animal like meat, skin, tushes, trophy, etc, will be consumed, possessed or displayed by any person,” the order states. The government’s move has upset activists and wildlifers, who blamed the forest department for wildlife conflicts. “The forest department has proven yet again that it is the biggest enemy of forests and wildlife, as well as the local population,” said activist Abhijit Prabhudesai. The department has failed to identify almost half of Goa’s forests till date, and reduced eco-sensitive zones of wildlife sanctuaries from 10km to 1km, he said. “It has also allowed large-scale mining in the western ghats, massive infrastructure projects crisscrossing the state and industries, airports, real estate and large institutions in forests and on plateaus,” Prabhudesai said. Another wildlife enthusiast, Edward Rodricks, a former honorary wildlife warden, said that the state has enacted many laws, but they are not always implemented and can be misused. “By shooting these animals, we will soon be exterminating them. How can we let other offenders off the hook — those who have destroyed forests, animal habitats and the fragile environments for sheer greed?” he asked He said the farmers should erect infrastructure to guard their crops. “There are means like making loud noises or bursting crackers to drive away wild animals. But farmers leave their fields unguarded,” Rodricks said. Prabhudesai said that restoring forests is crucial to solve wildlife conflicts and our children’s survival. “We have to restore and return the forests and plateaus to them and local communities after stopping all destructive activities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-frames-rules-to-allow-limited-killing-of-wild-boars/articleshow/87788213.cms||Paul Fernandes

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought a response from the government while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by S Ramesh Kumar, an advocate from Sivaganga district. The petitioner stated that Spices Park in Sivaganga was established in 2013 by the Union ministry of commerce and industry in order to facilitate the processing and to improve the quality of spices such as turmeric and chilli in the region. The park in Sivaganga was the fifth of its kind established in the country. He stated that the park is fully equipped with all the infrastructure facilities. However, even after eight years the same was not functioning. As per information obtained through RTI, he learnt that there was a delay in the functioning of the Spices Park, due to lack of permission from the directorate of the town and country planning. He further stated that though the Spices Board has sent a requisition letter in September to the directorate of town and country planning seeking to grant permission for the functioning of the park, no steps were taken. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/petition-in-hc-seeks-nod-for-spices-park-in-sivaganga-district/articleshow/87788226.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan observed that the column cannot be filled up after posing a formal question to the arrestee. The duty doctor must observe independently and gather inputs from the arrestee’s next friend or relative. The judge observed that psychiatric ailments are ticking bombs. They lie beneath the surface. Unless they manifest themselves in a concrete manner in the behaviour and conduct of the patient, one is hardly aware of it. “Time has come to conduct awareness programmes in police training academies and judicial academies to sensitize the officers concerned,” observed the judge. Suggesting that every police officer and judge should read Jerry Pinto’s ‘A Book of Light : When a Loved One Has a Different Mind’ and should also watch the film ‘A Beautiful Mind’, the judge observed that only then one will understand about depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. “The expression ‘reason to believe’ warrants a purposive construction... The police officer is obliged to undertake a basic enquiry. He has to find out from the person on whom the intimation of arrest is served as to whether the accused is a normal person,” observed the judge. The duty doctor examining the accused must satisfy himself that the arrestee is not suffering from any mental illness before certifying that he is fit for remand. The remanding magistrate is under an equal obligation. The court made these observations while hearing a plea moved by a woman seeking transfer of her husband suffering from bipolar disorder from the Tuticorin government hospital to the Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital. The petitioner’s husband was arrayed as an accused in a usury case. The judge took note of the fact that the police officials and the doctor who examined him before remand were not aware of his medical condition. Taking into account that the facilities at the Tuticorin government hospital were not sufficient, the judge directed the authorities to take immediate steps to shift the man to Tirunelveli MCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/revise-protocol-for-health-screening-of-arrestees-hc/articleshow/87788220.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Madras high court directs PWD to free Trichy channel of encroachments||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Thursday directed the public works department (PWD) to inspect and remove the encroachments made in a water channel on the stretch between Melasaveriyarpuram village and Uyyakondan river in Trichy district. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan also directed the authorities to file a detailed report along with a sketch indicating that the work has been completed. The court passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by M Periyaswamy, a farmer and a resident of Trichy district. In his petition, Periyaswamy stated that the flow of Cauvery river which is a major source of water for agricultural activities is divided in many places for irrigation purposes. One such water channel flows for nearly 12km from Thayanur village to Santhapuram village in Srirangam taluk. The water in the channel finally flows into the Uyyakondan river. He stated that the farmers of eight villages depend on the water from the channel for irrigation purposes. However, several encroachments inside the channel over the years has reduced its width. He stated that earlier this year, the PWD officials carried out the works of removing the encroachments in the channel till Melasaveriyarpuram village, however they did not continue the work in the remaining stretch. Despite submitting several representations to remove the encroachments in the remaining stretch, no steps were taken so far. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to the authorities to survey and remove the encroachments to ensure the free flow of water for irrigation purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-pwd-to-free-trichy-channel-of-encroachments/articleshow/87788223.cms||---

On Thursday, the court also granted bail to the 21-year-old woman, Simran Verma, who was arrested in the case. Police arrested Himanshu Devkate (22), a Nagpur resident, who has a previous offence of outraging the modesty of a woman registered against him at the Marine Drive police. Police said they found a Rolex watch, stamp of Maharashtra government, several debit cards, a visiting card of Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa high court and various other cards from his possession. Advocate Sunil Pandey for Simran Verma argued that she is innocent and only an employee of the accused who has been falsely implicated in the crime. The case pertains to a complaint lodged by Rahul Bokadia, who runs an electronic shop on Lamington Road. Bokadia stated that on November 8, he received a call from an unknown person, who identified himself as advocate Himanshu from Himanshu and Associate law firm and placed an order for a laptop and a mobile phone. Himanshu agreed to pay the quoted price of Rs 2.4 lakh for the purchase of the gadgets. Later, Himanshu sent Bokadia a fabricated screenshot of the payment and asked for the mobile and laptop to be urgently delivered to his office address — Sagar Mahal near Sydenham College in Churchgate. But when Bokadia called up Himanshu to inform him that he was sending the goods, Himanshu said the office was closed and asked him to send the goods near Churchgate station. On reaching Churchgate station, when the delivery man called up Himanshu, he asked him to come to a burger shop nearby and deliver the goods to Simran. The next day, on realising that the money had not been credited, Bokadia sent his peon to Himanshu’s law firm at Churchgate and learnt that no such firm existed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-who-duped-electronic-shop-owner-held-his-employee-granted-bail/articleshow/87790117.cms||Ahmed Ali

Within six hours, the bedridden woman suffering from neuromuscular disease was vaccinated at home by the nearby Har Ghar Dastak team.The youth, an IT professional, told TOI that he was pleasantly surprised when the NMC team responded to his online concern. “I thought it will take a lot of time. The vaccination centre is just 200 metre from my home but my mom can’t go there. I am happy that the NMC team came and gave her the first dose,” said Kartik, adding that only his mother was left to take the jab in the family.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the NMC will vaccinate anyone, irrepective of the manner in which the demand is raised. “We are vaccinating individuals at home whenever they seek help on social media, over phone or through zone offices. The facility can be extended after November 30 for the second dose too,” he said.Civic officials said citizens shouldn’t delay their first dose any further as this is the best opportunity to get jabbed with all focus on complete coverage. They added that even citizens making phone calls are given response with the same zeal.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said this should have been the policy to reach out to everyone right from February but the demand-supply imbalance posed hurdles. “Such innovative ways will help clear decks for the booster doses of HCW, FLWs and high-risk individuals,” he said.Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said this is a very good mop-up strategy. “We are standing at a very critical point and need very high herd immunity. Many have taken the first dose while the second jab of many is remaining. This will impact where it must. This is wonderful,” he said.Dr Shinde said this drive is like pulse polio and this is how it should be. “This is a guarantee that vaccination is reaching everyone. Many people still avoid jabs worrying about long queues, registration, the time it will take and so on. So, if you call or tag NMC on social media and they respond,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tweet-tag-call-nmc-all-ears-to-vaccination-demand/articleshow/87787555.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

He also announced a slew of new projects under the Tito’s brand on the 50th anniversary of the club, which is on Friday, November 19. Talking to the media at Baga, Ricardo said, “We changed our mind about selling. We never sold. Talks were at an advanced stage with a buyer, but we decided to stay on and continue running Tito’s.” In late June, in a surprise move, Ricardo had announced in a social media post that “Tito’s has been sold” because of some problems with government departments, amongst other reasons. “We were overwhelmed with the messages of support and help we received from across Goa, India and abroad, and that made us decide to fight it out,” Ricardo said. On Thursday, Ricardo, along with brother David, announced that they’re now looking to expand their business operations. “We’re going to create a Goan company which will take on the world,” he said. The new projects include Tito’s Hotels, which has begun with two properties, with six more to be added soon, Tito’s Eats, a food-restaurant chain which starts on Friday, Tito’s Travel, a tour operator, and Tito’s Spirits, a alcohol and beverage company. They are also launching franchises of Club Tito’s and Tito’s Fashion. Talking about his entry into politics by contesting from Calangute at the upcoming assembly elections, Ricardo said he would have liked to, but the circumstances are not right at the moment and his family members are also opposed to his entering politics. “So, no politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/titos-will-not-be-sold-says-co-owner/articleshow/87788259.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thanks to the Maharashtra transport department, all the three regional transport offices — city, deputy RTO east and rural RTO — will receive two simulators each.Deputy transport commissioner Dinkar Manwar said that it will not be mandatory for an aspirant to pass the simulator test to go for the final driving test. The simulators will help the licence seekers to evaluate their driving skills before appearing for the final test.Manwar said it will provide training to the applicants on various aspects like basic driving skills on road, following traffic signals, use of accelerator, clutch, brake, steering, turns and speed limits. The training will also be useful for the applicants to learn how they should drive on different roads, timings like peak hours and about the movement of pedestrians among other important road safety aspects.Apart from three RTOs, 13 more offices in the state will get two simulators each. Similarly, 33 offices including Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Bhandara and Gondia will get one simulator each.The department is procuring 65 simulators from a Hyderabad firm at a cost of Rs3.90 crore.Manwar said all RTOs and deputy RTOs have been asked to identify the place for installation of simulators in their respective offices. The simulators will be operational within two months.“Besides, nodal officers from 50 offices across the state have also been selected for a special training programme,” he said.The move is part of the road safety initiative adopted by the state government. Figures of road accidents in the city had also revealed the involvement of four-wheelers have increased manifold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/before-seeking-licence-assess-your-driving-skills-on-simulators/articleshow/87787547.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Regulator moots another round of power tariff hike in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Setting the stage for yet another round of power tariff hike, Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) has directed Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to submit a tariff revision petition before Dec 31. It was in July 2019 that KSERC announced a power tariff hike in state and KSEB has not filed a revision petition since then because the government did not want a revision for political reasons. The new multi-year tariff, for five years, will come into effect on April 1, 2022. Sources hinted that KSERC may even concede an overall hike of 10%, depending on how craftily KSEB prepares the tariff revision petition. KSEB said it would take an appropriate decision after diligently going through the new tariff regulations. How much hike KSEB would seek would depend on various factors, including the fresh financial commitment brought out by the recent pay revision. Meanwhile, power minister K Krishnankutty said on Thursday that there were no plans to increase the tariff. “Though a proposal to introduce higher tariffs for energy used during the peak hours (6pm to 10pm), KSEB is yet to take a call on the same. The proposal is aimed at reducing power consumption in peak hours, rather than eking out more money from it,” he said. At the same time, KSERC has dropped several key recommendations it made in the draft regulations for determination of power tariff. The new regulation notified by the commission in Nov 2021 has dropped the recommendations that endorsed the demand for different tariff structure for distribution licensees under KSEB. The board had strongly opposed the recommendation on the ground that it would adversely affect its financial position. It also scrapped the suggestion that excess power should be made available to open access consumers at power exchange price. If the control period for the earlier tariff was two years, the new tariff determination regulation has set it for five years. This can even go beyond five years, if deemed appropriate by KSERC. The new tariff would be applicable from April 1, 2022 to March 1, 2027. But, there will be a mid-term performance review in 2024-25 – based on the truing up figures for 2022-23 and 2023-24 – and KSEB’s annual performance review (till Sept 2024). It also stipulates that one-third of KSEB’s financial gains be transferred to consumers as rebate in tariff. But, the aggregate loss to the utility can’t be passed onto consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/regulator-moots-another-round-of-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/87787550.cms||---
---||Kochi||After four decades, Idukki dam opened thrice in a year||IDUKKI: The shutters of Cheruthoni dam of the Idukki reservoir have been opened thrice within a year now as part of anticipatory floodcontrol measures. As per the KSEB dam safety wing data, the dam was opened four times in the 1981 period within a month for an experimental purpose. After increased inflow to the Idukki reservoir, the shutter number 3 of the Cheruthoni dam was opened at 10am on Thursday. The shutter has been raised to 40cm and 40 cumecs of water is being released. According to KSEB officials, the shutter was opened to regulate the water level as it was nearing the upper rule level of 2,400.03ft. The water level reached 2,399.44ft at 9am. The water level in the Idukki reservoir was at the red alert level for the past two days. The full reservoir level is 2,403ft. There was a storage of 95.74% on Thursday, which was 88.86% on the same day last year. After opening the shutter of Cheruthoni dam, the water level in Idukki continued to increase and it reached 2,399.46 ft at 5pm. In 1981, the dam shutters were kept opened initially from October 29, to November 5. The shutters were closed on October 31 and opened again on November 1 and released an amount of 23.42mcm of water. “The dam was opened again on November 10 and closed on November 12. It was opened again on November 14 and closed the same day. The longest opening of the dam was in 2018 when a total amount of 1,069.29 mcm water was released within 32 days,” said a KSEB dam safety official. KSEB advisory board member James Wilson said that the shutters of Cheruthoni were opened to strictly follow the rule curve. “After the central water commission fixed the revised rule curve, the KSEB rule committee decided to strictly follow the rule curve in Idukki and other major hydel dams. It was decided to ensure that the opening of shutters did not create any damage in the downstream areas of the dam,” he said. “The weather conditions and the water level of Mullaperiyar dam were also considered before the early opening of the shutters of Idukki. In addition, we strictly opened the shutters before the water reached the rule curve level,” said Wilson. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu opened four spillway shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam on Thursday morning after the water level reached the upper rule curve level of 141ft. Two shutters were closed by 10pm after the water level decreased to 140.90ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/after-four-decades-idukki-dam-opened-thrice-in-a-year/articleshow/87787561.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Residents come out with action plan to restore Vandiyur tank||MADURAI: Residents of K K Nagar and Gomathypuram have chalked out an action plan for the conservation and restoration of the Vandiyur tank which would solve the water woes of the wards in Madurai north and east constituencies. The action plan, which is to be submitted to the state government through the district administration in a few days, includes deepening and desilting the tank to its original capacity, planting native breeds of plants to strengthen the bund and establishment of a sewage treatment plant on the western end where corporation sewage flows into it through the Athikulam channel. President of the Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar residents welfare association, D Raghavan said that the Vandiyur tank, one of the largest in Madurai, originally had a water spread area of 600 acres and had a command area of 1,000 acres. However, infrastructural encroachments on its banks on all sides, agricultural encroachments and invasive species have resulted in the area shrinking to 572 acres and the area under agriculture which depended on it now has just less than 100 acres. The water storage capacity of this tank was originally 107 mcft, but now it has shrunk to just 71 mcft, said Pandi, the secretary of the association. In 2012, the tank, which had held water throughout the year, became bone dry due to encroachment of its supply channels. As a result, the groundwater in the wards neighbouring this tank - Gomathypuram, Tahsildar Nagar, Vandiyur, K K Nagar, Anna Nagar, Anbu Nagar, Yagappa Nagar and Melamadai - went down to as low as 600 feet below the ground level. Many resident welfare associations joined hands with the Walkers Club and formed the Federation for the Vandiyur Tank Development in 2013. Raghavan said that every year they have to cough up nearly Rs 2 lakh to clean the 30th sluice of the Periyar 9th main channel which brings water to the tank from Vaigai river. “If the PWD can undertake stone wall pitching of this channel to a distance of 1,350m, it would be solve a perennial problem,’’ he said. “Open defecation is rampant on the banks of the tank. Civc body should install mobile toilets,” said A A G Rajkumar, president of the Walkers Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-come-out-with-action-plan-to-restore-vandiyur-tank/articleshow/87788235.cms||---

Aliyar reservoir in Tamil Nadu is part of the inter-state Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) and Tamil Nadu has to issue two warnings before releasing the water so that people living along the river banks can take precautionary measures. The Tamil Nadu water resource department claimed it had informed about the release of water to its Kerala counterparts. Palakkad district disaster management authority (DDMA) in a statement here on Thursday said that there was no need for anxiety as the rivers were flowing below the danger levels. Chitturpuzha overflowed with Tamil Nadu releasing as much as 6,000cuscus of water on Wednesday night which was brought down to 2,500cuscus on Thursday. Chitturpuzha was in spate by Thursday early morning and waters entered several some houses at Thirunellayi. People living along the banks said no warning was issued about the opening of the dam shutters. Three councillors of Palakkad municipality blocked the road at Thiruvalathur to protest against the opening of the dam shutters without informing the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opening-of-aliyar-dam-sparks-panic/articleshow/87787573.cms||---

The district child welfare committee (CWC) has taken note of the dangerous travel by students following a video that has surfaced showing them not just on footboard but also by grabbing onto the ladder at the back of a bus.The viral video shared on various social media platforms showed six students with school bags on their backs climbing onto the ladder behind a TNSTC bus in Narimedu and clinging to it dangerously. Across Madurai, at various bus stops outside schools, children indulging in footboard travel have become a common sight after schools reopened for most classes. This is particularly rampant in cases of buses plying to and from the city’s outskirts like Alanganallur and Avaniyapuram as they are more crowded.“With buses crowded during peak hours now, especially for areas to which only few of them operate, children are forced to take the bus even if it means footboard travel. Even if we create awareness on its dangers, children will not stop travelling on footboard unless there is another solution for them to be on time,” said the headmaster of a government aided school.Bus drivers and conductors are also able to do little to prevent footboard travel effectively. They say that despite warnings, children continue the practice. “This can be resolved only if some alternative is arranged. Especially with free travel now allowed for school children, government TNSTC buses are jampacked during school hours on all routes. Steps must be taken to increase the number of buses or schools should be made to have different timings rather than all of them in peak hours,” said A Kanagasundar, Madurai district secretary of CITU.CWC members B Pandiaraja and L Shanmugam have written to the police, school education and transport department officials to ensure the safety of children and prevent such dangerous practice. “It was already brought to our notice when schools reopened for Class IX to XII. One accidental slip can cost the life of a child. All three department officials must work together to ensure the practice is stopped. We have also requested for more buses to be deployed for the welfare of students,” said Shanmugam. The CWC has sought a report in 15 days from district officials on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-back-to-dangling-footboard-travel/articleshow/87788249.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 2% on Thursday as wind direction was not favourable for transfer of pollutants. Track the pollution level in your cityStrong winds are likely to help in cleaning the air from Sunday and AQI may touch “poor” category, predicted Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi. Central Pollution Control Board’s data shows that AQI improved marginally on Thursday from Wednesday’s 375. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting agency, said the contribution of farm fires decreased to 2% from 6% on Wednesday. “AQI is likely to improve but remain in the same category for the next two days as transport-level winds are coming from the east direction, preventing intrusion of pollutants from the upwind region. From November 21, surface winds are likely to be strong, resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality,” said SAFAR. “The effective farm fire count is 773 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 is negligible,” it added. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature was recorded at 26.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, and the minimum, which dipped to 9.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, rose to 10.5 degrees, two notches below normal. India Meteorological Department has predicted shallow fog on Friday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-still-very-poor-but-relief-in-offing/articleshow/87788263.cms||---

Twentyone children in the age group of 8-13 also had a memorable meeting with Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu in Nellore in Andhra Pradesh. The tribal children, including eight girls, walked from Srisailam forest area to Muppavarapu farmers training centre of Swarana Bharati Trust in Nellore where they met the Vice-President on November 13. The walk, which began from Yerragondlapalem in Prakasam district on November 4, ended on November 17. Apart from the 21 tribal children, there were four other children and six elders who accompanied them on their marathon walk. While 20 children hailed from Nagarkurnool district in Telangana, one was from Mekalabanda in AP’s Kurnool district. The children are students of government schools. “We also had a car in which the children could rest after they completed their walk for the day before they would join the walk again. It was all about exposing the tribal children to the world outside of their tribal habitations,” said Children of the Forest founder Vamsidhar Kalidasu. The marathon walk was intended to inculcate in them sportsmanship so that they are exposed to the world of sports and also develop interest in them, he said. The walk was also for a cause. They were taken to a temple but the surroundings were littered with plastic and other waste materials. The children picked up and segregated one tonne of waste. A more challenging task was taken up by 18 Chenchu youth earlier this year who embarked on a 9,000-km cycle journey as an expedition to the Himalayas. However, they could not complete the expedition because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Jitendra Kakuste, the joint managing director of Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC), told TOI, “ACG capsules has purchased the plot and it has set a target to start manufacturing capsules in another year.” He said the plant will have a production capacity of 20 billion capsules per year and will generate 450 direct employment and a large number of indirect employment in Aurangabad. Sources said as ACG capsules have a presence in 138 countries, the company has plans to start manufacturing capsules and related articles meant for export. Authorities said of the 2200 acre of industrial land in Shendra, this plot has been purchased by the company in AURIC. Those privy to the development said the company has plans to expand the manufacturing plant in multiple phases in the near future. Of the 60 major plots that have been sold in the recent past, 17 plants have already started manufacturing, while construction work at several plots is underway. AURIC’s marketing manager Deepak Mulikar said Of the 10, 000 acre of industries being developed under AURIC, Shendra has 2200 acre, while Bidkin has 7800 acre. “Bidkin is being developed in three phases, of which, one phase sizing 2,500 acres has already been developed and investors are being invited for this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/worlds-leading-capsule-firm-plans-shendra-unit/articleshow/87786050.cms||Mohammed Akhef

In a meeting convened by the joint director of urban affairs on October 30, the city corporation presented a set of issues regarding the software. In response the Information Kerala Mission cited in the meeting that a report would be furnished on November 10. Seven days later, the city corporation has yet to receive a response from IKM. Even in the list of arrears being published across wards, tax dues are dated from the fiscal 2016-17. The status of tax payments before this period has remained a case of concern for the city corporation. The software allows assessment of tax only with effect from 2016-17. The software does not have an option to assess buildings based on annual rental value before this period. Unless the city corporation gets a way to assess and calculate dues based on the old system of tax assessment for buildings for the period before 2016-17, actual dues may still remain unclear. The city corporation had also sent a letter to the Information Kerala Mission on October 15, flagging glaring shortcomings in the IKM software. During the tenure of the previous council, the corporation had highlighted the issues and glitches in IKM software but to no avail. References to similar communications in the past had also been mentioned in the letter sent on October 15. While the corporation is updating records of around 4.5 lakh tax assessments and even though service cess is being calculated in the city corporation along with property tax for the past three years, the software has no facility to add service cess in buildings which were assessed before service cess came into effect. While merging the data base before 2016, the officials tried posting the tax for a whole year; however, the system would still reflect that of half a year, the letter sent to the IKM shows. It also lists out other technical glitches like delay, frequent instances of system snags which have delayed the process of data updation. As regarding relaxation of tax for ex-service men, the software has no provision to update the relaxation annually after scrutiny of necessary documents. The officials fear that even after undertaking a laborious task of updating tax data, the corporation would still face the predicament of dealing with irregularities unless the software is updated. Besides, in the absence of calculating dues with retrospective effect, defaulters will also find a way to evade the dues, the officials pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/software-issues-on-tax-data-updation-not-resolved-yet/articleshow/87766678.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolkata||After a decade, parking fees set to double in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Motorists may soon have to cough up twice the amount to park their cars at designated fee parking lots across the city. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is set to revise the parking fee structure after more than a decade to make it Rs 20 per hour instead of Rs 10 now for cars. For two-wheelers, the proposed parking fee is Rs 10 per hour instead of the current Rs 5. The KMC car parking department may soon notify the new fee structure that will be applicable from 7am to 10pm. The department had in April 2019 attempted a similar revision but then rolled it back under public pressure. On Wednesday, the proposal was mooted again and placed before the board of administrators for discussion. It was thereafter forwarded to an expert committee comprising senior civic officials and traffic police officers for deliberation. Though a formal decision will be taken after the expert committee gives its view, sources said it was likely to be passed this time as municipal commissioner Binod Kumar had himself advocated the need for a change in the fee structure in March. The reason cited for the fee hike is two-fold. While it will augment the revenue, KMC also hopes it will discourage some people to take out their cars on a regular basis, thereby putting less pressure on parking lots. More importantly, that would lead to less emission, and hence, reduce the air pollution. While appearing to be contadictory, even a 20% reduction in vehicles will lead to more revenue in the revised rate. Revenue from parking had been severely affected in the past 18 months due to the pandemic. While there were no vehicles on the road during the lockdown, even during the unlock period and subsequent restrictions during the second wave, there were fewer cars on the road. The parking department had also announced a waiver of the amount it collected from the parking agencies during the lockdown in 2020 as there were no earnings during this period. A section of car parking department officials said parking cooperatives who deploy attendants to collect the fees had been demanding a revision for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-a-decade-parking-fees-set-to-double/articleshow/87787582.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cellphone fight with mom ends in suicide||KOLKATA: A Class-X student of a Budge Budge school was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her room at Balurghata on Thursday after her mother had reportedly stopped her from taking her cellphone to school. The eldest among three siblings, the girl used to attend her online classes on her mother’s cellphone as the parents would leave the phone with her when they went out to work. However, since the physical classes began from Tuesday, the mother insisted on taking her cellphone to work and didn’t allow the girl to keep it with her any more. This apparently led to a bitter fight with her mother on Wednesday. The mother took away the cell phone from her on Wednesday and on Thursday she took the cellphone to her workplace. The 14-year-old girl was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room by her younger brother after both the parents had left their home. “My daughter had become addicted to the cellphone. As Madhyamik exam was due shortly and since the physical classes had begun, my wife had rebuked her on Wednesday for being hooked on to the cellphone and took it away from her. On Thursday, both of us had left for work by 6.15am. My son found her hanging around 7am,” said the father, who works at a local jute mill. The incident has brought to focus the dangers associated with over-dependence on electronic gadgets, which children had been forced into since the start of the pandemic. “It was pretty much expected that once the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions ease down, the dangers of over-reliance on digital media will turn out to be a serious concern and tackling the withdrawal symptoms will become a major challenge. The entire problem has been triggered by unrestrained screen addiction,” said child psychologist Devika De. Psychiatrist Siladitya Ray pointed out that the incident proves two things — how increased screen time along with phone addiction can create mental instability leading to impulsive behaviour and how modern technologies of distraction can tear apart the cohesive fabric of human society. “The most reliable way to tackle this crisis is to teach children and help them to develop an insight into the core issue that excessive screen time leads to addictive behaviour which eventually might go out of hand and generate frustration and disgruntlement. However, parents need to be patient, said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cellphone-fight-with-mom-ends-in-suicide/articleshow/87787589.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Pune||Experts don’t see Europe-like severe wave of Covid in India||PUNE: At a time when Delta is making up 99.5% of all genomic sequences worldwide, its emergence in India early in December 2020 and the breakneck speed with which it ran through the dense population here over the next six months seems to have stalled the ‘severe’ wave that Europe is currently experiencing, experts have said. Most of the current variants, including the AY.4.2 strain, are the offspring/descendants of the Delta variant, against which the Indian population is believed to have a fair amount of protection owing to wide exposure in the past. “The latest AY.4.2 strain comes from the lineage of Delta strain. It does not appear to pose major challenges,” leading epidemiologist Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said. Gangakhedkar is part of the World Health Organisation’s 26-member expert team to examine the origins of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. He is also Dr CG Pandit National Chair at ICMR. “The threat of a third wave, which was expected to be more severe, seems to have receded in India. If at all the third wave occurs, we are more likely to have only minor spikes in cases among the vulnerable and unvaccinated individuals,” Gangakhedkar said. After the initial Wuhan strain last year, the more infectious Delta strain spread much faster and infected a significantly large population in a short span of time during the second wave. High-seroprevalence of Delta variant in the community is also among the positive indicators. “The second wave in India was almost four times more widespread than the first wave, with a rapid rise and equally sharp fall. It left a large chunk of our population with immunity after recovery from natural infection as seen in latest serosurveys,” said senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. The high antibody level against the Delta variant seems to have acted as brakes. “The fact that India with high population density is likely to have reached an endemic status after widespread natural infection, can be substantiated when we compare the current surge in cases in the European countries. These nations with a fairly high vaccination coverage are experiencing peaks, while infections in India are plummeting,” Banerjee said. Nevertheless, virologists are closely watching the evolution of the Delta and other variants. Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology’s (ICMR-NIV) senior scientist Pragya Yadav said, “Immune-mediated mechanism (waning immunity) or viral evolution for immune escape is unlikely to drive a severe third wave unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed. Likewise, a new more transmissible variant will have to exceed a high threshold of Rnaught (R0) value (average virus spreadability value) to cause the third wave on its own, which seems unlikely as of now.” The experts, however, have underscored that the duration of protection of the natural and vaccine-induced immunity and the emergence of any immunity-evading variant will determine the nature of the future covid waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-dont-see-europe-like-severe-wave-of-covid-in-india/articleshow/87787588.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The order was issued after Anupama, who has accused her parents of giving out her baby for adoption to the council without her consent, claimed that the child was hers. After the government informed the court about the claims of Anupama over the child, the court had directed the council and child welfare committee to take steps for conducting the DNA test of the child. Reacting to the latest development, Anupama, who is staging a protest in front of the welfare council, said she was happy about the order, but would continue the stir till she gets her baby back. “The order says the child would be brought back to Kerala in five days for the DNA test. The district child protection officer would be the custodian of the baby till the DNA test is over. The child would be housed in a government facility is what I assume,” she said. The child would be brought from Andhra under police protection. “Getting back my child is one of the most important demands I have raised. But there are other important problems that need attention. It includes action against the authorities who failed to do justice. My fight would continue until all those responsible for the forced adoption of my child are punished,” Anupama said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cwc-orders-dna-test-on-child/articleshow/87787587.cms||---

According to the police, the accused, Jesu Antony Raj, is the second husband of Suja from Periyavilai in Kanyakumari district, mother of three children -- two daughters and a son. The couple got married after the death of Suja’s first husband and settled down at Kavalkinaru in Tirunelveli district. On Wednesday, Antony Raj’s 10-year-old stepdaughter, who had gone to a bakery, took a biscuit packet without paying for it. The bakery owner complained to Antony Raj about the incident. Angered by the girl’s action, he came home that night and gathered all the three children and poured kerosene on them and set them on fire, police said. On hearing the screams of the children, neighbours rushed in and extinguished the fire quickly. The boy and a girl escaped unharmed but the 10-year-old girl suffered burn injuries.  She was admitted to Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital, where Antony Raj was also admitted with minor injuries.

Protesting along with his cabinet colleagues, elected representatives and TRS functionaries at Indira Park, the CM thundered this was only a beginning and that his party would take the lead against ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the Centre as and when required. KCR, who led the separate Telangana statehood movement for 13 years staging dharnas/rasta rokos and addressing scores of public rallies, was trenchant in his criticism of the Centre at the ‘maha dharna’. “Started the battle because the farming community is suffering due to the Centre’s policies,” the CM said. During his 40-minute long speech, the CM announced he would fight for the cause of the farmers till the last drop of his blood. “This battle will not end today. If the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre does not procure 5 lakh metric tonnes of rice from last year’s rabi quota, we will dump it in the BJP office at Nampally,” he warned. The CM said the farming community in the entire country was beset with problems with farmers agitating on the borders of Delhi, but the Modi government was reluctant to change its policies. “We are asking only one straight question: Are you (Centre) going to procure paddy in the coming rabi season or not.” He recalled the state had stoutly opposed when the Centre insisted on fixing power meters to agriculture pump sets and borewells. “The central government has been harassing the state government for the last seven years by stopping loans and creating problems. Since Telangana is a new state, we have been very restrained. But, there is a limit to our patience,” he said. Gross injustice was done to Telangana after the BJP came to power at the Centre, the CM said. “Seven Telangana mandals were given to AP, they gave Sileru power plant to AP, they did not sanction tribal university, ITIR project and even Navodaya schools. Many resolutions like BC caste census, ST reservations and SC categorisation are still pending with the Centre,” KCR added. BOX CM hits out at BJP Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao hit out at the BJP alleging that it was busy ‘creating communal tensions’. “The BJP knows only how to encash on sentiments of people by creating communal tensions and raking up Bhainsa incident, Pakistan sentiment and surgical strikes during elections. BJP leaders even resort to character assassination by spreading lies on social media. Did people elect you for this? People also understand your dramas,” KCR said. The CM also said the parties that ruled the country all these decades have failed the country and because of their inefficiency, the country has been facing several problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-on-dharna-rips-centre-on-paddy-row/articleshow/87788928.cms||Koride Mahesh

Protesters also blocked the VC’s vehicle as he proceeded from his house to the varsity. Youth Congress staged a sit-in before the VC’s residence at 9am, locked the gate and chanted slogans alleging nepotism in varsity faculty appointment and that Varghese was not qualified for the post. Ravindran told the media that there were no violations of norms and that the varsity will proceed with the interview for the appointment of associate professor in Malayalam department. The same was held online during the day. Save Education Campaign Committee had alleged that Varghese lacked the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor that requires a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. The petition claimed that Varghese joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012 and while working there she had availed three years’ leave under FDP programme for completing her PhD.

---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s WPR down to 1%, testing up 31% compared to last week||PUNE: A 31% increase in Covid testing and 0.35% drop in weekly positivity rate were registered in the state in the seven-day period ending on November 17. Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) dipped to 1% from1.35% last week, stated the state public health department’s data. On the other hand, the weekly tests went up to 7.33 lakh in the state between November 11 and 17 from 5.6 lakh in the previous week — an increase of 1.73 lakh. Of these, more than 4.16 lakh were RTPCR tests and over 3.16 lakh tests were antigen tests. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said the dip in WPR was a good sign and most districts in the state were slowly inching towards the endemic stage. “Post-Diwali, the state’s WPR has decreased despite more relaxation in curbs. Still, we need to keep a close watch as most districts are reaching the endemic stage of Covid-19 and protocols should be followed strictly,” he said. A senior public health department official said, “Strict instructions were issued to local authorities conducting less than 1,000 tests weekly. Some of them were carrying out 500-600 tests each week. Six districts were pulled up and directed to scale up tests in a meeting.” Another official attributed the low testing in the previous week to shortage of staffers in many laboratories because it was the first week after the Diwali. Many did not even go for tests either, he felt. According to the recent data shared by the public health department, all districts had conducted over 1,000 tests in the November 11-17 week and WPR was dipping gradually in most districts. About 24 districts’ WPR was below 1%. With no fresh cases, Washim’s WPR was zero. Ten districts’ WPR was above 1%. Public health experts stressed on scaling up testing even if Covid cases continued to dip in the coming two weeks. Stating that it would be a good sign after all the curbs were lifted, one among them said, “Double-masking and increased vaccination is the way ahead.” Public health expert Dr R Jotkar said the testing should be scaled up and if WPR remained low , it would boost the confidence of planners to chalk out future strategy. “Testing volume should be scaled up where cases are comparatively higher,” said the expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-wpr-down-to-1-testing-up-31-compared-to-last-week/articleshow/87787602.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Jaipur||Parties should have power to disqualify MP/MLAs under anti-defection law: CP Joshi||JAIPUR: Assembly Speaker CP Joshi has advocated that the power to disqualify MPs and MLAs under the anti-defection law should also be given to political parties rather than limiting the power only for Lok Sabha and assembly speakers. He was speaking at the 82nd All India Presiding Officers' Conference held in Shimla. Joshi said if a member of the assembly, who wins the election on a ticket from a particular political party, is not behaving properly, then the party president should have the power to disqualify him/her under the anti-defection law because the party gives the MLA a ticket. But he said many of his colleagues do not agree with it. He appealed to the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to convene an all-party meeting to form a consensus on the issue. He argued that there are rules and regulations for a party member. If a party member does not behave, the party has the right to initiate action against that member. He said the party president should have the power to write to the election commission seeking disqualification of a member who won on a party ticket but violated party discipline. He said such a step would also help to discipline the members in the house. Joshi also said, “the Speaker often takes decisions influenced by the presidents of their respective parties. Therefore, we also need to introspect the role of the Speaker.” Citing an example, Joshi said if we look at the history from 1952 to 1967, the country was ruled by the Congress. But the more dominant personality than the president of the Congress party was Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parties-should-have-power-to-disqualify-mp/mlas-under-anti-defection-law-joshi/articleshow/87788274.cms||Joychen Joseph

Now, it is time for them to shift to the temporary shed built especially for them.” The fish vendors’ leader Caridade Pereira said, “We have been saying that nobody should be allowed to sell fish outside the market.

The school staff planted 60 areca trees four years ago, which are now yielding arecanuts. Fruits and medicinal plants have also been planted on the campus, that generate additional income for the school. The school is situated in a remote village in Bantwal, about 25 km from here. Its campus is spread over an acre. Due to the efforts of its teacher Bhaskar Naik M, the students actively participate in farming on campus. Half of the campus is covered with areca and fruit-yielding trees. Close to 150 varieties of trees, including medicinal plants, can be found on the school campus. Four years ago,class VII students had planted about 60 areca trees. “I am happy to say that this year they has started to yield arecanuts and we expect a good income,’’ said Bhaskar, a physical education teacher. He has been serving in the institution for the past three decades. Bhaskar added that his efforts have brought laurels to the school, as it has bagged the Green School Award or Hasiru Parisara Mitra Shale more than five times in the district. Farming activities are looked after by the students. The school has about 227 students studying from LKG to class VII. The profit earned from farming is utilised for school activities and for the development of the institution. Before the pandemic, the school campus used to grow vegetables, which were used for the midday meal programme. However, the land was lying unused due to the closure of schools owing to Covid-19. “The work done by Bhaskar is an inspiration for all of us, including the children, who love the environment and contribute towards preserving nature. He has turned our campus green. It has encouraged us to plant saplings and look after them,”said headmistress Umavathi N. The school has been there for 85 years. Umavathi said that most of the school infrastructure has got dilapidated, and that there is a need for a new building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-school-generates-income-through-farming/articleshow/87787545.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Aurangabad||Experts pitch for 4% education quota for 50 marginalised castes among Muslims||Aurangabad: Experts and researchers pitched for 4% reservation in education for 50 marginalised castes from the Muslim community while quoting statistics from different reports. Experts of the Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP), along with the Dua foundation, had gathered in Aurangabad on Thursday to highlight the need for reservation in education for the deprived sections of the Muslim community. During the meet, CDPP director and economist Amir Ullah Khan said that the PM’s dream of five trillion economy cannot be achieved by failing to bring women, who are over 49% of the population, and Muslims, who are 14% of the population, into the mainstream. He told TOI, “The data shows that Muslim representation is far below the acceptable level in the country. For positive GDP, merely doubling the production is not enough, there should be doubling of consumption by the citizens as well.” Speaking on the occasion, professor Venkatnarayana Motukurri showed reservations across the country and the background of each reservation. Tata Institute of Social Science’s prof Abdul Shaban, who joined the meeting from Paris, cited findings of different surveys by committees and commissions, and demanded implementation of the Mahmoodur Rehman Committee recommendations, including share of Muslim women in 33% reservation, minimum 8% reservation in state services as well as education, expansion of OBC list, inclusion of Dalit Muslims into scheduled caste. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said this is the first step towards bringing the community into the mainstream and contributing towards the overall development of the country. “To get what the Muslims deserve rightfully, we will not hesitate to take to the streets,” he said. Speaking on the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in Maharashtra, high court advocate Sagheer Khan said, “For similar offences, 47-57% Muslims, Dalits and scheduled tribes are failing to get bail, while the upper castes and influential people have bail rate of 97%.” While demanding substantive study on the issue, he said the disparity is either due to lack of resources or due to institutional bias. The experts also stated that various surveys and commissions have found that 83.2% Muslims in the state do not hold agricultural land, 56% of the Muslim population in Maharashtra does not hold any assets, while only 0.7% Muslim families have an annual income of over Rs 3.6 lakh per annum, and every third persone in prison is a Muslim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-pitch-for-4-education-quota-for-50-marginalised-castes-among-muslims/articleshow/87786074.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He said the investigation is essential to find the real perpetrators of the violence and to ascertain involvement of political parties, if any. “We not only condemn the violence, but also appeal for peace. There should be an inquiry to find out why and how the violence took place and whose dereliction it was,” said Owaisi. Answering a question on different civic bodies in Gujarat ordering the removal of non-vegetarian food stalls from streets, Owaisi said that it was an anti-poor move. “Not all the non-vegetarian people — Hindus or Muslims — can afford to go to lavish restaurants to eat non-vegetarian food. The decision to remove roadside non-vegetarian food stalls is anti-poor.” On the reservation issue, Owaisi said his party will take to the streets and reach out to people in each district in Maharashtra and raise the issues of reservation and wakf properties. Asking why the Maratha community has suddenly become silent ob reservation, Owaisi said: “If the Maratha community is willing come with us, we are ready to support them. We will demand reservation for the Muslims, whether people come with us or not,” he said. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said in the coming month, as a show of unity and strength, people from across Maharashtra will head to Mumbai to demand rightful reservation, which even the high court has favoured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/owaisi-condemns-violence-seeks-probe/articleshow/87786064.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Hyderabad||JNTU-Hyderabad nod must for new engineering courses, rules SC||HYDERABAD: Making it clear that Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, has the final say in approving new engineering courses or enhancing seats in Telangana, the Supreme Court on Thursday made it mandatory for several private engineering colleges in the state, including Hyderabad, to obtain affiliation from the university after meeting its set criteria. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and A Bopanna pronounced this order after hearing the appeal filed by JNTU registrar Dr M Manzoor Hussain, who challenged an interim direction given by Telangana high court ordering affiliation to all those colleges which had obtained permission from AICTE. JNTU-Hyderabad oversees technical education across Telangana. Several private engineering colleges, which have secured AICTE nod for an additional 2,500 seats in computer science engineering, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the Internet of things, etc, have to now submit themselves to the authority of JNTU-Hyderabad and prove their infra credentials. While the colleges were insisting that they should be given permission to go ahead because AICTE had permitted them, JNTU said that they have to first obtain a no objection certificate (NoC) from the state and the process of affiliation would start only after that. Senior counsel C S Vaidyanathan, defending the action of JNTU, said the state has to plan the educational facilities in a proportionate manner and it had a bounden-duty to prevent mushrooming of similar courses at one point and the university has the responsibility to grant affiliation to only those colleges that have the required infrastructure. As the state later accorded NoC to several colleges, the bench, however, recorded the assurance of JNTU that it would complete the inspections within 10 days. The bench, while staying the Telangana HC order, however, directed JNTU to place its reports before the HC after inspection. The HC would take decisions in respect of each of the colleges after verifying the inspection reports furnished by JNTU. The apex court observed that it kept in view the interests of the students already admitted this year, but made it clear that all the colleges have to go through inspection of JNTU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntu-nod-must-for-new-engg-courses-rules-sc/articleshow/87788940.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MSRTC to rope in 500 private buses to deal with strike||MUMBAI: With the workers’ indefinite strike continuing for the 22nd day, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) on Thursday decided to rope in 500 private buses along with drivers to cater to commuters stranded due to the agitation. The move comes amid reports of a 29-year-old MSRTC employee allegedly dying by suicide in Buldhana district. Vishal Ambalkar, a resident of Matargaon in Khamgaon taluka, had consumed poison at his house on Tuesday night. A senior MSRTC official told TOI, “We have floated a tender to invite private bus contractors to provide 500 buses on an urgent basis in the first phase along with drivers under a ‘wet lease’ model. These buses will cater to at least a lakh commuters in various districts across the state.” He further said that if the agitation continues for a longer time, the MSRTC will float more tenders to hire 500 to 1,000 additional private buses along with drivers in subsequent phases. Meanwhile, the talks with unions remained inconclusive on Thursday as the bus corporation’s treasury was hit hard with losses to the tune of over Rs 200 crore due to the bus strike, sources said. Transport minister Anil Parab met the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis to discuss several issues, including the ongoing strike of the ST workers. “The state government has made multiple appeals asking the striking employees to report to work, but they have not responded yet. Fadnavis has made some suggestions. We will examine those and a decision will be taken,” said Parab. On the passenger front, several daily commuters and passenger rights activists on Thursday demanded that bus services be restarted. “There are many villages which depend entirely on ST (state transport) service and where there is poor availability of private vehicles such as autos or taxis,” said Jayawant Darekar of Kokan Vikas Samiti. Also, office-goers in the Mumbai metropolitan region depend on ST to travel to work. Passenger rights activist Gaurang Vora said, “It’s an essential service and you cannot hold commuters to ransom.” Vinod Gholap, president, Fight for Right Foundation, which represents commuters, said, “The commuters are facing a major hardship as they are at the mercy of private vehicle operators, who charge more than double the MSRTC fare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-to-rope-in-500-pvt-buses-to-deal-with-strike/articleshow/87790143.cms||Somit Sen

The protesting farmers claimed that the centre in charge had rejected their paddy on the ground that “it doesn’t meet the procurement standards fixed by the government,” leaving them with no option but to sell their produce to private vendors at a lower price. Farmer leader Shyamu Shukla told TOI, “We staged protests in various parts of Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur districts against discrepancies in paddy procurement. The protest was called off after the assurance that tehsildars would visit the procurement centres to address the farmers’ issues.” Maiganganj police station SHO Chiranjivi Mohan said, “The farmers withdrew their protest after over three hours when administrative officials assured them of transparency in the procurement process. The situation is under control, and the paddy procurement is going on at the centres.” Earlier, a farmer had set his paddy crop on fire after the procurement centre in charge in Mohammadi town had allegedly refused to buy his produce. Kheri’s DM had already asked the farmers to make videos and share them with his officials if they faced any difficulties in selling paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/failing-to-sell-their-paddy-at-msp-farmers-climb-atop-water-tank-to-protest-discrepancies-in-procurement/articleshow/87786835.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The parents Shanavas and Sajeena of Chirayinkeezhu have told the media that they discovered about his online gaming addiction only after his death, when they examined his mobile phone which they provided him for online classes. Their son Sabith was found dead on November 8, hanging in his room. The police had taken possession of his mobile phone as part of the investigation. However, the phone was handed back to the parents after they requested it. It was after that the parents found their son’s collection of online games locked away in a folder secured with password. The parents also told the media that they have spoken out so that other parents would take this as a warning and take necessary measures to ensure that their wards are safe from such addictive games. Following this revelation, the police officials on Wednesday visited the couple and took back the phone for detailed scientific examination. They said that the phone will be sent to the cyber experts for examination. The police have acted after the higher ups in the department directed the local police to investigate whether the allegations made by the parents of the boy are true. The senior officers of the department are also of the opinion that the local police should not have given the phone back to the parents instead of sending it to the scientific experts. Meanwhile, sources in the police also said that the parents must not have made these remarks without scientifically confirming their doubts. “The boy has not left any clue to the actual reason behind his death. The reasons could be anything such as personal issues or even cyber harassment as kids these days spend most of their time online,” said an officer who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/online-game-addiction-takes-boys-life/articleshow/87766704.cms||---

While the dues concerned is the highest in the past five years, the authorities said the Covid outbreak in March last year has further mounted the dues. Of the total outstanding amount, Rs 263.4 crore are pending towards the non-irrigation sector, which includes public water supply schemes of different local self-governing bodies and industries etc. The remaining Rs 87.7 crore dues are pending towards the irrigation needs, including the farming community. S K Sabbinwar, the superintendent engineer of the Command Area Development Authority of the GMIDC, said the financial crisis arising out of the pandemic situation among different water users has hampered the recovery of irrigation dues. “Both local self-governing bodies and the farming community cite weak financial conditions when it comes to payment of dues. The timely payment of dues is essential for upkeep and value-addition of different infrastructure involving the dam and canal systems,” he said. Sabbinwar said the department engaged in the recovery of irrigation dues was reeling under staff crunch. Assistant engineer with CADA Jaisingh Hire said some of the industries and power plants also figure among defaulters. Water rights activist Abhijeet Dhanorkar said a huge recovery amount of GMIDC, especially that from the non-irrigation sector was a reason to worry. The local self-governing bodies need to improve their tax-recovery to pay money towards public water supply scheme, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mwada-irrigation-dues-highest-in-5-yrs/articleshow/87786081.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Delhi||E-vehicles in Delhi can ply in no-entry hours||NEW DELHI: In a move that will contribute to the battle against air pollution and also give a boost to the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) in the national capital, transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Thursday announced exemption for e-light goods vehicles (e-LCV) during “no-entry” hours. Gahlot said there would be no prohibition on e-LCVs from plying and idle parking on identified roads during the “no-entry” hours as notified by the transport department. Earlier in the day, he took to social media to announce that the department will empanel manufacturers of electric kits for retrofitting conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric ones. Transport officials said this would be particularly beneficial to the owners of diesel-run vehicles that were more than 10 years old and were not allowed to ply in Delhi. “Delhi is now open to ICE to electric retrofitting! Vehicles, if found fit, can convert their diesel into electric engine, dept'll empanel manufacturers of pure electric kit by approved testing agencies. Once empanelled, this’ll enable vehicles to continue plying here beyond 10 years,” Gahlot tweeted. Later, Gahlot said the movement of commercial vehicles had been restricted on over 250 major roads from 7am to 11am and 5pm to 9pm due to congestion during peak hours and vehicular pollution. On average, 300 challans are issued every day by the department’s enforcement teams against vehicles without a valid pollution under control certificate (PUCC), he added. A total of 280 challans were issued on Tuesday and 390 on Wednesday at petrol pumps, where the department has deployed enforcement teams and civil defence volunteers for PUCC checking, Gahlot said, adding that stringent enforcement had led to a big rise in the number of PUCC being issued. “We are committed to implementing each and every promise made under the EV policy in the best way possible, and implementing this provision is a proof,” Gahlot said. The L5N category electric three-wheeler goods carrier and N1 category electric goods carrier with gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes will now be allowed to ply in Delhi at any time, he added. Delhi Traffic Police has also issued a circular in line with the Delhi government’s decision, he pointed out. “Since the launch of EV policy, the sale of e-LCVs has gone up from just 46 to 1,054, a 95.6% hike in the registration. We are hopeful that today’s decision would give a huge push to mass adoption of EVs across categories in Delhi,” Gahlot said. He said that with a target of 25% of new vehicle registrations by 2024 to be electric, the Delhi government put a significant focus on the electrification of shared and commercial transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-vehicles-can-ply-in-no-entry-hours/articleshow/87788346.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Thane||Thane Municipal Corporation allegedly spent Rs 5 crore on beautifying pvt garden||THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has spent nearly Rs 5 crore on redeveloping and beautifying a private garden in the Shrinagar area of the city, corporators informed the Thane general body, on Thursday. The startling expose was made in the House, Thursday, after Shiv Sena corporator Gurmukh Singh raised a question over the ownership of the garden in his ward. He claimed the corporation had recently moved a plan to rename the garden even and sought to know if the facility was owned by the corporation. A red-faced administration claimed it was unaware of the ownership status of the garden and hinted it could possibly be a private property. Officials from the corporation told the House that the redevelopment and beautification was approved by the general body previously, which made the members ask why the administration had failed to check its ownership title. Meanwhile, Singh also pointed to a similar situation where the corporation was unaware of a 10k sqm plot in the Wagle estate ward that was to be handed over to the transport undertaking several years back. Fellow corporator Radhika Fatak also pointed out a discrepancy where a developer had encroached upon a nullah adjoining his project. Mayor Naresh Mhaske took cognisance of the issues and ordered the administration to ensure the garden was acquired at the earliest else launch a probe on how and why the corporation spent money for beautification and upkeep of a private facility. “The estate department has to keep records of corporation property and ensure it isn’t usurped,” he said, directing the administration to survey the city and keep record of all corporation owned and acquired properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-tmc-allegedly-spent-rs-5cr-on-beautifying-pvt-garden/articleshow/87790147.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Under the programme, book stands will be put up at various public places, mainly bus stands, of every gram panchayat. The books will be placed in a glass case for the public to use. Meanwhile, notebooks were distributed to 285 government school students from Siribagilu and Kombaru. The programme was undertaken as part of CSR activity of Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd (KIOCL) in association with the District Working Journalists’ Association (DWJA). The ZP CEO said in January, DWJA held a village-stay programme and was able to find solutions to several problems of Siribagilu and Kombaru. The association’s concern towards social needs is laudable, he added. “Government school children from these remote villages do not receive government facilities on time. When classes went online due to the pandemic, many children here were not able to get access to online classes due to poor internet connectivity. Some parents have no cellphones. In such a scenario, government school teachers have a major responsibility to teach them. The scene here is quite different compared to urban areas, where parents take interest in their child’s academic performance,” he said. DWJA president Srinivas Nayak Indaje, S Murugesh, manager, human resource and administration, KIOCL, and others were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pustaka-goodu-initiative-launched-at-kadaba-taluk/articleshow/87787576.cms||---

It also imposed a fine of Rs 14,000 on him. Raja is the first legislator to be convicted by the special court, set up in Aligarh district about two years ago. Later, the court granted Raja bail and gave him 30 days’ time to file an appeal against the order in the high court. Talking with TOI, additional district government counsel (ADGC) Ravi Kant Sharma said the MLA was granted bail after being convicted by the court as his maximum sentence is for a term less than three years. He was not a legislator at the time of the incident in 1999, he added. The special sessions judge, Manisha (who goes by the first name) convicted Raja under IPC sections (rioting), 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 353 (assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty), 504 (intentionally insults) and 506 (criminal intimidation) On November 17, 1999, a constable. Shyamsunder, was on duty at Ganda Nala chowk, when he saw a “gitty” (sand and gravel) loaded truck entering the city from a bypass road. He stopped the truck, and directed the driver not to enter the town area. The driver did not pay heed to the constable and entered the city, saying that the truck is owned by Sanjeev Raja. Meanwhile, the truck helper went and informed Raja, who along with some unidentified people reached the spot and assaulted the constable. The policeman had filed a complaint against Raja, the truck driver and seven-to-eight unidentified people, following which an FIR was registered against them at Bannadevi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-bjp-mla-sanjeev-raja-gets-2-year-jail-term-for-assaulting-cop-22-yrs-ago/articleshow/87786850.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Arpita managed to persuade the Maoists to free Ajay Roshan Lakra, 35, on Wednesday after he was held captive for six days. Journalists and social organisations of Bastar too had approached the Maoists to get Ajay released. The sub-engineer and peon Lakshman Partagiri, 24, were kidnapped on November 11 from a Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna work site. Partagiri was released after two days but Lakra continued to be held hostage. Bijapur police said Ajay was released on Wednesday after Arpita, who had carried her son into the dense forest, requested the Maoists to free him. According to Bastar journalists, when Maoists came to know that he is not a road contractor but an engineer, they decided to let him go. Ajay was brought before a ‘people’s court’ in a village in the interiors of Bijapur. He was then blindfolded and taken to a rendezvous spot in the jungle from where villagers escorted him to Gangloor Road. On seeing her husband, Arpita broke down and the emotional reunion moved villagers and journalists who had accompanied them. Arpita couldn’t stop thanking the people for intervening on her behalf. According to police, the Maoists took Lakra for a road contractor and abducted him. When Arpita reached the forest, along with a group of activists, journalists and villagers, looking for Lakra, the Maoists released him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhattisgarh-baby-in-lap-woman-walks-into-jungle-frees-hubby-from-naxals/articleshow/87790145.cms||---

Inspector general, prisons, Manoj Kumar, confirmed the development saying, “The jail administration of Saraikela had requested that Bose and five others be shifted on security grounds. The administration had also stated that Bose was suffering from various ailments and needed to be kept in a centre with better medical facilities.” Kumar said in view of the concerns raised by the authorities and the recommendation of the Saraikela deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police in this regard, the order for shifting them was issued on Thursday. Official sources said Birsa Munda Central Jail has the best medical facilities among the prisons in the state. Besides, the patients could be refrred to higher medical centre, Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (Rims) without difficulty from the jail. The decision to shift Bose and others to Birsa Munda Central Jail was also taken as it would be more convenient for investigating agencies arriving from different parts of the country to interrogate him. The responsibility of transferring the Maoists to the Birsa Munda Central Jail lies with the district administration concerned. The authorities have to, however, take permission of the local court before implementing the decision. It may be stated here that Sheela, who was admitted in Rims on Wednesday after an attack of epilepsy is stated to be stable at present. The doctors said further investigations would be carried out later. Bose, his wife and four other Maoists were caught by the police under Kandra police station area in Saraikela district on November 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kishan-da-aides-to-be-moved-to-birsa-munda-jail-for-better-security/articleshow/87787419.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The delay in elections is having adverse effect on the development at the district and panchayat levels,” Mahto said. The state government has postponed the panchayat elections, originally due last year, by over 12 months citing the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 4,000 panchayat bodies in Jharkhand received an extension in their tenure in August this year through an ordinance which was brought about by the state government. Mahto also criticised the government for failing to fulfill its poll promises. “Two years is a long time for a government to deliver. Ajsu will tell the people of Jharkhand how many steps has this government has taken in the last two years,” Mahto said. At the meeting, Mahto directed the party officials to strengthen their grassroots units for the panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ajsu-slams-govt-for-delaying-rural-polls/articleshow/87787462.cms||---

In September this year, the civic body had served notices to the cable companies and the customers and sought to know whether they had obtained the RMC’s permission to use the electric poles for hanging the cables. “The electric poles come under the state electricity department but the land comes under RMC’s jurisdiction. There are cables dangling all over the city and they often lead to accidents, sometimes eve fatal ones,” Kunwar Singh Pahan, the deputy municipal commissioner of RMC, told TOI when asked the rationale behind the notice. “For instance, there are naked wires dangling in Main Road which can lead to accidents. So it is important to cut the unauthorized wires,” Pahan added. The move is in pursuance with Section 126 of the Jharkhand Municipal Act, 2011 where there is a provision about vesting of property and the municipality had already ordered three notices in the wake of Jharkhand high court’s mandate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rmc-notice-to-remove-cables-from-electric-poles/articleshow/87787301.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Anil Deshmukh will be out of jail soon, get his job back: NCP leader Praful Patel||NAGPUR: NCP leader Praful Patel said former home minister Anil Deshmukh would soon be out of jail and, with the blessings of party supremo Sharad Pawar, reinstated in his previous position in the MVA government. Pawar was present when he spoke. Addressing party workers, the former aviation minister said Deshmukh’s rehabilitation was on Pawar’s mind too. “Nobody should think that a big vacuum has been created in Deshmukh’s absence,” he said. Stressing that the former minister and Katol MLA was a key figure in NCP, Pawar said he missed Deshmukh’s presence on his visit to Nagpur. “Today is the first day in many years that I have come to Nagpur, and Anil babu is not here with me. We have been working together for many years, but this had never happened before,” he said. Alleging “misuse” of Central agencies in targeting the state’s ministers and destabilising the MVA government, Pawar said the opposition would be made to pay for putting Deshmukh behind bars. “You will be made to pay the price for every day and every hour” that Deshmukh spends in jail, he said, without naming the BJP. ‘After losing power, some sending list of possible targets to Delhi’When you have power, you need to handle it carefully and respectfully, with feet firmly on ground…those who lost it, resort to intimidating tactics like harassing and defaming others.” Taking a dig at the local BJP leadership, the former Union agriculture minister said after losing power in the state, some unscrupulous elements were sending their senior leaders in Delhi a list of possible targets and accordingly the central agencies were targeting them. “After switching sides, senior leader Eknath Khadse and wife were summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). As nothing could be done to MP Sanjay Raut, his wife was targeted. Similarly, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sister was harassed after the government failed to indict him. Minister Hassan Mushrif's home was raided but nothing found. There are numerous examples.” Flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, the veteran politician said even as the prices of essential commodities skyrocketed, the regime was busy harassing opposition leaders. “I recently visited Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur district, where farmers, including senior citizens and women, were fighting for their rights for over a year. Similar protests are happening in other states like Rajasthan and Haryana. However, the NDA government does not have time to listen to the grievances of those who feed the nation. Its leaders are piling up miseries on the farmers and common citizens, and there is a need to teach them a lesson.” Calling on workers to work under Patel’s guidance in strengthening the party’s base in Vidarbha, Pawar said the change would begin from Nagpur and spread across Vidarbha. “I was a bit sceptical of workers’ morale while arriving in the city in Deshmukh’s absence. But looking at your enthusiasm, I am sure that any misuse of power would not deter you in standing behind the party. With all your hard work, we have formed the MVA government under CM Uddhav Thackeray. Our aim is to provide a stable government that will take Maharashtra to prosperity,” he said. The NCP chief later cancelled his Wardha and Yavatmal tours due to official reasons, according to NCP city chief Duneshwar Pathe, who was with him at Wadsa in Gadchiroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anil-deshmukh-will-be-out-of-jail-soon-get-his-job-back/articleshow/87790192.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The child had completed her deposition against the 23-year-old deaf and mute accused in 2019. However, the defence wanted her back in court “to confront her with her statement given to the magistrate.” It said that this had to be done to bring out contradiction, omissions and improvements between the statements. While an opportunity was given to the defence in April, the lawyer did not turn up as he had a “cold”. “Though the application for recalling of victim was allowed previously and the opportunity was granted to the accused, the accused failed to avail the opportunity... only a vague statement is made about the illness (of the lawyer) without any supporting evidence for the same. Therefore, the accused cannot claim that his right to fair trial has been extinguished,” the special Pocso court said. The accused has been out on bail since April 2018. The FIR was lodged in 2016. The prosecution submitted that the child should not be harassed by repeatedly calling her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pocso-court-rejects-plea-to-recall-survivor-for-questioning/articleshow/87790266.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi: After years of trying, plan to clean Yamuna by '2025'||NEW DELHI: Yamuna, virtually a dead river in Delhi with 22 drains spewing sewage into it across its 22km stretch in the city, may get another shot at salvation. Decades after the first clean-up attempts, CM Arvind Kejriwal unveiled a major six-point plan on Thursday to cleanse the river by February 2025. He said he will himself take a dip in the river before the next assembly elections. The plan includes setting up new sewage treatment plants, increasing the capacity of the existing STPs, roping in new technology to make sure no pollutant enters the river, going for in-situ treatment of the major drains in the city and diverting all industrial waste to treatment plants. The drains of public toilets in JJ clusters will be connected to the larger sewer network to completely stop stormwater drains from being polluted. The government also plans to connect every household to the sewer network so that no waste from household toilets flows into the drains. The entire sewer network of Delhi will be desilted and rehabilitated, it said. It's a tall order but the chief minister said the work was being undertaken on a war footing. He will be personally monitoring the entire exercise. Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said his government has fixed timelines. "We are aiming to completely clean the Yamuna by February 2025. I will keep revisiting the progress of the plan every 15 to 30 days," he asserted. He later tweeted: "I do what I say. I always deliver upon my promises. Will definitely clean Yamuna before the next election." The 22-km urban stretch of the river, from Wazirabad to Okhla, is severely polluted, as reported recently by TOI. The latest report on the water quality by Delhi Pollution Control Committee in October this year, based on data from eight monitoring stations, revealed that it does not meet the standards set for dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). According to the report, DO, which is the amount of oxygen in the river water, had failed to meet the criteria of 5 mg/l or more at all the eight stations. A higher BOD indicates that the amount for oxygen-demanding species to feed on is less. The prescribed standard for BOD in Yamuna is 3mg/l or less but it was 34 mg/l at the ISBT bridge, 40mg/l at Agra canal (Okhla), 58mg/l at downstream Okhla barrage and 54mg/l at Asgarpur. The toxic foam covering the river often makes headlines and recently lead to a political uproar during the Chhat puja. The CM had then said that the buck stops with him and that his government will clean the river. "The current state of the river is a result of 70 years of pollution - carrying all of Delhi's waste - and cannot be undone in two days," said Kejriwal. "Many untreated sewers end up flowing into the Yamuna, carrying a large volume of chemicals and pollutants, thereby contaminating it. Currently, we are equipped to treat around 600 MGD when we need our capacity to be around 850 MGD," the CM said. "For this, work is going on to improve treatment and cleaning of sewers on three fronts - building new sewer treatment plants such as the ones at Coronation Park, Okhla, Kondli and Rithala; increasing the capacity of the existing treatment plants; and lastly, adopting new technologies for the treatment plants because the current outdated mechanisms give out polluted sewage even after treatment. We will ensure a 10:10 ratio of output after treatment," he asserted. The government says it will also ensure in-situ treatment of the water in four major drains in Delhi, that is, the cleaning work will be undertaken on the spot, using new technology. " Kejriwal said his government will crack down on industries not treating industrial waste. "On paper, industrial waste gets treated before being disposed of, but in reality there's not much substance to it. We will ensure that all the effluent treatment plants work to the best of their capacity. If an industry is found not to be sending its waste to treatment plants, it will be shut immediately by the authorities. There will be no compromise," he said. The plan envisages connecting all JJ clusters to the sewer network. At many places, public toilet complexes have been connected to stormwater drains instead of the sewerage. The CM announced that under Mukhyamantri Sewer Connection Yojana, all households will be connected to the sewer network.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-after-years-of-trying-plan-to-clean-yamuna-by-2025/articleshow/87790262.cms||Alok KN Mishra

Since India does not provide them e-visas, they are left with no option but to visit their local high commission office for a visa. “It is not easy to get a visa. Goa has a huge number of repeat clients with long stays, and usually they are senior citizens who travel to avoid the harsh winters of England. They are eager to come, but are having difficulties getting visas,” said Ralph de Souza, president, Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). Even as getting the visa isn’t easy, there’s also the pendency of applications to account for, as several Indian expats were unable to visit their home country over the past two years, due to the pandemic. Sources said that the Indian expats too are having problems getting their visas stamped, as processing of applications takes time. “But when tourists apply for visas, they are likely to have to wait for (even) longer,” said de Souza. He added that although India has removed quarantine conditions and permitted vaccinated travellers entry, the crucial factor now is that visas are hard to come by. “The only solution is that India starts issuing e-visas. Otherwise, bookings by tourists are likely to be affected,” he said. The GCCI president said they have made a representation to chief minister Pramod Sawant “to use his good office to intervene in the matter”. The chamber has also sought the help of Union minister Shripad Naik. Interestingly, India is also not issuing e-visas to travellers from Kazakhstan, another country that matters to Goa for tourism. “With regards to the UK, we will again approach the government. If the issue is not sorted out, we will have fewer footfalls from England. If Goa is not available, there are other destinations that offer e-visas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-issuance-of-e-visas-to-uk-tourists-may-impact-bookings/articleshow/87787976.cms||---

The visit assumes significance as the former chief minister, who was first elected to the Goa legislative assembly in 1994 and won six elections from the Panaji constituency, always began his campaign with a visit to the Mahalaxmi temple. Responding to a query on whether his visit was to kickstart his own campaign, Utpal said that he has already started meeting people. “It being my birthday, everyone requested me to pray at the temple. I’m getting the people’s support,” he said. “I prayed to the goddess to give me strength. There are plenty of my father’s supporters, and they are my strength.” Former CM's brother Avdhoot Parrikar was also present. On Thursday, Utpal reiterated that he has informed the party that he wants to contest, and was confident BJP would give him the ticket. However, he didn’t comment on what he plans to do if the party denies him the ticket. While Utpal has been vocal about his political aspirations, he was not active in politics before his father’s death. As of now, none of BJP’s senior functionaries or leaders have commented either for or against his move to secure the party ticket from his father’s longtime constituency when the party has a sitting MLA there. “I don’t want to talk about it now, but Manohar Parrikar did not get anything in his life without a struggle,” Utpal said. “Similarly, I too will have to work hard, and may have to take some difficult decisions.” He, however, didn’t divulge what those “difficult decisions” could be. Political observers say that Utpal received good response from BJP karyakartas and former defence minister’s supporters, on his birthday. In 2014, when Manohar Parrikar vacated his seat to become India’s defence minister, his aide Sidharth Kuncalienker was elected in the bypoll. In 2017, after his resignation as defence minister, Kuncalienker stepped down and Parrikar was re-elected as Panaji MLA. However, after Parrikar’s death in 2019, Kuncalienker was defeated by then Congress candidate Atanasio Monserrate in the bypoll. However, Panaji returned to BJP in July, when a breakaway group of Congress MLAs led by current deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/utpal-visits-city-temple-reiterates-confidence-in-securing-bjp-ticket/articleshow/87787984.cms||---

Against a global average of 96 doses per 100 population as of November 16, India had achieved 81 per 100. Similarly, 41% of the world’s population has been fully vaccinated, India has given both doses to only 27% of its population. Among the 29 most populous nations, India now ranks 16th in terms of doses per 100 population and 19th in terms of percentage of population fully vaccinated. This is despite India having for long been the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines. The two countries that were lagging behind India in September but have now marched ahead are Iran and Vietnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-india-has-slid-in-vaccination-among-nations-with-50-million-population/articleshow/87790287.cms||---

The party said that traffic along the route is heightened due to tourism and the festive season and the government needs to ensure that commuters do not suffer. GFP functionary Jagdish Bhobe who stated that he will contest St Andre constituency seat said that it takes almost two hours to cross the 7km-stretch till Cortalim with serpentine queues of vehicles seen on a daily basis. “There are feast and novenas. During this festive period people will suffer commuting from this area as traffic jams are witnessed every passing day,” Bhobe said. GFP has sought chief minister Pramod Sawant’s intervention. “There is threat to people’s life who wait for buses along the road as there are no proper bus stands in this area,” said Bhobe. GFP thanked the state government for finally hiking the salary of Ayush doctors from Rs20,000 to Rs50,000 per month. The 82 Ayush doctors who are under the national health mission (NHM) got the hike after GFP president Vijai Sardesai raised the issue in the assembly. The party had demanded that the doctors should be paid Rs 65,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resolve-traffic-woes-along-goa-velha-agasaim-stretch-gfp/articleshow/87787993.cms||---

The board also advised GEL to expand its business by taking up software development work for other state departments, central government departments and public sector undertakings. During the meeting, GEL apprised the board on the status of the Bhumija-Ore Tracking and Management System and Goaonline. The board also approved the proposal to set up a dedicated office for GEL at Pilerne Industrial estate for software development activities. Sawant was informed that Goaonline has more than 25 departments onboard with 162 services being offered to citizens as well as commercial entities. “The chief minister emphasised on the requirement to onboard all the remaining departments and their services on to this portal so as to have maximum inter-department service integrations and data sharing to facilitate a true single-window experience for citizens,” a senior official said. Sawant asked GEL chief executive officer Revati Mazumdar to identify all services, mainly citizen-centric, outside the ambit of Goaonline so that the same could be brought online immediately. During the 45-minute meeting, the financial statements of the company for the year 2020-21 were also approved. “He emphasised on scheme management. None of the scheme beneficiaries should be made to come to any government office for application. There are many schemes that are coming and all should be uploaded on Goaonline,” an official said. GEL has also taken over the ore tracking and management system, which has helped bring down the monthly cost for truck owners from Rs 850 per month to Rs 450 per month Additionally, with the setup of the control room the complete data monitoring and management will be handled by GEL at the mines department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-urges-gel-to-maximise-e-gov-bring-all-depts-onboard/articleshow/87788009.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Govt opposes Majithia’s plea to be made party in drug haul case||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Thursday vehemently opposed the plea filed by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia asking to be made a party in the Punjab’s drug haul case pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court. When the matter came up for resumed hearing on Thursday before the division bench comprising Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Maudgil, senior advocates Dushyant Dave and A P S Deol informed the court that they would be representing the state of Punjab in this case. The bench, however, observed that it would need some more time to examine the record of the case as Justice Maudgil is a new member to the bench and would require time to summarise the case. Dave, representing the state of Punjab, however, requested the bench to fix the matter for an early date of hearing. Dave said that the situation of drugs in Punjab had already been aggravated and the case had been pending in the court for a long time. He also added that even the Supreme Court (SC) had also said in 2015 for early disposal of this case. He stated that the Punjab government was committed to take action in the matter and requested the bench read the reports and hand it over to the state so that they can act accordingly. Dave also opposed the plea move by Majithia. He said the former minister did not have the right to be heard in the case. On this, the counsel representing Majithia said that before taking any decision, he should also be heard on the issue. The bench said that they would first examine the plea and then take any decision on this issue. Thereafter the matter was adjourned for December 6 for further hearing. In his plea, Majithia had contended that a malicious and mala fide agenda had been launched by his political opponents in the garb of public interest only to target him. The former minister also alleged that Punjab’s deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu were running unwarranted propaganda on drug issue against him. He has also claimed that neither the STF of Punjab police nor ED had found any evidence against him in relation to the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-opposes-majithias-plea-to-be-made-party-in-drug-haul-case/articleshow/87788649.cms||---

He said, “Some hidden devils in Congress were conspiring to defame me and I will expose them at right time.” Khaira said this during his court appearance in Mohali on Thursday before being sent to judicial custody. He was produced in the court after seven-day police remand by the enforcement directorate (ED) in money laundering case. The case was adjourned for December 2. Khaira said truth can be suppressed but could not be overpowered and added that he would continue to fight until his last breath. On the money laundering case, Khaira said ED had not given them the copy of the case nor given the grounds for his arrest till date. He said his lawyer was only allowed to read ECIR registered against him. He said only thing which came to the fore in the paper presented by the ED was that he collected money in the name of Aam Aadmi Party. He said he had visited 16 cities and the tour was sponsored by the AAP and the money was collected only by the AAP workers. Khaira said ED has taken the scheduled offence on the basis of the NDPS case of 2017, in which one of the accused was arrested in NDPS case and was later sentenced to 20 years in jail. Supreme Court has granted stay in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khaira-alleges-his-arrest-as-vendetta-by-cong-insists-money-was-collected-by-aap-workers/articleshow/87788666.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The post had fallen vacant after the resignation of Veerendra Dhavlikar. Councillors Archana Dangui and Jaya Sawant had filed their nominations for the post and a special meeting was convened at the PMC hall to vote and elect the new deputy on Thursday. Ponda deputy collector Pradip Naik, who was observer for the meeting, declared the Sawant winner after she secured nine votes against her rival Dangui’s seven votes in the 15-member council. The voting was held by secret ballot, Naik said. The party had suffered first jolt when Kolvenkar, then BJP Ponda block president, had wrested the post of chairperson of the council on May 18 by defeating his own party candidate Ritesh Naik, son of Ponda Congress MLA Ravi Naik. Almost four months later, on October 4, BJP’s efforts to oust Kolvenkar fizzled out as no councillor, including those who had moved the motion, turned up for the special meeting to vote on the no-trust motion .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-backed-jaya-elected-to-ponda-councils-dy-post/articleshow/87788044.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

We strongly condemn this act of terror and firmly stand by the family of the deceased,” Vaidya said in a statement after visiting the bereaved family. He lamented that the democratically elected state government had failed to prevent such targeted killings. “Since it’s evident from the previous experiences that there’s a clandestine understanding between the ruling CPM and Islamist forces in the targeted killing of Swayamsevaks, we demand a fair probe in this matter and the perpetrators of violence should be booked and punished at the earliest,” Vaidya said. “We demand the central government to intervene in the matter if justice is not delivered under the CPM government. We also demand a detailed NIA probe into the murder of Sanjith as the perpetrators allegedly have terrorist links,” he said. Vaidya urged both the state and Centre to further probe the terrorist connections and anti-national activities of PFI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manmohan-vaidya-accuses-kerala-govt-of-targeted-killings-of-rss-workers/articleshow/87790308.cms||---

---||India||Uniform civil code a necessity; cannot be made voluntary: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Dealing with a batch of 17 petitions pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners and seeking protection from the court, the Allahabad high court on Thursday called upon the Central government to consider setting up a panel for implementing the mandate of Article 44, which says that the "State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India." The court also directed marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners without insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar, who passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by one Mayra alias Vaishnavi and 16 others pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners, further called upon the Union government to initiate the process as the stage has been reached. "The uniform civil code (UCC) is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made purely voluntary as was observed by Dr BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community. The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code," the court observed. "Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law," the court further added. The court, in an attempt to envisage the possible effect of uniform civil code (UCC) on the Indian population if implemented, referred to the Hindu Family Code (HFC), which in the court’s opinion, acted as uniform civil code and integrated the citizens into an integrated and united Indian citizenry, on terms that is equal and uniform, in so far as the law regulating family law is concerned. Stressing that the impact of HFC on Hindu society has been phenomenal, the court opined that HFC has not encroached upon the religious custom, culture, practice, and propagation of the minuscule minority, i.e., Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, included within the definition of Hindus. The HFC can be said to be the UCC governing the Hindus and the communities, falling within the ambit and definition of Hindu and that it covers and has sway over 80% of the population. Significantly, the court noted that the HFC laid the foundation of transforming the traditional Hindu society, and the legislations lifted and transported the Hindu personal law from the shastra/religion and placed it within the domain of Parliament. "Parliament through HFC in a single stroke provided the legal platform where Hindu citizens could interact with each other on equal terms irrespective of rigid caste, jati, creed, gotra and the concept of purity, pollution in marriage and dining. The HFC has been largely instrumental, (apart from other factors viz education, mobility, health services), in facilitating and creating what the sociologist refer to as a Hindu social class and or a Hindu citizenry," noted the court. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehended threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, they had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Key observations:The issue of UCC, though constitutional, rakes political overtures whenever raised or debated in the public domain and calls for its implementation in the wake of a multiplicity of marriage and family laws in place. A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the minority community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. That has been the consistent official stand of the government within the country and in international forums. A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws that have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the state which is charged with the duty of securing Uniform Civil Code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uniform-civil-code-a-necessity-cannot-be-made-voluntary-allahabad-hc/articleshow/87787579.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The issue was raised by Sena group leader in the Thane House, Ashok Vaity, during the question hour session in the general body meeting. Vaity asked the corporation if it had constituted an inquiry in the allegations made by senior official Swarup Kulkarni who had told the House last month he was sent on compulsory leave a few years back as he had refused to approve files pertaining to Digi Thane. Additional municipal commissioner-1 Sandeep Malvi told the House the administration there was no enquiry done in the matter. The administration also later clarified to the House that the action taken on the official was disciplinary, which failed to convince Vaity who sought a probe in the matter. “The administration seems to be not transparent about the operations of the Digi-Thane projects and the incident which led to the official being sent on leave apparently for not approving certain projects under Digi-Thane. There has to be clarity if the official is guilty or was unnecessarily punished for not bowing down to unreasonable pressure from seniors. I will write to the anti-corruption department seeking a thorough probe in the same,” said Vaity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/probe-digi-thane-projects-following-allegations-says-shiv-sena/articleshow/87786634.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||India||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh score high on SMART police perception index; Bihar, UP lowest||NEW DELHI: Almost seven years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the call for SMART policing, a survey done by a thinktank to gauge public perception of the police has found the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to have the highest ‘SMART policing index’ score of 8.11 and 8.1 respectively on a scale of 1-10, even as UP and Bihar returned the lowest score of 5.81 and 5.74 respectively. SMART is an acronym for what the police in the country need to reform into. While 'S' stands for strict and sensitive police, ‘M’ expands to modern and mobile, ‘A’ alert and accountable, ‘R’ reliable and responsive and ‘T’ techno-savvy and trained. The SMART policing index was worked out by Indian Police Foundation (IPF) - a Delhi-based thinktank set up by eminent citizens including serving and retired police officers, civil servants, academics and lawyers etc – for each individual state or Union territory on the basis of respondents’ views along 10 indicators – six linked to competence, three to values and one to public trust. Telangana scored best on perception score of police sensitivity, strictness and good behaviour, accessibility, police responsiveness and technology adoption. Andhra Pradesh had the highest perception score in helpful and friendly policing, unbiased and lawful policing, police accountability and public trust in the police. Kerala returned the highest perception score on integrity and corruption-free service, while Bihar had the lowest score for this indicator. The survey questionnaire, comprising 10 queries, was filled via online mode and later through offline mode, even though almost 2/3rd of the 1.61 lakh valid responses were received online. Interestingly, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana together accounted for 56.48% of the total responses, while bigger states like UP returned only 2,868 and 1,615 responses respectively. "After consulting social scientists and statistical experts, IPF decided to limit itself to separately determining the smart policing index for each state and UT, and refrain from ranking the states based on their individual indices," IPF president and CEO N Ramachandran, a former IPS officer, said at a press conference here to release the survey findings. "We believe that the insights from the survey will help police to improve legitimacy, restore confidence and trust, even as they strive to progressively bring about a transformation in policing," said Ramachandran. IPF chairman Prakash Singh, the former BSF DG on whose plea SC had laid down the roadmap for key police reforms, added this was first of the series of annual, longitudinal surveys to assess public perception of the police. The survey found that respondents who had no previous contact with the police were more likely to have negative perceptions about the police, than those who had had such previous interactions. "This indicates perceptions may be formed based on secondary sources and hearsay, and building of relationships by police with the public earns the latter’s confidence and trust," said Ramachandran. Apart from numerical data, IPF received 25,761 messages, comments and suggestions. Some were radical and even abusive, but then there were sensible messages that IPF sees as a good barometer of the issues agitating the minds of citizens. Some spoke about police interventions in domestic violence issues, insisting that the woman should have her course of justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/telangana-andhra-pradesh-score-high-on-smart-police-perception-index-bihar-up-lowest/articleshow/87787831.cms||Bharti Jain

Chandra said while the government is keen to support the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) industry in a big way, and intends to set up a national centre for excellence, it would also like content producers to use the theme of 75 Years of Indian Independence to produce content on Indian war heroes and freedom fighters that can be appreciated by the youth and is inspirational. The I&B secretary also said the Centre is looking beyond creating a government institution to promote the M&E industry. “In future, we should develop institutions like the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis, as has been done for the AVGC industry. We should spawn these throughout the country so that the necessary skills are developed, with the industry as a partner,” he said. Chandra also assured the industry stakeholders that the government is keen to be a facilitator and will endeavour to support the media and entertainment industry in every way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/produce-content-in-new-formats-like-animation-for-youth-ib-secy-at-cii-summit/articleshow/87787834.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||Minnesota man charged in killing of couple at Fargo factory||FARGO: A 35-year-old man with a long criminal record was charged Thursday with three counts of murder in the shooting deaths at a Fargo factory of a man and a woman who was eight months pregnant.  Anthony Reese Jr of Moorhead, Minnesota, is charged with killing Richard Pittman, April Carone and Carone's unborn child after an argument Wednesday at Composite America. He made his first court appearance Thursday, where a judge set his bond at $2 million and scheduled a preliminary hearing for December 16.  If convicted of murder, Reese faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. His public defender at Thursday's hearing, Eric Thomas, told The Associated Press he couldn't comment on the case while it's ongoing.  Factory workers told police that Pittman and Carone were dating and that she was expecting a baby girl who they planned to name Layla.  Police responded to multiple 911 calls reporting an active shooter Wednesday afternoon and discovered the victims. Carone died at the scene and Pittman was declared dead at a hospital.  Authorities said Pittman, Reese and another employee, Pourdeye Kegbeh, had been involved in an altercation on the factory floor prior to the shooting. Management ordered Reese to leave the business but he returned a short time later and confronted Pittman, Kegbeh said.  Kegbeh told police that Reese pulled out a handgun and shot Pittman numerous times before he turned and fired multiple shots at Carone.  Police said Reese then drove to the Fargo Police Department and turned himself in. He told officers that he had ditched the gun in a residential neighborhood, and investigators later found the 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Detectives also recovered multiple 9mm cartridge casings at the crime scene.  The shooting wasn't Reese's first brush with the law. In 2014, he was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in Benton County, Minnesota, and he has to register as a sex offender until 2029. He also has convictions for domestic assault, illegal gun possession, selling and possessing illegal drugs and violating no contact orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/minnesota-man-charged-in-killing-of-couple-at-fargo-factory/articleshow/87787895.cms||---

There were certain aspects that were delaying the project which have now been cleared,” said Awhad while talking to the media following a review of several infrastructure projects in Kalwa, Mumbra suburbs. The 550-metre-long skywalk is being constructed at a cost of Rs 21 crores and will connect Thane station with Vitawa in Kalwa. The proposed skywalk, planned years ago, would run parallel to the railway tracks and over the Ulhas river. The skywalk is planned to give citizens a faster and cheaper alternative to reach Thane station and also reduce mishaps as presently commuters walk down the tracks.

Over 126 matches, it had the lowest proportion of uneven fixtures where a team won by at least three goals. Next on the list of the Switzerland-based research group was India. Only 5.3 percent of the games in the Indian Super League (ISL) were uneven. Elsewhere in Asia, the Arabian Gulf League in United Arab Emirates (22.2%) and Qatar Stars League (21.7%) stood out as lopsided competitions. As the next edition of the ISL kicks off in Goa on Friday inside a bio-secure bubble, many believe this could be the most competitive yet. “This is going to be very exciting because of the quality of the teams,” Jamshedpur FC coach Owen Coyle told TOI. “There is not going to be a lot between them. I truly believe that.” Part of the reason for its “competitiveness” is the salary cap which does not permit clubs to spend more than Rs 16.5 crore on player salaries. Accountants do find a way past that cap, but this season the gap between the top teams and those at the bottom is likely to be narrow. Take Odisha FC, for example. They finished at the bottom last season winning just two of their 20 matches but have responded by signing the second most expensive player in Brazilian striker Jonathas de Jesus Kerala Blasters made it to two finals in the first three years but have not tasted playoff success for the last four editions. They now look stronger than ever with an attacking lineup as good as anyone else. Coyle’s own Jamshedpur have made heads turn with success in pre-season friendlies, while even SC East Bengal, despite the limited time that they had due to a tussle between club and investor, are looking good enough to give others a run for the points. “It’s not like before where three or four teams are high-performing,” said FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando. “When I see the players, in my point of view, this is going to be very competitive. There are not just 11 teams. These are teams who can all qualify.” In a league where teams habitually change players and coaches, Goa have managed to buck the trend. No wonder Ferrando, now into his second season at the club with the same set of players, is being backed to do even better than last season’s semifinal appearance when they lost against eventual champions Mumbai City on penalties. Others like ATK Mohun Bagan are just as strong, never mind the departure of defender Sandesh Jhingan to Croatia or their off-field travails. Last season’s finalists were forced to go from south to north in search of accommodation and cancelled training on the eve of the opener due to the long travel. “It’s too tiring,” said one of the senior players. What about Mumbai? The defending champions have a new coach in Des Buckingham but the same philosophy that Sergio Lobera instilled and helped them win a rare double. Hyderabad FC have quietly strengthened themselves with some tried and tested foreigners from ISL. Having missed out by just two points, Manolo Marquez’s boys should now fancy their chances of making the final four stage. After missing out on a playoff spot, former champions Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC will be keen to prove a point. They’ve made significant additions and hired coaches who have set the bar high. All eyes, though, will be on Khalid Jamil, who previously had an interim role at NorthEast United and is now the first Indian head coach to take charge of an ISL team on an official basis. Till recent seasons, Indian coaches were not allowed to take charge. Jamil changed that perception, proved himself last season and took NorthEast to the playoffs, against the odds. Can he do it again?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-preview-with-gap-in-quality-between-teams-getting-narrower-isl-8-promises-to-hold-an-unusual-competitive-edge/articleshow/87787906.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Centre asks laggard states to expedite notification of PESA||NEW DELHI: Taking serious view of their delay, the Centre has asked Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha — the four states that account for a significant part of India’s tribal population — to expedite notification and implementation of the rules of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act 1996 (PESA), that will complete 25 years in December this year. The ministry of panchayati raj (MoPR) is planing to write to the states to rid the hurdles and notify the rules over the next few months. The provisions of the Pesa Act seeks to empower local self - governments in the Schedule V areas of the country to help safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of the tribal communities. The draft model Pesa rules had been circulated by (MoPR) in 2009 to the 10 Pesa states. Six states — Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Telangana — have notified their state Pesa rules. The remaining four (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha) on Thursday informed the ministries of panchayati raj and tribal affairs that they are in the process of considering these rules of implementation. The update of the challenges being faced was shared by them at the national conference organised by these ministries to review Pesa implementation and measures to enhance welfare of tribals. Minister of rural development and panchayati raj, Giriraj Singh and tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda made it clear that there was no scope for any further delay. At the conference, both ministers said that if required they will take up this matter with the governors, chief ministers and ministers of these four states. The deliberations and outcomes of this conference will be placed at the minister-level conference, proposed to be held in January next year. The tribal affairs minister asserted the need for a convergence model for schemes of the ministries of panchayati raj, tribal affairs and environment, forest and climate change that apply to tribals. Outlining the spirit of Pesa, Munda said, "Pesa seeks to protect the principle of Jal, Jungle , Jameen (Water, forest and land) for the tribals. The strengthening and empowerment of the Gram Sabhas is imperative under Pesa." He also stressed upon the need to prevent land alienation of tribals for which a well organised data base must be maintained and the need for convergence between Pesa and the execution of the Forest Rights Act. Singh said that while preparing the gram panchayat development plan (GPDP), they should create a new model of development for the tribal community through convergence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-asks-laggard-states-to-expedite-notification-of-pesa/articleshow/87787932.cms||Ambika Pandit

The anti-corruption wing stumbled upon the demonetised notes while conducting a raid at the house of Rusinath Baral, an assistant executive engineer (RD division) of Ranpur in Nayagarh district following allegations that he amassed disproportionate assets (DA). “When we were searching his residence, we found the banned Rs 500 notes worth Rs 35,000 under a bed cushion. We strongly suspect it was his black money,” a vigilance officer said. Further search led to recovery of huge movable and immovable assets to the tune of about Rs 2.51 crore owned by Baral and his kin. The vigilance found a 3-storey building at Chandrasekharpur in Bhubaneswar, a single storey house in Dhenkanal, seven plots at Sadangi in Dhenkanal district and two plots in Bhubaneswar. The vigilance officials also seized Rs 1.30 lakh in cash from his home. Baral has been detained. Same day, the vigilance carried out three more operations against corrupt officers. Assets worth over Rs 1.3 crore were detected in the name of a section officer of the office of Sonepur sub-collector. A revenue inspector was arrested in Sambalpur for allegedly accepting Rs 15,000 bribe. Another revenue inspector was arrested in Koraput district for allegedly accepting Rs 10,000 bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/five-years-after-demonetisation-scrapped-notes-seized-from-odisha-engineers-home/articleshow/87786751.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||India||Abhijit Banerjee flags methodology used for Global Hunger Index rankings||NEW DELHI: India should not take the drop in its Global Hunger Index ranking "seriously" as the methodology used for the exercise is 'model-based' and not survey-based, renowned economist and Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee said on Thursday. Addressing virtually an event organised by industry body CII, Banerjee further said the credit mechanism does not work well in India as banks do not want to give loans to small and medium enterprises.  According to the 2021 Global Hunger Index (GHI), prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hungerhilfe, India has slipped to the 101st position out of 116 countries, from its 2020 position of 94th.  It is now behind its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.  "I think they are essentially model-based. I don't think there is any survey that says anything.  "We should not take those numbers (GHI) seriously, they put them out, but they have no idea where they are getting them," he said while replying to a question on the dip in India's rank in the Global Hunger Index.  Banerjee said there was no on ground survey by publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report.  "This (GHI) is coming entirely from small surveys here and there. But scaled surveys that we need, had not happened, so we don't really know," he opined.  Banerjee, currently a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in countries like Ghana and Kenya there is no way to get these (undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting) data.  "All model based, it's sort of calculation of this much income and then in India, this means these people will be pushed below the poverty line... phone based survey, which have their own biases because many people don't have phones," he observed.  The GHI score is calculated on four indicators -- undernourishment, child wasting (share of children under age of five who are wasted i.e. who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition), child stunting (children under age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (mortality rate of children under age of five).  Banerjee further noted that there was a demand shortage in India, especially coming from the low income population in the last five years.  "Under MNREGA, the government should announce that people will have an option of 150 days of wage employment if they want to...I think they won't use it if the economy recovers, but people will feel confident to spend.  "Giving people the confidence to spend, is what the small scale industry sector needs," he said.  The renowned economist emphasised that even a short term demand stimulus would help.  "Shrinking of small scale industries has benefited the formal sector," he added.  Talking about high inflation in India, Banerjee said inflation has always been complicated in the country.  Referring to a recent SBI report, which had said about 80% of the economy is now formal following the digitisation drive and the pandemic, he said the number does not make sense.  "...that number, if we take it seriously, which I loathe to do, would be so depressing but that would mean we have lost something like 20% GDP or something for that to happen.  "GDP must have gone down by that much. If the other sector has not grown by... so much, and one sector has dropped by 30 percentage of GDP, you see what that means, you get something like 15-20 per cent drop in GDP net," he pointed out.  Banerjee said he hopes this has not happened and stressed that data collection in India really needs to improve.  According to the SBI Research report, the digitisation drive and pandemic-induced emergence of the gig economy have led to a faster formalisation of the economy, with the share of the informal sector shrinking to just 15-20 per cent in 2021 from 52.4% in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/abhijit-banerjee-flags-methodology-used-for-global-hunger-index-rankings/articleshow/87787964.cms||---

The survey also shows that 57% in the same age group and 45% of people above 40 years of age feel that education is the biggest determinant of success. Nearly 58% of the youth believe that children today experience more pressure to succeed. "The Changing Childhood Project", is a first-of-its-kind survey to ask multiple generations for their views on the world and what it is like to be a child today. It surveyed more than 21,000 people in the 15-24 and 40 years and above age group in 21 countries in early 2021. Respondents from India were surveyed before the second deadly wave of Covid-19 this year. "In India, where an overwhelming number of the world’s young people reside, it is heartening to see the optimism and value attached to education," said Yasumasa Kimura, Unicef India representative. The survey shows that 64 per cent of young people aged 15-24 in India are likely to believe that the world is becoming a better place. This was higher than the average across 21 countries, which was 57%. However, the survey found half the young people polled from India were concerned about personal information being collected when using the internet. 60% also believe that meeting someone in person after meeting them online is very risky. The report shows that 55% younger people have heard of climate change compared to 42% older people – the biggest overall gap across 21 countries. The younger generation is much more likely to blame companies for climate change. 65% of young respondents from India believe that it is very important for politicians to listen to children’s voices. Almost 57% of young people believe the legal marrying age for women should be older than 18 years. The survey findings from India also show some perception gaps between younger and older respondents. For instance 57% of young people use the internet daily, compared to 27% of older people – the fourth largest generation difference among 21 countries. Besides India, the other countries surveyed include Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, United Kingdom, Ukraine, USA and Zimbabwe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/73-indian-youth-in-unicef-poll-say-quality-of-education-has-become-better-now-than-in-past/articleshow/87788001.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha signs MoU with Save Life Foundation to improve road safety||BHUBANESWAR: The state transport authority (STA) on Thursday signed an MoU with Delhi-based Save Life Foundation (SLF), an NGO working in the field of road safety, to reduce accident deaths. SLF has been tasked to identify accident-prone stretches, find out the causes of accidents and recommend remedial measures to create ‘zero fatality corridors’ in the state. STA said the MoU aims at reducing road deaths in the next three years. "Road safety is a very high priority area for us. SLF has improved road safety situation in various states. I am sure our combined efforts will bring good results in Odisha as well. Once the remedial measures are suggested and implemented, we hope the fatalities will be reduced by around 30-50 per cent,” STA chairman and transport commissioner Arun Bothra said. Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO of SLF, said his agency will work on the ‘zero-fatality corridor’ model through a 360 degree intervention across engineering, emergency trauma care, enforcement and education. The development came close on heels of chief minister Naveen Patnaik launching a road safety initiative under the banner of Rakshak- a first responder’s training programme on November 10. At least 30,000 volunteers, staying or working at eateries and different business establishments located near accident-prone spots, are being trained as first responders to road accidents. It must be noted that road accident-related deaths have increased by nearly 21% from 3,931 deaths in 2014 to 4,738 in 2020 in the state. This despite the Supreme Court committee on road safety directing the state government to bring it down by 50% by 2020. According to the transport department, the accident fatality rate increased abnormally by 25% in the first half 2021 as compared to the first six months of 2020, despite the Covid-induced lockdown. Wary of an alarming rise in road accident deaths in Odisha, the centre recently urged the chief minister Naveen Patnaik to consider adopting a road safety model of Tamil Nadu, which has succeeded in reducing accident fatalities by 54% in the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-signs-mou-with-save-life-foundation-to-improve-road-safety/articleshow/87787062.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The religious event has become an eye-feast to the devotees who were left surprised in a manner it was organized to mark the holy Karthika Pournami. The event was supervised by the founding trustees of the temple PV Krishna Reddy and Sudha Reddy couple. Temple committee members P. Vira Reddy, Vijayalakshmi, Kommareddy Bapi Reddy, Vijaya Bhaskaramma couple, Sumalata, Prasanna and other family members, relatives, villagers, devotees especially women were present in large numbers.  Temple trustees Krishna Reddy and Sudha Reddy handed over the necessary pooja items to the participants of the Koti Vattika Dipotsavam. Archana and special pujas were performed early in the morning at the Mahakshetram ahead of the commencement of Koti Vattika Deepotsvam in the evening. According to the Vaikhanasa Bhagavatshastra at the Mahakshetram, Vedic scholars have organised the Koti Vattika Dipotsavam to mark the Karthika pournami in the month of Karthika. The temple trustees organize daily, partial, monthly, half yearly and annual festivals at the Mahakshetram. On special days like Karthika Pournami and Varalakshmi Vratam, it has become a tradition to organize special pujas seeking the divine support for the welfare of the people in the country and the state, especially around Dokiparru. Priests explained that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu were specially worshiped during the month of Karthika. “Kartikam means lamp. The lamp signifies the divine form of Lord and inner-self. If a single lamp is lit during the month of Karthika, it is as if crore lamps are lit. One should always keep their inner-consciousness lit to do good to the society,” observed the priests. They said that Koti Vattika Dipotsavam was celebrated to keep the devotees alert about their duties towards the God as well as the society. Temple premises was virtually sparkled with thousands of lamps lit by the devotees to mark the Karthika pournami. Temple and surroundings were specially decorated with colourful lights.

The exhumation order came in response to surging anger across Kashmir over the authorities’ initial refusal to hand over the civilians’ corpses to their families for the last rites. The bodies had been buried in Handwara by the police and were being moved to Srinagar, officials were quoted as saying by PTI. Apart from the families of the slain men, Opposition political parties, too, had demanded that the bodies be returned to the families for burial. The two civilians were Altaf Ahmad Bhat, the owner of the building in which the terrorists were hiding, and Mudasir Gul, a dentist by training who was running a call centre on the same premises. Gul, according to the authorities, had been aiding the militants. The J&K police chief, DGP Dilbag Singh, said the police was "open to corrections if anything has gone wrong". He told reporters that they would look into the demands of the families. "We will find out what happened in the Hyderpora encounter. We are for the safety of the people and will not shy away from a probe," the DGP said. The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), meanwhile, demanded a "judicial inquiry" into the killing of civilians in the Hyderpora encounter. It said the same administration could not "act as judge, jury and executioner" and that a judicial inquiry was needed. The police had said that Bhat had been killed in the crossfire and that Gul was an overground worker (for the terrorists), a claim rejected by Gul's family. The other two men killed were identified by the police as foreign terrorist Haidar and his local associate, Amir Ahmad of Banihal. Amir’s family, too, had contested the police claim that he was a terrorist. Srinagar deputy commissioner Ajaz Asad appointed ADC (Srinagar) Khurshid Ahmad Shah as the inquiry officer for the Hyderpora encounter and asked him to submit his report within 15 days. "It has been felt expedient to conduct a magisterial inquiry into the matter so as to ascertain the facts and circumstances related to the incident and the cause of death," the deputy commissioner’s order said. He said a case (FIR vide No. 193/2021) was registered on November 16 at Police Station Sadder, Srinagar "and is under investigation by an SIT". Meanwhile, the ADC (Srinagar) issued a general notice asking the general public or any person who had knowledge of the incident, and was willing to record his/ her statement or wanted to give any other information about the incident, to come to his office for recording of statements within 10 days. Bhat and Gul’s families had staged a sit-in protest in Srinagar demanding the return of the bodies but the protest had been dispersed by the police in the middle of the night. "I am grateful, and also thankful, to L-G Manoj Sinha for ordering a magisterial inquiry into the Hyderpora encounter. I am hopeful that the probe will be taken to its logical conclusion and the truth will come out under the supervision of L-G Sahib," Bhat’s brother, Abdul Majeed, said. "My brother has little children who want to see their father one last time," Majeed had said earlier. Gul’s wife, Humaira, who was there at the sit-in protest in Srinagar along with her 18-month-old daughter, said the police must come up with proof that her husband was an OGW. She said if this was proved, the "police can kill her along with her daughter and one would raise their voice then". National Conference vice-president and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, too, had led a sit-in protest at a local park at Sonwar, close to his Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar, against the government not handing over the bodies of the civilians killed. "I had decided not to stage a sit-in but to knock on other doors, but the way the families of the slain were treated yesterday (Wednesday) evening, I couldn’t control myself and decided to raise my voice," Omar said, adding, "The families were first called to the SP’s office, and then to the PCR, and then asked to wait for two-three days. So I had no option but to join the families in protest." He said that at this stage he has nothing to do with the inquiry ordered into the Hyderpora encounter. Asked about hybrid militants, the former CM said, "I have read so many intelligence reports, and I do watch happenings across the world, but I haven’t heard about hybrid militants. Someone should make me understand what it means," he said. Peoples Conference leaders had also staged massive protests in Srinagar over the killing of the civilians and had demanded that their bodies be immediately handed over to their families for burial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-orders-magisterial-probe-into-hyderpora-encounter-civilians-bodies-exhumed-after-outcry/articleshow/87788049.cms||M Saleem Pandit

On Wednesday, in an apparent attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘saffron politics’ at a rally during the fourth phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ on Purvanchal Expressway at Pakhanpura area in Ghazipur, Akhilesh had reportedly called holy saffron-clad saints ‘chillumjeevi’ (users of pipe used for smoking tobacco or intoxicants) and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of one particular colour).” Swami Jitendranand said, “In his bid to target the BJP and its leadership, the SP chief has insulted the saffron-clad seers and their fraternity by terming them as ‘chillumjeevi’ and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of the same colour).” The Swami also defended chief minister Yogi Adityanath in view of the SP chief’s remark. “Yogi Ji is the head of one of the prime peeths of Sanatan Dharma which is worshipped and honoured since ancient times. Nobody has the right to victimize Yogi for the sake of dirty politics and just because he has become a chief minister,” said Swami Jitendranand. “The SP chief should immediately apologise for the remarks and avoid dragging seers in the political battlefield for petty electoral gains,” said Swami Jitendranand, cautioning Akhilesh that “he will have to face the ire of saffron-clad seers as they will go door-to-door to expose his views”. He added that the “Sant Samaj (seers’ community) will soon launch a campaign against the Samajwadis and Congress leaders targeting the seers’ fraternity for political gains”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhilesh-yadav-must-apologise-for-his-chillumjeevi-remark-sant-samiti/articleshow/87786743.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

It said the magisterial inquiry ordered was unacceptable because "it is the same administration which killed and it cannot act as judge, jury and executioner". The PAGD, while demanding that the two civilians’ bodies be returned to their families for burial, said, "This is a constitutional right and not a favour." "We reject the magisterial inquiry… We demand a credible inquiry, and to our belief it can only be a judicial inquiry. Those who are responsible should be brought to book. This is our demand," PAGD spokesperson Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said after an alliance meeting at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah here. "Mehboobaji (PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti) could not come because she was placed under house arrest, which is unfortunate and condemnable," Tarigami, who is a leader of the CPM, said. "We have demanded in our separate statements that there should be a halt to such destructive incidents. This is not only our concern but of every citizen. The local citizen cannot feel secure in such a situation and there is continuous breach of law by law enforcers, which is unacceptable," he said, adding, "We can have differences of opinion on the political front, but whatever is happening, and in particular this grave tragedy, it remains the important issue for all of us (sic)." The PAGD demanded a judicial inquiry in a time-bound manner. "Those who have been killed cannot be brought back but their families and kin should get justice," he said, adding, "We want to ask questions of the government of India. Is killing innocent civilians necessary for national security, have we come to such a pass? This is our question," Tarigami said. Tarigami said a letter was being sent to the President of India and that the alliance was demanding "a credible inquiry". The PAGD said if its demand was not met, then "our parliamentarians, such as Farooq Sahib, Masoodi Sahib, and Mohammad Akhbar Lone will meet the President. They will take other opposition leaders into confidence and inform the President about the situation in Kashmir". "I want to tell that the government to stop, stop this," he said, adding, "This is a historical fact that when the glass is filled to capacity, water overflows, and the same is the case with patience. Don’t construe patience as silence. You are not gauging things in the right perspective. Irrespective of differences on the political front, we are together and won’t allow Kashmir to turn into a graveyard. This is our belief and this is our appeal to the government to listen to this voice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pagd-demands-judicial-inquiry-says-magisterial-probe-unacceptable-as-govt-cant-act-as-judge-jury-executioner/articleshow/87788096.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The proposal was moved by Shiv Sena corporator Ram Repale and was seconded by party colleague Vikas Repale. The move, timed ahead of the civic elections scheduled early next year, saw minimal resistance from all party netas who supported the same. Following majority netas supporting the proposal, mayor Naresh Mhaske announced the same will now be sent to the state government for implementation. “The Shiv Sena had promised Thane residents staying in houses measuring upto 500sft of tax waiver ahead of the 2017 polls. We had tried to implement the same earlier but are now positive of getting the same implemented by the state government. Once okayed, it will provide relief to lakhs of residents,” he said. Meanwhile, the administration said it will have to analyse the impact of the waiver, if implemented, on the civic treasury considering that a notable chunk of revenue comes from this segment. Interestingly, the House, on Thursday afternoon, had discussed the fragile financial condition of the corporation due to Covid impact with barely Rs 7 crore available in the kitty. A civic official said the volume of flats measuring till 500sft was notable and could possibly dent the corporation fortunes but said would wait till the approval came from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-civic-body-promises-to-waive-property-tax/articleshow/87786729.cms||Manoj Badgeri

In the plea filed through advocate AK Preetha, the girl who belongs to the lower strata of the society and a member of a scheduled class said she was traumatized by the ‘public trial’ conducted by the civil police officer on Pink Patrol duty and had to seek medical treatment. She couldn’t sleep or attend online classes for around two weeks, the girl who is studying in third standard said in the plea. Following the ordeal, she was admitted as an inpatient at a mental health centre at Thiruvananthapuram on September 4th and had to take counselling sessions, as per the petition. Seeking action against the police officer and compensation, it is alleged in the girl’s plea that the state government and the police department engaged in a concerted effort to protect the police officer. The girl was waiting at Moonnumukku near Attingal along with her father to see giant machinery of ISRO being transported by road when the police officer who was in the Pink Police patrol car parked nearby accused her of stealing a mobile phone from the car. The officer tried to disrobe her and her father in the guise of a search and threatened to take them to the police station for a search, it is alleged. While putting them on ‘public trial’, the officer also insulted and intimidated them, the plea said while pointing out that a police official deputed to aid women and children acted in such a highhanded manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pink-patrol-horror-eight-year-old-seeks-rs-50-lakh-as-compensation/articleshow/87786987.cms||Mahir Haneef
---||Delhi||Diners rejoice, restaurateurs relieved, as Delhi restaurants gear up to remain open till 3am||Delhi restaurateurs say the new timelines will bring much relief to the industry ravaged by the pandemic, while diners add that it will improve their dining experience considerablyHow many times has it happened that you are out for dinner and by the time you’re ready for your meal after drinks, it’s already time for the last order? While most diners have complained about the “limited dining hours in Delhi”, restaurateurs have also argued that the 1am deadline was a deterrent for those planning an evening out after office hours on weekdays. To the relief of both parties, in July this year, the excise policy for 2021-22 – announced by the Excise Department on its website – stated that bars in hotels, restaurants and clubs will now be allowed to operate till 3am. The new policy came into effect on November 17, and restaurants are gearing up to remain open till 3am once the paperwork is sorted. Says restaurateur Rahul Singh, “It is already stated in the policy, which is in public domain, that restaurants can remain open till 3am, but we are just waiting for our new licences to reflect the new timings.” Huge relief for an industry impacted by pandemic: RestaurateursCalling it a progressive and much-needed step forward, restaurateurs say that the new timings will help the industry – that is finally getting back on its feet – gain more revenue after suffering losses for almost a year during the pandemic. “The extension in timeline is a huge relief even for diners. I would sometimes ponder over how something that is legal until midnight can suddenly become illegal post that hour? In today’s work-from-anywhere world, where shops are open 24/7, regulations need to keep up with the times. The new timeline will allow consumers to unwind in safer and licensed premises. Delhi is the most-visited city in India and needs to have a vibrant nightlife that caters to global tourists as well. At the same time, Delhiites should not be forced to gulp down drinks in their cars due to a clock monitoring them. The extended timings will also bring relief to the sector which has been ravaged by the pandemic,” says Rahul. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra, who owns multiple outlets in NCR, adds, “This (time extension) is in sync with the best tourist destinations in the world. It will help all stakeholders and aid in making Delhi one of the finest tourist destinations in the country.” Akshay Anand, owner of a restaurant, bar and nightclub, says that out of the many changes that the new excise policy will bring, “the two most-awaited are extension in timelines and the lowering of the drinking age in Delhi, as this will change the nightlife scenario in the city.” “On weekdays, and even weekends, people like to step out late and enjoy their evening without bothering about it being already time for the last order. The timing extension has come at just the right time for us, as it will help businesses, and also guests,” says restaurateur Sahil Sambhi. Extended timelines mean we’ll no longer have to hurry, can enjoy relaxed dining experience: DinersMost diners thought that restaurants’ operational hours in Delhi would change as soon as the new excise policy came into effect. They add that while they do not understand much about licences and business technicalities, this is a change that even they are looking forward to. “Most people in Delhi resort to drinking in their cars because they think that by the time they leave their workplace and drive to a restaurant, they will be left with little time to spend at the establishment. The extension of timings by just two hours will make a huge difference to the dining experience. After all, who wants to reach a restaurant at 10 pm, only to be told to place the last order at midnight?” says Namita Khanna, a resident of Pitampura. Ashish Mehra, a resident of Saket, adds, “As someone who finishes work mostly at 10pm and also works on weekends, I hardly have a social life. But now at least I will have the option to go out and have a few hours to enjoy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diners-rejoice-restaurateurs-relieved-as-delhi-restaurants-gear-up-to-remain-open-till-3am/articleshow/87784386.cms||Divya Kaushik

As testimony resumed inside the Glynn County courthouse, with its four huge columns, arched windows and shaded lawn, a group of mostly Black ministers gathered outside - a sea of dark suits and white collars.  Many carried signs reading, "Black pastors matter", and some wore buttons with Arbery's picture and the hashtag they were using for the case, "#JusticeForAhmaud". A vendor sold T-shirts under one tent while a woman under another offered water and snacks and asked people to put donations in a pickle jar.  The Rev. Al Sharpton announced the rally after a defense attorney intensified frustrations in the coastal Georgia community of Brunswick when he said he didn't want "any more Black pastors" sitting in the courtroom with Arbery's family.  As the crowd grew outside, the Rev. Jesse Jackson once again joined Arbery's family in the courtroom.  The Rev. Gregory Edwards was broadcasting a Facebook Live video back to his friends in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he is pastor of the Resurrected Life Community Church, United Church of Christ. As soon as the call for pastors to come to Brunswick went out, Edwards said, he rearranged his schedule to fly down.  "I would have walked," said Edwards, who also runs a multifaith, multiracial community organizing group. Edwards said he cried when he saw the video of the 25-year-old Black man's shooting death and thought of his three Black adult sons.  "Through technology we have been forced to bear witness to the public executions of our Black brothers and sisters," Edwards said.  A group of businesses in Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County joined together to provide a lunch of free barbecue sandwiches, shrimp and side dishes before the pastors rallied. Organiser Mike Mally said the group wanted to show that the community was united, not divided by race.  "We figured this was a good thing to do with all these visitors," Mally said.  Cellphone video of Arbery's death on February 23, 2020, leaked online about two months later, deepening a national outcry over racial injustice. The defence contends Arbery was killed in self-defense.  The man who shot Arbery, Travis McMichael, testified on Thursday that Arbery did not speak, show a weapon or threaten him in any way before he raised his shotgun and pointed it at him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/black-pastors-rally-outside-trial-over-arberys-killing/articleshow/87788329.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||YSRCP named MLC Koyye Mosenu Raju as candidate for legislative council chairman post||AMARAVATI: YSRCP named MLC Koyye Mosenu Raju as its candidate for legislative council chairman post. Mosenu Raju filed his papers little after the release of notification for the election of the council chairman on Thursday. Mosenu Raju is most likely to be declared elected unopposed on Friday as TDP had not fielded its candidate after dip in the party’s strength in the Upper House. Although, Mosenu Raju is the first-time legislator, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy decided to make him as chairman in order to ensure a dalit leader preside the Upper House. The post of chairman fell vacant following the retirement of MA Shariff of TDP as council member in May. Mosenu Raju, who hails from Kovvur in West Godavari district, was nominated to the state legislative council last year under the Governor’s quota. He has been a long-time loyalist of YSR family and contested as congress candidate from Kovvur assembly constituency in 2009 elections. He, however, lost the election to the TDP nominee TV Ramarao.  Although, he has been with YS Jagan since he floated YSRCP in 2011, Raju could not get the chance to contest assembly elections held in 2014 and 2019. As a reward to his loyalty, Jagan initially brought him to council and subsequently named him as chairman.  Mosenu Raju’s nomination was proposed by fellow legislators Balli Kalyan Chakravarthi, Duvvada Srinivas and Gangula Prabhakara Reddy. Raju handed over the nomination papers to legislature secretary Balakrishnamacharyulu. “It is the blood of YSR family to recognize and reward the loyal party activists,” said Raju after filing the papers. He said that he had never disappointed despite the fact that he had to wait for his turn for nearly a decade as he is aware of YS Jagan’s commitment to recognize the services of the sincere and dedicated activists.  Jagan has already made a Backward Classes leader – Tammineni Sitaram as the Speaker of the state assembly. It is reliably learnt that CM is contemplating to name either a muslim or Yadav MLC as deputy chairman of the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrcp-named-mlc-koyye-mosenu-raju-as-candidate-for-legislative-council-chairman-post/articleshow/87788284.cms||Samdani MN
---||World||Georgia's citizen's arrest law key to defense in Arbery case||A key defense argument for the three white men on trial in Georgia for killing Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger, is that they were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a Civil War-era law that was later repealed amid an uproar over the shooting. The defense can still use the repealed law in their defence because, as one lawyer said, it was "the law of the land" at the time of the February 2020 shooting. It was legal in Georgia for people to arrest someone where they had "reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion" that the person had just committed a felony. Lawmakers now limit citizen detainment to specific circumstances, such as shopkeepers who see a theft or restaurant workers seeing a "dine-and-dash". Most US states have codified some form of a law allowing citizen's arrests. Ira Robbins, a law professor at American University in Washington, wrote in an academic paper, "While recruiting citizens to aid in eradicating crime is a noble idea, strict safeguards are needed to prevent the law being abused."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/georgias-citizens-arrest-law-key-to-defense-in-arbery-case/articleshow/87788395.cms||---

The fishing vessel, which was taking on water in its engine room, was stabilised by the crew of ICGS Sujeet and then towed back to Mormugao harbour for repairs. The Indian Coast Guard received a distress message at 12:45pm and ICGS Sujeet, which was patrolling the area was asked to search and assist the Karnataka registered fishing trawler Madhava Mangala. “On receipt of the message, the ship immediately proceeded for rescue despite the rough seas and strong winds due to the low pressure persisting off Goa. The ship rendered assistance by sending the technical support team to the boat for deflooding the engine room and brought the fishing boat to floating condition,” said a coast guard official. ICGS Sujeet towed the fishing vessel through the rough weather conditions and brought the vessel towards Mormugao harbour, from where another vessel, the ICGS Amal, assisted in bringing the fishing boat alongside. IMD had warned of thunderstorms accompanied with lightning for the current week, and had advised fishermen not to venture out to sea. Squally weather with wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph are likely to prevail along the Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka coast, the IMD warning had said. Subsequently, with the help of MPT, the fishing vessel was shifted to Khariwada fishing jetty and later handed over to the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-coast-guard-rescues-five-fishermen-from-sinking-fishing-vessel/articleshow/87788407.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||World||Ahmaud Arbery murder trial: Killer testifies the Black man never threatened him||BRUNSWICK: The man who killed Ahmaud Arbery testified Thursday that Arbery did not speak, show a weapon or threaten him in any way before he raised his shotgun and pointed it at the 25-year-old Black man.  Under cross-examination by the prosecution on his second day of testimony, Travis McMichael said he was "under the impression" that Arbery could be a threat because he was running straight at him and he had seen Arbery trying to get into the truck of a neighbour who had joined in a pursuit of Arbery.  "All he's done is run away from you," prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said. "And you pulled out a shotgun and pointed it at him."  Cellphone video from the February 23, 2020, shooting - replayed in court Thursday - shows Arbery running around the back of McMichael's pickup truck after McMichael first points the shotgun while standing next to the open driver's side door. Arbery then runs around the passenger side as McMichael moves to the front and the two come face to face. The truck blocks any view of them until the first gunshot sounds.  McMichael's remarks Wednesday marked the first time any of the three white men charged with murder in Arbery's death speaking publicly about the killing. He testified Wednesday that Arbery forced him to make a split-second "life-or-death" decision by attacking him and grabbing his shotgun.  Dunikoski noted Thursday that's not what McMichael told police in an interview about two hours after the shooting occurred.  "So you didn't shoot him because he grabbed the barrel of your shotgun," Dunikoski said. "You shot him because he came around that corner and you were right there and you just pulled the trigger immediately."  "No, I was struck," McMichael replied. "We were face to face, I'm being struck and that's when I shot."  McMichael said he had approached Arbery because neighbours indicated something had happened down the road in his coastal Georgia neighborhood of Brunswick and he wanted to ask Arbery about it. Arbery was running in the neighbourhood at the time. He said Arbery stopped, then took off running when McMichael told him police were on the way.  Asked how many times he had previously pulled up behind strangers in the neighbourhood to ask them what they were doing there, McMichael said never.  "You know that no one has to talk to anyone they don't want to talk to, right," Dunikoski asked.  The prosecutor also pressed McMichael on why he didn't include some details of his testimony Wednesday in his written statement to police, namely the part about his telling Arbery police were on the way.  McMichael said he was "under stress, nervous, scared" at the time of his police interview and "probably being choppy".  "What were you nervous about," Dunikoski asked.  "I just killed a man," McMichael responded. "I had blood on myself. It was the most traumatic event of my life."  "You were nervous because you thought you were going to jail, right," Dunikoski asked.  "No. I gave them a statement," McMichael said.  McMichael and his father Greg armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck after he ran past their home from the house under construction. A neighbour, William "Roddie" Bryan, joined the chase in his own truck and recorded cellphone video. Arbery's killing deepened a national outcry over racial injustice after the video of his death leaked online. Meanwhile, outside the Glynn County courthouse Thursday, hundreds of pastors gathered in response to a defense lawyer's bid to keep Black ministers out of the courtroom.  The Rev. Jesse Jackson again joined Arbery's family in the courtroom, even as Bryan attorney Kevin Gough renewed his request to keep pastors like Jackson out. The issue was brought up outside the jury's presence, and Judge Timothy Walmsley declined to take it up again, noting he'd already rejected the same motion twice.  "The court's position is already in the record," Walmsley said.  Gough first asked the judge last week to remove the Rev. Al Sharpton from the court, saying the civil rights activist was trying to influence the jury, which is disproportionately white. The later called Gough's remarks "reprehensible."  Prosecutors contend there was no justification for McMichael and his father to arm themselves and chase Arbery when he ran past their Georgia home. The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery was a burglar because security cameras had recorded him several times in the unfinished house on their street.  Prosecutors say the men chased Arbery for five minutes and used their trucks to prevent him from fleeing their neighborhood before Travis McMichael shot him. They say there's no evidence that Arbery - who had enrolled at a technical college to study to become an electrician like his uncles - had committed any crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ahmaud-arbery-murder-trial-killer-testifies-the-black-man-never-threatened-him/articleshow/87788533.cms||---

The governor's eleventh-hour reprieve followed the clemency recommendation of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which voted 3-1 on November 1 that Jones' sentence should be commuted to life in prison.  "After prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case, I have determined to commute Julius Jones' sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole," Stitt said in a statement.  The commutation was filed just over four hours before Jones was to die by lethal injection of a three-drug cocktail that his lawyers had challenged as inhumane in a separate last-minute appeal.  Jones, 41, was convicted of fatally shooting insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking in his driveway.  But his lawyers have cited evidence that he was home with his family when the murder occurred, which they said the jury never learned because his lawyers at the time failed to fully investigate it.  The case, which has drawn widespread interest from celebrities, including Kim Kardashian West, and anti-death penalty activists, sparked several protests and vigils across the state in the past two days.  A crowd outside the state penitentiary in McAlester where Jones was scheduled to be put to death erupted in cheers after learning of the governor's decision. Supporters chanted Jones' name, hugged and wiped away tears, video posted on Twitter showed.  Amanda Bass, an attorney for Jones, said she regretted that the governor did not adopt the board's recommendation to allow Jones the possibility of parole, but was grateful Stitt did not allow "an irreparable mistake" to take place.  "Governor Stitt took an important step today towards restoring public faith in the criminal justice system by ensuring that Oklahoma does not execute an innocent man," she said in a statement.  Jones was among five condemned inmates who won stays of execution from a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit US Court of Appeals on October 27.  But the US Supreme Court lifted the stays the next day, allowing the state to resume executions for the first time since 2015 by putting to death John Grant, another of the five inmates, hours later by lethal injection.  Witnesses said Grant convulsed and vomited before dying, while the state Department of Corrections said there were no complications.  Grant had been a plaintiff in a lawsuit set to go to trial next year challenging the three-drug protocol that ended his life as inhumane, but the state refused to postpone his execution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/oklahoma-governor-spares-death-row-inmate-in-last-minute-reprieve/articleshow/87788564.cms||---

The new enclave of 60 buildings in the Shi Yomi district, which did not exist in 2019, has come up “six km inside” the territory claimed by India “in the region between the LAC and the International Boundary” shown on Indian maps, as per NDTV, which accessed the satellite images. The Army, on being contacted by TOI, however, said the “location in question lies north of the LAC” as per the coordinates. An officer, in turn, added that “there has been no such construction within our perception of the LAC”. The 3,488-km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, is the demarcation that separates the Indian-controlled territory from the Chinese, though the two sides have “differing perceptions” of the line with Beijing refusing to “jointly clarify” it till now. China, of course, continues with its salami-slicing tactics to nibble away territory of its neighbours like India and Bhutan. This is the second such newly-constructed Chinese village that has recently come to light on the disputed territory in Arunachal Pradesh. The first was the 100-home village constructed on the banks of River Tsari Chu in the Upper Subansiri district last year, which lies 93 km west of the second enclave. The disputed area in the Upper Subansiri district has been under China’s “adverse occupation” since the Longju incident in 1959. As reported by TOI earlier, China has been building as many as 628 ‘xiaokang’ model border defence villages to fortify the borders of the Tibetan Autonomous Region with India and Bhutan over the last few years. Though a lot of these “dual-use” villages lie on the Chinese side of the LAC, some are on disputed territory with India. “After the Doklam face-off in 2017, China has also constructed some new villages on Bhutanese territory,” said an official. Responding to the Chinese village constructed in the Upper Subansiri district, the external affairs ministry on November 11 said, “China has undertaken construction activities in the past several years along the border areas, including those that it has illegally occupied over the decades. India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/second-chinese-village-along-arunachal-border-sat-images/articleshow/87788526.cms||---

Faulting the closure of CBI’s preliminary enquiry (PE) despite listing numerous irregularities in the sale in the PSU while brushing aside the CAG’s critical report, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna ordered CBI to conduct full-fledged investigations into 18 suspicious grounds surrounding the deal. “There is sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26% disinvestment of HZL by the Union government in 2002. The CBI is directed to register a regular case and proceed in accordance with law. The CBI is directed to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this court. The aforesaid reports shall be submitted every quarter, or as otherwise directed by this court,” the bench said, while green-signalling the selling of the government’s residuary 29.5% stake in HZL, a decision taken in 2012 by the UPA government. The sale had taken place during the tenure of the Vajpayee government. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, “The Union government is a shareholder of HZL. The control and management of HZL does not vest with the Union government which has a residual stake of 29.54%. The shareholding of Sterlite Opportunities and Ventures Ltd (SOVL) stood increased to 64.92% after the exercise of the first call option in 2002. During the course of hearing, this court has been apprised by Sterlite that it does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the share purchase agreement. “It is in this backdrop that a decision has been taken by the Union government to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market. The Union government, in its capacity as a shareholder of HZL, is entitled to take such a decision. The fact that the Union government is amenable to the norms set out in Part III of the Constitution would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, so long as the process of disinvestment is transparent and the Union government is following a process which comports with law and results in the best price being realised for its shareholding.” The bench further said, “The Union government has stated through the solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the residual shareholding shall be divested in the open market and shall take place in accordance with the rules and regulations of SEBI to ensure that the best price is realized for the sale of the shareholding.” The Centre first divested 24.08% of its stake in HZL in 1991-92 when Manmohan Singh was finance minister and scripted the liberalisation of the Indian economy. In April 2002, the Centre had sold off 26% of its share for Rs 445 crore to SOVL. Sterlite acquired another 20% of HZL share from the open market, raising its shareholding in the erstwhile PSU to 46%. Under the 2002 shareholders’ agreement, which envisaged two call options, Sterlite exercised its first one for 18.92% of HZL equity in August 2003, which was transferred in its favour in November 2003. Sterlite became majority shareholder with 64.92% stake in HZL. In 2012, the Centre had decided to disinvest its residuary shareholding of 29.54% in HZL. On November 6, 2013, the CBI had initiated a PE investigation into suspected irregularities in the course of the disinvestment of the 26% equity holding of the Union government to Sterlite in 2002. The CBI special prosecutor, director of prosecution and the special director had concurred on closure of the PE. But the CBI additional director had insisted on converting the PE into a regular case. After scrutinising the reasons given for closure of PE, the bench said, “Upon perusal of the aforementioned reports and recommendations, it is our considered opinion that the disinvestment in 2002 evinces a prime facie case for registration of a regular case.” It then listed out 18 counts on which a regular case should have been registered, while agreeing with advocate Prashant Bhushan for a full fledged CBI probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-orders-cbi-probe-into-hzl-divestment-in-2002/articleshow/87788642.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Will back calls taken in national interest: PM to bankers||NEW DELHI: Weeks after the arrest of former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri rattled the financial sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to stand like a rock behind decisions taken by bankers in the national interest. “The ground is ready (to leapfrong). The most important thing that I have repeatedly said: I am with you, I am near you and I am for you on every step that is taken in national interest, with an honest intent. If there are mistakes when you take decisions that are honest, authentic and in the national interest, if you ever face difficulty, I am ready to stand like a wall. But we need to fulfil our responsibilities to take the country forward. Generations will not spare us if we waste the opportunity when there is such a strong foundation, a huge opportunity, with possibility that sky's the limit,” he said at a meeting of state-run bank executives. The statement comes amid concerns from top bankers following the arrest of Chaudhuri who had joined an asset reconstruction company (ARC) after his retirement from SBI. The ARC was trying to recover the dues from a loan given by SBI for a hotel project in Rajasthan. Chaudhuri is currently out on bail. Several bankers have expressed reservations over sanctioning loans, fearing adverse action by probe agencies after several years. The government has repeatedly sought to comfort them, even as it has gone about recovering loans from several defaulters and sought action in cases such as Kingfisher and Bhushan Steel, among others. Modi suggested that the efforts, including the enactment of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, had helped banks recover Rs 5 lakh crore extended as loans to defaulters. “In our attempt to bring back fugitive (economic offenders), we relied on policies, law and also used diplomatic channels. The message is very clear -- return to your country. We are continuing these efforts,” he said. The PM said the government expected around Rs 2 lakh crore of stressed assets to be resolved in the coming years following the establishment of the National Asset Reconstruction Company, with government guarantee of Rs 30,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-back-calls-taken-in-national-interest-pm-to-bankers/articleshow/87788714.cms||---

"Something we're considering," Biden said when asked if a diplomatic boycott was under consideration as he sat down for a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  A diplomatic boycott would mean that US officials would not attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.  A US decision not to send diplomats would be a rebuke of Chinese President Xi Jinping just days after Xi and Biden worked to ease tensions in a virtual summit, their first extensive talks since Biden took office in January.  Activists and members of Congress from both parties have been pressing the Biden administration to diplomatically boycott the event given that the US government accuses China of carrying out a genocide against Muslim ethnic groups in its western Xinjiang region, something that Beijing denies.  White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told a regular briefing on Thursday that US consideration of a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics was driven by concerns about human rights practices in Xinjiang province.  "There are areas that we do have concerns: human rights abuses," Psaki told reporters. "We have serious concerns."  "Certainly there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be," she said, while declining to provide a timeline for a decision.  "I want to leave the president the space to make decisions," she said.  Sources with knowledge of the administration's thinking have told Reuters there was a growing consensus within the White House that it should keep US officials away from the Games.  Last week, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington was talking to countries around the world about "how they're thinking about participation," but left a deadline for a decision unclear.  A bipartisan group of the US senators in October proposed an amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would prohibit the US State Department from spending federal funds to "support or facilitate" the attendance of US government employees at the Games.  Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also called for a diplomatic boycott, saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.  Some Republican lawmakers have been calling for a complete boycott of the Olympics.  Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas told a news conference on Thursday that a diplomatic boycott of what he called the "genocide Olympics" would be "too little, too late" and said no US athletes, officials, or US corporate sponsors should take part.  Nikki Haley, a Republican former US ambassador to the United Nations, also had called for a complete boycott, saying attending would send a message that America was willing to turn a blind eye to genocide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics/articleshow/87788755.cms||---

A final decision in this regard will be taken once the ministry analyses comments and views of stakeholders after two months. The proposal was coincidentally issued as draft notification in a gazette on November 1 at a time when the country was negotiating its position on various issues, including use of fossil fuels and its fair share in carbon space at the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK. Stakeholders and experts are expected to share their views on this draft proposal with the ministry by the end of next month. The ministry had in January 2019 issued a notification declaring certain coastal stretches as CRZ, restricting setting up and expanding industries, operations and processes in the ecologically-fragile zone along coasts. However, now it proposed easing out such restrictions for oil & natural gas drilling operations, acting on requests of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, and other stakeholders, and subsequent recommendation of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA). “In post-liberalisation India, regulatory instruments like CRZ were introduced to balance the government’s economic priorities with the duty to protect environment and ensure social welfare. These instruments have always been amenable to introducing amendments in favour of specific projects or sectoral demands. However, the proposed changes to the CRZ is unapologetic about foregrounding the demand of the oil and gas industry as a justification, and contravenes the objective of the notification set up to ‘conserve and protect’ coastal stretches and ensure ‘livelihood security’ of fisher and other communities,” said Kanchi Kohli, senior researcher at the Delhi-based think-tank, Centre for Policy Research (CPR). “It is also important to locate this (proposed) amendment along with the series of changes made to the impact assessment and public hearings procedures for the oil and gas industry over the last two years. The sector has been recognised for production maximisation by the government. Amendments such as the one proposed can be understood to be responding to this call, and are not intended be based on studying the socio-ecological implications of this deregulation,” she added. The ministry through its draft has also proposed other changes in the CRZ notification, 2019, such as retaining “purely temporary and seasonal structures (shacks)” during the monsoon season with adequate precautions, and giving regulatory power to concerned coastal zone management authority in the state in case of giving clearances to stand-alone jetties, breakwaters, salt works, slipways and manual erosion control bunds. This move of decentralisation may speed up the process of creating such structures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-moots-exempting-oil-drilling-from-prior-crz-nod/articleshow/87788753.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Biden kicks off North American Leaders Summit with one-on-one meet with Trudeau, EV dispute discussion on cards||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden kicked off the North American Leaders Summit on Thursday with a one-on-one meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling their two countries' relationship one of the easiest in the early going of his presidency.  But as Biden and Trudeau sat down for talks, he also confirmed that the two leaders would discuss their differences over proposed electric vehicle tax incentives in his massive social services and climate bill that is causing concern in Ottawa.  "We're going to talk about that," Biden said. "It hasn't even passed yet in the House."  Biden was meeting later with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and the three leaders were also to meet together as they revived a near-annual summit that went dormant during President Donald Trump's time in office. Trudeau and Lopez Obrador were also meeting separately with Vice President Kamala Harris.  A provision in the United States spending plan would offer American consumers a $7,500 tax credit if they buy electric vehicles through 2026. The following year, only purchases of electric vehicles made in the US would qualify for the credit. The base credit would go up by $4,500 if the vehicle was made at a US plant that operates under a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement.  The union provision has sparked pushback from some non-union shops and lawmakers. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden "is pretty committed to the bill providing good-paying union jobs."  Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland on Wednesday called the incentive a clear violation of an updated trade agreement among the three countries that aimed to protect US jobs and products made in North America.  Trudeau, Freeland and other Canadian ministers met with the US officials on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to express their concerns. And Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said she raised concerns about the electric vehicle provision with secretary of state Antony Blinken last week.  Freeland said that for Canada, "Job one here in the US this week is to really make our American counterparts aware of the extent to which their current approach to this issue is a problem for Canada and to really explain to them that the way they have formulated this incentive really, really has the potential to become the dominant issue in our bilateral relationship."  As Biden, Trudeau and Lopez Obrador resume the tradition of the North America Leaders' Summit, the three allies also face deep differences on migration and climate issues.  There's "not that much in common between them, at least in their vision for what they want for their countries," said Kenneth Frankel, president of the Canadian Council for the Americas. "Not just what they want for their countries, but what they can deliver for their countries."  Thursday's meetings at the White House marks the first trilateral get-together for North American leaders since a June 2016 gathering of Trudeau, Barack Obama and Enrique Pena Nieto in Ottawa. The gatherings took a hiatus under former president Donald Trump who feuded with Trudeau and Nieto during his tenure.  Biden has made some progress in repairing relations with the US neighbors after the turbulent Trump years. But many significant strains remain - and some new ones have emerged.  Mexico's priorities heading into the summit were to obtain concrete advances on immigration and more equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.  The tradition of three-way meetings started when George W Bush played host to Mexico's Vicente Fox and Canada's Paul Martin in 2005 for talks at his ranch in Waco, Texas.  Biden has already held separate virtual meetings with Trudeau in February and Lopez Obrador in March.  The US and Canada, meanwhile, have expressed frustration that Lopez Obrador has failed to get on board with global efforts to curb climate emissions. The Mexican president skipped this month's UN climate summit in Glasgow.  Lopez Obrador's government, for its part, wants promised US development funds for the Northern Triangle countries of Central America to be firmed up. The Mexican leader continues to press the US to fund an expansion of his tree planting program to Central America.  Mexico has worked with the United States - under both Trump and Biden - to control migrant flows and assist in returning migrants to Central America. The two countries are still negotiating the court-ordered re-implementation of a Trump-era policy known as Remain in Mexico, which forced asylum seekers to wait out their U.S. asylum process in Mexico. Psaki said that the policy was not expected to be a major topic of discussions at Thursday's meeting.  Lopez Obrador has also mentioned on multiple occasions his interest in the U.S. government expanding its temporary work visa program so more Mexicans and Central Americans can fill the demand for labor in the U.S. The temporary workers in turn could have access to the higher pay they seek in the U.S. without becoming part of the illegal immigration flow.  Arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his government would focus on three issues: the pandemic, economic integration and immigration. On immigration, Ebrard said Mexico would try to rally support for two of Lopez Obrador's signature social programs - tree planting and youth job opportunities - to reduce the push factors of migration. Ken Salazar, the US ambassador to Mexico, recently expressed "serious concerns" about the Mexican government's attempts to limit competition in the electrical power sector.  Trudeau and Biden are also expected to discuss the future of an oil pipeline that crosses part of the Great Lakes and is the subject of rising tension over whether it should be shut down. Biden is caught in a battle over Enbridge's Line 5, a key segment of a pipeline network that carries Canadian oil across the U.S. Midwest.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and Biden ally, has demanded closure of the 68-year-old line because of the potential for a catastrophic rupture along a 4-mile section (6.4 kilometers) in the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. The Biden administration has not taken a position but is under increasing pressure to do so.  Canada last month invoked a 1977 treaty that guarantees the unimpeded transit of oil between the two nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-kicks-off-north-american-leaders-summit-with-one-on-one-meet-with-trudeau-ev-dispute-discussion-on-cards/articleshow/87788915.cms||---
---||World||Divided House debates Democrats' expansive social, climate bill||WASHINGTON: A divided House finally launched debate Thursday on Democrats' expansive social and environment bill, with party leaders hoping that cost estimates expected from Congress' top fiscal analyst would nail down moderate lawmakers' votes and allow passage by week's end.  Two weeks after centrists' objections forced Democrats to delay the measure, the Bill began moving amid optimistic signs from leaders and lawmakers that their divisions were all but resolved - for now. Facing uniform Republican opposition, Democrats can lose no more than three votes to prevail in the House.  The package, a top priority for President Joe Biden, would bolster child care assistance, create free preschool, curb seniors' prescription drug costs and beef up efforts to slow climate change.  Biden and other Democratic leaders have said the 10-year, $1.85 trillion measure would pay for itself, largely through tax increases on the wealthy, big corporations and companies doing business abroad.  A cost estimate on the bill, promised by Friday from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, was expected to show a modestly higher price tag and deficits of perhaps $200 billion over the coming decade. Early signs were that those differences were unlikely to derail the legislation, which exceeds 2,100 pages.  "Each of these investments on its own will make an extraordinary impact on the lives of American families," said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., ticking off the bill's initiatives. Noting that savings would come from higher levies on the rich and corporations, he added, "It's a helluva deal."  Republicans said the legislation would damage an economy already racked by inflation, give tax breaks to some wealthy taxpayers and make government bigger and more intrusive. Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Budget Committee's top Republican, used alliteration from Biden's name for the measure - Build Back Better - to mock it.  "Bankrupts the economy. Benefits the wealthy. And it builds the Washington machine," Smith said.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she was hoping the chamber would vote on the measure later Thursday, reflecting Democratic plans to approve the measure before leaving for a weeklong holiday break. "This is going to be a wonderful Thanksgiving," she said.  The debate came with Democrats hoping to move toward delivering a badly needed victory for Biden. For months, the bill has been delayed by infighting between party moderates and progressives over the measure's cost and the policies it should include.  Biden this week signed a $1 trillion package of highway and other infrastructure projects, which he's spent recent days promoting around the country. But he's been battered recently by falling approval numbers in polls, reflecting voters' concerns over inflation, supply chain delays and the persistent coronavirus pandemic.  After months of talks, lawmakers appeared eager to wrap it up, shelving lingering differences to begin selling the package back home. House Democrats said they were planning 1,000 events across the country by year's end to pitch the measure's benefits to voters.  Democrats have struggled to explain the far-reaching scope of the bill, with its health, child care and other provisions affecting millions of Americans. The internal battling has often overshadowed the actual bill, weighing down Democrats as they prepare for potentially difficult midterm elections next year.  House passage of the social and environment bill would send it to the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats have zero votes to spare. Significant changes there are likely due to cost-cutting demands by moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.  Senate talks could take weeks, and the prospect that Manchin or others will force additional cuts in the measure was making it easier for House moderates to back the legislation Thursday. The altered bill would have to return to the House before going to Biden's desk.  Even as lawmakers debated the legislation, Democrats were set to change it before the House votes to make sure it doesn't run afoul of Senate rules. Democrats are using special rules that would let the bill pass the Senate by a simple majority, not the usual 60 votes, but such legislation must follow certain budget constraints.  When moderates delayed House passage of the bill two weeks ago, they said they wanted to make sure the CBO's projections for its costs were similar to White House numbers, which showed the measure essentially paid for itself.  Some differences, however, were expected between the CBO and White House estimates.  A chief discrepancy was expected to be over a White House estimate that giving the IRS an additional $80 billion for stepped-up enforcement would yield $480 billion in new tax collections over a decade, a net gain of $400 billion. The CBO, using stricter estimating guidelines, was expected to envision half that amount in new revenue.  The House's addition of a paid family leave program was also expected to increase the legislation's cost. That program faces objections from Manchin and seems likely to be dropped by the Senate.  Some moderates have already said projections over IRS savings are always uncertain and would not cause them to oppose the measure. Others have said the measure's roughly $555 billion in tax credits and other costs to encourage cleaner energy need not be paid for in the bill because global warming is an existential crisis.  Critics have said the bill's overall cost would exceed $4 trillion if Democrats hadn't made temporary some of its programs they would actually like to be permanent. For example, tax credits for children and low-earning workers, top party priorities, are extended for just one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/divided-house-debates-democrats-expansive-social-climate-bill/articleshow/87788932.cms||---
---||India||India, China agree to go for more military talks||NEW DELHI: After the LAC disengagement talks between senior commanders last month ended on a sour note with both sides blaming each other for the continued deadlock, India and China were back on the dialogue table Thursday with another round of diplomatic talks to resolve the situation in eastern Ladakh. The 23rd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) saw India seeking early and complete disengagement from all friction points along the LAC in the western sector and the two sides agreeing to have another round of military talks soon. There was no sign of any breakthrough though with both India and China reiterating their respective positions in separate statements after what was the 9th meeting of WMCC since the Galwan incident last year. The Chinese readout also didn't mention complete disengagement even as it spoke about efforts to settle the remaining issue and to shift from "urgent dispute settlement" to regular border management and control. They recalled the agreement between foreign minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi during their meeting in September in Dushanbe that military and diplomatic officials of the two sides should continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. Accordingly, India said in its readout, the two sides had candid and in-depth discussions on the situation along the LAC in western sector of India-China border areas and also reviewed the developments since the last meeting of the senior commanders of both sides last month. "In this regard they agreed on the need to find an early resolution to the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols so as to restore peace and tranquility. The two sides also agreed that both sides should in the interim also continue to ensure a stable ground situation and avoid any untoward incident," said the government. "It was agreed that both sides should hold the next (14th) round of the Senior Commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols," it added. According to China, both sides called for continuous efforts to further de-escalate the border situation, and said they would strive to shift from "urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control at an early date". "Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels, actively prepare for the 14th round of Senior Commanders Meeting, and make efforts to settle the remaining issues in the western sector of the China-India border," said China in its statement. "The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent developments in the China-India border areas, and agreed to consolidate the existing outcomes of the disengagement, strictly abide by the agreements and protocols and the consensus reached between the two sides, prevent the situation on the ground from relapsing," it added. After the last round of military talks, the government had accused China of ignoring India's "constructive suggestions" and not coming up with any forward-looking proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-china-agree-to-go-for-more-military-talks/articleshow/87788971.cms||---

India never joined the review trial because of Pakistan’s refusal to grant unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Jadhav and to allow India to appoint an Indian lawyer for him. India has maintained since the Bill was introduced in Pakistan’s Parliament that any new law will not help until Islamabad agrees to provide what it calls remedial consular access to Jadhav in line with the spirit of the ICJ judgment. “We have seen reports of Pakistan enacting into law the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. “Nothing could have been further from the truth. As stated earlier, the ordinance did not create the machinery for an effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-rejects-pakistan-law-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-says-it-will-be-of-little-use/articleshow/87789110.cms||---

They were not allowed to board the flight even though they took Rapid RT-PCR tests at the airport for Rs 3,000 each. All Indian passengers headed to the UAE must clear this pre-departure test, besides carrying RT-PCR negative reports not older than 48 hours. Rukhsar Memon, 28, husband Suhail Syed, 39, and his mother Mamtaz Munawar, 63, had come to Bengaluru for their annual holiday at their Nandidurga Road home on October 9 this year. On Tuesday morning, the family went to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to board the IndiGo flight 6E 95 from Bengaluru to Dubai scheduled to take off at 1.15pm. As per pre-departure requirement for UAE travelers, the three, including 13-week pregnant Rukhsar, took Rapid RT-PCR tests outside KIA and secured negative reports for Rs 9,000 before reaching the IndiGo check-in counter around 10am on Tuesday. Then came the one-minute shocker. “We were denied boarding for the 1.15pm flight on Tuesday as the IndiGo ground staff said our initial RT-PCR test reports showed that our samples were collected at 1.15pm on Sunday,” recalled Suhail, who works as a sales executive with a Dubai-based health insurance firm. The airline calculates the 48-hour validity period from the time of sample collection. The IndiGo ground staff told the family that by the time the flight takes off at 1.15pm, their RT-PCR reports will be “aged one minute over the mandated 48 hours”. “We requested the IndiGo manager at the airport to kindly consider us since we were well within the 48-hour validity when we reached the airport. My pregnant wife and my elderly mother were travelling with me. The employees were rude to us, especially the airline manager, as they dragged us for three long hours and finally denying us boarding,” said Suhail on his family’s ordeal. Sources with IndiGo’s ground staff confirmed the incident and said they were following the Covid protocol rules. The family has lodged a complaint with IndiGo about the incident due to which they had to undergo humiliation and financial losses. There was no official response from the airline till Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-test-lapses-by-1-minute-pregnant-woman-and-2-others-denied-boarding/articleshow/87789329.cms||Petlee Peter
---||India||Skin-to-skin touch not a must for sex assault: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Holding that physical contact with a child with sexual intent could not be trivialised by excluding it from the ambit of sexual assault, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that direct skin-to-skin touch is not essential and even indirect touch amounts to an offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. A bench of Justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi quashed two judgments of the Bombay high court which had held that "skin to skin" contact was essential for the purpose of proving the charge of sexual offence under Pocso and held that a narrow interpretation of "physical contact" would defeat the purpose of the Act, which was framed to protect children. The high court ruling had caused widespread consternation as it could have allowed offenders to exploit the reference to escape the ambit of the law. "The act of touching any sexual part of the body of a child with sexual intent or any other act involving physical contact with sexual intent could not be trivialised or held insignificant or peripheral so as to exclude such act from the purview of 'sexual assault' under Section 7," the bench said. It noted use of gloves, cloth, or contact through clothes, or even use of condoms, could have been excluded in the light of the HC orders despite sexual intent. The HC verdict passed in January had led to considerable outrage and it was attorney general K K Venugopal who challenged it before the Supreme Court saying the order was outrageous and will have wider ramifications on 43,000 Pocso cases registered every year in the country. It is the only second time in the history of the SC that the attorney general moved court against an HC order. The first was in 1985 when the then AG challenged a Rajasthan HC order directing execution of death sentence by public hanging. The National Commission for Women and Maharashtra government had also subsequently filed appeals against the HC verdict. "Restricting the interpretation of the words 'touch' or 'physical contact' to 'skin to skin contact' would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision contained in Section 7 of the Pocso Act, but it would lead to an absurd interpretation of the said provision. 'Skin to skin contact' for constituting an offence of sexual assault could not have been intended or contemplated by the legislature," Justice Trivedi, who penned the judgment for herself and Justice Lalit, said. "The very object of enacting the POCSO Act is to protect the children from sexual abuse, and if such a narrow interpretation is accepted, it would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act, inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent, would not amount to an offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Pocso Act. The most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Act is 'sexual intent' and not 'skin to skin' contact with the child," she said. In a separate but concurrent verdict, Justice Bhat said that the fallacy in the HC's reasoning is that it assumed that indirect touch is not covered by Section 7 or, in other words, is no touch at all. He said the section covers both direct and indirect touch. "In plain English, to touch is to engage in one of the most basic of human sensory perceptions. The receptors on the surface of the human body are acutely sensitive to the subtleties of a whole range of tactile experiences. The use of a spoon, for instance, to consume food, without touching it with hand, in no way diminishes the sense of touch that is experienced by the lips and the mouth. Similarly, when a stick or other object is pressed onto a person, even when clothed, their sense of touch is keen enough to feel it. Therefore, the reasoning in the high court’s judgment quite insensitively trivialises — indeed legitimises — an entire range of unacceptable behaviour which undermines a child’s dignity and autonomy, through unwanted intrusions," Justice Bhat said. The bench said that HC ignored surrounding circumstances — like the accused having taken the victim to his house, unzipping his pants, contact with sexual organs and attempt to remove clothes of the victim — all of which justified the conclusion about the culpable mental state of the accused. "...whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of 'sexual assault' under Section 7 of the Pocso Act. In view of the discussion made earlier, the prosecution was not required to prove a 'skin to skin' contact for the purpose of proving the charge of sexual assault under the Act," the bench said while convicting both the accused under the Pocso Act. While one convict was given three years of imprisonment, the other was awarded a five-year jail term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/skin-to-skin-touch-not-a-must-for-sex-assault-supreme-court/articleshow/87789433.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Business||RBI proposes new law to regulate digital lending||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed new norms and asked the government to frame a new legislation to curb illegal digital lending in the country. The proposals come after a panel set up by the regulator found that there are 1,100 loan apps in various app stores, of which 600 are illegal. The suggestions come in the wake of complaints of harassment by digital lending apps, many of which have turned out to be unauthorized and operated by offshore entities. Some of the borrowers have also committed suicide, blaming the apps of harassment. There have also been reports of digital lenders repatriating unlawful profits outside the country. The recommendations, submitted by a working group on digital lending including lending through online platforms and mobile apps chaired by Jayant Kumar Dash, executive director, RBI, include having a nodal agency to verify all the digital lending apps and setting up a self-regulatory organisation. The group has also suggested tighter norms for “buy now pay later” loans, a form of credit given at time of purchase. The proposal is to treat them as part of balance sheet lending, if it is not in the form of operational credit by merchants. “Since these products do not meet the requirements of traditional credit facilities, a suitable notification may be issued by the government of India in this regard,” the group said. “The recommendations seek to protect the integrity of the system against entities that are not regulated and are not authorized to carry out lending business. The onus of subjecting third-party lending service providers to a standard protocol of business conduct would lie with the regulated entities to whom they are attached. Further, an institutional mechanism is envisaged to ensure the basic level of customer suitability, appropriateness and protection of data privacy,” the report said. The panel said that the digital lending ecosystem comprises both balance sheet lenders (those who lend their own money) and marketplace lending (a platform that allows others to lend). Within these two forms of lending, there are peer-to-peer lending platforms, neo banks, and “buy now pay later” players. “It is observed that lending through digital mode relative to physical mode is still at a nascent stage in case of banks (Rs 1.1 lakh crore via digital mode vis-à-vis Rs 53.1 lakh crore via physical mode) whereas for NBFCs, a higher proportion of lending (Rs 0.2 lakh crore via digital mode vis-à-vis Rs1.9 lakh crore via physical mode) is happening through digital mode,” the report said. The FinTech Association for Consumer Empowerment, which was launched last year, and comprises digital lending platforms such as EarlySalary, KreditBee, Kissht, CashE and LoanTap, welcomed the proposed regulations. “SRO is the call of the hour to structure the industry and to set the rules for the fintech members and customers. FACE members have always abided with the disclosure of all relevant information including the interest rates, as it believes in transparency and proactive commitment to consumers builds brand trust. Data privacy is of utmost importance and should be strictly adhered to,” FACE said in a statement. Experts, however, cautioned at regulations stifling innovation. “While subjecting third-party digital lending providers to certain standard protocols and regulations is key to protecting customer’s interest, this should not come at the cost of innovation and create entry barriers for startups in the fintech space,” said Jaikrishnan G, Partner, Financial Services Consulting at Grant Thornton Bharat. He added that new-age short-term liquid lending products have created a niche and are now filling in a critical credit void in the ecosystem. “A traditional lending framework cannot be applied on these products,” said Jaikrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-law-to-regulate-digital-lending/articleshow/87789536.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar said it would not be appropriate to intervene and disturb the entire process. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing CBSE, assured the court that all precautions would be taken for conducting the exams in the offline mode and also informed the bench that the number of examination centres had been increased from 6,500 to 15,000. The apex court noted that Term 1 board exams of the CBSE had already commenced from November 16, while Semester 1 of the board exams of the CISCE would begin on November 22. The top court was hearing a plea filed by six students seeking directions to the CBSE and the CISCE to issue a revised circular for conducting Class 10 and 12 board exams in hybrid mode, instead of offline mode only, in view of Covid-19. The court said the students must have faith and trust in the board authorities who will take all care to ensure that examinees and the staff are not exposed to untoward situations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-refuses-plea-for-board-exams-in-hybrid-mode/articleshow/87789576.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Yellow alert sounded after incessant rain batters Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Incessant rain through Thursday left Bengalureans longing for some sun and warm weather. The drizzle that often turned into downpour slowed traffic movement before intensifying into heavy showers as dusk set in. A tree each was uprooted in Vasanthnagar, KR Puram and Krishnayyanapalya and a branch fell near Thanisandra. Water-logging was reported from CMR College, Banaswadi; Brigade Road; Basappa Circle in Kalasipalya; KEB Junction in Nagawara; 12th Cross in HBR Layout and New Byappanahalli. Water entered a house in Canara Bank Colony of Vidyaranyapura. Though the damage was little till late evening, rain made matters worse for many Bengalureans, given the poor state of roads in most localities. The forecast of at least two more wet days added to the gloom. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert in the city and neighbouring districts for Friday. A yellow alert means people are required to be on watch and look out for updates. Civic works under way in Malleswaram, Banaswadi, Ramamurthynagar, Old Madras Road, Banashankari and Indiranagar only added to Bengalureans’ woes. “It’s been raining for the past two weeks. I have been using my car to reach office, but today (Thursday) morning the traffic was down to a crawl. It is quite difficult to drive at such times given the bad infrastructure,” said motorist Janardhana H, who was driving from his Banaswadi home to his workplace in Richmond Town. “It is difficult to even move around in our locality. Recently, Bescom dug up the road to lay cables. BWSSB dug up roads for installing new water and sewage lines. Neither has fixed the roads properly. When can we lead a normal life,” asked Sandesh Shetty, a resident of Banashankari 2nd Stage. As of 8.30pm, the city received 37mm of rain, whereas Kempegowda International Airport and HAL recorded 20mm and 39.2mm, respectively. With a depression forming over southwest Bay of Bengal, more rain and thunderstorms are expected in Bengaluru, neighbouring districts and coastal Karnataka in the next few days. According to the Met department, a depression over southwest Bay of Bengal, off North Tamil Nadu coast, is very likely to cross North Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coasts early Friday morning. Under the influence of these systems, Karnataka is likely to receive widespread rain for the next four days, with heavy showers at isolated places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-to-see-2-more-days-of-rain-schools-shut-today/articleshow/87789773.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Apple has created around 1 million jobs in India, says company VP||BENGALURU: Priya Balasubramaniam, vice-president of product operations in Apple, said the company supports around 1 million jobs in India, from its own employees to the fast-growing iOS app economy to its work with supplier partners. “The App Store is filled with incredible apps developed in India, while our App Accelerator in Bengaluru provides guidance to thousands of iOS developers," she said virtually at the 24th edition of the Bengaluru Tech Summit on Thursday. Balasubramaniam said manufacturing is being transformed by newer technologies like AI, machine learning, augmented and virtual reality, advanced robotics, and 3D printing. “What they add up to is a new form of manufacturing. Some call it Industry 4.0, the fourth Industrial Revolution. We call it smart manufacturing. Instead of using expensive optical inspection machines to measure part dimensions for quality assurance, we can use iPhone's A14 Bionic chip and camera to run machine vision algorithms. In milliseconds, we can capture product deviations,” she said. Smart manufacturing, she said, anticipates issues proactively and with predictive modelling, it could take corrective actions. Apple has been operating in India for more than two decades, and in 2017, it began manufacturing iPhones in Bengaluru’s industrial hub of Peenya where it started assembling the low-cost iPhone SE back then. Together with the two assembling facilities it has in Peenya in Bengaluru and Narasapura in Kolar, the company now has a substantial presence in and around Bengaluru. “…Since then, we've expanded that facility here and in Chennai, manufacturing several iPhone models for the domestic market and for export. Along with our supply chain, we are investing significantly in India to develop our operations, expand our reach and engage with more local suppliers,” Balasubramaniam said. Through the pandemic, she said, we have all realised the importance of resilient supply chains and the importance of manufacturing, not only to sustain the economy but to allow it to thrive. “Our systems will become more adaptable, fostering a more resilient economy. For example, one of the projects we are piloting in India as we speak is station monitoring with video ML. This will allow remote monitoring and control of production, increasing productivity,” she added. Last year, the Cupertino-based company launched its e-commerce store in India. “We are looking forward to expanding further with physical retail stores too,” she said. She said state-level policies and the Indian government's policies to promote manufacturing, along with efforts to support the ecosystem of startups, are already advancing Apple along the path to more opportunities and more investments. “We see an exciting opportunity for India to grow further and train its emerging workforce in the foundation of smart manufacturing, intelligent design and connected and optimized systems that are agile, proactive and sustainable,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/apple-has-created-around-1-mn-jobs-in-india-says-company-vp/articleshow/87789774.cms||---

With greater impetus, that can also go up to more than $410 billion, the report said.“A strong partnership between industry and government is vital in creating an ecosystem for the fabless startups and electronics products companies. We are proposing the creation of a $1 billion ESDM Innovation fund, move to high-value manufacturing through global partnerships, and creation of the National Institute for Semiconductor Electronics Research (NISER),” said Satya Gupta, vice chairman of IESA.The pandemic has highlighted the need to have a strong and robust electronics research and manufacturing ecosystem in the country as electronics forms the backbone of all strategic sectors like healthcare, security, defence, transportation, financial inclusion and agriculture. “The trend of AI and systems are getting more autonomous, whether it’s cars, homes, work environment or appliances, as the products have gained capacities to send everything, know everything and handle the situations seamlessly. The landscape of electronic and semiconductor units is changed completely by the modern technologies like EV, AI, industrial IoT, augmented reality, security, safety and big data,” Santosh Kumar, MD of Texas Instruments, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/electronics-mfg-can-double-contribution-to-eco-by-2025/articleshow/87789775.cms||---

The usually fractious poll battle turned shriller this time with many candidates openly flouting their caste and political affiliations while trying to leave no stone unturned to garner support from the community that is largely into promotion of Kannada language and literature. Even in terms of expenditure, insiders admit the money spent by some of the candidates is all set to cross Rs 1 crore each.The Parishat has 3.5 lakh members across the state and, of these, 3.1 lakh have voting rights. Reaching out to these voters with an appeal through post would cost around Rs 13 lakh for a candidate. Some candidates have sent appeals three or four times apart from visiting all districts to meet important local influencers and littérateurs.With only three days left for the polling on November 21, aspirants are busy wooing the votersto improve their chances of getting the coveted post. The candidates include Mahesh Joshi, Shekargouda Mali Patil, Va Cha Chennegowda, poet Saraswathi Shivappa Chimmalagi, Mayanna and K Ratnakara Shetty. Senior writer and former Parishat president Hampa Nagarajaiah said only 6-8 candidates would usually be in the race.According to special election officer ST Mohan Raju, 3.1 lakh of the Parishat’s 3.4 lakh members are eligible to vote. Members get the eligibility to vote three years after getting membership.About 4,800 voters in other states like West Bengal, Manipur and Gujarat and countries like Germany, the US and Singapore vote through postal ballots. Postal ballots have already reached the office of the special election officer. The counting of votes is on November 24 and results will be announced the same day.New app for voters“A new app, Kasapa election 21, has been introduced to facilitate voters to find their polling booths easily. If a member enters his/her name after opening the app, it will show the booth where he or she has to vote,” Mohan Raju said. A few candidates have complained to the election officer that some contestants are distributing suitcases, silver articles and other things. Former president of the Parishat Nalluru Prasad said: “Any member who has love for Kannada and commitment towards Kannada can contest the elections. There should not be any political interference in the election or functioning of the Parishat.”Hampa Nagarajaiah, however, said: “Election is an election and whether it is for the assembly, corporation or panchayat, factors like political interference and caste inevitably come into the picture. But the person elected for the post must meet the expectations of Kannadigas and efficiently work for the development of the language, land, culture and literature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/record-21-in-race-for-sundays-sahitya-parishat-election/articleshow/87789777.cms||---

While it witnessed 2,987 cases till September 15 this year, 2,516 more were recorded till November 17. The 84% increase is due to untimely rain giving rise to mosquito breeding, say doctors. The state also reported the year’s first dengue deaths, five, on October 21. Since the beginning of November, Karnataka has seen 441 new cases. However, there has been no death so far this month. “Incessant rain and water stagnation in pits and dug-up areas lead to breeding of mosquitoes,” said Dr Ramesh K Kaulgud, joint director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), state health and family welfare department. Of the five patients who died, two were from Ramanagara and one each from Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada and Belagavi. More than one lakh people with symptoms of dengue underwent testing in the state in 2021; 40% of the tests were done in Bengaluru alone. As per data with the health department, Bengaluru has seen 1,038 cases this year and accounts for 19% of the state’s total dengue burden. From November 1 to17, 110 persons in Bengaluru tested positive for the infection. After Bengaluru, the highest number of cases have been reported from Shivamogga (393), Kalaburagi (386), Udupi (312), Koppal (278).

His body was found 6km downstream of the canal on Monday. Abhishek AS, a resident of Annechakkanahalli in KR Pet taluk of Mandya and helper at a bar and restaurant in Gandhinagar, Bengaluru, was on the way to his village when the accident took place around 2am on November 7. Abhishek’s fatal misadventure went unnoticed by his four friends travelling with him. As Abhishek did not come home, his parents filed a missing person’s complaint with Upparpet police in Bengaluru on November 8. Cops learnt about his death during probe and found his body on November 15 near Srirangapatna. Sanjeev M Patil, deputy commissioner of police (west), said Abhishek had taken up the helper’s job three months ago. A temple inauguration was scheduled in his village on November 7. Abhishek took permission to attend the function and invited four of his friends. All five gathered at Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna railway station in Bengaluru by 10pm on November 6 and boarded the train around midnight. “They started taking photos and selfies on their mobiles after the train left the city. They were standing near the door of a compartment. Later, the other four went to their seats. Investigation revealed Abhishek clung on to an iron bar in the train and bent his body outside. He may have failed to notice the train approaching a bridge on the canal and was hit by the railing. He fell into the canal and was washed away at least 6km from the spot where he fell,” a police officer said. Patil said, “His friends noticed Abhishek was missing near Pandavapura. They got down from the train and searched for him in a nearby area. They got scared and hence two of them went to their villages, and the others returned to the city. They did not inform anyone about his disappearance.” The DCP said Abhishek had informed his family members that he would attend the temple inauguration and they called him at noon to know his whereabouts. His mobile was switched off, so they rushed to Bengaluru and enquired with his employer and learnt he had left the hotel to go to his village. His relative Manjegowda filed a missing person’s complaint on November 8. Upparpet police swung into action and traced the friends who travelled with him. They told police they were on the way to Abhishek’s village when he went missing. Police started searching for Abhishek and took help of their counterparts in Mandya, railway police, local swimmers and rescue team from the fire and emergency services department, Mandya. Police have taken up a case of unnatural death and handed over the body to his family members. The DCP appealed to the public not to risk their lives for the sake of photos/selfies while travelling in trains or at any dangerous place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teen-taking-selfies-from-train-falls-body-found-8-days-later/articleshow/87789779.cms||---

On Wednesday, Kharge had said 0.08 bitcoins seized from accused Robin Khandelawala by Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths had vanished from the police wallet where they had been moved.  Kharge had also objected to police taking technical help from Unocoin, a bitcoin exchange company, during the investigation as it had approached cops saying their website had been hacked. “These are absolutely false claims. We clarify that 0.08 bitcoins along with three cryptocurrencies (worth Rs 2.5 lakh) were seized from the account of Robin Khandelawala and transferred to the police wallet. The same was duly intimated to the court. This fact has been prominently mentioned to the court along with the chargesheet. The currencies are safely placed in the police wallet under the knowledge of the court,” it said. It stated though the Unocoin account was hacked for a small amount, there was nothing adverse against the company making them ineligible to assist in the probe. “The company is a victim in the case, not the accused.

The marks cards have not come as the tender for non-tearable ones has been delayed. It is allegedly stuck in a tussle between the vice-chancellor and some syndicate members — one group favouring tearable and the other non-tearable marks cards — for several months. “We had called for a tender of non-tearable marks cards. Three companies had applied, including Mysore Sales International Limited. While MSIL had quoted Rs 41 per marks card when we procured a smaller number, it quoted Rs 43 a piece when we ordered 10 lakh answer scripts. While I was questioning this and negotiating, a syndicate member wrote to the governor (chancellor) alleging corruption. The governor sought a response and we have sent a reply. Now the chancellor has to respond on how to take this forward,” explained KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor, BU. “Students have to wait or else we will temporarily issue tearable marks cards. We will try to upload their results on the website which can be used by the students,” the vice-chancellor added. However, some syndicate members said non-tearable marks cards have to be issued as it is mandated by the government and is in the best interest of students. Colleges point out that the delay in taking a decision will cost students. “They will finish their final semester soon. They have to start applying for jobs and higher education. Where are the marks cards?” said the principal of an affiliated college. However, an official concerned said marks cards of all semesters of the PG students will be issued as soon as the fourth semester results are out. “The students anyway have to wait for the fourth semester results to take the next step in their career. By then, we will have their marks cards ready as printing for 10,000 students will not take much time. We will do it in tearable marksheets,” he said. Apart from the 2019-20 PG students who are graduating soon, the colleges said marks cards of fourth and fifth semesters of 2018 batch undergraduate programmes are also pending. The batches from 2019 have not received any marks cards at all. “Marks cards up to fourth semester have been dispatched. The ones for fifth semester will be sent by this week. Once sixth semester results get announced, we will send those too. The university has started printing UG results in tearable marks cards. We will finish the process very soon and proceed with PG,” said the official. The third semester results of the 2019-20 PG students are yet to be announced due to delay in valuation of some open elective programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iv-sem-bu-pg-students-yet-to-get-i-sem-marks-cards/articleshow/87789786.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

In a series of tweets, the BJP published a picture of Rakesh Siddaramaiah with Sunish Hegde and Hemanth Muddappa, while targeting the former CM over trying to cover up when Sriki and his associates were arrested in 2016. The party’s official handle also asked Siddaramaiah why he took a U-turn on Wednesday, when asked if he had any proof of the case. ಮಾನ್ಯ #Bitcoinಬುರುಡೆರಾಮಯ್ಯ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಅವಧಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ಈ ಹಗರಣವನ್ನು ಮುಚ್ಚಿ ಹಾಕುವುದು ನಿಮಗೆ ತೀರಾ ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯವಾಗಿತ್ತು.ಅಪ್ರಿಯ… https://t.co/fh2nCNAy7a— BJP Karnataka (@BJP4Karnataka) 1637219662000“During your tenure, it appears that you were very keen on closing the cases.

I urge the CM to order a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court to investigate the scam including our term.” He even tweeted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with another fugitive, Nirav Modi, at the 2018 World Economic Forum. “BJP alleged that my son Rakesh was seen with Sri Krishna’s friend Hemant Muddappa. Then how can we interpret the photo of PM Modi with Nirav Modi during the 2018 World Economic Forum?”he asked. He added BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel may know the “important” leader who supposedly received bitcoins as quid pro quo for mediating the release of Muddappa when he was arrested with Srikrishna, the hacker. Former CM BS Yediyurappa said the bitcoin scam was being probed and there was no intention to protect anyone. “The PM will ensure that none of the accused is spared.

---||India||Ensure cryptos don’t end up in wrong hands, PM Narendra Modi urges world||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for democratic nations to work together on cryptocurrency to ensure it “promotes trade, investment and the larger good” rather than ending up in the “wrong hands”. In his keynote address at the first Sydney Dialogue, organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Modi described the current age as one of profound changes, that happens once in an era. “The digital age is changing everything around us. It has defined politics, the economy and society. It is raising new questions on sovereignty, governance... and law. It is reshaping international competition, power and leadership. But, we also face new risks and new forms of conflicts across diverse threats from the sea-bed to cyber to space.” India, he said, was developing indigenous capabilities in telecom technology such as 5G and 6G, in what is being seen as a significant development because of the keenness of many outside players to be part of India’s 5G rollout. Both India and Australia have kept Chinese firms out of its 5G structure. Highlighting a recent government initiative, Modi said India was now focusing on “hardware and creating packages to become key manufacturers of semiconductors”. India has been known to have an edge in artificial intelligence and semiconductor design. The PM’s remarks seem to signal India’s desire go further into fabrication and manufacturing. Modi called on democracies to jointly invest in “research and development of future technology”. He also spoke on India’s digital revolution and the country’s efforts in becoming one of the “leading nations in artificial intelligence and machine learning”. Modi said, “technology and data are becoming new weapons. The biggest strength of democracy is openness. At the same, we should not allow vested interests to use this openness against us.” He called for collaboration in “research and development in future technology” — for trusted manufacturing base and trusted supply chains. The PM also called for deeper “intelligence and operational cooperation on cyber security, protect critical information infrastructure.” He flagged the importance of combating the power of subversive cyber activities that attempt to manipulate public opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ensure-cryptos-dont-end-up-in-wrong-hands-pm-narendra-modi-urges-world/articleshow/87789793.cms||---
---||India||SC rejects Anil Deshmukh’s plea to examine CBI’s PE report which gave him clean chit||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh's plea for the court to examine CBI's preliminary inquiry report against him which allegedly granted him a clean chit. The court, however, allowed him the liberty to raise the issue before an appropriate court. At the outset of hearing, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Deshmukh, referred to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on whose plea CBI probe was ordered against the former minister and said the court had passed the order placing confidence in him but the cop was himself absconding now. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said, "It is very unfortunate for the institutions. It shows lack of faith in the system." The bench, thereafter, proceeded with the hearing of Deshmukh's plea and raised the question of how he could approach directly to the apex under Article 32 jurisdiction. Sibal contended that SC passed the order against Deshmukh on the presumption that the evidence against him was found by CBI after holding a preliminary probe and subsequently FIR was filed, but as per media reports the politician was given clean chit in PE report. Sibal contended that the court should ask CBI to place before it 65-page PE report along with file noting to find out the truth. He said that if it was true that "nothing was found against me" in the preliminary report then it was clear that there is political motivation behind lodging FIR The bench, however, raised a question on how much credence could be given to media reports and said it was not inclined to entertain the petition. It allowed him to raise the issue before a competent court. Deshmukh had approached the SC through his lawyer Avadh Kaushik. "The present petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is based on the premise that the orders passed by the Court on the rationale that the preliminary enquiry may have material against petitioner. As per certain newspaper reports the Petitioner is stated to have been given a clean chit. Therefore, they have called for all records...We are not inclined to exercise jurisdiction under Article 32 in this scenario. It is always open for the petitioner to raise the issue before a competent court," the court said. Deshmukh (71) was arrested by the ED on November 1 after questioning in the case, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 this year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations that demands of Rs 100 crore by way of bribes from Mumbai's hotel and restaurant owners were sought by the former minister were levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The ED case is that Deshmukh, while serving as the state's home minister, misused his official position and through dismissed police officer Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-rejects-anil-deshmukhs-plea-to-examine-cbis-pe-report-which-gave-him-clean-chit/articleshow/87789811.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Say where you are, then we’ll hear you, SC tells Param Bir||NEW DELHI: “No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the Supreme Court on Thursday told former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and made it clear that it will not entertain his plea if the IPS officer does not disclose his whereabouts. Minutes after dismissing former Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh's plea for documents relating to the CBI investigation and having expressed concern over the former Mumbai top cop not having faith in the system, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan and Kaul M M Sundresh took up Param Bir Singh's petition and asked his lawyer to first inform about Singh's whereabouts. "Where are you? Are you in this country or outside? Where are you? We will come to the petition. First, we need to know where you are," the bench asked Senior Advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Singh. Bali replied that the filing counsel could answer the court's query but the advocate-on-record told the bench that the petition has been filed by the holder of power of attorney for Singh. The bench then observed that it was getting an impression that Singh was sitting abroad and would come to India after getting a favourable order from the court. The bench again pointed out lack of confidence shown by the top IPS officer in the system and made it clear that he will not be treated differently. “You are seeking protective orders; nobody knows where you are. Suppose you are sitting abroad and taking legal recourse through power of attorney then what happens. If that is so then you will come to India if the court rules in your favour, we don't know what you have in mind. No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the bench said. A magistrate court in Bombay on Wednesday declared Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city. Singh had last attended his office in May this year after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay High Court last month that his whereabouts were not known. The police action had followed his sensational charge that Deshmukh had asked for collection of Rs 100 crore as bribes. Bimal Agrawal, a real estate developer and hotelier, had alleged the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on two bars and restaurants which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them. The incidents are said to have occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed. Following his complaint, a case was filed under IPC Sections 384 and 385 (both pertaining to extortion) and 34 (common intention) against six accused. Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too. The IPS officer was shunted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March 2021 after Waze was arrested in the case of explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai residence 'Antilia' and the subsequent mysterious death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/say-where-you-are-then-well-hear-you-sc-tells-param-bir/articleshow/87789829.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The officials of my department and those from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) should have zero-tolerance against such practices,” he said. While addressing the ‘Eat Right’ walkathon organised by FSSAI, west region, here, Shingane said mobile testing labs and other initiatives were being implemented by the government to detect adulteration of food and beverages. “In today’s hectic life, the intake of good food has gained supreme importance for achieving health goals. The FDA is committed to helping citizens in getting healthy and hygienic food to achieve good health,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said youth should avoid eating junk food. “The youth should become aware of healthy eating habits at an early age. Such awareness can only ensure good health in later phases of life,” he said. Organised by FSSAI on the occasion of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, an initiative of the Indian government to commemorate 75 years of the country’s Independence, the ‘Eat Right’ walkathon also saw awareness measures involving food vendors from Aurangabad. An exhibition-cum-sale of different food items was also held at Kalagram as part of different activities spanned over two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stern-action-against-adulteration-practices/articleshow/87786096.cms||---

While piling work is going on for some new buildings, column and beam casting for other structures are also in progress. The construction work is being undertaken in phases so that healthcare services at this largest hospital of the state are not affected. Once the number of beds at PMCH is increased from the existing 2,000 to about 5,500 after its redevelopment, it will emerge as the largest government hospital of the country. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said piling work on multi-level car parking, central utility block, nurse hostel and hospital building was being done. Columns and beam casting under the structural erection plan is also in progress at Jeevak Hostel. Foundation stone for this ambitious project was earlier laid by chief minister Nitish Kumar. However, after demolition of some of the buildings identified for the first phase, the foundation stone for beginning of piling work was laid jointly by the additional chief secretary of health department Pratyaya Amrit and the superintendent in the presence of P K Jha, managing director of Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited and other officials on October 30. Dr Thakur said the hospital has been catering to the needs of patients from all over the state for decades. “Even during the peak of Covid pandemic, doctors and other healthcare staff provided services in all the departments and the emergency units risking their lives,” Dr Thakur added. Altogether 148 pillars for the first multi-level parking, which is being constructed after demolition of the superintendent quarter, 129 for central utility block, 48 for hospital building and 35 for nurse hostel were complete by Wednesday. Important buildings which were demolished for the first phase of development are Quaidi ward, Lavaris ward, A and B-grade nurses’ quarters and class IV quarters. The southern portion of the GNM School is still under demolition process. “The PMCH will have several state-of-the-art technologies for treatment of patients, enlarged hostel facility for students and a spacious multi-level parking on the campus. Separate 200 beds will be marked for superspecialty branches,” Dr Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/construction-work-at-pmch-in-full-swing/articleshow/87786526.cms||VK Tripathi

The state government has, consequently, decided to begin an awareness campaign after the ongoing panchayat elections as part of which the villagers will be told about the advantages of using toilets and maintaining cleanliness. State rural development department’s principal secretary Arvind Kumar Chaudhary told this newspaper, “As sufficient number of toilets have been made available in almost all the villages under the ‘Lohiya Swachh Bihar Abhiyan’ launched by the government, concerted efforts are being made to ensure their use by the people. An intensive campaign in this regard will be launched in different parts of the state after the elections are over and new panchayat committees constituted,” he said. He further pointed out that the government organised weeklong awareness campaigns at the village level every month to motivate the people to use toilets. However, they were temporarily stopped due to the panchayat elections. “The department has also started constructing at least two community toilets in every panchayat for those who do not use the ones in their houses,” Chaudhary said, promising that community toilets would be built in many panchayats and villagers trained in solid waste management soon. Patna University economics department’s former head Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “As many as 3.6 billion people in the world are still living without access to safely-managed sanitation. When some people in a community do not have safe toilets, everyone’s health is threatened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-government-to-launch-campaign-to-promote-cleanliness/articleshow/87786549.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||Chancellor’s office knew of VC’s shady deals in March||PATNA: Three senior officers of Magadh University (MU) had written to chancellor’s office in March this year against vice-chancellor Dr Rajendra Prasad, accusing him of pressuring them to clear payment of Rs 16 crore for printing of question papers, answer booklets and OMR sheets without any tender. The three officers were the then registrar Dr Vijay Kumar, financial adviser Madhusudan and financial officer S K Bajpai. The trio had sent a joint letter to the chancellor’s principal secretary on March 9 this year, urging him to order inquiry into “serious financial irregularities”. A copy of the letter is with TOI. They had also alleged in the letter that the VC, after calling them at his official residence on March 3, threatened to get them removed from their posts while using abusive language after they refused to clear payments. Surprisingly, the registrar was sacked just 10 days after he wrote the letter on the basis of a report sent to the chancellor by the MU VC. The governor’s secretariat had issued a notification on March 19, stating that the registrar was sacked for “unlawful activities, actions which undermined the prestige of the university and acts in violation of terms and conditions of his service”. On the same day, the governor’s secretariat issued another notification transferring Madhusudan to Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University in the same capacity. Bajpai, who was the third person to sign the letter, had resigned on April 1. Notification regarding acceptance of his resignation was issued by the governor’s secretariat on April 13. Patliputra University registrar Jitendra Kumar and Veer Kunwar Singh University financial officer Om Prakash were given responsibilities to look after MU’s affairs afterwards. The SVU sleuths had conducted the raids after lodging an FIR against the VC, his personal assistant Subodh Kumar, Om Prakash, Jitendra Kumar, two private firms named M/s Poorva Graphics and Offset Printers and M/s XLICT Software Private Limited and other unknown persons in a case of financial irregularities worth Rs30 crore. The SVU raid on VC’s private residence at Azad Nagar East in Gorakhpur on Wednesday had led to recovery of official files which showed only 47 private guards were working at the varsity while money for salary payment was being withdrawn for 87 guards. Officers in the chancellor’s office could not be contacted despite repeated attempts by TOI. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said the chancellor was the competent authority to take action against the VC involved in financial irregularities. He said the people involved in the process of selection of VCs must be vigilant so that only men of honesty and integrity are appointed to the highest office in the universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chancellors-office-knew-of-vcs-shady-deals-in-march/articleshow/87786829.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said the acts of financial corruption of MU VC and others have put the entire teaching community to shame and raised serious doubts over the credibility of people being appointed as VCs or pro-VCs in different universities. The findings of the SVU’s raid on VC’s residence have also revealed serious flaws in the process of selection of VCs, they said. They further pointed out that earlier there was a well-established practice to obtain police verification reports of the persons prior to their appointment to any high office. “It seems this practice has not been adhered to in recent appointments. Today, the VCs wield more powers than a cabinet minister, but unfortunately the power is not being used in improving the academic and administrative affairs of the university,” they said. They urged the chancellor to ask all the VCs and other officials dealing with university finances to immediately declare their assets so that the universities are saved from financial irregularities. Bihar State Progressive Intellectuals’ Forum convener Shiv Jatan Thakur has welcomed the move of the state government to order SVU raids on MU authorities for uncovering financial irregularities worth crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-should-ask-vcs-to-declare-their-assets/articleshow/87786841.cms||B K Mishra

A notification regarding Pathak’s new assignment after his return from central deputation was issued on Wednesday. Pathak held a brief meeting with the officials of the department on Day 1 and inquired about the steps taken by them to enforce the prohibition law in the state. “He looked calm and sombre during his maiden meeting,” an officer, who did not wish to be identified, told this reporter. Another officer said, “All the employees of the department reached office in time because everyone knows that Pathak sir is a no-nonsense officer.” According to sources, Pathak’s return to the prohibition department after a gap of about five years has sent shivers down the spine of the liquor smugglers, who have allegedly been operating in and outside the state in cahoots with some officials and politicians. Meanwhile, Pathak’s posting has resulted in an intensive war of words between the leaders of opposition parties and those of the ruling alliance. Leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, quipped, “Why did the government remove him earlier when he was to be given the same assignment again?” Responding to Tejashwi’s remark, SC/ST welfare minister, Santosh Kumar Suman, said, “It appears that Tejashwi has a lot of information about the liquor trade and its supply chain. Has he or his men invested in the illegal trade?” The minister’s response, however, irked Congress MLC, Prem Chandra Mishra, who said, “If the government has any evidence against Tejashwi, why is it not taking any legal action against him? It should arrest those involved in violating the new prohibition law and Tejashwi is no exception.” Mishra added, “The government should pay attention to the matter put forth by the opposition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-ramps-up-war-of-words-over-pathaks-posting/articleshow/87786879.cms||Ramashankar

Chaudhary said against the demand of 8,067 computer operators for the panchayats, as many as 7,800 posts had been filled. “We have put the requisition for filling around 300 vacant posts of computer operators,” he said, adding that the number of accountants who have been appointed is 1,300, with each of them having been given the responsibilities of more than one panchayat. Chaudhary said the state government has already decided to open panchayat level public service counters under the Right to Public Services (RTPS) Act. Accordingly, 8,067 RTPS counters have to be opened at the panchayat level. “We are going to appoint 8,067 more computer operators to run the RTPS counters in the panchayats,” he added. The salaries of the computer operators and accountants have been pending for the last six months. The minister said attempts were being made at the government and department levels to further strengthen and improve the panchayati raj institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/salary-dues-of-computer-operators-to-be-cleared-after-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87786986.cms||Abhay Singh

Naidu and party legislators walked from Venkatapalem to the assembly building at Velagapudi. TDP members raised slogans criticising the government for ‘not providing’ relief from price rise to the common man. Naidu demanded that the state government start reducing the prices of petrol and diesel. He said it was unfortunate that Jagan had not realised the burden on the common man despite the fact that AP is the only state with such high prices in the country. “The highest fuel prices have caused an unbearable rise in prices of essential commodities. The chief minister should also take back the decision on collecting tax on garbage,” demanded Naidu. TDP MLAs K Atchannaidu, Nimmala Ramanaidu, Gorantla Butchaiah Chowdary and others took part in the foot march. Soon after the commencement of the legislative council session, the TDP legislators staged a walkout . The MLCs demanded that the chairman accept their adjournment motions as the issues they wanted taken up for discussion were very important. With the chairman refusing to budge, TDP MLCs led by Yanamala Ramakrishnudu and Nara Lokesh staged a walkout. Later, Lokesh visited Amaravati and Pedakurapadu police stations and extended support to TNSF activists detained by the police while taking up their ‘Chalo Assembly’ march, demanding immediate withdrawal of the government’s decision to take over aided educational institutions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-mlcs-walk-out-of-legislative-council/articleshow/87786923.cms||Samdani MN

Doing so will be considered a “leak”. A Board circular to this effect has reached principals. “Even if there is any mistake in the question paper/answer key, the OMR will be evaluated as per the answer key provided by CBSE. Necessary action to rectify the mistake will be taken by the Board,” the circular said. Principals have also been instructed to only upload the number of correct answers and not the marks. In another circular, the bo-ard told principals that apart fr-om blackening the right circle on the OMR sheet, kids should not use a tick or cross. If they are told to answer 45 of 50 questions, and a kid answers all 50, the last five will be considered not attempted. “Best of 45 will not be considered,” it said. “We have informed students,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School, who is also a co-ordinator. CBSE has also made it mandatory for principals to send OMR answer sheets to regional offices via registered speed post. Requests have been made to keep post offices open beyond normal hours. “We will send the OMR sheets like we used to send answer books,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-sends-key-info-about-exams-to-principals/articleshow/87787606.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

However, a status report of land acquisition for laying a pipeline for CNG supply revealed the project remains a distant dream. Currently, a limited amount of CNG is being supplied in cylinders and transported by trucks, pushing up its cost in the city. The pipeline laying received a fillip after NGT intervened following the case filed by green activist Subhas Datta. But, the status report submitted by the district administration revealed that land acquisition is unlikely to be complete before next August, after which the pipeline laying work would resume. The eastern regional bench of Justice Amit B Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) ordered the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to file an affidavit on the pending issues relating to notification for acquisition of right of user in land. The bench also directed Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL) to file its affidavit on the action taken with respect to the districts concerned in which mouzas with land valuations have been handed to GAIL before January 6, the next date of listing. Since 5.7km of the pipeline will pass through the forest area in Purulia, the bench has directed the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to file its reply addressing these issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cng-pipe-laying-hits-land-hurdle/articleshow/87787621.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Pune||Nov 30 deadline for fire audit compliance reports by hosps||Pune: District collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Thursday told TOI that he had directed all hospitals to not just ensure a fire audit but also submit a compliance report by the end of this month. This comes in the wake of the death of 12 Covid patients in a fire that broke out in the Ahmednagar civil hospital on November 6. Deshmukh said after a review on November 30, necessary action would be taken against hospitals not complying with the fire audit norms. “Both the private and government hospitals have been directed to submit the compliance report,” he said. Chief fire officer of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority Devendra Prabhakar Potphode told TOI that 737 Covid hospitals had completed the fire audit. Of these, 192 are in the PMC, 133 in PCMC and 11 in the Cantonment limits. In the rural areas, the number of hospitals is 401. Among these, 122 are government hospitals. “The hospitals, specifically those run by the state, in the rural areas have started complying with the requirements. Additional data needed to be assessed and follow-ups ensured,” he said.  Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise said the fire audit had been completed in the area but 10-12 hospitals had to carry out repair and maintenance work of the equipment. “This should be done by the month-end,” he said. His counterpart in Pimpri Chinchwad, K B Gawade, said though the fire audit had been completed, checks were on for implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nov-30-deadline-for-fire-audit-compliance-reports-by-hosps/articleshow/87787663.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In an interview with TOI, Sharma speaks of how he has faith in the Indian markets and how he plans to reassure investors through explanation and execution of the company’s plans. You got emotional during the listing. Why was the listing so important? The national anthem was playing at the beginning of the listing process and there is a line that goes ‘Bharat Bhagya Vidhata’ – the one who owns the fortune of the country. It comes upon a generation to change the fate of a country and I would have never believed that in my life I would see a chance to bring a huge impact on such a large scale. That India from being digital-negative would become a digital-native country where mobile payment and Paytm has become mainstream. And then today we have been able to bring the company to the stock exchange. I did not see this only as fund-raising. In fund-raising, we get capital to expand the business and have people who buy into the business model. In the listing, we welcomed one million new shareholders to the Paytm family and that is important. But the investors would be disappointed with the listing day performance. What would you say to them? No investor invests for one day. If they invest only for a day, they are not investors. One day is not a game and this is not a loss either. I believe it is important for us to remember that we are in a business that a lot of people do not understand because there is no other business like this in the stock market. There is a lot of explanation and a lot of execution that we will bring in to make people understand the business. I cannot comment on the outcome of a tournament in a long-haul game based on day one. I do understand what you have to say and the concern, Let us see how we execute the new business plan to hold up to the opportunities. You have compared the listing to losing an early wicket in a long-haul tournament... The stock price for an investor is important. For a company, it is important to be sincere in its business mission. There we are happy with our business and plan. When we execute that is the time when investors and potential new investors understand us. Obviously, this (listing price) is not an indication of what we want to be looking at in the long haul. There is a lot that will happen in the business going forward and that is when people will understand and appreciate it. Our business model, which is payments leading to financial services, is a new concept to the stock markets. One analyst said that we are doing too many things. That is the difference between a platform and a point business. Once you have people who understand platform business, new things happen. Once we have a platform showing outcome, magically things begin to compound. You have the base in terms of customers. When will the network effect kick in? In our key revenue lines, items like credit, wealth, and insurance, some are showing revenue growth at an incredible pace. Some of them are still in the investment phase. Next quarter and the quarter after that, we have an incredible amount of traction. We are restrained by quarterly result obligations. Once we start announcing the numbers a lot can be understood. Payment leading to financial services is a proven model in other parts of the world. Once we start showing key performance indicators people will understand that this is not just cost-effective but highly scalable. Now that you are subject to quarterly results and analyst meets will things get more boring or will the excitement continue? It is going to be absolutely thrilling and even more exciting. The good thing is we can see traction on payment-led financial services. If telephony penetration happened through cellular phones, the magic was in how smartphones took over and mobile internet took over. Likewise, if payments are driving the beginning of financial services the magic will be in the actual financial services. Are you happy with the advice you have received from bankers? Yes. I would say that the process of bankers, regulators, lawyers, lead managers is phenomenally gratifying. I can tell you that India has the best in the world ecosystem for IPOs, I am betting on India becoming the second-largest tech IPO market after Nasdaq. I believe that is possible because of the scale, support of the regulator, bankers, and the ecosystem put together. I think that is what India should head toward — becoming the second-largest market after the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-forecast-long-haul-games-outcome-based-on-day-1-show/articleshow/87788542.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Vijayawada||Will only examine decision-making process: Andhra Pradesh HC||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Thursday said that it would not evaluate the suitability of one city over the other for the establishment of the capital. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice D V S S Somayajulu observed that they were only concerned with the legality of the impugned legislations and they would only adjudicate whether there were any shortcomings in the decision-making process. On the fourth day of the daily hearing on the batch of petitions filed challenging the twin legislations brought in by the state government to trifurcate the capital, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao argued on behalf of the farmers saying that besides violation of doctrine of legitimate expectations and promissory estoppel, there was no basis and rationale for bringing twin legislations in the name of decentralised development. He argued against reasons cited by the state government stating the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act was bad in law as there was resentment in other regions of the state on the centralised model of the capital. He said that the very statement was opposite of the truth as actual resentment came after the twin legislations were made. There was no objection from anyone in the state to the location of the capital, land pooling scheme and the notified master plan and the resentment started after the state government tried to undo the capital. Unnam Murlidhar Rao, who also argued for the farmers, said the allegation by the state government that the location of the capital was decided without considering the recommendations of Sivaramakrishnan committee was false. The state government even consulted the Sivaramakrishnan committee before taking the decision on the location of the capital. The land pooling scheme was one among the three alternatives suggested by the Sivaramakrishnan committee report to acquire required land for the purpose of the construction of capital. Even the doubts expressed by the Sivaramakrishnan committee over legal problems that may arise if the land pooling option is exercised by the state government without legislative backing were also addressed by enacting APCRDA Act. So, the genesis for APCRDA Act flows from Sivaramakrishnan committee that was constituted by the Union government as part of the State Reorganisation Act, he said.  The Andhra Pradesh high court on Thursday said that it would not evaluate the suitability of one city over the other for the establishment of the capital||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-only-examine-decision-making-process-hc/articleshow/87786730.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Thambelu Seeta, alias Nirmala (25) from Kotagunnalu village, and Pangi Lachi, alias Shailu (20) from Thatidavulu village under Kudumusari panchayat in Chintapalli mandal of the Agency area joined the Maoist ranks three years ago and worked as party members of Pedabayalu area committee squad, which was one of the strongest committees in the AOB area but has now been considerably weakened following the surrender of its commander Chikkudu Chinna Rao recently. Visakha rural SP B Krishna Rao said Nirmal and Shailu joined the party at a young age and served as militia members for six months before being inducted into the squad. Both were important members of the squad as they belong to local primitive tribe group and have good knowledge of the remote villages and forest routes.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt hospitals to get over 10,000 doctors, nurses||AMARAVATI: In a major move to strengthen the public healthcare system, the state government has decided to fill over 10,000 posts in the government medical colleges, teaching hospitals and district hospitals. This is the first time that many teaching hospitals will get new wings and regular posts of faculty after several decades. While all teaching posts, including professor, associate and assistant professors will be filled through regular recruitment system, nurses and other staff will be roped in through a contract system. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has been very particular about streamlining the public healthcare system since taking over the reins of the state. The state government has already launched the modernisation and upgradation of infrastructure in medical colleges and government hospitals under the Nadu-Nedu project. Taking the challenges posed by Covid-19 into consideration, the chief minister directed the officials not to keep the vacancies in the health department unfilled for years together. In fact, the state government had appointed nearly 10,000 staffers including medical officers and paramedical staff on temporary basis during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. With a long-term vision to upgrade the government medical colleges into national level premier institutions, the chief minister asked the health department to strengthen them as per the National Medical Council (NMC) standards. He wanted that no government medical college forego seats for want of faculty or infrastructure. Following the chief minister’s instructions, director of medical education (DME) conducted a comprehensive survey in all the medical colleges and readied a blueprint on existing vacancies and new departments to be established in view of the growing needs of patients. Similarly, director of public health and commissioner of AP Vaidya Vidhana Parishad (APVVP) have also carried out a study on the vacancies of doctors and paramedical staff in the district hospitals and primary healthcare centres (PHCs). After going through the requirements, the government has granted green signal to all three wings of the health departments to recruit nearly 10,865 staffers, including professors, in the medical colleges. Interestingly, the government has allowed for filling about 7,390 posts, which have been lying vacant for several decades. Another 3,475 posts have been newly created in view of the latest requirements of the medical colleges and hospitals. The YSRC government has already readied proposals for construction of 16 new medical colleges in the public sector. Three medical colleges have been given the green signal from the Centre and the state government is waiting for the Centre’s nod for the remaining medical colleges. The new medical colleges have been proposed taking the proposed formation of new districts into consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-hospitals-to-get-over-10k-docs-nurses/articleshow/87786658.cms||Samdani MN

The accused constable, identified as Shravan Kumar and attached to Vadapalli police station, was apprehended while he was attempting to bypass the security by driving the patrol vehicle. He was arrested when cops found 650 bottles of liquor in the patrol vehicle. Koteswara Rao, a notorious liquor smuggler from Narasaraopet, who was in the vehicle was also arrested. Cops said there were allegations of liquor smuggling against Shravan in the past as well which prompted them to search the vehicle when it was transiting the check-post. A case under relevant sections of AP Excise (Amendment) Act 2020 has been filed against the two at Dachepalli police station. Meanwhile, a departmental inquiry has been initiated against the accused constable who has been placed under suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/constable-held-for-smuggling-liquor/articleshow/87786906.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: As cops strengthen anti-drug drive, more traffickers come under scrutiny||VIJAYAWADA: Owing to anti-drug enforcement drives, Andhra Pradesh saw a 119% increase in cases registered under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and an 86% increase in the number of those arrested this year compared to 2020, according to official data from AP Police. A total of 2,039 cases have been registered from January to October 2021 and 5,411 persons were arrested. Out of these, a total 2.69 lakh kilograms of ganja have been seized. The figures stand as a major record based on a comparative analysis of ganja enforcement data during the last 10 years. For instance, compared to 2019, ganja cases in 2021 saw a 151% increase. District-wise data show Visakhapatnam at number one position with 972 cases registered against accused dealing with ganja. East Godavari follows at second place with 319 cases. Interestingly, Guntur stands third, with 138 cases. Official sources indicate that Guntur and Krishna districts stand as a major transit point due to two National Highways, 16 and 65, crisscrossing the region. With the introduction of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) last year, ganja enforcement in the state saw a huge boost as the agency alone accounts for 14% of the ganja cases this year. In terms of other hard drugs, Andhra Pradesh saw a marginal four cases being registered. The seizure of hard drugs this year include 66 grams of LSD, 1 kilogram of MDMA, 15 Zolpidem SMG and 25 Pramadol. Officials note that they aren’t just focusing their enforcement on the supply side alone and in cities like Vijayawada, they are also focusing on the demand side by tracing details of the end-consumer. In Vijayawada, cops traced 550 alleged ganja addicts and provided counselling with the help of clinical psychologists and other experts. Most of the ganja produced in Agency areas are transported to metro cities like Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. “We have focused on enforcement strategically and apart from just hitting at smugglers, we have now began destroying ganja plantations in Agency areas; Rs 165 crore worth of ganja has been destroyed in four different mandals in Agency areas,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-cops-strengthen-anti-drug-drive-more-traffickers-come-under-scrutiny/articleshow/87786668.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The general secretary of the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, Indrajit Singh, told this newspaper on Thursday that hundreds of devotees walked through the lanes from Guru ka Bagh to Patna Sahib gurdwara as part of the ‘nagar kirtan’ ritual. “The ‘akhand path’ is over and the entire gurdwara has been illuminated with colourful lights,” he added. A large number of devotees have already arrived here from Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and other states to pay obeisance to Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. “What makes the occasion more auspicious is the fact that quite a few people belonging to other religions also visit the gurdwara and pray to Guru Nanak Dev ji,” Indrajit said. Talking about the four-day ‘Prakash Parv’ from January 6 to 9 in 2022, Indrajit claimed, “A larger number of people are expected to participate in the 355th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh leader, next year. Therefore, the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee will make elaborate arrangements for the devotees.” Meanwhile, the district administration has geared up to ensure the safety and well-being of the devotees during the 552nd ‘Prakash Parv’. The SDO of Patna City, Mukesh Ranjan, pointed out that adequate number of magistrates and policemen had been deployed near the gurdwara and its approach roads. “Since a huge crowd will assemble at the Kangan Ghat on the occasion of ‘Prakash Parv’, teams of National Disaster Response Force have been deputed there. Medical teams have also been roped in to ensure the safety of the devotees,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prakash-parv-gurdwara-decked-up-to-welcome-15k-devotees-today/articleshow/87786490.cms||VK Tripathi

The court also stayed the order of the single judge setting aside the memo issued by the panchayat raj department withholding 21% of the amount on the basis of vigilance inquiry. The high court earlier disposed 1,013 petitions that alleged the state government was not clearing the bills. The court directed the government to clear bills within a stipulated time. When the bills were not cleared, after considering the interlocutory applications moved by some of the petitioners, the court directed to pay the bills with interest. Challenging the single judge orders, the state government moved an appeal petition. Arguing on behalf of the government, advocate general S Sriram said there is no rule in MGNREGS that bills have to be paid with interest. He said the vigilance inquiry found large-scale irregularities where incomplete works were shown as completed on paper. The HC bench comprising Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice B Krishna Mohan issued notices to respondents to file counter affidavits and granted interim relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stay-on-single-judge-order-on-nregs-dues/articleshow/87786674.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Kalyanesh Agrawal, a local businessman, echoed similar views, saying, “People consider it auspicious to take a dip in the Ganga on Kartik Purnima.” Meanwhile, the Saran district administration has also taken steps to avoid any mishap on Kartik Purnima on Friday. Earlier, DM Rajesh Meena and SP Santosh Kumar had reviewed the arrangements made for the devotees who will take a dip at Konhara Ghat, the confluence of the Ganga and the Gandak in Saran district. They had directed the officials concerned to stop the movement of traffic on the Old Gandak Bridge from 12pm on Friday.

Babu, speaking to reporters after attending a National Commission for Schedule Castes (NCSC) hearing, said he is yet to receive Rs 10 lakh compensation for serving nine years of prison sentence for a crime he did not commit and also two acres of land. Babu said he and his family faced a lot of suffering in the nine years he spent in jail. “My legs aren’t working properly and my father died while I was in jail. The police branded me (a rapist and murderer),” he said. Babu had filed a complaint against Vijayawada police with the NCSC in 2019 alleging he was being harassed under the guise of a ‘history sheet’ opened against him in 2012 while he was in jail. The NCSC issued summons to Vijayawada police and an assistant commissioner-ranked officer was sent to attend the hearing. Cops point out there were other offences against Babu and he was convicted in some of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/yet-to-receive-rs-10-lakh-compensation-land/articleshow/87786707.cms||---

Without taking their names, Nitish came hard on leaders of the opposition parties who have been critical of the implementation of the prohibition policy and kept pointing to the unchecked movement of the vehicles that carried liquor after crossing the interstate borders. “They also have responsibility to make the prohibition policy a success as they were party to the making of the Act and had taken pledge to support it,” Nitish said, adding that the BJP that was in the opposition in 2016 had also supported it, and the department’s minster was from the Congress. Denying that he had any other engagement other than the check-up of his eyes in Delhi, Nitish said he would only visit Bihar Bhavan and the new building, Bihar Sadan, that has come up in the national capital. He added that the use of the word ‘bhakchonhar’ by RJD chief Lalu Prasad to describe Congress leader Bhakta Charan Das and the abuse hurled by deputy CM Renu Devi against agitating job seeking youths will not dent, damage or affect the image of Bihar. “Instead, those who have used those words have tarnished their own image,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-leaders-should-help-govt-check-illegal-liquor-trade-says-cm/articleshow/87786863.cms||Abhay Singh

Most vegetable shops in the city have stopped selling tomatoes considering their high price. Incessant rains due to the recent cyclone had an impact on tomato plantations in Chittoor district. Madanapalle, the biggest tomato market in the state, has seen poor yield and, as a result, traders are procuring tomatoes in Madanapalle for an all-time high price of Rs 95 per kilogram. The arrival of tomatoes at the Rajiv Gandhi Wholesale Market, Kaleswara Rao Market and at rythu bazaars across the city has come down significantly in recent days. “The price of tomatoes is nearly competing with that of gold. It is becoming tough for us to find fine quality tomatoes. Many farmers are harvesting poor quality tomatoes with a motive of earning some profits. But we are unable to sell them at meager margin,” said Akiveedu Rambabu, a wholesale trader in Kaleswara Rao market. Agriculture marketing authorities estimate that the cost of tomatoes may cross the mark of Rs 140 per kilogram in the next ten days as weathermen have predicted that another low pressure area is forming over the Bay of Bengal. Meanwhile, most retailers have stopped selling tomatoes. Many people have struck tomatoes off their shopping lists. “Petrol and diesel prices are much better than tomatoes. We are now making curries without tomatoes. Government should procure tomatoes from farmers and take necessary measures to control the price,” S Naga Ramya, a homemaker, demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/buyers-strike-tomato-off-shopping-lists/articleshow/87786887.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Construction sites fall silent after input prices skyrocket||VIJAYAWADA: The construction industry is in limbo with prices skyrocketing and severe sand shortage across Krishna district for the last three months. Sand reaches have been closed for the last three months due to floods in the Krishna river. The non-availability of sand, in particular, has slowed down construction activity. Sand is usually sold for Rs 350 per metric tonne at sand reaches. But an agency appointed by Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) is selling sand stored at stock yards after sand trucks were washed away in the Krishna river at Chevitikallu sand reach. The agency has fixed the price at Rs 680 per tonne, which is almost double the price at sand reaches. “It is not viable to buy sand from stock points. Cost of 10 metric tonnes of sand from Keesara stock point to Vijayawada city costs around Rs 12,000. We have stalled our constructions temporarily and are waiting for the price to come down,” said K Venkata Nagaraju, a member of Capital Region Builder Association (CRBA). “The cost of cement has crossed Rs 390 per bag in the city and we urge the government to consider our problems,” he said. Masons, daily labourers, carpenters, and workers involved in iron bending and painting have been hit with the slow down. “Construction activity has reduced drastically in recent times. Painting works are done at the final stage and the majority of constructions have been stalled midway. It may take several months to revive the activity. We are going for domestic works to feed our family,” said K Rambabu, a painter from Maruti Nagar. Building workers’ associations have strongly opposed the sand supply system and demanded the state government regulate the prices of sand and cement. Sand reaches have been closed for the last three months due to floods in the Krishna river.

YSRC women MLAs thanked the chief minister for introducing welfare programmes and giving the development for women its due share.

---||Pune||Pune: Activists want PMC to resume post-Covid OPDs||PUNE: Health activists and experts have criticized the sudden closure of post-Covid outpatient departments (OPDs) at civic and government-run hospitals in the city following a significant decline in the daily infection count and active case tally. They observed that a sizeable number of patients, who have had Covid in the past, were forced to approach private practitioners and hospitals and bear out-of-pocket expenditure, as the specialised OPD service had been shut at most civic and government-run hospitals. Apart from fatigue, breathlessness and lung diseases, members of the Covid task force and doctors have identified diabetes as yet another complication of the disease. Against this backdrop, there was a growing need for special OPD services for post-Covid patients, the experts were unanimous. “Quite a few of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run hospitals have closed post-Covid OPDs overall active Covid cases took a nosedive post-August this year. But they should realize that a sizeable number of patients still require these services as long-term after-effects are known in Covid even after months of full recovery,” said public health expert Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter. The trend of active Covid caseload has dropped to below 2,000 in Pune district for the first time despite a lot of mingling and overcrowding during and after the recent festive period. Sanjeev Wavare, nodal officer of the PMC’s Covid mitigation plan, said, “There were seven PMC-run hospitals offering post-Covid OPD services till recently. Currently, the PMC’s Naidu hospital and state-run Sassoon hospital offer post-Covid OPD services. We will resume services at the other centres, if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-want-pmc-to-resume-post-ncov-opds/articleshow/87787644.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Circle officer Varun Singh said the post-mortem would be conducted after 72 hours as the body is yet to be identified.

---||Agra||UP: Aligarh Muslim University students deny Samajwadi Party’s claims of their support to party||AGRA: Several students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Thursday staged a protest and condemned the tweet by Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and member of Maharashtra assembly Abu Asim Azmi, claiming that the varsity students had extended support to the party. The agitating students also warned SP members not to use the name of the varsity for their “political benefits”. A research scholar of the university, Imran Khan, said that recently some people had joined SP in Lucknow in presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav, and Azmi portrayed them as AMU students. “Students of Moradabad Hindu College were shown as AMU students which is incorrect and unacceptable,” he added. “We will expose the politicians who betrayed the Muslim community,” Khan said, adding that they will remind their community members that "whatever happened in Gujarat was repeated in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar, and that they should never forget this when they cast their votes in the upcoming assembly elections." The 2013 riots happened just about a year after SP swept the UP polls. The ruling party was blamed for mishandling the situation when communal riots broke out in the district. Showing posters that read ‘AMU never supported Akhilesh Yadav', the students categorically denied any announcement of support to the opposition party. Former cabinet member of AMU students’ union Mateen Ashraf, who is pursuing post-graduation, said Akhilesh and Azmi had shown no concern about their community members for the past four-and-a-half years, but suddenly they have started using the university's name for political gains. “How could they use the name of the varsity on their own?” he questioned, adding that they were trying to establish a different narrative ahead of the state elections. In the 2017 assembly elections, Muslim representation plummeted from 17.1% in 2012 to 5.9%. India’s most populous state has 38.4 million Muslims. In 2017, 24 Muslim candidates were elected to the legislative assembly, and of these 14 had won earlier from the same constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-students-deny-sps-claims-of-their-support-to-party/articleshow/87786856.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolkata||Schools in Kolkata plan to shift tests offline for classes IX & XI||KOLKATA: Many schools in the city, after discussions with parents, have decided that students of classes IX and XI will no longer write their exams online. This transition will help wean them off the virtual mode where students started taking exams lightly and had lost the habit of sitting in a hall scenario to write their papers. Since IX and XI are pre-board years, they need to be jerked out of the comfort of inertia. Schools feel that a big learning gap has already set in because of the virtual exams where marks were easily scored because of the myriad unfair methods that children had adopted. Meetings with parents revealed they are also looking forward to kids writing “real” exams now. “Travelling to school, sitting in an exam hall without any support, comprehending a question paper and tackling it is a positive struggle that each school child should physically go through. Online exams were a part of the online classes, which have had their day,” said Seema Sapru, principal of The Heritage School. Here the term exams are beginning for classes IX and XI on Monday — exclusively in the physical mode. Parents are supportive of the move. If someone is sick, the child can take another physical exam after recovering. The unit tests for classes IX and XI will begin in the physical mode at South City International School from December 6. On Thursday, a webinar was held where principal John Bagul told Class XI students, with parents in the background, that all exams will now be in the physical mode. “Students were habitually taking the exam easy. With the help of parents, we are trying our best to help them shake it off. There will be initial adjustment problems, which will definitely be overcome,” he said. Since more than 80% of children have started coming to school in classes IX and XI, DPS Newtown has decided unit tests should be shifted to the offline mode. “Children are back in large numbers, so there is no reason why they should write the test from home,” said principal Sonali Sen. Two sets of question papers will be prepared by Asian International School and classes will be split into halves for the physical tests for classes IX and XI. “Parents are eager that children start writing “real” tests,” said principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar. There used to be at least 20 toppers every time an exam was held online, be it a unit test or a term exam, said John Ghosh, secretary and principal of St Thomas Boys School, Kidderpore. “We have over 90% children of classes IX and XI attending and so exams will only be offline,” he said. Tirthankar Sarkar, whose son Ayushman is a student of Class XI at DPS Ruby Park, said, “Since my child is back on campus, the next best thing is to write exams on campus.” Ritwick Bhattacharjee, whose daughter Yashamoti is in Class XI at GD Goenka School, said, “Unless they start writing exams in the physical mode again, they will not be able to shake off this lethargy towards studies.” More buses on roads soon:Several bus owners have said reopening of schools and colleges have led to them deciding to increase frequency on all routes except in Esplanade and Sector V, where response is poor. Swapan Ghosh of Minibus Operators’ Coordination Committee said they have finalized routes which will see a 10%-20% augmentation in order to begin services from 7am next Monday. Tapan Banerjee of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate said they will run a few buses early in the morning as there was “positive feedback regarding college students”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-plan-to-shift-tests-offline-for-classes-ix-xi/articleshow/87787591.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Mosquito nets in demand, prices go up as dengue fear strikes Kolkata||KOLKATA: Mosquito nets have disappeared from some neighbourhood bedding stores following a sudden spurt in demand borne out of the fear of fever that has gripped people following the pandemic. A mass order placed by Kolkata Municipal Corporation has also accentuated the demand. Seizing the opportunity, shops have hiked prices. Some shops in Hatibagan and Gariahat ran out of mosquito nets and had to reorder after they failed to anticipate the rise in demand. “Usually, we sell around 25-30 mosquito nets during this season and have another 20-odd in stock. But this time, the entire stock was exhausted earlier this week. We are now getting fresh stock,” said Dhiren Das, a salesman at a bedding store in Hatibagan. At the city’s mosquito net hub in Chetla, where shops do both wholesale and retail business, sales are up nearly 8%-10%. “People seem to have suddenly realised the utility of mosquito nets,” said Swapan Sarkar who runs a store there. Park Circus resident Sneha Mukherjee is among many who have begun using mosquito nets. “I last used one around three decades ago. The only alternative was the suffocating mosquito coil. But after the introduction of mats and liquid repellants, use of mosquito nets ceased. But with fever causing so much anxiety since the pandemic, I decided to revert to mosquito nets,” she said. Admitting that overlapping symptoms of Covid, malaria, dengue and flu made it difficult to understand what was happening till diagnostic tests were carried out, doctors said people should take precautions against mosquito bites just like wearing masks against Covid. Nizam Khan, who sits at the familyowned five-decade-old wholesale store in Chetla, said a KMC order added to the demand spurt this year. Alarmed by the rise in malaria and dengue cases, KMC ordered 20,000 mosquito nets for distribution among slum- and pavement dwellers. “We have been distributing them in the affected boroughs with help from cops,” said a KMC official. This year, 8,000 people across four boroughs have tested positive for malaria, a rise of 60% against last year. Over 60% of these cases are falciparum or malignant malaria. Some areas where the number of infected is high include Burrabazar, Jorabagan, Beadon Street, Rabindra Sarani, College Street, Elliot Road, Entally, Park Circus, Taltala, Amherst Street and Bidhan Sarani. Similarly, dengue cases have also gone up with around 1,000 people testing positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mosquito-nets-in-demand-prices-go-up-as-dengue-fear-strikes-city/articleshow/87787610.cms||Saikat Ray

If you want to catch a glimpse of the deadly jaws residing in Vishwamitri river, then join in the Croc Walk organized as a part of the People’s Heritage Festival on Sunday. In a bid to spread awareness about the crocodiles that have been co-existing with Barodians since decades, a first-of-its-kind crocodile walk has been organized in the city. “Barodians usually see or hear about crocodiles during the monsoons when many reptiles venture out on the roads. But not many know about the crocodiles, their habitat, how they survive in Vishwamitri and why the river is important for the city’s eco-system,” said Vishal Thakur who has organized the walk. “So, we decided to organize a crocodile walk and take people along the Vishwamitri river bank,” he added. “Apart from getting a closer look of the reptile, participants will also get an idea about how crocodiles have been coexisting with humans. It will help in spreading awareness about the crocodiles and other living beings of the river,” Thakur told TOI.  The forest department census conducted last year revealed that about 270 crocodiles reside in Vishwamitri river. Apart from the Croc Walk, a heritage tree walk has been organized by Dr Jitendra Gavali and Chandrashekhar Patil on Saturday on the ONGC Road wherein the duo will talk about the trees planted along the road, their diversity and fruiting season. “Vadodara is home to a variety of trees including many rare ones. The tree walk will be about the diversity and importance of these trees,” Patil said. Sanjay Soni will also organize a heritage walk on November 22 wherein he will take people on Navnath Temple tour explaining the importance of all the nine temples of Lord Shiva in the city. On Sunday, art historian Sandip Joshi will also organize a Baroda Museum Walk wherein he will take citizens through the museum in Sayajibaug and explain the sculptures and paintings.

---||Patna||Make abolition of prohibition RJD’s poll plank: JD(U) to Tejashwi||PATNA: JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjn Singh alias Lalan Singh on Thursday dared leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to include abolition of prohibition in the election manifesto of the RJD. Reacting to Tejashwi’s charges against the state government, Singh said, “If Tejashwi is so vocal about prohibition in the state, he should include abolition of prohibition in his party’s election manifesto.” The Munger MP, however, reiterated that prohibition would continue in the state. “The government is serious about the effective implementation of prohibition law in Bihar. Adequate measures are being taken for this purpose,” he added. Referring to opposition’s remarks over appointment of senior IAS officer K K Pathak as additional chief secretary in prohibition, excise and registration department, the JD(U) national chief said, “It’s the prerogative of the state government to appoint officials. Will the state government now seek suggestion from Tejashwi before posting officers? It’s none of his business.” He clarified that Pathak was posted as excise commissioner when the draft for prohibition in the state was prepared in 2016. Tejashwi had earlier alleged that smuggling of liquor continued in dry state with the tacit support of the senior officials of the state government. He also alleged that the purpose of prohibition has been defeated with unabated bootlegging. Meanwhile, HAM(S) headed by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has decided to convene next national working committee meeting at Valmikinagar in West Champaran on December 16 to discuss various issues, including effective implementation of prohibition in the state. HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan said besides the party’s national chief, the minister for SC/ST welfare department, Santosh Kumar Suman, and executive committee members of other states would attend the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-abolition-of-prohibition-rjds-poll-plank-jdu-to-tejas/articleshow/87786905.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Experts: Exercise regularly, say ‘no’ to steroids||PATNA: With the onset of the winter season, doctors have advised Patnaites to perform physical exercise and yoga every day. They have, however, cautioned youngsters against the use of artificial supplements and steroids. According to weather experts, the minimum temperature of the city has been hovering around 14-16 degrees Celsius during the last few days. Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, a physician, urges people to follow healthy habits and exercise in order to remain fit. “Cardiac patients should, however, avoid early morning walks because the blood pressure tends to rise in the winter season. People suffering from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should also avoid exposure to cold weather,” Dr Diwakar says, adding that precautions should be taken to prevent flu. Dr Shashi Pratap Sahi, the principal of A N College, echoes similar views and asks people to walk or perform yoga regularly. He claims, “I have been walking in the Patna zoo for the last 20 years.” Health experts also advise people, especially youngsters, to work out in gyms, but caution them against the consumption of steroids and artificial supplements. The former director of the health department, Dr R N Pandey, points out, “One cannot lead a healthy life solely by building muscles. Being healthy means that a person is mentally, physically and spiritually fit.” Shamsad Alam, a physical trainer at a gym on Ashiana-Digha Road, says, “There are many trainers who advise people to take steroids, but they can sometimes be fatal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-exercise-regularly-say-no-to-steroids/articleshow/87786600.cms||---

---||Business||Paytm’s 27% crash on debut worst among IPOs over Rs 1,000 crore||MUMBAI: The much-anticipated listing of Paytm, which had raised Rs 18,300 crore in India’s biggest IPO, ended on a bitter note with the stock crashing 27% from its issue price of Rs 2,150, closing at Rs 1,564. At the debut-day close, the plunge in Paytm stock was the worst for any newly listed company that had an IPO of over Rs 1,000 crore. The sharply lower closing also eroded about Rs 38,000 crore worth of investors’ wealth. From a market capitalisation of Rs 1.39 lakh crore (about $20 billion) at the IPO price, the company, a pioneer in tech-enabled payment solutions, is now valued at Rs 1.01 lakh crore (about $13.6 billion) that makes it the 52nd most valued company in India. The listing was for One 97 Communications that operates Paytm. The closing price was 20% below the price discovered during the hour-long pre-listing session. Technically, the stock closed at the lower circuit, which is also leading to fears among marketmen that it may fall further on Monday when trading begins after the extended weekend. What has added to those fears is a report by Australian financial services major Macquarie that put a price target of Rs 1,200 for the stock. Despite the sharp value erosion on its debut session on Dalal Street, Paytm still has a market capitalisation that is more than that of large companies like Hindalco, Coal India and BPCL. At Thursday’s close, Paytm is valued about Rs 6,000 crore more than Coal India, the largest coal producer in the world that so far had India’s biggest IPO when in October 2010 it raised about Rs 15,200 crore. However, in contrast to Paytm’s sliding stock price on listing, on its market debut in early November 2010, Coal India had rallied nearly 40%. Currently, Paytm is worth below the $16 billion valuation that the company had got in 2019, when it raised $1 billion from SoftBank, ANT and other investors. When the bidding for Paytm IPO closed on November 10, the offer was oversubscribed 1.9 times, mainly on the back of institutional and retail investors. After setting a listing price of Rs 1,955 during the pre-open session, the stock lost ground through the session and closed at the day’s low. The Macquarie report, titled ‘Too many fingers in too many pies’, noted that the company had a “complicated organisation structure, related-party transactions, churn in top management and a thinly staffed board with 75% of members being based out of India”. Analysts at Macquarie believe that for Paytm, obtaining a small finance bank licence could be difficult “given that Chinese-controlled firms own more than a 30% stake” in it. The Paytm management said that the analysts had never approached the company to understand its business model. The sharp selloff in Paytm after listing also affected the pricec of some of the recently listed companies, market players said. Policybazaar closed 8% lower, while Zomato closed 1.3% lower and Nykaa lost a marginal 0.3% on Thursday, BSE data showed. The day’s session also saw the sensex close 372 points lower at 59,636. In the last three sessions, the index has lost nearly 1,100 points as inflation in the US has risen sharply and foreign funds have been on a selling spree in recent weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytms-27-crash-on-debut-worst-among-ipos-over-rs-1k-cr/articleshow/87788510.cms||---
---||Pune||WFH helped men to see women in new light||PUNE: A business analyst working in Bengaluru returned to Pune to live with his parents after he was given the pink slip a few months after the pandemic hit India. He was worried and tense but his mother and sister came to his rescue by starting a tiffin service and making enough money to run the house without his contribution. “I never knew that my sister and mother had an entrepreneurial spirit in them. As an MBA graduate, I volunteered to help them with the business side of things but found that they already had a well-functioning system in place. The women of the house have been the breadwinners since and I see them in a new light now,” said the 27-year-old resident of Hadapsar. With the theme of the International Men’s Day, celebrated on November 19, being ‘better relations between men and women’, TOI turns the spotlight on the changing dynamics between men and women since the pandemic started. As work from home became the norm during the initial months of the pandemic and the lockdown, it helped many to change their notions of household work and about the role played by their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters as they juggled different roles with courage, confidence and professionalism --- attributes generally associated with men. Karthik Agarwal, IT professional manager, said, “I have always avoided confrontation with my colleagues. But while working from home I saw my wife, a purchase manager, boldly voicing her opinion with her colleagues and clients and managing difficult situations with confidence.” Krishna TN found that housework was no joke as he started participating in household chores. “I learnt that whether it is spreading out the laundry, dusting the furniture, sweeping, mopping or doing the dishes, there is a science and art to everything, which women do effortlessly.” Suhail Badri , a tourism entrepreneur, said,“Ever since my daughter started working two years ago, I thought she was splurging all her money on shopping online. But during the pandemic, my 23-year-old was working from home, cooking and distributing food to Covid-affected families, volunteering with various groups to facilitate vaccination, and running our house, all with her own savings.” But while some took the initiative to share household responsibilities and supported their professional ambitions, others found it a tad difficult to get along. “Many couples have had problems arising from ego issues,” said psychologist Aishwariya Sanavaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wfh-helped-men-to-see-women-in-new-light/articleshow/87787674.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Ahmedabad||63-year-old man’s throat slit in Acher||Ahmedabad: A 63-year-old man from Chandkheda was found with his throat slit at another house belonging to him, at Thakorvas in Acher, in the wee hours of Wednesday, police said. The officers investigating the murder said the victim may have been killed due to a dispute in his homosexual relationship and they have zeroed in on the suspect. According to the FIR filed at Sabarmati police station, the deceased, Devendra Rawat, a resident of Dhartinagar Society in Chandkheda, had retired from his job at a private firm in Vadodara in 2018. “On Tuesday at around 3pm, Rawat got a call from a man who told him to accompany him to a jewellery shop so he could buy a gold chain for his mother. Rawat’s wife Geeta Rawat told cops about the man, whom she does not know,” said a police officer. The officer said Rawat’s wife asked him about the man and he responded that he lived in Vatva and had got a bonus and wanted to buy a gold chain for his mother. At around 5pm on Thursday, Rawat left home to meet that man and did not return till 8pm. After this, his wife called her nephew Manoj Chaudhary and expressed concern about Rawat, who was incommunicado. Chaudhary, who was in Kalol at the time, told her that he would go to Rawat’s other house in Thakorvas at Acher and would inquire about him. At around 1.15am on Wednesday, Chaudhary reached Rawat’s home in Thakorvas where he found him lying in pool of blood with his throat cut. Rawat’s family informed police about the murder and a team of Sabarmati police reached the spot and began an investigation. Rawat’s wife told the cops that her husband’s gold chain, mobile phone and motorcycle were stolen from the house in Acher. Police officers first began inquiry on the angle of robbery but after they found Rs 200 cash in his pocket and spoke to local residents, they learned the murder took place due to a dispute in Rawat’s homosexual relationship. The officers said only Rawat’s cellphone and motorcycle were taken by the killer. Sources in the police said they have zeroed in on the person who called Rawat before he went incommunicado.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/63-year-old-mans-throat-slit-in-acher/articleshow/87766772.cms||---

---||Meerut||2 UP journos, booked for 'rioting' in 1987, discharged by court 34 yrs on||MEERUT: Rakesh Garg and Rakesh Goel, two journalists who worked at a Hindi daily in Saharanpur, UP, have been discharged by a civil court 34 years after they were booked for "rioting". Goel died in 2018 after a prolonged illness. Garg is now 64. The court said that discharging the two accused in the "ancient" case "did not harm public interest" as the UP government in 1991, under chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, had already asked the court, via an affidavit, to take back all charges against the accused. The Saharanpur court in its order, a copy of which is with TOI, said that the government had initiated proceedings to take back the case in March 1991 but the affidavit had "some technical errors". The court started proceedings to discharge the accused 11 years later, in 2002, after receiving a revised affidavit from the government. Proceedings continued for the next 19 years and the accused kept making rounds of the court. “It took 34 years for the court to discharge the two and come to the conclusion that the charges framed against them shouldn’t have been there in the first place. The government had already asked the court to revoke the charges against the accused. It took over three decades for the judiciary to give them a fair chance,” said Abhay Saini, lawyer of the two and president of the local bar association. The journalists were accused of "raising provocative slogans" during a procession that was passing near a Saharanpur mosque in 1987. They were sent to jail and the police booked them under sections 147 (rioting), 153 (provocation to riot), 153(a) (promoting disharmony), and 353 (assault to deter public servant) of the IPC. The then Congress government of chief minister Vir Bahadur Singh had also initially slapped charges against the duo under the National Security Act, 1980. The journalists spent time behind bars for a month, before those charges were taken back. The case then proceeded under relevant sections of the IPC. Garg, who was 30 at the time of the incident, said that he was on a reporting assignment and wasn’t participating in the procession. He said the charges pressed on him deprived him of a permanent job, bank loans, and compromised his reputation in society. He told TOI that the procession was the Ram Rath Yatra, which is an annual affair at the Gangoh area of Saharanpur. "That particular year saw more festivities as the Vishva Hindu Parishad's movement was picking pace," he added. “I was the one who was pacifying the crowd, asking them not to raise slogans. All I did was urge the administration to allow the procession to move forward, based on the request of the organisers of the yatra. Police booked me for no reason. I think I became a victim of politics,” Garg said. Police, while booking the two journalists, said they "raised anti-minority slogans and pushed PAC personnel".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-up-journos-booked-for-rioting-in-1987-discharged-by-court-34-yrs-on/articleshow/87786890.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||Family takes lead to donate organs of 18-yr-old braindead son||Nagpur: In an example of increasing awareness about the noble cause of organ donation in society, members of a family from Nagpur that lost their 18-year-old only son came forward and took a spontaneous decision to donate his organs to needy patients. Tirth Devang Shah, who recently cleared his HSC examination, died of brain haemorrhage on November 17 at New Era Hospital. Tirth had a fall from his bike due to some dizziness on November 14. This was followed by episodes of vomiting in the evening. However, he was fine. He had his dinner and went to sleep. On November 15, his grandfather went to his room to wake him up, but he had stopped responding by then. Family members got him admitted to New Era hospital. Despite 3 days of treatment, his condition deteriorated and the team of doctors declared him brain dead on November 17. “The young boy had a fall due to bleeding in brain but it was not realized as he started feeling better. When he reached the hospital in critical condition, probably after 24 hours of the fall, it was very difficult to save him,” said neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal. After doctors declared him brain dead, his parents Darshana and Devang as well as grandfather Jayantibhai took the decision to donate his organs. After being formally counselled by Dr Ashwini Choudary, they agreed to donate all organs, including heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and eyes. Zonal Transplant Coordination Center’s (ZTCC) Nagpur team sent a national alert for heart and lungs. “The heart was allotted to a patient admitted to MGM Hospital, Chennai. But as the recipient could not afford the chartered flight cost, the offer was declined. Similarly, lungs could not be transported due to logistic reasons,” said ZTCC coordinator Veena Wathore. “Even after death, Tirth moved into a new life by being the hero who donated his organs and gave the gift of life to three people,” said Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital where one kidney and liver was transplanted to needy patients on Thursday. “The enthusiasm and preparedness of the parents and relatives for donating all organs needed to be seen to be believed. They were disheartened as the heart and lungs could not be donated due to logistic reasons,” said Dr Sanjay Kolte, secretary of ZTCC. ZTCC President Dr Vibhavari Dani said the time has now come to mull over logistical cost hindrance, especially at government level. “Serious rethinking is necessary for lowering such costs to save lives of the needy and underprivileged sections of the society,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/family-takes-lead-to-donate-organs-of-18-yr-old-braindead-son/articleshow/87787684.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Varanasi||Sant Samiti seeks apology from Akhilesh Yadav over his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark||Varanasi: National general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (AKSS) Swami Jitendranand Saraswati on Thursday demanded an apology from Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav for his ‘chillumjeevi’ remark, telling him to “either express an apology to the seers’ fraternity or get ready to face their ire”. On Wednesday, in an apparent attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘saffron politics’ at a rally during the fourth phase of his ‘Vijay Yatra’ on Purvanchal Expressway at Pakhanpura area in Ghazipur, Akhilesh had reportedly called holy saffron-clad saints ‘chillumjeevi’ (users of pipe used for smoking tobacco or intoxicants) and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of one particular colour).” Swami Jitendranand said, “In his bid to target the BJP and its leadership, the SP chief has insulted the saffron-clad seers and their fraternity by terming them as ‘chillumjeevi’ and ‘ek rang wale’ (people of the same colour).” The Swami also defended Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in view of the SP chief’s remark. “Yogi Ji is the head of one of the prime peeths of Sanatan Dharma which is worshipped and honoured since ancient times. Nobody has the right to victimize Yogi for the sake of dirty politics and just because he has become a chief minister,” said Swami Jitendranand. “The SP chief should immediately apologise for the remarks and avoid dragging seers in the political battlefield for petty electoral gains,” said Swami Jitendranand, cautioning Akhilesh that “he will have to face the ire of saffron-clad seers as they will go door-to-door to expose his views”. He added that the “Sant Samaj (seers’ community) will soon launch a campaign against the Samajwadis and Congress leaders targeting the seers’ fraternity for political gains”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sant-samiti-seeks-apology-from-akhilesh-yadav-over-his-chillumjeevi-remark/articleshow/87788350.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Their arrest took place a few hours after the announcement of a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on PK, against whom a local court had issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW). Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “PK and Ritesh were arrested from the Ring road under the limits of Sarnath police station area. Ritesh, a clerk in culture and youth affairs department and posted at the secretariat of Bihar government in Patna, is married to PK’s sister Priya, who is a doctor at a PHC in Chhapra. Her involvement in the gang has also come to light in the ongoing investigations.” “PK, who belongs to Chhapra district and posed as a doctor, had settled in Patna following the retirement of his father from the industry department in 1990,” police said. “He had formed the solvers’ gang about six years ago. With the help of Ritesh he used to get the exam papers of different competitive examinations of UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar or arrange impersonators for gullible aspirants after charging huge amounts — from Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 49 lakh. With the wealth created from these illegal activities, he had constructed several multi-storied buildings in Patna, Danapur, purchased plots and luxury SUVs,” the police added. The process for announcing the cash reward on PK had been initiated after issuance of NBW against him and it was approved on Thursday morning. Before announcing the cash reward on PK, the CP said that cash rewards of Rs 20,000 had also been announced on each of his accomplices — Mrityunjay Debnath and Dr Afroz — as they were also absconding and have not surrendered before the court so far. With the progress in investigation, a medico of KGMU Osama Shahid, Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia, Raju Kumar of Jehanabad in Bihar and father of an aspirant Tapan Saha from Tripura have been arrested so far. The arrests started after the gang was busted by the police with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from a NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under the limits of Sarnath police station in Varanasi. Of the 25 aspirants in contact with the gang, 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine skipped the exam. The National Testing Agency withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for two years from appearing in the exam. “Police summoned the 16 candidates for recording their statements and to take their fingerprints. They have started appearing before the investigation team and their statements are being recorded with videography,” the CP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-mastermind-pk-aide-arrested-in-varanasi/articleshow/87788361.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Spanning an area of 12,00 hectares across Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor districts, the wetland is part of the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. The wetland lies in the Central Asian Flyway and is an important stopover for the avian visitors such as Bar-headed goose, Ruddy Shelduck, Gadwall, Eurasian Wigeon, Spot-billed duck, Northern Shoveler, Northern Pintail and Eurasian Teal. The forest department is making all-out efforts to attract tourists and bird-watchers to visit the wetland to see the feathered visitors wintering. Over 16,000 birds of 114 species were spotted in Haiderpur Wetland and at least 3,600 were sighted in Bijnor district on World Wetland Day last year. Two years ago, over 20,000 birds were spotted. Last year, there was a fall in numbers of birds as water in the Ganga and its adjacent Haiderpur Wetland had decreased drastically. But this time around, there is enough water. The Ganga is flowing with 36,000k cusecs of water. Joel Lyall, author of ‘Jungle Tale’, said, “The wetlands have enough water to retain the birds’ interest." Over the past one week, migratory birds have been spotted on the banks of the Ganga and various lakes like Haravili, Pili Dam and in the Afzalgarh area. Migratory birds were also spotted In some parts of Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said the department is making efforts to enlist the help of the villagers living along the Ganga and its tributaries that flow through the wetland to help in protecting and conserving the birds. Informers have been alerted against the movement of poachers. “We have urged the villagers not to dump garbage or animal carcasses near the banks of the rivers or lakes. We have appealed to them to avoid using pesticides in farmlands close to the wetlands to ensure a safe and clean environment for the migratory birds, “ said Semmaran." The Bijnor administration has even launched a campaign to adopt organic farming at the 25 villages along river Ganga. Umesh Mishra, district magistrate, said, "We are running a campaign to make the farmers aware about organic farming. Recently, during the Gangoysav programme, the farmers were trained to practice organic farming."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/good-oct-rains-make-haiderpur-wetland-ideal-for-migratory-birds-experts/articleshow/87786931.cms||Harveer Dabas

The date is fixed on November 26 after court work is over,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said. Earlier, Patil submitted DGCA’s certification along with the pursis informing that all NFC posts are filled up, every machinery is put in order and all aircraft are also in flying condition, except for CESSNA 172-R, as its one part is to be replaced/repaired. He added even this aircraft will be brought back in order within a week. “These documents show that DGCA has granted its approval for conducting flying training courses as specified in the certificate. Issuance of the certificate is a significant development and paved the way for NFC’s actual revival. Now, according to the Patil, nothing remains to be done and the club can start its training operations immediately,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing till December 2. Patil further informed that the decision will be taken for issuing advertisement for inviting applications from the interested candidates for joining the training programmes.  “The courses for which approval has been granted are Private Pilot License (PPL), Commercial Pilot License (CPL), IR Instrument Rating, Assistant Flying Instructor Rating (AFIR), Flying Instructor Rating (FIR) and extension of aircraft ratings on single engine. All these courses now shall be initiated,” he said. “We have accepted Patil’s submissions and appreciate efforts taken by the authorities for expediting the NFC’s revival. We also appreciate the promptitude shown by DGCA in considering the matter and granting certificate of approval,” the bench said. The court was hearing a PIL (No13/2016) filed by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate which was later pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the government’s apathy in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-judges-to-visit-flying-club-on-nov-26-with-petitioner-div-commissioner/articleshow/87787693.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

E-GP systems cater to the procurement and tendering requirements of various government departments and organizations. This partnership aims to ease the hassle of the existing systems by making more than 50 operational e-GP systems across the country interoperable, which, till now, work in silos. Director IIT-K Prof Abhay Karandikar said, “I am delighted for the team of CRUBN, who have come forward to help in developing a key blockchain network across the country to enrich the existing e-governance systems. This will help IIT-Kanpur in realising the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat in state-of-the-art technologies and making India a technology super power.” This blockchain network will be used for validating the claims of suppliers along with their identities. The proposed system will connect all the e-GP systems through a network and help retrieve and validate relevant supplier data between various e-GP Systems in use within India. The system will also digitize bank guarantees by powering them using the trust-based automation of Blockchain. When fully operational, this system will be a pan-India system that would reduce the time and cost associated with public procurements made using e-GP systems. CRUBN was incubated at IIT-K for phase-III of National Blockchain Project, funded by the National Security Council Secretariat and envisioned to build e-governance solutions using blockchain technology. IIT Kanpur’s C3i Center, funded by the SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board) is India’s first cyber security research and education centre in the field of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. Further, the C3i Hub (The Technology Innovation Hub funded by DST’s National Mission on Cyber Physical systems) established at IIT Kanpur helps in empowering the research, education, start-up ecosystem, and industrial collaboration in the field of cyber security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-incubated-crubn-to-ease-hassles-of-existing-e-governance-systems/articleshow/87788363.cms||---

Buses of state roadways would have to mandatorily carry a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate or face challan. A coordination meeting was held by the transport department with Delhi Traffic Police and district magistrates to enforce the ban. Delhi Traffic Police also issued an advisory prohibiting entry of trucks and said they had deployed teams at all pickets and 15 border areas to enforce the ban. Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Manish Kumar Agarwal said they were implementing all necessary measures advised to curb pollution. “We are talking to other departments, truck unions, drivers and owners to make adequate arrangements for proper parking and halting of vehicles outside Delhi’s borders. We have suggested that they use warehouses and transport hubs till further orders,” said Agarwal. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that 14 enforcement teams had been deployed by the government at the border entry points. The DMs had been asked to coordinate with their counterparts in the neighbouring districts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh so that trucks not destined for Delhi were diverted to expressways. In a letter to the neighbouring states, Kundra said, “Our enforcement teams have been given a clear mandate to impound and scrap any diesel vehicle older than 10 years found plying on Delhi roads. All stage carriage buses are required to carry a valid PUC certificate. The enforcement authorities are issuing challans to all vehicles found without a valid PUC in Delhi.” The letter also mentioned that, according to Supreme Court orders, the governments of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan were required to provide large billboards at exit points towards alternate highways to inform commercial traffic of diversions. Till Thursday, at least 500 trucks had been stopped at Delhi’s borders. A police officer said they had discussed the action plan with traffic police in Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad.

---||Pune||Pune: Woman gets life imprisonment for poisoning 3-year-old son to death||PUNE: The court of additional sessions judge G P Agrawal here on Thursday convicted and sentenced Swati Vikram Malvadkar (29) to life imprisonment for poisoning her three-year-old son to death at her house at Rupeenagar in Nigdi on August 2, 2016. The court also imposed three years and six months sentences on Swati for administering poison and attempting suicide, under Sections 328 and 309 of the Indian Penal Code, respectively. The sentences are to run concurrently with the main punishment, the court said. Swati, who was granted bail on September 24, 2016, was taken into custody after the sentencing and sent to jail. Additional public prosecutor Leena Pathak told TOI, “The convict wanted to live separately from her joint family, and this was the cause of frequent quarrels with her husband, Vikram, whom she married on May 3, 2013. ” Judge Agrawal said that the minimum sentence for a conviction under Section 302 (murder) is life term and since the present case did not fall within the ambit of “rarest of rare case” to attract a death penalty, the convict shall suffer life imprisonment. The judge expressed anguish over “the manner in which a child was killed by his own birth giver.” On the day of the incident, Swati’s husband, who was at work, called his brother Shrikant around 1.45pm and asked him to check why Swati was not responding to his calls. When Shrikant reached home, he found both the three-year-old and Swati lying motionless. A saree was found entangled with the bedroom ceiling fan. The two were rushed to a nearby hospital where the child was declared dead, and Swati was referred for treatment. A post-mortem was conducted on the child and a chit, purportedly written by Swati was found in the pocket of the child’s pant. The Nigdi police registered an FIR and subsequent investigation led to Swati’s arrest on August 20, 2016. The police also recovered two bottles of Khatnil, an insecticide, and Temprid SC, used for controlling bed bugs, from the spot. The accused was subsequently charged for offences under Sections 302, 328 and 309 of the IPC. During the trial, the accused had taken a defence of false implication as her father-inlaw was a former police officer. She also referred to a domestic violence case she had registered against her husband and in-laws. The court, however, found substance in the prosecution’s argument that the domestic violence case, registered after Swati regained consciousness in the hospital, was an afterthought. Besides, her claims were not supported by apt evidence. On the contrary, the 13 witnesses examined by the prosecution, besides the evidence were found reliable, unshakable and credible, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-gets-life-imprisonment-for-poisoning-3-year-old-son-to-death/articleshow/87787696.cms||Vishwas Kothari

More than 300 employees of the civic body, equipped with heavy machinery, are involved in the drive. For the first time, such large-scale action against encroachments is being carried out here. Over the past couple of months, the KMC had carried out surveys. The focus was on encroachments in basements reserved for parking of vehicles for the visitors as well as encroachments along nullahs that cause obstruction to the natural flow of water. So far, seven basements in different parts of the city have been cleared. The basements had been rented out for commercial purposes, thus forcing visitors to park their vehicles along the roads. This caused traffic congestions in residential and commercial localities. Harshit Ghatage, KMC’s deputy city engineer, said, “The owners or operators of the establishments were asked to get the encroachments removed by themselves. Some did so, but many did not. Therefore, we had to strike down on the encroachments. Most of the basements were converted into shops and warehouses, which is illegal. We found such encroachments in hospital buildings and lodges also.” During the June floods, the issue of encroachments along the nullahs, especially the Jayanti nullah, was raised by the activists. “The survey, showed several temporary sheds and shop cabins. We demolished such encroachments,” said Ghatage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/major-drive-to-get-rid-of-encroachment-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/87786168.cms||---

More than half of the daily tests are rapid antigen tests (RAT) or done at private labs. This means that the workload on public facilities has drastically reduced giving them the liberty to perform other tasks.Civic health officials said as the testing facility doesn’t need much personnel, they are being sent for vaccination drive where more manpower is needed.The urban primary health centres (UPHCs) continue to offer RT-PCR and antigen tests which have sufficient stock of kits, but a few takers. Some additional centres which were started due to huge demand in second wave have been clubbed with nearby UPHCs or Covid Care Centre (CCCs).Zone officials said people needing a negative RT-PCR certificate for travelling to certain cities and some having symptoms of cough and cold are coming, but the numbers are pretty low. “We had discontinued services of additional manpower requisitioned from NUHM as per government directives. But now, they have been called again as the workload under ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ is huge,” officials said.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said swab collection is going on. “As people are not coming for tests, we delegate other work to the staff. Yet, if someone needs a test, they can visit the UPHC,” he said.Medical microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed, who runs a private lab, said overall there is drop in footfalls. “Sometime back, pregnant women used to come regularly but now they seem to be preferring antigen tests. We mostly have people who wish to travel or have developed symptoms after returning from outstation. Some concerned local residents too come but as compared to others, they are very few in numbers,” he said.Testing over the monthsMonth -------------- TestsApril--------------6,90,983May --------------5,34,771June --------------2,74,488July --------------2,19,094Aug --------------1,45,368Sept --------------4,86,292Oct--------------98,592Nov* -------------- 81,372* Nov data till 17th.

When the National Asessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) team visited PU in 2015, the student-teacher ratio was found to be low, which was affecting students and increasing the burden on teachers. The NAAC team called for rectification of the situation at the earliest. However, PU did not follow this up for two to three years.

On Thursday, the saffron party has organised a protest rally at Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) demanding to cancel a government resolution (GR) of October 18 through which the MVA government had hiked Gunthewari charges by three times. Last week, it had targetted the government over failure to reduce VAT on fuel. However, no permission was taken out of for Thursday’s rally, where large number of BJP activists gathered at NIT office in Civil Lines, despite the fact that Section 144 of IPC prohibiting gathering of four or more persons is at a place was enforced in the city in the aftermath of Amravati riots. “We had taken permission for our earlier protests related to same issue, but today’s rally was having small numbers so did not seek it. On Wednesday, NCP organised a slew of programmes for their supremo Sharad Pawar at a hotel and other places where hundreds of their party workers and other citizens participated. No one asked them on whether they had sought permission and how they were allowed to gather despite Section 144 was in place. How law can be different for ruling party and opposition,” MLA Krishna Khopde said. Under Khopde’s leadership, the BJP delegation submitted a representation to NIT chairman Manoj Suryawanshi which was actually directed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to cancel the “black GR” of October 18. The delegation warned that if the MVA government failed to act, they would intensify their protests. The delegation comprising BJP MLA and other top functionaries apprised of the NIT chief that about five lakh citizens would suffer due to three-fold hike in Gunthewari charges from Rs56/sq ft to Rs168. According to them, the decision was taken without consulting the elected representatives.

On Thursday, in view of the proposed visit of additional chief secretary panchayati raj and rural development, chief development officer, Kanpur Dehat, Soumya Pandey, reached Bhainsaya village, where the families will reside, and took stock of the arrangements with regard to their accommodation. Accompanied by teams of revenue and development departments, Pandey gave necessary directions to the officials concerned. In this sequence, CDO inspected the work of the rejuvenation plan done in the school built there. She directed the concerned authorities that the work which is incomplete should be completed soon. Later, she also inspected the ‘gaushala’ built there and directed the officials to provide green fodder, straw, water and bran to the cows. She said that in view of the fast approaching winter season, the ‘gaushala’ should be covered with tarpaulins so that the animals remain safe. To recall, the state government has decided to rehabilitate Bengali Hindus who migrated in the 1970s from East Pakistan (Bangladesh). The state cabinet on November 10 had cleared a proposal for the rehabilitation plan for 63 Hindu Bengali families displaced from East Pakistan in 1970 on 121.41 hectares of land available in the name of the rehabilitation department in village Bhainsaya, under Rasulabad tehsil in Kanpur Dehat district. Official sources said the families would be allotted two acre each for farming activities, and 200 sq. metres of land for residential purposes for which Rs 1.20 lakh would be allotted per family to construct a house under the Mukhya Mantri Awaas Yojana, said the sources and added further that “they would also get land reform and irrigation facilities under MGNREGA as per requirement”. Those who migrated from East Pakistan were rehabilitated under the provisions of The Displaced Persons (Claims) Act 1950 & The Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act 1954 brought by the Indian Government. “In Odisha and Budaun, 332 families were rehabilitated while the remaining 63 Hindu Bengali families were provided jobs in a cotton factory in Meerut and settled there,” said official sources further. However, the mill shut down on August 8, 1984 following which 63 families were awaiting rehabilitation. There were originally 65 families but members of two families had died since, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/63-bengali-hindu-familiesbeing-settled-in-rasulabad/articleshow/87788380.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat private school told to issue leaving certificate||AHMEDABAD: Since the lockdown, a lot of students shifted from private schools to government-run schools due to the financial stress caused by the pandemic. Little Arman in Jamnagar was not lucky enough to have a smooth transfer to a government school. His father had to wage a year-long legal battle with the school for his school leaving certificate so that he could get admission to the government school, and this happened only after the intervention of consumer courts. According to the case details, a resident of Jamnagar, Chand Alam Ansari decided to move his son Arman, a student of Class 3 at St Francis School, to a government school after the lockdown. In July 2020, he requested the school to provide the school leaving certificate. Ansari told the school that it had begun teaching online but he had only one Android phone. He could not afford the expenses and wanted to shift the child to a government school. The private school asked Ansari to pay fees for the period of March to July, but Ansari refused, saying that his son was not taught anything in this time due to the lockdown. The school refused him the certificate and the child could not be admitted to the government school. Ansari dragged the school management to the Jamnagar District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission alleging deficiency in service and seeking directions to the school to issue the certificate. He also demanded compensation from school for wasting his son’s precious time by not issuing the certificate. The school management, on the other hand, insisted that Ansari’s son got admission for the academic year 2020-21. For the certificate, Ansari had first to pay Rs 5,400 as fees for the last quarter, which he had not done. After hearing the case, in August, the district commission concluded the by not issuing the school leaving certificate, the school had shown a deficiency in service. But it was also held that Ansari was liable to pay the fees. The commission found a way out, and ordered Ansari to pay Rs 5,400 to the school but also directed the school to pay Rs 1,400 to Ansari as compensation for not issuing the certificate and Rs 4,000 extra for legal expenditure he had to incur. The commission, in this way, settled the account. This was not acceptable to the private school and it filed an appeal in the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission against order of the district commission, but did not succeed. The school’s appeal was rejected in the last week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/private-school-told-to-issue-lc/articleshow/87787702.cms||---

---||Mumbai||SC rejects ex-Maharashtra home minister’s plea to examine CBI report on him||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh's plea for the court to examine CBI's preliminary inquiry report against him which allegedly granted him a clean chit. The court, however, allowed him the liberty to raise the issue before an appropriate court. At the outset, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Deshmukh, referred to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on whose plea a CBI probe was ordered against the former minister and said the court had passed the order placing confidence in him but the cop was himself absconding now. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said, "It is very unfortunate for the institutions. It shows lack of faith in the system." The bench, thereafter, proceeded with the hearing and raised the question of how he could directly approach he apex under Article 32 jurisdiction. Sibal contended that SC passed the order against Deshmukh on the presumption that evidence against him was found by CBI after a preliminary enquiry (PE) and an FIR was filed, but as per media reports the politician was given a clean chit in the PE report. Sibal contended that the court should ask CBI to place before it the 65-page PE report along with file notings to find out the truth. He said if it was true that "nothing was found against me" in the PE, then it was clear that there was political motivation behind lodging an FIR The bench, however, asked how much credence could be given to media reports and said it was not inclined to entertain the petition. It allowed him to raise the issue before a competent court. "As per certain newspaper reports the Petitioner is stated to have been given a clean chit. Therefore, they have called for all records...We are not inclined to exercise jurisdiction under Article 32 in this scenario. It is always open for the petitioner to raise the issue before a competent court," the court said. Deshmukh (71) was arrested by the ED on November 1 after questioning in the case, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 this year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations that demands of Rs 100 crore by way of bribes from Mumbai's hotel and restaurant owners were sought by the former minister. The allegations were levelled by Param Bir Singh. The ED case is that Deshmukh, while serving as the state's home minister, misused his official position and through dismissed police officer Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-rejects-ex-maharashtra-home-ministers-plea-to-examine-cbi-report-on-him/articleshow/87789015.cms||---

With no fresh violence during the the last five days, normalcy seems to be returning to the city. People stepped out to buy essentials as police gave a six-hour relaxation in curfew from 11 am on Thursday. Bonde said that he was still firm on his statement that riots do not happen in states ruled by BJP. “It is in Congress or Left-ruled states that rioters are protected,” he said. The former guardian minister said that law and order situation in Maharashtra has collapsed and such statements (by Malik) are being made to divert people’s attention. “Though the home minister of the state is a good-natured man, he is helpless. We have every right to protest when a violent mob pelts stones at shops and beats shopkeepers,” he said. With no fresh violence during the the last five days, normalcy seems to be returning to the city. People stepped out to buy essentials as police gave a six-hour relaxation in curfew from 11 am on Thursday. Banks and government offices resumed their working but transactions were stalled as internet services remained suspended. Curfew was clamped and internet was barred after violence broke out in the city on November 12 and 13. Administration is taking all efforts to restore normalcy. The curfew was relaxed for not only essential goods but also for agriculture centres. On Friday, there will be relaxation in curfew from 9am to 12 noon and 3pm to 5pm. Internet services are expected to become operational from 3pm on Friday. Students appearing for various exams have been given concession in curfew. Cops have arrested 210 persons till Thursday noon and filed 35 cases. The process of registering offences is under way. In all, 14,673 persons have been booked so far.

Sarkhej resident Amjad Sipai, 41, in his complaint with Vejalpur police on Wednesday stated he had a shop in Bopal, which he had set up with tin sheets. The municipal corporation five months ago directed him to close it down as it was an encroachment on land that was not his. The complainant stated that the structure was dismantled and the metal sheets and pipes were left at the spot. On Wednesday, he saw the sheets and pipes of his shop at a scrap shop in Sarkhej. He found out that a youth had come a month ago and sold the sheets and pipes, stating that his shop in Bopal had been closed down and he was disposing of the material. The scrap dealer paid Rs 12,000 for the sheets, pipes and a device for breaking ice. He said the material had been sold to them by Zahiruddin Momin and his son Jishan, residents of Sarkhej, and a complaint has been lodged against them.

The party alleged that the BJP government led by CM Bhupendra Patel is trying to cover up the scam. Party spokesman Manish Doshi said, “During the lockdown, a scam regarding siphoning off ration worth more than Rs 100 crore using 62,000 fake identity documents was reported in Surat. The government has not taken any action so far in the case or even dared to inquire into the scam in other districts through same modus operandi.” “In Surat, using fake identity documents of over 62,000 ration card holders under the National Food Security Act, rations worth crores of rupees was stolen. Though a similar scam could have easily been done in other districts, the Gujarat government has avoided taking any action,” Doshi said. He added, “Cases of siphoning of ration meant for distribution to the poor for free have been reported in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Rajkot, Jamnagar and other districts. The BJP government has not done anything yet to stop this massive corruption. A few top officials of the civil supply department are allegedly behind the scam and we demand that the BJP government take action,” Doshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/congress-alleges-scam-in-free-ration-scheme/articleshow/87787717.cms||---

---||Pune||Panel to frame education policy for minority institutions in Maharashtra||PUNE: A 16-member state-level committee under education commissioner Vishal Solanki has been set up to discuss and recommend a policy for the education of minorities in the state. Experts from the communitiesand educators are expected to submit the report within three months. The government gives various grants and has implemented many schemes for students of minority communities and their educational institutes. An independent education policy for minority communities is necessary. The committee will look into the existing schemes and new ones to improve minority education and submit its recommendations, the government resolution released on Wednesday said. The resolution further said that the Supreme Court has passed four judgments explaining various clauses in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 which are not applicable to the minority institutions. The committee is expected to study this and other judgments regarding minority institutes and formulate administrative and educational policies related to schools, students and teachers in minority institutes. Markus Deshmukh, an advocate and also educational consultant for many minority schools, said, “Till now, there has not been any policy specifically for minority education. This has created some issues because there are ambiguities when it comes to implementing some Acts. Such a policy will help clear them. Secondly, there are many schemes available but implementation may be an issue because the educational department officers do not know them well. Their training is a must. Thirdly, there are areas in the education of minority communities where we can do better as a state. This will also be studied and a draft policy will be recommended.” In its report that was out in August, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), sought the extension of the RTE Act, 2009, to include minority institutions. The child rights body had demanded that the states issue guidelines for minority schools to set aside a minimum percentage of students admitted from minority communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panel-to-frame-edu-policy-for-minority-institutions/articleshow/87787730.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Nashik||Nashik Municipal Corporation to spend Rs 400 crore to overhaul water pipe network||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to completely overhaul city’s underground water pipeline network at a cost of over Rs 400 crore. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the civic body is in the process of appointing an agency to help the NMC prepare a master plan for the ambitious project to ensure city’s water needs are taken care of for the next 30 years. Jadhav said this exercise is important as city’s population is increasing rapidly due to Nashik’s thriving economy. The NMC is already in the process of floating a request for proposal (RFP) to appoint the agency. “The RFP will be floated within a week,” he said. The task of the agency would be to prepare a plan and methodology that would be adopted for the underground water supply pipeline from Gangapur dam to the city. An NMC official said the existing direct pipeline between Gangapur dam to Bara Bungalow water filtration plant, a distance of around 12 km, is to be replaced with new ones. The pipeline will be further extended by another 8-km till Gandhinagar water filtration plant and the proposed work is estimated to cost Rs 175 crore. Currently, Nashik Road division gets water from Chehedi weir of the Darna dam. However, Waldevi river that connects to Chehedi weir is supplying contaminated water to the jackwell from where the NMC lifts water. Due to complaints from residents about contaminated water the NMC was forced to stop water supply from Chehedi on many occasions. Last year, the NMC could lift only 16 mcft of water from Chehedi weir even though the water reservation in Darna dam was 400 mcft. Hence, the NMC has plans of laying new pipeline to lift water from Darna dam. A 20-km pipeline will be laid between Darna dam to Gandhinagar water filtration plant via Pathardi area of the city. The work is estimated to cost around Rs 150 crore. Further, 25 new overhead water tanks would be established at various locations that are witnessing population growth at a cost of Rs 60 crore. Moreover, the NMC has two water filtration plants in Gandhinagar and Nashik Road divisions. The civic body has plans to connect both the water filtration plants through a six-km pipeline at a cost of Rs 19 crore. Presently, the NMC supplies 650 million litres per day (MLD) of water for the entire Nashik city. The daily water requirement of the city is likely to increase by over 1,500 MLD during the next 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-spend-rs-400-crore-to-overhaul-water-pipe-network/articleshow/87786188.cms||Tushar Pawar

According to senior officials of MSRTC’s Nashik division, passenger count has been increasing for destinations like Pune and Dhule, for which buses ply every hour. However, at the moment, the movement of buses is affected due to the ongoing strike called by the MSRTC employees. The MSRTC authorities are trying to persuade the employees — the drivers, conductors and other workers — to call off the strike, but that has not helped resolve the issue. However, the administration was able to run the Shivshahi buses taken on lease by the corporation to various destinations. “The number of buses on the road is limited. The bus sent from Nashik to Pune despite stone-pelting, as an experiment, is now bearing fruits. We now have hourly service from New CBS terminus of Nashik to Pune and Dhule,” the senior officer of the MSRTC said. The MSRTC started the Borivali bus services from Mahamarg bus terminus in the city, which is also receiving good response from the citizens. The leased buses have drivers on contract. A similar experiment can also be carried out with Aurangabad, where the bus service is likely to be started in the next few days. The MSRTC officials said they have also issued notices to 58 of the 69 employees working on ‘nominal muster roll’ (NMR), which is a step before they are inducted into the services completely. “Since they failed to take up their duties, we have now issued them show-cause notice for their action and they will be terminated for the job if their replies are not satisfactory,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-msrtc-to-start-buses-to-aurangabad/articleshow/87786164.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mangaluru||Yellow rain reported in Udupi; experts yet to ascertain cause||Udupi: Residents at a few places in Beejadi near Koteshwara in Kundapur have said that they saw light yellow rain drops on their clothes and other articles on Wednesday. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board in Udupi has taken note of this development. In 2017, yellow rain was witnessed in Amasebail in Kundapur Taluk. Professor Arun M Isloor, who teaches chemistry at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) in Surathkal, said that “unless the samples are examined, we cannot conclude the exact cause for the yellow rain”. The professor listed various reasons for why a place could receive “yellow rain”. It may occur because of fine dust particles that had accumulated in the air because of heavy construction work. It could also be due to the pollen grains of a particular plant. This could happen if a particular species of plant runs into thousands of acres. Fungus concentration could also be one of the reasons, he said. Another possibility could be chemical industries. When coal with high sulphur content burns, it emits sulphur dioxide and when this meets the moisture in the air it becomes sulphur trioxide that is converted into sulfuric acid. This is also known as acid rain. This can be confirmed only after lab analysis, he said. “As there is no report from the public about skin burning complaints, I don’t think its acid rain,” he added. Ganesh Puthran, a businessman and social worker, said that around 1 pm on Wednesday, the family of Punadalika Bangera noticed yellow drops on clothes they had put out for drying, as well as on the ground and on leaves. A few other people from the region also reported seeing “yellow rain”, he said. Uday Gaonkar, a science teacher in a government high school in Siddapur, said that while a scientific study is essential, the yellow-coloured drops could be because of some fungus in the air. Kerala too had witnessed yellow rain a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/yellow-rain-reported-in-udupi-experts-yet-to-ascertain-cause/articleshow/87787636.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Level-playing field for local producers of def items soon||Nagpur: A policy to bring a further level-playing field for domestic players against foreign entities dealing in defence items is being worked out, according to Sanjay Jaju, the additional secretary for defence production. This would also deal with aspect of trials needed for clearing an item. Subject to the approval of the cabinet, it is expected to be included in the defence procurement policy. “A decision on this is expected in a short time,” said Jaju who was in here to chair a seminar on MSME’s participation in defence sector. It was organized by Vidarbha Defence Industrial Association (VDIA) and JSR Dynamics. Jaju said it is easier for a foreign vendor to sell a product in India. “For the same item, it is like baptism by fire for an Indian manufacturer. If its a foreign manufacturer, often the basis is that the product is already established in the country. Do we really go and see? If it is an Indian entity, the product is subject to be proven on multiple parameters,” he said. A number of steps have been taken to encourage Indian industries. “Over 200 items have been included in the no-import lists. This includes even artillery guns leaving a big slice for Indian companies,” said Jaju. Jaju stressed on better coordination between the armed forces for churning out a product. “The Army gives a certain requirement and by the time a manufacturer comes up with an item, its often said that it’s not in lines with the specifications. The question is that why wasn’t any corrective action taken during the development process,” he asked. Air Vice Marshall (retd) SB Deo, now running a defence industry after retiring as IAF’s vice-chief, said Nagpur is emerging as an “explosive capital” of the country. Lt General (retd) Vinod Khandare, who recently retired as the military advisor to the National Security Council, also stressed on the need for promoting private industries. Citing an example of one of the actions in which he took part, Khandare said, “Out of 500 M36 grenades lobbed, around 400 did not explode. The army had been using the grenades of World War II make. It will finally be replaced with the latest multimode grenades. The soldiers will be grateful for that.” Nagpur’s Solar Group has got an order to make 10 lakh multimode grenades for the Army.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/level-playing-field-for-local-producers-of-def-items-soon/articleshow/87787734.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Dengue impact continues, but cases reported sporadically||PRAYAGRAJ: As the impact of the dengue outbreak continues, the tally of dengue cases in the district has already crossed the 981-mark. The cases reported this year are 17 times more compared to the previous year when Sangam city had reported only 56 cases. However, officials of the health department claimed that there is currently not a single hotspot in Prayagraj district and sporadic cases being reported are from random locations. About 72% of the total 981 cases have been reported from city locations, health department officials said. Several teams of the health department and municipal corporation have conducted surveys of over 2.75 lakh houses in the city limits to find out the reasons behind spread of the vector borne disease to take corrective measures accordingly. Officials admitted that about 40% of houses with deserted coolers, flower pots and abandoned or unused articles dumped on roofs were found to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes in city areas. Officials said that owners or tenants of houses were least bothered to clean their coolers, flower pots, or even dispose of unused articles kept on the side of the roof of houses for a month. Also, the number of drains and areas witnessing water logging due to various reasons have also turned into areas for mosquito breeding. District Malaria Officer (DMO) AK Singh told TOI on Thursday, “Municipal corporation and health teams conducting door-to-door survey found that larvae were thriving in a number of spots inside residential premises, including abandoned objects kept on rooftops, flower pots, deserted coolers and old tyres. Moreover, open plots in low-lying areas and areas showing water logging have also turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes.” The fact is that there is no area, mohallah or colony left in the city which has not reported dengue cases. “House owners or tenants should regularly clean water sites in their houses. If it is not possible to drain out water, a little kerosene can be poured in it to kill larvae,” the DMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dengue-impact-continues-but-cases-reported-sporadically/articleshow/87788404.cms||---

A division bench of justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare have warned of strict action if the CEO fails to appear in person before the court. Primary teacher Gajanan Uplanchiwar under Zilla Parishad, Chandrapur, had died in 2009. His wife Sangeeta applied for a job on compassionate grounds to her eldest son Aditya immediately. According to the petitioners, Aditya’s name was on the waiting list in 2009, but he was not given a job till 2014. In the meantime, Aditya suffered an ailment leading to failure of both his kidneys in 2013-14. He is taking regular dialysis treatment since then and also had to give up his education. In 2014, Sangeeta prayed that the job be given to her second son Dhruv but he was only 15 then. The petitioners stated the ZP administration assured to recruit him as soon after he turns 18 and his name was registered on the waiting list. Dhruv turned 18 in 2017, but the petitioners stated that despite repeated requests his name was not included in place of Aditya till 2020. Later, his name was removed and his job claim was rejected stating that the regulation in this regard has changed on May 20, 2020, and Aditya’s name cannot be replaced, stated the petitioners. Advocate Arvind Waghmare appearing for the petitioners stated that Dhruva’s application was filed before the change in rule and pointed out that HC had earlier quashed similar proceedings by passing two judgments. Sangeeta and Dhruv filed the petition in March after which, the HC issued a notice in August, but the ZP had already issued an order to appoint Aditya in July. When HC sought an explanation, ZP neither replied nor its advocates appeared before the court. Additional government pleader Shishir Ukey held brief for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/job-on-compassionate-grounds-hc-summons-chanda-zp-ceo/articleshow/87786208.cms||Mazhar Ali

The directive from the mayor came after corporators, cutting across party lines, sought termination of contract with the aforesaid contractor during Wednesday’s general body (GB) meeting. The corporators alleged that the contractor is paying lower salaries to the workers even though the NMC is making full payment as per the Minimum Wages Act. The elected representatives also alleged that the contractor had taken a deposit of Rs 15,000 from every sanitation worker hired by them. An NMC official, during the general body meeting, said there had been complaints against the contractor concerned regarding the same issue. “The contractor concerned has also submitted an affidavit to the civic administration, admitting that he had accepted the deposits but the money was later returned to the workers,” the official said. BJP Corporator Dinkar Patil said if the contractor has accepted that he had taken deposit which is not in the agreement, the NMC administration should terminate the contract. Corporators also alleged that when NMC is making full payment to contractors for the workers as per Minimum Wages Act, the contractor is paying only 50% of the salaries to the workers0 which is injustice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-probe-against-contractor-over-wage-issue/articleshow/87786239.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||BJP localizes state-levelissues ahead of civic polls||Nagpur: Over the last one month, the BJP has been busy taking up state-level issues that have local ramifications as well, thus giving it a leg up in preparations ahead of next year’s civic polls. Right from housing for the poor scheme to Gunthewari rates to Monday’s morcha over ration card holders, the BJP’s strategic localization of state-level issues is helping it target all the three members of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) while connecting with voters in the city. Involving ration card or Ramai Awaas Yojna beneficiaries in their morchas has helped the BJP to reach out to the end beneficiaries. Officially, BJP leaders have denied that any of these steps are connected to the upcoming civic polls but their own workers say that the saffron party has already started running the warm-up lap, way before the race begins. Devendra Fadnavis is meeting booth level workers at their homes, which is a big morale booster for those who have their feet on the ground. Similary, almost all city MLAs and MLCs are seen in press conferences and morchas, thus projecting a ‘united’ front though factionlism is rampant in every party. Congress party member Vivek Nikose said BJP is trying to divert issues. “They have not done anything while in power between 2014-19 and are putting the blame on others. Why did BJP not ensure the housing for poor scheme is implemented properly or that ration card holders do not face logisitical issues. BJP could have solved these problems but kept them pending for reasons best known to them. To counter this, BJP is picking state-level issues and forcibly putting a local spin on them,” said Nikose. BJP’s city president Pravin Datke said if the the main MVA constituents have so many issues then they should hit the streets. “The state machinery belongs to them so what is stopping these leaders from protesting on the streets. If there’s corruption in NMC then ask the police to investigate. All they are doing is indulging in allegations without follow up,” said Datke. He thrashed the notion that his recent political agitations were in anyway connected to the 2022 civic polls. “Now our opponents will say that the BJP worked during the Covid-19 pandemic only to garner votes. We are always working to resolve people’s issues and never with polls in sight. The fact is that none of the three parties have any issues to raise before voters,” said Datke. Prakash Gajbhiye, NCP leader and fromer MLC, said, “There is no dearth of issues with anyone. It’s actually the BJP which is painting an incorrect picture. For five years they were in power in the state. What have they done for people who are below the poverty line.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-localizes-state-levelissues-ahead-of-civic-polls/articleshow/87787746.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The bench had already treated this petition filed by petitioner Mukesh Shahu as a PIL. “Considering the larger interest, we find it appropriate to consider the issues involved in this petition. Amendments to be carried out, as directed by this court on October 26, within a week. If not carried out within a stipulated time, this petition shall stand dismissed without reference to this court,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said, while adjourning the hearing by four weeks. The petitioner challenged commissioner of police’s notification of August 25 on prohibiting prostitution activities within 200 meters of public places in the city’s infamous red-light area. The notification issued under Section 7(1)(b) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, is without jurisdiction, as the power to issue it, notifying prohibited public places vests to the state government, he contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-notices-to-govt-cp-over-pil-on-ganga-jamuna-restrictions/articleshow/87787757.cms||---

The directions came after the court was informed that a police complaint seeking registration of FIR in a property dispute case was made on July 7. The FIR, however, was registered after a lapse of more than two months on September 18. The complainant’s counsel submitted to the court that police had claimed that enquiry was being conducted before registration of the FIR based on certain internal guidelines and office orders. The person against whom the complaint was made had moved the court seeking anticipatory bail on the apprehension of his arrest in the case. Advocate Sanjay Sharma, appearing for the complainant, claimed that despite repeated visits, the SHO concerned failed to initiate registration of the FIR and kept the matter for “enquiry”. It was further alleged that the FIR was registered only after visiting the office of the DCP concerned. “The procedure adopted by police officials concerned is alien to the provisions of CrPC…. Such incidents are coming time and again before this court. This has a direct bearing as the uncertainty created by such practice adopted by the investigating officer are resulting in the filing of bail applications of the present nature,” Additional Sessions Judge Naveen Kumar Kashyap said in an order on November 12.

While partly allowing a writ petition filed by one Km. Anju Singh and another of Hapur district, a division bench comprising Justice Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi directed the police concerned to grant protection to the couple after verifying all documents. The petitioner, Anju Singh and her live-in partner, who filed the petition jointly, submitted before the court that they are major girls and same-sex couple who wanted a live-in relationship. They alleged that they would be harassed and would not be permitted to live in peace by their family members if protection is not granted to them. They also submitted that their parents threatened to kill them if they do not end their relationship and also threatened to falsely implicate them in a criminal case. Against this backdrop, the court while stressing that it is not against live-in relationship, directed the police of the concerned district to grant them protection after verifying all the documents. While passing this directive in its decision on November 2, the court also referred and relied upon Supreme Court’s rulings in the cases of Gian Devi vs. The Superintendent, Nari Niketan, Delhi, and others, Lata Singh vs. State of UP and another and Bhagwan Das V State (NCT of Delhi). The court also referred and relied on the government order (GO) dated August 31, 2019. According to the said GO, police protection will be given to those, who entered into inter-caste or inter-faith marriages. Further, the district magistrate or superintendent of police concerned shall prosecute those persons who tried to create fear in the mind of such couples, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/not-against-live-in-relationship-hc-tells-same-sex-couple-of-hapur/articleshow/87788430.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh, UK to conduct joint study on decarbonising city transport||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration, in association with the British Deputy High Commission, which represent the UK government in Chandigarh, will conduct a study to decarbonise the city’s transport. Various aspects of the study were discussed during a meeting held under the chairmanship of UT adviser Dharam Pal, in the presence of secretary, transport Nitin Yadav and MC commissioner Anandita Mitra. Madhuchhanda Mishra of the British Deputy High Commission apprised UT officials that the project would be funded by the UK government for a duration of 12 months and would tentatively start from January 2022. He said that the project is aimed at providing support to decarbonise the city’s transport and contribute towards efforts to stem climate change. The study will also focus on suggesting alternative eco-friendly transport for the city. The adviser appreciated the British High Commission proposal for the study and accorded its concurrence to initiate the project. UT adviser Dharam Pal said that the UT and UK government would work together on the study. He added that the alternative eco-friendly transport system would also be part of mass rapid transport system (MRTS), on which UT administration is also working. UT adviser Dharam Pal recently sought a report on the new mobility plan. In August, the UT administration decided to go for a fresh mobility plan for mass rapid transport system (MRTS) as officials of Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) had conveyed to the UT administration that the 2009 plan could not be updated with the Centre issuing new guidelines. To solve the city’s urban transport problem, the UT administration had fixed a meeting with RITES officials, in which options of mass rapid transport system (MRTS) like metro, monorail and skybus were discussed. Before moving ahead on this front, the UT adviser had directed UT transport department officials to get the updated RITES 2009 study. The last mobility plan for MRTS was prepared by RITES in 2009. Since then, many things like volume of traffic, entry of vehicles into the city and rush on routes have changed drastically. In 2019, the UT had rejected a detailed study conducted by the French company, Systra for the city’s mobility plan under the Smart City project. Citing wrong methodology for carrying out the study, aimed at suggesting ways to solve traffic congestion and offer possible modes for mass rapid transport system, the administration suggested to close the study. The French agency had suggested three Tricity corridors and a combination of bus rapid transit system (BRTS), light rail transit (LRT), modern tram and monorail as possible modes of transport along these three corridors. The UT administration got the study checked by a team of Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and other experts and found that the methodology and various other figures were not correct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-uk-to-conduct-jt-study-on-decarbonising-city-transport/articleshow/87787747.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Allahabad||HC calls upon Central Govt to implement mandate of Article 44||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the Central government to consider the constitution of a committee/commission for implementing the mandate of Article 44, which says that the “State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”. The court also directed the marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners, without, insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar passed the order while allowing a batch of petitions (17 in number), pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehend threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Standing counsel appearing for the state government submitted that the conversion is for the purpose of marriage, approval of the district magistrate has not been obtained before conversion, and/or, contracting marriage and marriage cannot be registered without the district authority making an enquiry, as to whether the conversion is voluntary and not induced by coercion, allurement and threat. Further, the petitioners were not entitled to any relief from this court, they should approach the competent district authority and obtain approval, in the first instance, with regard to their conversion. The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the citizens have a right to make choice of their partner and faith, the conversion of religion/faith, followed by marriage under the personal law is on free will without coercion, threat or inducement. Interference by the state or by the private respondents (family members) would tantamount to encroaching upon their constitutional right to freedom, choice, life, liberty and to live life on their own terms as man and woman. The prior approval of the district authority followed by registration of marriage is not sine qua non before conversion and marriage. The court observed, “The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code.” “Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-calls-upon-central-govt-to-implement-mandate-of-article-44/articleshow/87788435.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rera To Crack Whip On Norm Violators||New Delhi: Stepping up the ante, Delhi’s real estate tribunal has started a drive to verify which ongoing construction projects in the capital are yet to be registered with it, focusing on areas under DDA’s landpooling policy. To ensure that “gullible buyers are not left to be cheated by unscrupulous people operating in construction business, the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal on Wednesday asked the three municipal corporations, DDA and Delhi Police Commissioner to inform it of such pending projects where mandatory registration as mandated under Rera Act has not been done. “The registry of the tribunal also points out that they had addressed a couple of communications to the commissioner of police seeking details of the FIRs registered in respect of societies/individuals offering membership of housing projects and fraudulently collecting huge amounts of money from gullible buyers within the jurisdiction of Delhi and especially in areas falling under the landpooling policy of DDA. Details are stated to have not been received till date despite lapse of considerable time and also a reminder,” observed the bench chaired by justice Chander Shekhar. The tribunal cited Section 2 of the Act to reiterate that no promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite people to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera). It further pointed out that registration under Rera is critical for projects where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square metres or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed eight inclusive of all phases. “Despite the clarity of the provisions of the Act regarding their applicability, there is a rampant non-compliance of these provisions within the city,” the bench noted, explaining its decision to initiate a suo motu case in regard to unregistered projects in the capital. The major objective of Rera is to regulate and promote the real estate sector, but ensure transparency in the real estate business by insisting mandatory disclosure of project details to the property buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rera-to-crack-whip-on-norm-violators/articleshow/87787765.cms||Abhinav Garg

The workers continued to protest at the MSRTC bus stand for their demand of the transport utility’s merger with the state government. No buses have been plying from any of the 12 depots in Kolhapur. Uttam Patil, the head of MSRTC workers’ association, said, “Even after 11 days of the strike, no positive sign can be seen from the state government. No member of the MVA government has come here to support us or even listen to us. More than 40 employees in the state have lost their lives during the pandemic. To awaken the state government, five of our suspended members from the Kolhapur department will take jal samadhi in the Panchaganga river. This is final ultimatum from us and the government should not test our limits.” Meanwhile, passengers continue to suffer and hope that the strike is called off soon. Sachin Vankudre, a commuter, said, “The state government and the MSRTC employees are both firm on their stands and the normal public is facing the heat.

---||Allahabad||Mull forming a panel to bring in Uniform Civil Code: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Dealing with a batch of 17 petitions pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners and seeking protection from the court, the Allahabad high court on Thursday called upon the Central government to consider setting up a panel for implementing the mandate of Article 44, which says that the “State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India”. The court also directed marriage registrar/officer of petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners without insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith. Justice Suneet Kumar, who passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by one Mayra alias Vaishnavi and 16 others pertaining to interfaith marriage contracted by the petitioners, further called upon the Union government to initiate the process as the stage has been reached. “The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made purely voluntary as was observed by Dr BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community. The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code,” the court observed. “Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law,” the court further added. The court, in an attempt to envisage the possible effect of Uniform Civil Court (UCC) on the Indian population if implemented, referred to the Hindu Family Code (HFC), which in the court’s opinion, acted as uniform civil code and integrated the citizens into an integrated and united Indian citizenry, on terms that is equal and uniform, insofar as the law regulating family law is concerned. Stressing that the impact of HFC on Hindu society has been phenomenal, the court opined that HFC has not encroached upon the religious custom, culture, practice, and propagation of the minuscule minority, i.e., Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, included within the definition of Hindus. The HFC can be said to be the UCC governing the Hindus and the communities, falling within the ambit and definition of Hindu and that it covers and has sway over 80% of the population. Significantly, the court noted that the HFC laid the foundation of transforming the traditional Hindu society, and the legislations lifted and transported the Hindu personal law from the shastra/religion and placed it within the domain of Parliament. “Parliament through HFC in a single stroke provided the legal platform where Hindu citizens could interact with each other on equal terms irrespective of rigid caste, jati, creed, gotra and the concept of purity, pollution in marriage and dining. The HFC has been largely instrumental, (apart from other factors viz education, mobility, health services), in facilitating and creating what the sociologist refer to as a Hindu social class and or a Hindu citizenry,” noted the court. The petitioners were major and one of the parties to the marriage had converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners had apprehended threats to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence, they had filed writ petitions seeking protection and registration of their marriages. Box: Key Observations | The issue of UCC, though constitutional, rakes political overtures whenever raised or debated in the public domain and calls for its implementation in the wake of a multiplicity of marriage and family laws in place. | A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the minority community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. That has been the consistent official stand of the government within the country and in international forums. A Common Civil Code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws that have conflicting ideologies. | No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the state which is charged with the duty of securing Uniform Civil Code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uniform-civil-code-a-necessitycannot-be-made-voluntary-hc/articleshow/87788442.cms||---

Rawal was in a relationship with Kalidas’s daughter Aarti. Kalidas had warned Rawal around two months ago of dire consequences if he continued meeting his daughter or even tried to speak to her. However, the girl’s mother spotted the lovebirds talking near Kalidas’s farm on Wednesday afternoon. Though Rawal ran back to his home, his fears of being attacked turned horrifyingly true soon after. The four accused dragged the youth near their house and flogged him mercilessly with sticks before making him wear a saree and tying him to a tree. All four accused took turns to beat Rawal and even kicked him on his private parts, despite the youth’s constant pleading to let him free. The violence continued due to which the youth soon lost consciousness. Sometime later, when Rawal’s cousin got to know about the incident they rushed to his help, seeing which the four accused fled the spot. Rawal was untied and an ambulance was called, while his cousin kept splashing water on his face. However, Rawal failed to respond and doctors at the government hospital in Vadu declared him dead on arrival. Later that same night, mother of the deceased youth, Ramila, lodged a complaint of murder, abduction, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy against four accused at Vadu police station. On Thursday, the four accused were detained and kept in quarantine. Police said that they will be taken for Covid-19 test on Friday following which they will be formally arrested. An unidentified person recorded the whole flogging incident on a mobile phone and circulated the video, which went viral on Thursday. Police said that besides working as a casual labourer, Rawal also used to play ‘dhol’ during weddings in the village, while his father is a castor oil trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/youth-tied-to-tree-beaten-to-death-over-love-affair/articleshow/87787209.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lawyer held in Malad after drug bust at his farmhouse||MUMBAI: A day after a narcotic drug-making unit was busted at a city lawyer’s farmhouse in Kolhapur, lawyer Rajkumar Rajhuns (39) was arrested from Malad on Thursday. In a raid at the farmhouse, the police had seized 38.7kg of raw material used to make mephedrone, and manufacturing machines of a total value of Rs 2.35 crore. Two of his aides had been arrested. The first arrest was of Maglin — alias Christina alias Ayesha — who was held with 50gm of the drug in Andheri recently, the caretaker of the farmhouse, Nikhil Lohar, was nabbed from the farmhouse. The police said that Rajhuns made a profit of at least Rs 12 lakh by selling a kilo of the drug. “It cost him Rs 2 lakh for a kilo, but he sold it for anywhere between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh,” said an officer. The police have got a list of at least 10 of his clients from Mumbai, Thane and Pune. While a car belonging to the lawyer has been confiscated, two others — one of them a BMW 5 — have been identified as his possessions, said officials of the Anti-Narcotics Cell. “Rajhuns procured ingredients to manufacture the drug while his caretaker helped in its manufacture,” said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade. A police team on Thursday searched his Kolhapur farmhouse and his Andheri office. A probe is on to check if his law degree is genuine. Rajhuns has claimed he had, during his legal practice, come across a few criminals who taught him how to make the drug. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-held-in-malad-after-drug-bust-at-his-farmhouse/articleshow/87789018.cms||S Ahmed Ali

Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications, said the 28-minute film dealt with various construction-related challenges faced by DMRC during its third phase of expansion. “In Phase III, DMRC constructed about 190km new lines and had to encounter innumerable challenges such as construction in the congested Old Delhi, passing through an extremely busy road intersection at Ashram and constructing its deepest station at Hauz Khas,” he said. With the help of graphics and interviews of the engineers who executed the project, the film brings to light the efforts put in by DMRC to expand the Metro footprint in National Capital Region. Dayal said extensive shooting of various locations, along with retrieval of archival footage, was undertaken. “Anticipating the film, the entire construction process was documented in the form of videos and photographs for about five-six years across all under-construction corridors,” he said, adding that the film took over a year’s time. “It is also an important document for transit rail engineers and researchers as it sheds light on a variety of issues that construction of such a mammoth infrastructure encounter. The film is available on DMRC’s official YouTube channel,” he said. A film on the challenges faced during Phase II had won the National Award in the Best Promotional Film Non-Feature films category in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-docu-to-be-screened-at-film-fest/articleshow/87788453.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is also the first in the state over the past four months. The last reported death in the city was on July 31 and last death in the state had happened on June 30. “The child was brought to our hospital in a serious condition, we shifted the baby to RUHS hospital,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. The baby had difficulty in breathing along with other complications. He was on ventilator at JK Lon Hospital. His condition continued to deteriorate and succumbed to the virus. “He had fever, altered sensorium and difficulty in breathing. We straight away put him on a ventilator. His Covid report on Wednesday showed that he was positive. So, we transferred him to RUHS hospital on the same day,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, head of the pediatric medicine department, JK Lon Hospital.

The baby died in RUHS hospital,” said Dr Narottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur I.

---||Jaipur||Another Jaipur private school student tests positive for Covid-19||JAIPUR: Another student from a private school in the city tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. With this, four children from three private schools have contacted the virus in three days. Chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Jaipur II, Hansraj Bhadaliya, said, "The 12-year-old student of Neerja Modi School, who tested positive for the virus, had not been attending school since November 8." "Her mother had tested positive earlier and now she got infected. We are tracing her contacts," he said. However, Neerja Modi School principal Indu Dubey said, "The girl had attended school till November 15 as per the attendance register." "After receiving information regarding this, we have decided to discontinue offline classes for three days for her class. On Saturday, our teachers will teach that class virtually. We have advised parents not to send their children if they show any Covid-related symptom," said Dubey. This incident has increased fear among parents and they have demanded provisions for online classes instead of compulsory offline ones. Earlier this week, two students from Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya and one from Jayshree Periwal International School were found to be Covid positive. The schools’ authorities have suspended offline classes, but parents from all schools in the city have started vouching for offline classes. Director of Secondary Education, Bikaner, Kana Ram, said, "The standard operating procedure (SOP) does not mention that the schools cannot provide online classes. It is up to the schools and parents to keep that option open. If parents are not comfortable with offline classes, they must approach the school authorities." According to Manish Vijayvargiya, convenor of Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh Rajasthan, the SOP had kept an option open for the private school not to provide online classes and most of the schools were adhering to that. "We need a firm order from the government to make it compulsory for every school to provide online classes and let the parents decide. Else, the government is unnecessarily risking the lives of the students." According to the guidelines issued by the state government, if a student is found positive, the classroom has to remain shut for 10 days. However, schools are keeping the rooms shut just for a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/another-city-pvt-school-student-tests-ve-for-covid/articleshow/87788449.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: ‘No intention to kill or injure the cop at gunpoint’||NEW DELHI: Shahrukh Pathan, arrested for allegedly pointing a gun at a Delhi police constable during the northeast Delhi riots, claimed before a city court on Thursday that he had no intention to cause injury or to kill and had merely wanted to scare him. Pathan’s counsel claimed that police had not brought any witness who speaks of the offence of attempt to murder, under which he has been booked in the case and no potential victim has been presented by them, except police officer Deepak Dahiya, at whom the gun was allegedly pointed. “It is through him (Pathan) the state consistently improves on the case that they don’t have,” the counsel told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat and sought his discharge in the case. Senior Advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for Pathan, played video footage and said that even though he had fired a shot, it was not intended to injure or kill the policeman seen in the video. She submitted that Pathan and Dahiya had a heated conversation and then they retreated. Guruswamy also questioned the introduction of a witness at a later stage of investigation without any test identification parade. She further claimed that Pathan had ample opportunities to fire at the policeman but instead, he asked Dahiya to stand back and fired in the air and towards his right. “We have seen from the two videos that simply shooting is not indicative of murder,” submitted Guruswamy. Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa opposed Guruswamy’s arguments, saying Pathan had clearly pointed the gun at Dahiya. “Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?” Handa argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-intention-to-kill-or-injure-the-cop-at-gunpoint/articleshow/87787773.cms||Usha Das
---||Kolkata||A day after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s rebuke, 32 cops control traffic at Chingrighata crossing||KOLKATA: As many as 32 police personnel—those from the Kolkata Police, Bidhannagar Commissionerate and civic volunteers—have been deployed to man vehicular traffic as well as pedestrians’ movement at the Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass-—stretching 850m on one side from Captain Bhery to Beliaghata Building More and 900m on the other, from the Beliaghata auto stand on Canal Side Road to the Sukanta Nagar intersection. A day after senior police officers, led by acting DGP Manoj Malviya, reviewed the traffic arrangement at the Chingrighata crossing following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s stern instructions that deaths at this important stretch of EM Bypass would no longer be tolerated, the presence of police personnel were increased. Besides, both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police have lined up a series of plans to discipline motorists as well as pedestrians at the spot. Back-to-back accidents at the Chingrighata intersection on EM Bypass, some of them fatal, led to the review of the traffic plan there and the CM’s directive to streamline the vehicular flow. As an immediate step, Kolkata Traffic Police has doubled the manpower on the spot, increasing the number of personnel from 12 to 24. “We used to keep six civic volunteers only to tackle pedestrians. Two sergeants were in charge of vehicular flow. In addition, we kept cops at the Bidhannagar cut and Chawlpatty cut. Now, we will deploy personnel at all the seven big and small cuts in and around Chingrighata. We have introduced police beats at Jalvayu Vihar and Captain Bhery,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Cops have also decided to shut the slip road near the Metropolitan crossing on the south-bound flank of Bypass from 9.30pm, instead of the current 10pm, till the end of winter. “We are increasing the number of retro reflective signs that are visible through fog. We are are installing LED blinkers on the road between the Metropolitan and Chingrighata crossings,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Some long-term changes have also been proposed. “A proposal, dating back to the times of former commissioner Rajeev Kumar, has been revived. Under it, Kolkata Police will be asked to take over 550m, from before the Chingrighata bridge on Bypass to the crossing from Bidhannagar Police in order to allow seamless monitoring of traffic. Since this will need the legislative nod, this is being discussed at the highest level,” said a Lalbazar officer. Separate channels for cycles and other slow moving vehicles have also been proposed from the Beliaghata Canal Road towards Nicco Park. Cops say once work on the subway begins, as proposed by experts from IIT-Kharagpur, they will use the FOB as a pedestrian crossover. “Once KMDA completes installing the escalators on the upcoming FOB and it is ready for use, no person will be allowed to use the road to cross and jaywalkers will be heavily fined,” said a police officer. Earlier, to stop accidents on the north-bound flank of Bypass, traffic police had introduced two signals, at Maa flyover and Avani cut, out close to Metropolitan. Cops now look to fix the signal cycles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-cms-rebuke-32-cops-control-traffic-at-chingrighata/articleshow/87787975.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court order on Sameer Wankhede’s father's plea against Nawab Malik on Monday||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday took on record two sets of documents, submitted by minister Nawab Malik and Dnyandeo Wankhede, father of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and posted for order on Monday Wankhede senior’s petition to restrain the NCP leader from posting defamatory content against his family. Justice Madhav Jamdar, expected to pass an order at 5.30pm on November 22, said “parties are requested not to produce anything till Monday”. Countering Malik’s public claim that his name was Dawood and his son is Muslim, Wankhede submitted Sameer’s birth certificate issued by the BMC. It shows Sameer’s date of birth as December 14, 1979, and his father’s name as Dnyandeo Kachruji Wankhede. Through his lawyers Arshad Shaikh and Diwakar Rai, he also submitted a caste certificate of July 1974, saying he belongs to a ‘scheduled caste community’, and a 1995 tenth standard school leaving certificate, where ‘Wankhede Sameer Dnyandev’s’ caste is ‘scheduled caste’, and his ‘progress in studies’ and ‘conduct in school’, both ‘good’. Malik, through senior counsel Atul Damle and Jay & Co Advocates, submitted an E ward health officer’s letter on November 15 saying that in 1979, the father’s name was registered in birth registration records as ‘Dawood K Wankhede’ and “corrected’’ to ‘Dnyandeo Kachruji Wankhede’ in May 1993 by a sub-registrar after a ‘declaration dated April 26, 1993’. In an additional affidavit submitted on Thursday, Malik said the birth certificate details show the religion of the newborn, Sameer, as ‘Muslim’. Malik also submitted a set of ‘certified copies of documents’ from the NCB officer’s schools. These documents include two primary school (standards I-IV) leaving certificates of 1986 and 1989, which say ‘Muslim’ in the religion column and his father’s name as ‘Dawood’.  The 1986 certificate says Sameer Wankhede’s conduct was ‘good’ and progress ‘satisfactory’. A third school document was an ‘admission form’ of a school in Wadala dated June 1986 where his religion is mentioned as ‘Muslim’. Relying on these documents, Malik sought dismissal of Wankhede’s plea. He went by a November 10 order, saying he can produce additional information. But Wankhede’s advocate Shaikh questioned the relevance of Malik’s documents, saying the father’s name was corrected in 1993 in the BMC records and the final tenth standard school leaving certificate bears all the correct details. Pointing out that Malik sought documents from BMC on November 13, he cited a Delhi HC ruling that said “before posting tweets… it was incumbent on the defendant to carry out preliminary due diligence’’. He argued that when posting the alleged defamatory content, Malik had no verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-order-on-wankhede-srs-plea-against-malik-on-mon/articleshow/87789038.cms||---

Since the Railways is now replacing all such shuttles with the Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains, it has an advantage of faster pickup and braking system thus cutting travel duration between the point of origin and destination. “The shuttle service between Bhusawal and Badnera and Bhusawal and Itarsi have been restored and replaced by the MEMU trains. On the same lines, we expect the permission of operating the train on Devlali – Bhusawal route,” senior officials from the divisional railway manager’s office said. This train had stopped plying in March last year following the Covid pandemic. “Nashik has a large number of people from Jalgaon district working in the industrial areas and even staying here. We are the biggest beneficiary of the shuttle and re-starting it will bring an easy and safe travel alternative,” Sanjay Barhate, a city businessman, said. Sangeeta Bhangale, another resident of Nashik city, said that road travel proves costlier. “Only special trains are running. The alternative is to take road transport, which is very costly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/re-start-shuttle-train-serviceto-bhusawal-demand-citizens/articleshow/87786306.cms||Abhilash Botekar

However, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in EDMC, Manoj Tyagi, informed that he has information about the suspension of only 15 of his party councillors. “AAP has repeatedly exposed the true face of BJP in front of the people of Delhi, only for it to ignore and continue indulging in blatant corruption and misgovernance,” said Atishi. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, however, said that the action was taken after prior warning for at least two times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/atishi-councillors-suspended-for-highlighting-corruption/articleshow/87787803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Buried labourer rescued after eight hours in Jaipur cave-in||JAIPUR: A labourer, who was buried after sand caved in on him at the under-construction building near the Brahmpuri Khurra area under Nahargarh police station Thursday evening was rescued late night. His condition is said to be serious. SHO Devendra Kumar said that the labourer, Hanuman Sharma, was buried under sand while digging for the construction of pillars for a house. The rescue operation was halted late at night after there was apprehension that it may cause structural damage to nearby buildings. A civil defence team was dispatched to the scene immediately after the Nahargarh police received the first report of the tragedy around 4pm. “The incident took place at Fakiro ki Dhani area where construction work was underway when the mishap took place. Labourers were digging when the sand suddenly crashed on them,” said a witness. Mahendra Sevda of the civil defence team told TOI that the labourer must be buried at least under 15 feet deep. Rescuers said that there were several multistoried buildings adjacent to it which impeded their operation. “We had begun digging up the basement in search of Sharma when some debris fell from nearby houses. It posed an immediate danger to the structure of other houses due to which the rescue operation had to come to a halt,” said an official who is part of the rescue effort. Locals told officials that at least two other labourers were present near the site moments before the incident, but managed to escape unscathed. Several JCB machines and other equipment were moved to the site. Till late night, rescuers were struggling to resume operations to rescue the worker. An official informed TOI that they had sought technical advice from disaster relief experts. “Residents from nearby buildings may have to be evacuated to ensure that there is no untoward situation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/buried-labourer-rescued-after-8-hrs-in-city-cave-in/articleshow/87788485.cms||---
---||Delhi||56-year-old’s case shows how some can benefit from partial knee replacement||NEW DELHI: A 56-year-old woman recently underwent a partial knee replacement surgery at a private hospital. Unlike the conventional procedure where surgeons use a fixed bearing joint, the artificial joint used in this case was mobile, giving the patient better mobility, claimed Dr Yash Gulati, chief orthopaedic surgeon of Apollo hospital who conducted the procedure. Instances of osteoarthritis are going up in India and, therefore, the need for knee replacement, Dr Gulati said. However, he clarified, all such patients do not require a total knee replacement; a partial knee replacement using innovative techniques is gaining acceptance. “Our knee joint is made up of three compartments: one inner, one outer and one with the kneecap. Quite often, especially in the Indian population, it is only the inner compartment that gets affected. Such patients can benefit from a partial knee replacement. However, due to the lack of awareness, many people continue to get total knee replacement done,” the doctor said. In the current case, he added, the woman had extreme arthritis of one compartment (medial arthritis) and she had been offered total knee replacement by some hospitals. “We found it fit for a partial replacement. It was done using a small incision and required the least bone damage as compared to total knee replacement,” Dr Gulati explained. Partial knee replacement is offered at many other hospitals, too, such as AIIMS. In the UK, doctors say, about 25% of all knee replacement cases are the ones in which only one compartment is changed. “In our country, orthopaedic surgeons have started to recognise this, but a lot of awareness is still required,” said a senior doctor. “Once it is established that only one compartment is involved, it is logical to change only that part,” another doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/56-year-olds-case-shows-how-some-can-benefit-from-partial-knee-replacement/articleshow/87788495.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

A few days ago, the University Grants Commission had taken cognizance of the complaint made by syndicate member Ram Lakhan Meena of not following norms in giving promotions to faculty members. As per the complaint, the university has given promotions to retired faculty members or on the payroll of the varsity between 2012-20.

The building is almost ready. The remaining construction work and parking can continue simultaneously. The authorities should take permission from the authorities concerned, including the Pune Municipal Corporation, and start the facility so that parking issues could be looked into immediately,” said Bapat, who is also the Pune MP. Earlier, Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke had said opening the facility amid the construction work was not on the cards, as it could lead to accidents.

The unseasonal showers are likely to affect the fruit orchards. Rohan Salvi, a farmer from Pandharpur, said, “Due to these unseasonal showers production of fruits like pomegranate and guava will be affected. These fruits develop black spots and many times attract caterpillars. If it rains further, then grape production will also get affected.” The low pressure area and associated cyclonic circulation over the Arabian sea has been the reason behind the unseasonal showers in the region. Meanwhile, weather in Kolhapur remained humid owing to the cloud cover and few spells of rain in parts of the district. As per IMD, Kolhapur district received 4.3mm rainfall between Wednesday and Thursday morning. Ajara region received the highest rainfall of 11.1mm, while Gaganbawda region received the least 1.1mm rainfall on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/more-rain-likely-in-kolhapur-till-sunday/articleshow/87786330.cms||---

---||Business||Skoda returns to premium sedan space with Slavia||Pune: Automaker Skoda India unveiled its new mid-size premium sedan Slavia on Thursday, marking the firm’s return to the segment, following the roll out of the four-seater SUV Kushaq earlier in the year. Skoda opened bookings for the model, manufactured at its Chakan facility near Pune, on Thursday, and said the price would be released in the first quarter of 2022. Slavia becomes the third newly-launched vehicle in India as a part of Skoda-Volkswagen’s India 2.0 market revitalisation strategy, which aimed at taking up to 5% of the Indian auto market share. The model will be available in two engine variants, as well as automatic and manual transmission editions. Skoda said while Slavia was primarily aimed at the Indian market, the company might consider the export market in certain jurisdictions, but as knocked-down cars. “In our India 2.0 strategy, we also focus on a high degree of localization of inputs of up to 95%. But we have also been dealing with the semiconductor chip shortage issue, like everyone else in the auto industry. No one makes chips in India, and thus the entire supply must be imported, and it is an industry requiring high investments. We hope that the situation resolves somewhat in the middle of 2022, and completely by the end of next year,” said Gurpratap Boparai, managing director of Skoda India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/skoda-returns-to-premium-sedan-space-with-slavia/articleshow/87787830.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

During lockdown in 2020-21 and 2021-22, schools remained closed for a long time. The government had been saying it would verify whether schools had conducted online classes. But verification of online teaching and textbook distribution is a time consuming process that would be done on a random basis by the administrative department in private schools. The order said for verification, the process of formation, training and verification teams at the district level is likely to take some time. In such a case, there will be a delay to make payments. Therefore, for 2020-21 session, the finance department had sent a proposal to pay 25 per cent of the amount for online teaching conducted under RTE to the institution as an advance. This advance amount will be adjusted against the last payable amount and in case the advance amount exceeds the last payable amount, this excess amount will be adjusted against the amount payable in the next financial year, said the government order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-releases-25-fees-under-rte/articleshow/87788505.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Upgrade of cameras at Chandigarh railway stations delayed||CHANDIGARH: With the dissolution of the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) by the ministry of railways, the upgrade of the electronic eye surveillance cover at Chandigarh railway station has been further delayed. The delay came after the ministry announced to hand over the railway station development work to Ambala division, and the Chandigarh railway station is yet to be formally handed over to it, said Ambala divisional manager Gurinder Mohan Singh. The dissolution of the IRSDC was announced in October this year. Special purpose vehicle of IRSDC was constituted in 2012, after which the corporation took over city railway station in 2019, but since then no work was done. Now everything will be redesigned and re-planned once Ambala division takes over. Singh said, “After it is officially handed over, we will chalk out new plans to construct Chandigarh as a world-class railway station.” As part of an amenities overhaul, the Chandigarh railway station was to get new CCTV cameras and emergency talk-back systems. Currently, 35 CCTV cameras are installed at the station, but their recordings and resolution are of poor quality. These will be replaced with high-resolution IP cameras, which don’t require a recording device. Singh had earlier said that they plan to have a system of 80-100 cameras to cover the premises. Along with beautification, the Rs 136-crore makeover project aimed at bringing an “air concourse”, on the lines of airport terminals, at all six platforms, and subways to segregate passenger flow. While this was earlier set to be finished by December 2021, now the work is to start afresh. IRSDC was also to manage passenger amenities and other infrastructures, like better platforms, waiting rooms, washrooms, eating and food stalls, drinking water facilities, keeping coaches clean, and adequate parking facilities with latest technologies. In the second stage, the construction part of the station was to be taken up in which state-of-the-art lounges, restaurants, serais and buildings were to be constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/upgrade-of-cameras-at-railway-station-delayed/articleshow/87787832.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

This monument symbolises the government’s stand of giving a befitting reply to anyone who threatens our sovereignty and integrity,” said Singh. The Rezang La memorial commemorates the unparalleled valour displayed by a company of 13 Kumaon led by Major Shaitan Singh — who was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra — against the numerically-superior Chinese Army at an altitude of over 16,500-feet on the Kailash Ranges during the 1962 war. “The historic battle of Rezang La is difficult to imagine even today. Major Shaitan Singh and his fellow soldiers fought till ‘last bullet and last breath’ and wrote a new chapter of bravery and sacrifice,” said the defence minister. “I am saluting the 114 Indian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in the 1962 war after reaching Rezang La,” added Singh, who also met Brig R V Jatar (retd) who was part of the battle of Rezang La as a captain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soldiers-ready-to-protect-every-inch-says-rajnath-singh/articleshow/87789913.cms||---

He said they threatened to press murder charges against him if he failed to pay up. A video of him levelling the allegations is doing the rounds on social media. The man, identified as Shekhar released three selfie videos demanding a “fair investigation” into the murder case. He alleged that two police personnel demanded Rs 10 lakh from him and another person involved in the incident. In his one 3-minute video, Shekhar said, “Two cops are threatening to make me the prime accused in Rinku’s murder case when I denied giving them Rs 10 lakh. Both the cops are not calling me but are sending some private person to my home and demanding Rs 10 lakh saying I own a good house and can pay. I told them I did not have money and asked them to probe the matter fairly but to no avail.” He said in the video that all he did was to call the murder victim and two to three others after he came to know that a fight was likely between them. “My concern was to stop the fight, but accusing me of murder and harassing my family for not giving Rs 10 lakh is going to ruin my life”, he said. In the video, Shekhar sought the intervention of police commissioner Saurabh Singh, DCP Mohit Handa and home minister Anil Vij. He requested them to order a fair investigation and give him stern punishment if he was found guilty. Police personnel were unavailable for comment. Early on September 27, around 10 to 12 persons attacked the victim, Rinku with swords, slashing his face and head at Majri Chowk. Rinku died while two of his friends took shelter at Kharak Mangoli and called the cops. A case was registered under section 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment for murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees or more) of the IPC at Sector 7 police station.

---||Delhi||E-charging stations set up at eight sites||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has finally set up e-charging stations for two-wheelers at eight sites after obtaining permission from the public works department (PWD), said an official. The sites are South Extension I & II, Bhikaji Cama Place, Sant Nagar and Lajpat Nagar 2. However, only one station at South Extension I has been made operational, while work for laying electricity cable is pending at other places due to the construction ban. “We will complete the work as soon as the ban is lifted and made them operational. People can charge their vehicles and pay bill online. Most of the stations will have facility to operate with the help of solar energy,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner of SDMC’s remunerative and project cell. To motivate people to use e-vehicles, the corporation decided to set up charging stations at 109 locations on main roads. The installation work for two-wheeler stations was to be carried out at 35 locations by Telecommunications Consultants India Limited. “But now the number of locations will be reduced to 30 as a consensus on the rest could not be reached with PWD. There is apprehension that the stations may hinder widening of roads in future,” said the SDMC official. While the work for two-wheeler stations started in October, the project was put on hold for some time. “We wrote to PWD that maintain the roads and issues were sorted out,” said the official. A PWD official also confirmed that the permission had been granted for these sites. While SDMC has already set up e-charging stations for four-wheelers, it is stressing on two-wheeler stations as they occupy less space. Electric two-wheelers are also economical and travel 80-100km after one full charge. “The two-wheelers contribute to two-third of the vehicular pollution in cities. Our stations are on Ring Road or Outer Ring Road to encourage their use for last-mile connectivity,” said Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-charging-stations-set-up-at-eight-sites/articleshow/87788521.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Supreme Court pulls up Gujarat government over payment of Covid ex gratia||AHMEDABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday pulled up the Gujarat government for making the disbursement process of Covid-19 death compensation cumbersome and for trying to “overreach” its directions by issuing a notification for Covid death compensation. The court termed the state’s notification “just contrary” to the “clear” directions issued to pay Rs 50,000 ex gratia compensation in Covid death. The SC insisted that it has issued clear directives that compensation amount should be paid on production of RT-PCR certificate and the death certificate showing that the death has occurred within 30 days. There is no further requirement at all, the SC reiterated. The bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice B V Nagarathna ordered the state government to simplify its procedure for disbursal of compensation among the Covid-affected families. The judges have sought response from the state authorities by November 22 on issuing a notification which is not in accordance with the SC directions and “to take remedial steps and come out with a clear and simplified formula/notification so that the amount of compensation as ordered by this court is paid to the victim at the earliest and without any further harassment”. The SC made it clear that the state government must issue new notification in accordance with its directions issued on October 4, and said, “Any deviation shall be viewed very seriously.” It insisted, “Even the procedure for compensation should be simplified and the form should be very simple and should not be clumsy.” The court was upset with the state government forming a scrutiny committee for issuing death certificates, which has made the affected families run from pillar to post. The apex court felt that the Gujarat government tried to overreach its directions. A practising advocate from Ahmedabad, Amit Panchal, raised objection to October 29 notification pointing out that the state has formed a Covid-19 Death Ascertaining Committee, which is contrary to the SC’s directions. The applicant has sought contempt of court proceedings against the health and family welfare department officials for issuing such a notification, “which is wilful disobedience of the directions of the court”. The SC perused the notification and said that it felt that it is just contrary to court directions. “It appears that an attempt has been made to overreach the directions issued by this court,” it noted. The judges further said that the state government was not required to constitute the scrutiny committee for the purpose of awarding compensation. The SC direction was for constitution of a Grievance Redressal Committee in case compensation is not paid and family members are aggrieved about death certificates. The court had not ordered the formation of a scrutiny committee for the purpose of issuing death certificates for getting compensation. The court said, “Our direction was very clear that the amount of compensation to be paid on production of the RT-PCR certificate and the death certificate showing that the death has occurred within 30 days. There was no further requirement at all.” It further said that death within 30 days of Covid-19 positive report entitled family members to compensation without any further conditions. “No further condition and/or requirement is provided. Still, such a notification has been issued without application of mind which can be said to be over-reaching the directions issued by this Court,” the court order reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-trying-to-make-process-cumbersome/articleshow/87787845.cms||---

---||Kolkata||As footfall rises, missing trolleys, unclean toilets back to haunt Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: From missing trolleys to unclean washrooms and faulty charging points to overcrowding on transit buses — old problems are back at Kolkata airport as it is pacing towards the pre-pandemic level footfall, clocking 50,000-plus passengers on an average over the last few days. Since the withdrawal of capacity restrictions on domestic flights last month, airlines in Kolkata increased their flights to full capacity, leading to a surge in footfall from the start of this month. Airport officials said that by next month it will have 60,000-plus domestic passengers daily, just like the pre-pandemic times. TimesViewFlyers coming back but Covid protocols still being there together make for a sure-shot recipe for disruption. The airport here has been spared the type of chaos that Mumbai experienced during the Diwali festive season. But the airport management and airlines must try to anticipate the problems and take preemptive measures.Issues related to “missing trolleys” top the complaint chart. This had bothered the Kolkata airport authorities earlier till it plugged the gap with an addition of 5,500 trolleys three years ago. While some of the trolleys conked off during the period, the drop in number of passengers due to Covid ensured there were enough trolleys to fill the demand. But with the footfall rising, passengers have started ruing about missing trolleys again. “Most pathetic experience in Kolkata airport. No trolley available, a drunkard was selling trolleys. No airline assistance was around to help and unreasonable charges for luggage, no support at queue,” read a tweet by Swagoto Chaudhuri on November 15. Another twitter user, Sanjay Gupta, was upset about another issue — unclean washrooms. “Request, the people in charge of maintaining washrooms in Kolkata airport to keep it clean. It’s the worst maintained airport in the country. Where does the user development fee, that we pay, goes to. Can the Kolkata airport authority reply?” Gupta had tweeted last week. Passengers have also highlighted faulty charging points at the airport. Among other issues that have returned to haunt the passengers are illegal parking of VIP and other vehicles belonging to cops and other dignitaries that clutter the area in front of the arrival section of the terminal and overcrowding of passengers in transit buses that take passengers from the terminal to the aircraft. On November 11, Harsh Nawal had posted a video of a crowded transit bus on Twitter tagging one of the airlines. Airport director C Pattabhi said he would take action to address the issues. “We have enough trolleys. But, I feel that at times trolleys are not returned to the bay on time, inconveniencing the passengers. We have also deployed extra men to ensure washrooms remain clean but there are occasions when some users soil the washroom,” said Pattabhi. About faulty charging points, Pattabhi said he has asked his personnel to look into it. “Overcrowding on transit buses is a real problem. I have asked the airlines to address this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-footfall-rises-missing-trolleys-unclean-toilets-back-to-haunt-airport/articleshow/87787858.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Work starts to construct tank to increase water File storage capacity||CHANDIGARH: The work has started to construct a new tank of 2-million-gallon water storage capacity at Sector 39 water works. It is the only new tank coming up at the water works under the project to increase water storage capacity from half-day to one-day supply. Besides, work is also going on to increase the capacity of the existing eight water storage tanks. “The new tank project aims at storing more water. Senior MC engineering officers are monitoring the work, which is being carried out as per specified designs and drawings,” sources said. As the water storage capacity has to be increased from the existing 48 MGD to 92 MGD a day, all the tanks will be reconstructed so that they can store almost double water. “Of the existing eight water tanks, capacity of one (number 8) has been enhanced and of two (number 6 and 7) will be increased in some days,” said an official. All the tanks are not being reconstructed simultaneously. “Since water is stored in the tanks, work can’t be started in all together. It will be done one by one,” the official added. The project will be completed in two years after which the city will have one-day water supply storage capacity. The supply comes from Bhakra Canal. The estimated cost of the project was Rs 37.37 crore. But as the successful bid was around 6.50% less, it was allotted for Rs 34.94 crore. The Chandigarh administration has already given the fund-starved MC around Rs 26 crore for the project. The rest of the amount will be paid by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) and has been approved by its board of directors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/work-starts-to-construct-tank-to-increase-citys-water-storage-capacity/articleshow/87787846.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||Dhapa plant boost to solve Kasba-Patuli water woes||Kolkata: To ward off water crisis in large areas off EM Bypass, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to augment the capacity of Jai Hind water treatment plant at Dhapa. The KMC water supply department needs to spend around Rs 126 crore for the augmentation of the treatment plant in next two years, said a KMC water supply department senior official. The KMC water supply department has also planned the construction of a water treatment plant in Garia-Patuli belt to improve the supply of potable water for the residents of large areas of Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt. Speaking at length on the civic body’s water augmentation policy, the chairman of the KMC board of administrators, Firhad Hakim, on Thursday said that the civic body was determined to take safe drinking water to large areas off EM Bypass and to lakhs of people residing in Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt. The present capacity of Dhapa water treatment plant is 30 million gallons per day (MGD). It caters to over 8 lakh people with filtered water in large areas (from Beliaghata to Patuli) off EM Bypass. The plant had started functioning in 2015. Hakim on Thursday said the capacity of Dhapa water treatment would be augmented by 20 MGD, taking the capacity to 50 MGD to supply potable water to at least 15 lakh houses. According to plans, the civic body will draw additional water from Mayer ghat in Bagbazar and the same will be treated at the Dhapa plant. The treated water will be sent to households in different areas off Bypass through major water pipes that will be laid soon. “Though we are supplying filtered water from the Dhapa water treatment plant, it is not sufficient to cater to the growing needs due to rapid urbanization,” said a civic official. According to a KMC official, after completion of the augmentation, the residents of Topsia, Anandapur, Naskarhat, Kasba, Madurdaha, Kalikapur, Mukundapur and Patuli will be benefited. “We have built water reservoirs in Anandapur, Mukundapur and Patuli,” said a civic official. The civic body will also focus on the construction of capsule or mini water booster pumping stations in the Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt to reach drinking water from the proposed treatment plant at Garia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dhapa-plant-boost-to-solve-kasba-patuli-water-woes/articleshow/87787870.cms||Saikat Ray

The dispensary and shelter home will be run in association with non-governmental organisation People for Animal and will offer medical treatment for pets at nominal charges, and sterilisation of stray dogs and cats. The agenda approved by the general body also allows owners to be fined Rs500 if they do not clean up after their pets in public. Corporators discussed the matter with NCP leader and former mayor Yogesh Bahl alleging that there were irregularities in the sterilisation of stray dogs by three firms during the pandemic. “We got to know via Right to Information (RTI) that the sterilisation of 5,000 stray dogs in the civic limits conducted by three firms during the pandemic was fake. Only bills were produced. NCP corporator from ward number 9, Vaishali Ghodekar, said the civic body must maintain records of pets. “Shelter experts and the PCMC must find a better way to manage the issue of stray animals,” said Ghodekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-general-body-approves-animal-shelter/articleshow/87787863.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Six Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation zones refuse to divulge nCov expenses||AHMEDABAD: Sounds implausible, but what one zone of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) thinks is reasonable information that can be shared under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, six other zones feel is confidential information about the Covid-19 pandemic which cannot be shared. Having received such conflicting replies from zones of the AMC, RTI activist Alpesh Bhavsar has filed an appeal with the civic body. Bhavsar had sought information on patients treated by private designated Covid hospitals and the amount that the AMC paid to these hospitals in lieu of the treatment. An almost identical reply was received from six AMC zones. “Information sought is not public information according to section 4 of Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. Since this information is confidential and work has been done in good faith, this information cannot be considered public information under RTI Act until the pandemic is not over,” read the replies. The central zone of the AMC, however, thinks otherwise. It provided Bhavsar with the names of private hospitals which were designated as Covid hospitals, the number of beds available for Covid-19 treatment in these hospitals and the amount that the AMC reimbursed to the hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. Bhavsar had sought these details for the period from April 2020 to June 2021. “It is a known fact that Covid-19 patients were fleeced by private hospitals who were designated as Covid-19 hospitals. Since the AMC has received funds from multiple agencies for Covid-19 treatment, these details ought to be part of proactive disclosure,” said Bhavsar. # Zone-wise details of how many and which private hospitals were designated as Covid-19 hospitals. # How much money did each hospital receive from corporation? Including details on costs incurred per patient. # Number of cases where private Covid-19 designated hospitals charged more than the fixed rates for treatment. Steps taken by the AMC to enforce rates which had been fixed. # How many persons were vaccinated by private hospitals for the first and second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and how much money did they earn?

---||Delhi||Delhi: New liquor stores in illegal colonies too||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has permitted retail liquor stores in unapproved markets in unauthorised colonies and rural areas. The excise department issued an order on Wednesday following a cabinet decision on November 5 that allowed the opening of retail liquor vends in non-conforming areas. The order facilitates opening of at least two liquor stores in each municipal ward as mandated under the new excise policy. Meanwhile, the city continues to grapple with liquor shortage even on Thursday with many swanky new stores — nearly 200 have opened in two days — not having enough stocks. Under the new policy, 850 liquor stores are going to open while all existing shops were closed on November 16. The Wednesday order stated that applications for retail liquor store licence might be considered provided no conforming area category existed in that particular ward. “Further, two mandatory vends may be permitted to be opened in those wards that have no conforming area, i.e. have 100% non-conforming areas only,” it added. The applicants will have to furnish an affidavit stating that the ward concerned doesn’t have any conforming area, which refers to commercial and industrial areas notified or approved by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) or a municipal corporation. “In case, any municipal ward is found to be having a conforming area, the licensee shall be bound to shift his retail vend to a conforming area in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence within 30 days of issue of notice by the department,” the order pointed out. The liquor stores in the unapproved markets will not be smaller in size as compared to the approved markets. The minimum carpet area for all stores is 500 square foot. “The opening of a retail vend in non-conforming areas is subject to obtaining the requisite approval from DDA and the municipal corporation concerned by the licensee,” the order stated. The excise department has asked the zonal retail licensees to promptly apply for the grant of the retail licence for their vends in the municipal wards without any conforming area and submit a physical copy of the application with necessary documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-liquor-stores-in-illegal-colonies-too/articleshow/87788534.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Rain guides mercury to take a dip, Churu coldest at 5.6°C||JAIPUR: Mercury dipped across the state on Thursday following moderate rainfall in many places. In places which did not receive rains, there was cloud cover throughout the day. Jhadol (Udaipur) received 28 mm rain, the highest in the state. Because of the cloudy conditions, day temperatures remained below 30°C in majority of the places. Churu remained coldest logging 5.6°C. Farmers, who have either finished sowing or are doing it, are jittery and apprehensive as they believe the rainfall might be a spoilsport for crops. “We have sown mustard almost a week ago and if the rainfall is moderate, it will spoil it and we will have to sow again. That means the seed cost would be lost,” said Ganpat Lal Saini, a farmer from Suroth village in Sikar district. Attributing the climatic change to active upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office said till Saturday, mild showers will occur at some places in Udaipur and Jaipur divisions. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning with a minimum temperature of 14.2°C. The maximum temperature of the day was 23.8°C, almost 8 degrees below normal. It was coldest afternoon of the season so far in Jaipur. Churu was followed by Sikar where a minimum temperature of 6.8°C was recorded, Pilani (7.6°C), Hanumangarh (7.9°C), Alwar (9.7°C), Sriganganagar (9.9°C) However, in rest of the districts, the minimum temperatures remained between 10°C and 15.0°C. In its forecast, Jaipur Met office said mild to moderate showers will occur at many places in southern and eastern Rajasthan in the next 24 hours. Many places will also witness ground frost in the morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rain-guides-mercury-to-take-a-dip-churu-coldest-at-5-6c/articleshow/87788537.cms||---

Now, feta cheese, which is made from goat milk, will soon hit the market with Surendranagar’s Sursagar Dairy chalking out elaborate plans to make this milk product. Sursagar Dairy will soon have a meeting with Sahjeevan, a voluntary organization working with pastoral families in Saurashtra and Kutch and apprise the Gujarat Milk Marketing Co-operative Federation (GCMMF) to finalize the launching of feta cheese in December. GCMMF, which markets the Amul brand, has already shown interest in selling feta cheese, which has no fat. Manoj Mishra, executive director of Sahjeevan, told TOI: “We had a meeting with GCMMF officials last week about the launching of feta cheese. They tested a smaller volume production of cheese and are going to test the production from 2,000 litres of milk.” Mishra said the launch is being planned in the first or second week of December. GCMMF, Sursagar Dairy officials and Sahjeevan team will meet soon to finalize the date and they are planning to invite Parsottam Rupala, union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, for the launch. Feta cheese is made in a few select places and India imports this cheese from Denmark and France. Goat milk has almost nil fat and that’s why it’s useful for making cheese. There are many pastoral families in Surendranagar engaged in goat breeding. Currently, they sell goat milk in the open market and some of them also mix it with cow or buffalo milk. Sursagar Dairy, which procures milk in the district, has already identified 17 pockets in Sayla and Chotila talukas to procure this milk. This milk will be initially procured in existing bulk milk chillers (BMC) and if required, they will also have mobile BMC which can keep milk cool for six to seven hours. There are some 500 families engaged in goat breeding and the dairy can procure 8,000 litres milk per day but in the initial stage they are planning to procure 2,000 litres. Gurdit Singh, managing director, Sursagar Dairy said, “I got a message from GCMMF that they will launch feta cheese. We have provided them goat milk for trial and we have infrasture ready to procure this milk.” GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi said, “We are positive about marketing goat cheese which is our initial planning. We are doing trials and the date of launching is yet to be finalized.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/feta-cheese-to-hit-shelves-across-gujarat-soon/articleshow/87787109.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kolhapur||Satej files MLC poll nomination||Kolhapur: District guardian minister and sitting Congress MLC Satej Patil on Thursday submitted his nomination papers to contest the MLC elections for the Kolhapur local body constituency. Patil was flanked by the key leaders of MVA parties, making it clear that they all stand in unity to ensure Patil’s win. In 2015, Patil had won the MLC seat with the support of NCP and smaller fronts. Then, Shiv Sena was with BJP. Now, since the Sena is with him, he expects landslide victory. After filling the nomination papers, Patil said, “At present, we have the support of 250 electors. In the next few days, the number will cross 270. The overwhelming response is due to the work done by the MVA in the past two years.” The members of the local bodies are the electors for the MLC election. As many as 416 electors are eligible to vote and the halfway mark to win is 209. After the nomination papers were filled, the MVA leaders addressed the party workers. Several leaders who were not with Patil during the recent Gokul cooperative dairy polls, were on the stage to support him. The Congress MLA PN Patil and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana president Raju Shetti were in opposition to the panel led by Patil and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif. Their presence showed that Patil has managed to take both on board. Patil and Mushrif made PN Patil’s son Rahul Patil the president of Kolhapur Zilla Parishad, despite demand from their own supporters to make one of them the ZP president. Despite criticising MVA led government for not heeding to the demands of flood-affected farmers, Shetti shared the dais with the MVA leaders. He said, “The flood-affected farmers and common people are unhappy with the MVA. As a part of MVA, we are with our candidate in this election. However, please do not ignore the plight of the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-files-mlc-poll-nomination/articleshow/87786390.cms||---

Delhi Traffic Police issued an advisory at night asking commuters to avoid the roads near Lala Lajpat Rai Marg. The cave-in occurred on the carriageway from Moolchand to Lodhi Hotel, the traffic police said. “Traffic is being diverted through the CGO complex and there could be congestion,” it stated. The traffic police has urged commuters to avoid the route and use alternative ones like Bhishma Pitamah Marg till the road is repaired. The repair is expected to take a couple of days. This will affect traffic as the footfall is high in the area due to the 40th edition of India International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-affected-as-a-part-of-road-caves-in-near-cgo-complex/articleshow/87788548.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Closed flank of Ultadanga flyover to open on Monday||Kolkata: The EM Bypass-bound flank of Ultadanga flyover was shut on Thursday morning for the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) to conduct post-repair load test to assess its structural strength. The flank will remain shut for the next three days and will open at 6am on Monday. The KMDA had been seeking a weekend closure of the Bypass-bound flank from the police to conduct the test after several cracks along this stretch were repaired earlier this year. Officials said that the test after its repair was necessary to assess whether the flyover has regained the desired structural strength to take the load of vehicles. Cops have put up a notice board on the entry point of the Bypass-bound flank, where the flyover starts ascending on VIP Road, asking motorists to take the slip bridge that connects VIP Road with Salt Lake near Hudco crossing or to take the diverted route through Ultadanga and Hudco crossing to move towards Bypass. The VIP Road-bound flank of the flyover remains open for motorists to move from the Bypass. On Thursday, there was some traffic congestion on the Bypass from Hudco crossing as the vehicles had to take the stretch below the Ultadanga flyover. The flyover had been repaired temporarily in 2019. But the full-fledged repair was taken up this year by the KMDA, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/closed-flank-of-ultadanga-flyover-to-open-on-monday/articleshow/87787877.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The court of principal district judge also fined the convict Ghulam Hussain Sheikh of Rs 25,000 for the crime he committed. As per the details of the case, Sheikh and his younger brother were involved in a dispute over passing on the ownership of the house in which the deceased Shehnazbanu Sheikh, her husband Umar and their family were living. The legal ownership of the house was jointly held by Ghulam Hussain and Umar. On February 3, when Shehnazbanu was on the first floor of the house, Ghulam Hussain doused her with kerosene and set her ablaze. She rushed downstairs where Umar was present following which a commotion ensued and people living in the neighbourhood gathered at her home. Umar and other neighbours had doused the fire by splashing water on her and she was taken to SSG Hospital where she succumbed during treatment two days later. However, before dying, Shehnazbanu gave a dying declaration to police and an executive magistrate wherein she blamed Ghulam Hussain for setting her on fire so that he would not have to transfer ownership to Umar. Based on her statement, an offence of attempt to murder was registered at City police station and after her death the accused was booked and arrested for murder. During the trial, the victim’s neighbours, her husband and other family members and the executive magistrate who took the dying declaration were examined and they supported the prosecution’s case. Other forensic evidences were also submitted which were upheld by the court along with the testimonies of the witnesses for convicting Ghulam Hussain. The court also ordered to extend Ghulam Hussain’s punishment by six months if he fails to pay the fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-gets-life-term-for-torching-sister-in-law-to-death/articleshow/87787221.cms||---

The woman lodged a complaint of rape and under sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and also Information Technology Act on Wednesday after the accused Haresh Chudasama uploaded a video of the rape on the internet.

The duo used to meet regularly and expressed their liking for each other. Chudasama recorded the conversation they used to have over the phone. In June 2019, Chudasama took the woman to a hotel near Mahuva and blackmailed her. He made her listen to one of the call recordings and blackmailed her to succumb to his sexual demands. He threatened to make the call recordings public and even tell her parents about the same. Fearing for her reputation, the woman succumbed to Chudasama’s demands. Using the recordings as a threat, Chudasama later raped the woman several times at his home too. The accused had also recorded a video of the rape he committed at a hotel on his mobile phone. Recently when he learnt that the woman’s marriage was fixed, Chudasama shared the video on the internet. When the woman learnt about it, she approached the police and lodged the case.

From January 1, 2022, bells will ring in theatres across the state during regional rounds of the 60th Maharashtra State Marathi Theatre Festival. In Vidarbha, it will be held at nearly 20 centres including Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Chandrapur. Forms are available online and date sheet for Marathi, Hindi, Sanskrit and Children’s theatre events are also out. Maharashtra is the only state in India where the government conducts state-level theatre competition for amateur artistes. Groups from all parts of Maharashtra as well as Marathi speaking parts of neighbouring states like MP, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Telangana, and Karnataka also participate in it. The competition called ‘State Theatre festival’ was conducted uninterruptedly since the formation of Maharashtra in 1960. But the final round of the festival that began in 2019 could not be held due to Covid-19. In 2020, the entire competition was cancelled. Bibhishan Chaware, director of cultural affairs, Maharashtra, said that theatre groups across the state were waiting for the announcement. “We were getting inquiries this year as the pandemic has now receded. While we have kept the format of Marathi theatre festival same, the Hindi and Sanskrit theatre festivals will be held at one centre as the final state-level round this time,” he said. While Nagpur is the preferred centre for Hindi theatre festival, Ratnagiri or Pune take the leas in the Sanskrit event. Nashik has already proposed to host the final round of Marathi theatre festival in March 2022. As far as the regional rounds are concerned, Nagpur’s Scientific Society Hall will be the centre for both Marathi and Children’s theatre festivals. Participants from Vidarbha should submit their documents along with the form at the divisional officer of the directorate at central museum in Nagpur. “The amateur theatre awaits this annual event as it’s the only competitive platform for them,” said senior theatre activist Ashok Ashtikar. “Last year, we missed it. This time, we are preparing with double enthusiasm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amateur-theatre-bells-ring-maha-festival-to-resume-this-season/articleshow/87787889.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

It has everything from live bus tracking to ticket booking, grievance redressal and more. PMPML is in the final phases of inking an agreement with Google to help,” PMPML joint managing director Chetna Kerure told TOI. Another transport official said that once the agreement was finalised, the live bus tracking system and intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) in buses will be revised and activated. “The app will need constant improvements, upgradations and proper monitoring. If PMPML can do it, it is a good option,” said Dhananjay Parikh, a regular commuter.

---||Kolhapur||Farmers’ outfits: Mills refuse to crush cane affected by floods||Kolhapur: Farmers’ outfits have claimed that sugar mills from Kolhapur district are refusing to crush sugar cane that were affected by the floods that occurred in June this year. Over 50,000 hectare of sugar cane fields across Kolhapur district was waterlogged for over two weeks in June. After intervention from district collector Rahul Rekhawar it was decided that the mills will crush 40% flood-affected sugar cane and the remaining not affected by floods on a daily basis. The mills will also have to ensure that all sugar cane affected by floods in their respective jurisdiction is crushed. Shivaji Mane, president of Jay Shivray, Jay Kisan farmers organisation from Hatkanangle tehsil, said, “No mill in our tehsil is ready to crush the sugar cane affected by floods. We have submitted a petition to local authorities to ensure the directions given by district collector are followed in letter and spirit. In 2019, same situation had arrived, however the mills then had cooperated by crushing the flood-affected sugarcane on priority.” Mane said that his outfit has given one-week deadline to the mills to follow directions or they will stop harvest and stop sugarcane transport to the mills. Meanwhile, the mills have raised several concerns to the district authorities. They claim that crushing flood-affected sugarcane will affect sugar recovery and if it is less at the start of the season then the collateral loan given by cooperative banks will be less and thereby will affect payment to the farmers. Also, the cutters have cited difficulties posed while cutting of sugarcane from farms along the river banks. Rekhawar, however said that the mills are cooperating. “The mills are cooperating and have provided us village-wise schedule of crushing till January.” Farmers, who are already under financial distress due to floods, have demanded that sugarcane should be cut at the earliest and keeping it for long time will yield less sugar and thereby less income for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-outfits-mills-refuse-to-crush-cane-affected-by-floods/articleshow/87786410.cms||---

To ease the process and motivate the owners to take up the restoration and repair works, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) would launch a drive to provide all services at a single window. To mark the UNESCO World Heritage Week, celebrated annually from November 19 to 25, the fees of the application would also be waived, said AMC officials. The historic city of Ahmedabad had become India’s first UNESCO World Heritage City in 2017. AMC municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, “The single window clearance will provide encouragement to private heritage homes and havelis to take advantage of the TDR (transferable development rights) extended to them in the Walled City. We have tried to cut down on the process, which we expect will help us conserve more buildings.” “The owners need to approach the cell at Sardar Patel Bhavan, Danapith with stipulated application form, ownership documents and architectural plans,” said a heritage cell official. Ashish Trambadia, director of the Ahmedabad World Heritage City Trust (AWHCT), said that the heritage cell provides technical guidance to the heritage homeowners on restoration, and so far about 40 such homes are either restored or are in various stages of restoration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/opening-a-window-to-usher-in-heritage-conservation/articleshow/87787927.cms||Parth Shastri

The university had announced Rs 5 lakh compensation on Wednesday evening after students protested for over 10 hours demanding justice for BA student Ruksaar Jahan, who was killed when the driver of the bus reversed the vehicle carelessly at high speed. Later, the driver was also arrested in the night. Following these developments, the students had withdrawn their protest. However, after reaching the hostel, the students had a meeting in which they came to the conclusion that the compensation was less, hence decided to resume the protest. Around midnight, a group of students sat at the university gates for a demonstration. Soon, they were joined by other students. At around 1 pm, Jahan’s parents also arrived on the campus to take the body of their daughter. Students brought them to the demonstration venue as well. In the morning, students blocked the road outside the campus and raised slogans against the university authorities. The students demanded Rs 40 lakh compensation for Jahan’s family and a job for a member. Vice-chancellor Prof Rana Krishna Pal Singh came to meet the demonstrators at 6pm. He announced to increase compensation to Rs 6 lakh and assured that since varsity is incapable of paying Rs 40 lakh, it will request the government to give the same under the Motor Vehicle Act. He appealed to university employees to donate a day’s salary for Jahan’s family. Jahan was a resident of Siwan in Bihar and a talented student. Her father Rashid Aleem, who is a shopkeeper, said that he wanted justice for his daughter who was killed due to carelessness of a driver. “I was stopped by the police administration when I was coming to the university to join the protest. University authorities wanted me to stay in a hotel. How can I stay in comfort with the pain of losing my young daughter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/irate-students-call-off-18-hour-agitation-as-univ-raises-compensation-for-death/articleshow/87788602.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Medical certificate racket in jail busted by Delhi cops||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police Special Cell busted a racket involved in the supply of fake medical certificates to incarcerated undertrials, which were used to seek bail or parole. A man claiming to be a doctor is being interrogated in custody, sources said. The accused was identified as Ram Krishna Gupta, a resident of sector 75 in Noida. He is the alleged mastermind of the racket. More arrests are likely and the cops suspect the involvement of a middleman and an advocate too. Raids are being conducted to nab others. The ‘doctor’, whose credentials are being verified, is suspected to have made over a dozen certificates for undertrials till date for pecuniary gains. Cops suspect he is a quack and impersonating a practicing doctor on the basis of forged documents. As per his remand application, police have invoked sections of impersonation, providing false information to court, cheating and forgery, against the accused. Gupta allegedly charged Rs 50,000-Rs 1,00,000 for each report based on the profile of the undertrial seeking the application. During initial investigation, cops have established his involvement in five such cases, a source said. “During interrogation, the accused conceded preparation of several medical reports to aid undertrial prisoners, but he claims to be unable to recall their particulars. We are digging further,” said an investigator. The cops had started this investigation on the directions of Delhi High Court, which had flagged a case of a fictitious medical report during the hearing of a bail application of a drug trafficker, Rais Khan, who was arrested with 329.5kg of drugs in 2019. An FIR was registered and a team was formed to investigate the matter. Cops tried to trace the alleged doctor who had issued the fake medical certificate to the undertrial, but found him untraceable. Several raids were conducted to nab him. Proclamation proceedings were then initiated to declare him an absconder. On Thursday, the cops received information that the suspect in the case was in Noida. Technical surveillance was mounted and the suspect was tracked down and arrested. During questioning, Gupta claimed that he was diagnosed with a brain-related ailment and was operated upon by a neurologist over the left temporal region for a brain tumour in the year 2002-03. He was then exposed to the working of doctors and decided to impersonate one.

The HC was hearing the PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal, demanding proper implementation of the Fire Safety Act and full compliance with directions issued by the court over the last two decades.  The PIL was filed after a fire claimed the lives of eight Covid-19 patients at Shrey Hospital in Ahmedabad in August 2020. The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice H M Prachchhak asked the petitioner to point out how court orders have been either not complied with or partially complied with, so the court can issue appropriate directions to the authorities. The judges made it clear that they would not hear any further arguments on this issue, which has been debated for nearly a year. The court said the reports filed till do not make it clear how many court directions have been complied with and to what extent. Panchal drew the court’s attention to various directions issued for implementation of fire safety rules since 2001. He insisted that the court continue monitoring the work undertaken by the authorities to comply with orders and expressed a grievance that despite repeated orders the situation does not improve. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi cited figures of buildings in municipality areas to show a marked improvement in implementation of fire safety rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-seeks-govt-plan-to-enforce-fire-safety-rules-in-phases/articleshow/87787946.cms||---

To mark its centenary, the zoological garden, popularly known as ‘Banarasi Bagh’, has already begun a series of competitions for schoolchildren. The events will be held till November 26. Various competitions, including ‘mobiliography’, still photography, street plays, slogan writing, face painting, recitation, rangoli making, quiz, drawing, painting and debate will be held every day from November 22-26. A walkathon will be organised to raise awareness about protection and adoption of animals from 1090 Crossing at 7.30am on November 28. Another highlight will be the arrival of six zebras of new genes from Israel on November 25. On the concluding day on November 29, CM Yogi Adityanath, will inaugurate the Centenary Pillar, and release a postage stamp and the centenary magazine. Despite malls and other indoor modes of entertainment, the zoo continues to be a favourite spot for the public. From the sprawling lush green garden, baradari, to the ‘Mummy’ in the State Museum, zoo has been a much-loved hangout place for both young and old. Despite facing a financial crunch during Covid pandemic, the zoo received an encouraging response to its animal adoption programme launched with dozens of wildlife conservation enthusiasts getting on board and raising more than Rs 72 lakh for the inmates. The zoo was initially developed as a mango orchard in the 18th century by the then Nawab of Awadh, Nawab Nasiruddin Haider, before being converted into an animal shelter home in 1921. “Awadh Nawabs and zamindars contributed 7.3 lakh towards running and maintenance of the society. The area is spread over 29 hectares and still houses the first and the oldest cage brought in during 1925. Currently, the animals reside in 152 enclosures built on modern lines,” said RK Singh, zoo director, adding that one of the major aims of the zoo is sensitization of people towards wildlife. The zoo has added many new additions and developments in its kitty from the time it came into existence. One among the highlighted features is the white marble Nagardi Baradari’ which has been on its campus since the 18th century.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zoo-turns-100-invites-kids-to-bash/articleshow/87788613.cms||---

The vaccination drive for pregnant women began in August and since then, 4,357 women across the district have been given the first dose, while 1,082 have been administered the second dose. Dr Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer and vaccination incharge said, “In Anjaneri PHC, the vaccination was carried under the special campaign and all the pregnant women registered with the health department have been administered at least the first dose. Leena Bansod, the ZP CEO, monitored the vaccination drive.” Bhoye pointed out that there are many pregnant women who have received vaccines, but were not categorized separately by the staff. “The number is only from the special campaign. Those who took vaccination at other centres were not categorized and hence, we have asked the officials to count them,” he said. The health officials said that on average, every year, 80,000 pregnant women register themselves with the health department. “Given the target, the vaccination numbers are low. The exercise of counting the vaccinated pregnant women is now being undertaken with the help of ASHA workers,” the official added. Malegaon taluka is leading in administering the first dose to 1,109 women, followed by Dindori taluka where 617 women have been given the jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-pregnant-women-under-anjaneri-phc-got-1st-covid-vax-dose/articleshow/87786463.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||Goons buy sharp weapons online, keep cops busy with seizures||Nagpur: The city police is finding it tricky to tackle crimes in city as goons are increasingly using e-commerce portals to purchase sharp weapons under the label of ‘kitchenware’. Known as ‘Chinese’ weapons, these are popular among youngsters, it’s learnt. In two years, there has been a sharp 81% increase in the seizure of arms, including a substantial number of weapons procured online. Till October 2019, 433 sharp weapons were seized by police. This year, 783 sharp weapons were seized till October. During a recent research done by the National Law University on crimes in Nagpur, a substantial rise in the trend of hurt cases and murders was observed. Though the traditional sources and routes of smuggling firearms from Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh mostly remained unchanged, the modus operandi of procuring sharp weapons has seen a sea change with easy availability of such materials on e-commerce sites. The sharp weapons are delivered at the doorsteps after being purchased online. CP Amitesh Kumar had in December last year issued a notification under Criminal Procedure Code 144 banning sale, purchase and delivery of any arms or weapons through e-commerce portals which do not conform to the norms under the Indian Arms Act. The top cop said that several purchasers of sharp weapons were pulled up and warned of serious actions in a drive towards the end of last year. The weapons were confiscated too. “Along with them, strict action will be taken against e-commerce portals too if it’s found the weapon used in a crime had been purchased and delivered from their sites, especially if it violates specifications of the Indian Arms Act,” he said. As per the Indian Arms Act, any sharp weapon beyond nine-inch in length and two-inch in width will be categorized as illegal. During a recent action, city police had recovered nine sharp weapons purchased online. The CP said the e-commerce portals have been advised to refrain from violating the instructions. “Shopping portals are dealing mostly in kitchenware and these sharp weapons are many times packaged as crockeries and vegetable knives. We are thinking of legally binding them,” he said. He also said the crime branch and police stations have been directed to take separate and joint drives against illegal arms, criminals known to keep and use arms and such armed gangs. “All the criminals on record having offences of possessing or supplying arms and known to have used them are being repeatedly checked and slapped with preventive actions,” said the top cop. Sources in the police stated that some shrines too have shops selling swords and small knives for religious purposes. “Goons many times mislead the shopkeepers for buying swords and knives by masquerading as member of a community,” said the source. A community near Rani Durgawati Chowk manufactures sharp weapons ‘on order’ and delivers it within few hours fearing police raids. “A mini factory of blacksmiths at Mominpura also delivers sharp weapons if an order is placed. After a raid, the place is being operated clandestinely,” said a source and added, “Some shops in Mominpura had earlier faced actions for selling Chinese weapons.” Sharp weapons seized 433 | Till October 2019 489 | Till October 2020 783 | Till October 2021||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goons-buy-sharp-weapons-online-keep-cops-busy-with-seizures/articleshow/87787959.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) is in talks with the Railways authorities to introduce a rail block to assist the work as the girder would be launched above the tracks and overhead traction. MahaMetro plans to complete the work in a week, with a few hours of block every day. As per the alignment, the Metro viaduct is aligned along the old Pune-Mumbai road till Khadki railway station, after which it would cross the tracks and enter the Range Hills area. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “It is delicate work and will require a rail block. We have already approached railway authorities with our plan. The girder is ready. It will be launched in phases. The entire work is expected to take about a week. We have teams of experts who will be working along with railway authorities to see that work is completed at the earliest”. A MahaMetro official said the Metro viaduct will be high enough as to not disturb railway operations; there will be an adequate clearance between the viaduct and the railways’ overhead traction. The girder will cater to both the up and down tracks. All necessary precautions will be followed during the launch of the girder, the official said The official said MahaMetro launched steel girders at other locations on the Metro routes in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The girder over the railway tracks had to be specially designed considering the railways’ requirements and technical aspects. After crossing the tracks on both ends, the girder will again be connected to the viaduct. The work of viaduct has already been expedited on both sides of the tracks. Officials from railway administration said that the proposal was being studied and that a plan for the launch would be finalised soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-web-girder-to-cross-rly-tracks-at-khadki-ready/articleshow/87787967.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: It’s still a messy ride on Tonk Road as revamp claims by traffic cops fall flat||JAIPUR: The city traffic police’s plans to remove bottlenecks along Tonk Road seem to have fizzled out very fast. Police officials, last month, had announced a slew of measures for a seamless movement of vehicular traffic on the road, including removal of encroachments outside SMS Hospital, nudging bus drivers to stop at earmarked spots, and proper parking facilities to remove bottlenecks. Cut to today, a reality check on the city’s important arterial road includes all signs of the old chaos, bottlenecks, and long snarls. The police had claimed that no bus would be allowed to halt at the Rambagh Circle. Contrary to claims, a row of buses was spotted on the same spot on Thursday, leaving a trail of stranded motorists honking for a corner to move ahead. There was a similar scene on the SMS Hospital Road, where multiple tie-ups brought the traffic to a crawl. Police had assured that vendors, unauthorized e-rickshaw parking spots will be removed to alleviate the problem. There are more than a dozen eateries, fruit vendors, illegal parking spots, dairy booths, and hawkers selling everything from masks to biscuits. The encroachment has led to buses, visitors and ambulances jostling for whatever little space they can find to advance before lights turn red, ahead on the intersection. At the glass factory stretch of the Tonk Road, police had assured that barricades will be put on a cut. No such arrangements were there as drivers continued to take a U-turn, thereby slowing down the traffic pouring in from Gopalpura. Near the Tonk Road flyover, peak hour traffic jams continue due to haphazard parking alongside the road, forcing people to take small alleys through residential blocks. Additional commissioner of police, law-and-order, Haider Ali Zaidi said a multi-departmental effort was needed. "The civic bodies and police need to come together, we are looking into the issue," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/its-still-a-messy-ride-on-tonk-road-as-revamp-claims-by-traffic-cops-fall-flat/articleshow/87788617.cms||---
---||Delhi||Chloroform OD killed two house workers||New Delhi: The investigation into the murders of two women from Darjeeling has revealed that they were given an overdose of chloroform. Investigators also claimed that the accused watched videos online to learn the use of chloroform. On Monday, the bodies of two house help were found in a house in the K block area of Jangpura Extension. Police on Wednesday arrested five people in the case and claimed that robbery was the primary motive. The key conspirator was a former help’s nephew. Investigators claimed that the accused did not have any knowledge about chloroform. “They purchased a one-litre bottle on the pretext of usage in a laboratory. Later they started watching videos on the internet on how to use chloroform on a person,” an investigator said. After they entered the house, they applied the chloroform on the faces of two maids. “To ensure they don’t wake up, they sprayed too much chloroform on the women’s pillows and gagged them with tape,” an investigator said, adding that they recovered the bottle. During the probe, investigators found that one accused was the nephew of a previous help, who worked for around two years in the house. “He learned the house’s topography from her and learnt that the house had Rs 30 lakh-40 lakh in cash,” said a police officer. The men expected only one help in the house but used the same strategy with chloroform to subdue both women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chloroform-od-killed-two-house-workers/articleshow/87787985.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Season’s 1st fog may surprise you today||Lucknow: Even as air quality continued to remain poor in the city on Thursday, people might witness pre-winter season’s first fog on Friday. Though the fog is expected to be shallow and that too only in the morning hours, experts fear that it may aggravate the air quality further. State met director JP Gupta said that easterly winds due to a low pressure area over Arabian Sea are feeding moisture into the state's atmosphere, resulting in overcast sky. This moisture may cause shallow fog/mist in the morning due to drop in temperatures at night, he explained. However, he added, possibilities of rains are low The maximum temperature on Thursday dropped to 25.8, three units below normal because of the cloudy sky. The minimum temperature was 14.2 degrees Celius, 1.3 degrees above normal. The met department forecast also said that there can be a brief spell of rain in some areas of East UP. Shallow fog/mist is expected in the rest of the state as well. Meanwhile, according to Central Pollution Control Board data Lucknow’s Air Quality Index increased to 241 on Thursday from 237 on Wednesday. This falls under the category of poor air quality, which may cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure. Experts said that tiny droplets of water in fog and mist combine with particles of pollutants to form smog or haze, which remains suspended in the air for a longer period, deteriorating the air quality further. Rain or increase in wind speed, however, helps in clearing the pollutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/seasons-1st-fog-may-surprise-you-today/articleshow/87788621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cops up vigil, peddlers jack ganja price to new high||HYDERABAD: Ever since chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed police to crack down on ganja trade and usage following the rape and murder of a minor in Saidabad, the price of the contraband has gone up manifold. For instance, in August, a sachet of 10 gram of ganja was available for Rs 200. Now, it costs Rs 500. Following increased vigilance on transportation of ganja and peddlers since September, peddlers too jacked up the price. While their buying price has increased only marginally, the peddlers reportedly are citing scarcity of ganja and the greater risk involved in selling it in the backdrop of heightened police enforcement as reasons for charging steep prices. Though police in all the three city commissionerates claim the supply of ganja has come down considerably, cops continue to come across instances of peddlers bringing huge quantity of ganja into Telangana. The stock is mostly sold to local users or is in transit to other states, especially Maharashtra and Haryana. “One doesn’t know how much ganja is slipping away from police radar and clandestinely reaching abusers from peddlers,” an investigator said. An ACP-rank officer from Old City confirmed that a ganja sachet of 10 gram now costs Rs 500. “Presently, price is being decided by desperation of the buyer and seller’s exploitation of the situation. In upscale areas, the price is much higher than Rs 500,” he said. After realising that the existing enforcement to nab peddlers was not sufficient, Hyderabad and Rachakonda police and prohibition & excise officials are taking the help of expert counsellors. “For persons who are arrested abusing ganja, we want to help them come out of the addiction and also stop them from relapsing. There is a provision in the NDPS Act which allows security agencies to give counselling to drug abusers if they are serious about de-addiction. Curtailing the supply through enforcement and reducing the demand by helping the victims to avoid abusing drugs through de-addiction is our strategy,’‘ Rachakonda commissioner of police Mahesh Bhagwat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-up-vigil-peddlers-jack-ganja-price-to-new-high/articleshow/87788290.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disha rape and murder case: Panel examines CCTV footage of crime scene||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court-appointed inquiry commission examined the CCTV footage of the Disha rape and murder case during oral arguments of investigating officer (IO) ACP V Surender’s advocate on Thursday. The commission also sought clarity on ‘arrest and re-arrest’ of the accused as mentioned in the case diary. The commission members checked the video footage at Thondupally toll plaza on November 27, 2019, to verify if it showed the accused carrying Disha to a secluded place adjacent to their parked truck next to the highway. The IO’s counsel Keerthi Kiran Kota played the CCTV footage of Disha crossing the road to get into a cab in the evening and later returning to the spot at night and going towards her parked scooter. Visuals of the accused riding Disha’s scooter along with their truck between Thondupally and Shadnagar and Md Arif with the truck next day were also shown. A YouTube video of Disha’s belongings near Thondupally toll plaza where she was assaulted were also played before the commission. After perusing the CCTV footage, the commission said that they could not see any visuals of the victim being carried by the accused in the clips shown. Earlier, while explaining the arrests, Kota said as per the IO’s orders the then Shadnagar SHO Sridhar Kumar apprehended the accused on November 29 afternoon from Jaklair and Gudigandla villages and affected their arrest before the IO at 5 pm at Shadnagar police station. The advocate cited arrest memo to substantiate his argument. But when the commission asked him to explain why the case diary mentions that the accused were arrested at around 1 pm and then re-arrested at 5 pm at Shadnagar, he clarified that they were picked up at around 1 pm. On being quizzed by the commission if the case diary mentioned that procedure was not followed because of law and order issue, the advocate replied in the negative.

During arguments by advocate for the three handlers, the commission ascertained that unlike other police witnesses, the three never said that ACP ordered firing in the direction of the sound or claimed being threatened by NHRC during recording of statements. Appearing for SI Sk Lal Madhar, SI K Ravi and head constable Md Sirajuddin, who had fired during the alleged encounter on December 6, 2019, advocate Sk Mastan Vali told the commission: “As per IPC Sections 76 and 79, the acts of my clients do not amount to an offence. My clients were discharging public duty as per the orders of their superior officer.” Mastan Vali said they were ordered to fire by the ACP after the accused continued to fire at them despite warnings shots in the air. During arguments of advocate T Bala Mohan Reddy appearing for handlers D Janakiram, Balu Rathod and D Srikanth, the commission queried if his clients had also stated being threatened by the NHRC team when their statements were recorded after the alleged encounter. The advocate said that they had not mentioned about threats from NHRC because no question was asked about it. Then, with advocate Reddy’s assistance the commission went through the deposition of ACP V Surender who had stated that NHRC team had threatened him and commented, “He himself said and we pursued it because it is a serious issue. But he did not lodge any complaint about it.” Advocate Reddy then pointed to the commission that NHRC team member Arun Tyagi had voluntarily mentioned during his deposition that he drew the sketch of the encounter site, while NHRC officials had admitted examining ACP V Surender beyond midnight to record his statement, which was a violation of human rights. “The statements recorded by NHRC can’t be given any importance,” the advocate argued.

The heart was being transported from the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) hospital in Punjagutta to AIG Hospital in Gachibowli, a usually busy stretch prone to traffic blocks. The donor was a 31-year-old brain dead patient, Nakirakanti Shekhar, who hailed from Nadimpally village in Mahabubnagar. The recipient of the heart was a 45-year-old from the city. Shekhar had been injured in a hit-and-run accident near Achampet in Mahabubnagar on November 13 while he was on his way home after work. He was rushed to the local government hospital first and later shifted to NIMS. “He was in the intensive care unit for four days. His condition deteriorated and was declared brain dead on the night of November 18. Jeevandan appreciates the donor family members for their noble act,” said Dr G Swarnalatha, head of state-run Jeevandan organisation. Dr Swarnalatha said that a Jeevandan coordinator had provided grief counselling to the family and also explained the importance of organ donation. Following the counselling, Shekhar’s brother and sister consented to donate his organs under Jeevandan programme for patients who may be in need. Apart from the heart, seven other organs were retrieved from Shekhar. These organs were sent to the Osmania General Hospital (liver and a kidney), another kidney was kept in NIMS for a transplant, two lungs were sent to KIMS hospital and two corneas given to the Sarojini Devi Eye bank. Incidentally, this was the first heart transplant taken up at AIG Hospitals, according to Jeevandan officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-9-mins-donors-heart-beats-traffic-to-beat-again-in-recipient/articleshow/87788359.cms||---

Lawyers and judicial staff rescued the ADJ and held the two police officers hostage. Krishna is the station house officer of Ghoghardiha police station in Madhubani, while Sharma is his subordinate. The ADJ had ordered special training for Madhubani SP and SDPO earlier this year for their “poor knowledge” while denying bail in a case which he had termed as rape case but police had not filed chargesheet invoking POCSO Act. Patna high court had seized his judicial powers on September 24 for his “unusual” judgments. At the time of filing of report, the SIs were still kept confined in a room inside the court premises by lawyers. Senior authorities, including Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar, were at the spot to pacify the lawyers. “There was a complaint against the SHO after which ADJ’s steno had rang him asking to come to the judge’s office. Heated arguments took place between both sides after which physical assault took place,” said Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar. Patna high court Chief Justice Sanjay Karol took suo moto cognizance of the incident and formed a special division bench to hear the matter. Late in the night, state police ADG (headquarters) J S Gangwar had to physically appear before the bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah which heard the matter and described the incident as an attempt to “jeopardise the independence of judiciary”. “The DGP is directed to remain present in the court on the next date of hearing on November 29. He should file a status report in a sealed cover,” the bench observed. Meanwhile, Darbhanga range IG told TOI over phone that the ADJ has lodged an FIR against both SIs for assaulting him physically and with their weapons.

---||Kolkata||CM’s Kona E-way decongest prod after investors’ appeal||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the chief secretary to work out a plan to manage traffic on Kona Expressway better after investors in Howrah urged the authorities to decongest the road, which gets clogged after evening due to trucks parked on the side. “I understand the problem. Truck drivers park their vehicles along Kona Expressway as the Kolkata Police doesn’t allow entry of heavy vehicles into the city before 9pm. But that creates jams and commuters headed for Kolkata are often stuck there. The jam continues for four to five hours,” the CM said at the Howrah administrative meeting on Thursday. The CM asked chief secretary H K Dwivedi and home secretary B S Gopalika to work out a de-congestion plan. “We have to find an alternative route to disperse the traffic via Nivedita Setu or some other bridge where the traffic load is low,” Banerjee said. Complaints of traffic jams on NH2 reached the state headquarters at Nabanna ahead of the Howrah meeting. Ambulance operators complained about being stuck in snarls while ferrying critical patients to city hospitals. The CM said in the meeting that efforts were on to create dedicated lanes for ambulances and motorists. Banerjee also pointed out travel on the opposite direction—from the bridge towards Howrah—via Kona Expressway in the morning was a trouble due to congestion at the Santragachhi rail overbridge. The Chandernagore Police Commissionerate roped in the Hooghly rural police to handle the traffic often diverted through Dankuni, instead of being allowed straight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cms-kona-e-way-decongest-prod-after-investors-appeal/articleshow/87788032.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Obesity increases threat of Covid severity, death: Docs||Lucknow: Individuals with Covid-19 and obesity have an increased risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death, said experts in an educational and awareness programme organised at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) on Thursday. They said that obesity weakens the immune system, making the individual susceptible to infectious diseases. Besides, they said, often obese patients also suffer from coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthama that make them vulnerable to Covid severity. Head of gastrosurgery department at RMLIMS, Prof Anshuman Pandey said, “About 35 obese patients, who had gone through bariatric surgery (surgery to modify the stomach and intestines to treat obesity and related diseases) at RMLIMS in last two years, beat Covid-19 better than others with the same problem during the second wave. The main reason behind this was that comorbid conditions such as diabetes, respiratory disease, blood pressure, thyroid and arthritis had improved after surgery.” HOD anaesthesia, Dr Deepak Malviya highlighted the different problems faced by obese patients who had to be admitted on ventilator. HOD cardiology, Dr Bhuvan Tiwari put forth the ill effects of Covid-19 on the heart of obese patients. He said, “Obesity is a modifiable risk factor of Covid-19 and our public health bodies goal should be to achieve a healthy weight at the population level that might reduce adverse outcomes in near future.” Meanwhile, doctors interacted with the participants including those who underwent Covid treatment. The participants who also suffered with comorbidities explained how they fought with the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/obesity-increases-threat-of-covid-severity-death-docs/articleshow/87788667.cms||---

The ACB caught lawyer Bhaatkumar Bhagwatiprasad Yadav (35) a resident of Abrama in Valsad, red-handed accepting cash from the owner of a wine shop outside the mamlatdar (revenue) office in Valsad town. ACB has registered a case against Yadav and Valsad city woman police sub-inspector Y J Patel under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to ACB, Patel had demanded Rs 1.5 lakh from the wine shop owner for not arresting his son who is booked in a prohibition case lodged in Valsad town police station. The shop owner alerted the ACB that laid a trap and caught Yadav red-handed. As per the case details, Patel was investigating a prohibition case at Valsad city police station last year. This is when the name of the wine shop owner in Silvassa city of union territory Dadra and Nagar Haveli cropped up. The owner got anticipatory bail from the court. But PSI Patel allegedly started threatening the wine shop owner and demanded Rs 1.5 lakh from him for not pursuing the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lawyer-held-for-taking-rs-1-5l-as-bribe-on-behalf-of-woman-cop/articleshow/87787298.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t know what you have in mind, SC tells Param Bir||New Delhi: The Supreme Court bench observed on Thursday that it was getting an impression that Param Bir Singh was sitting abroad and would come to India after getting a favourable order from the court. The bench again pointed out lack of confidence shown by the top IPS officer in the system and made it clear that he will not be treated differently. “You are seeking protective orders; nobody knows where you are. Suppose you are sitting abroad and taking legal recourse through power of attorney then what happens. If that is so then you will come to India if the court rules in your favour, we don't know what you have in mind. No protection, no hearing until we know where you are,” the bench said. A magistrate court on Wednesday declared Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city. Singh had last attended his office in May this year, after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay high court last month that his whereabouts were not known. The police action had followed his sensational charge that Deshmukh had asked for collection of Rs 100 crore as bribes. Bimal Agrawal, a real estate developer, had alleged the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on two bars and restaurants which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them. The incidents are said to have occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed. Following his complaint, a case was filed under IPC sections 384 and 385 (both about extortion) and 34 (common intention) against six accused. Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too. Singh was shunted from the post of Mumbai police chief in March after Waze was arrested in the case of explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-know-what-you-have-in-mind-sc-tells-param-bir/articleshow/87788690.cms||---

---||Delhi||Target 2025: Infusing life back into Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Determined to clean the Yamuna before February 2025, Delhi government has started work on a war-footing to ensure that the river gets its life back. Various measures being taken up include enhancing the sewage treatment capacity, monitoring creation and treatment of industrial waste and ensuring processing of domestic sewage before the treated water flows in the Yamuna.  Four new sewage treatment plants are being built — Okhla facility with a capacity of 124 million gallons a day, Coronation Pillar site 70MGD, Rithala 40MGDs and Kondli plant, 45MGDs. The existing 19 STPs are being upgraded to boost their treating capacity.  The government is also going for in-situ treating of sewage in the Najafgarh drain, Supplementary drain, Barapullah drain and Shahdara drain. “The running water is being cleaned inside the drain itself instead of in an STP,” explained a government official. TimesViewIt is good news that the Delhi government is embarking on a time-bound plan to clean the polluted Yamuna. But the truth is that a lot of money has been spent in the past to that end without much success. It is essential, therefore, that the plan must be carefully and regularly monitored on a quarterly basis to ensure its efficacy.Waste generation in 33 industrial clusters is under watch. “In 17 industrial clusters, wastewater flows to 13 common effluent treatment plant. Wastewater from locations not linked with a treatment plan will be tapped in the sewer line and sent for cleaning,” the official said.  The government has directed the industries department to act against units that do not channel their waste through a pipeline going to a treatment plant. “If they do not put the wastewater in treatment plant drains, the units will be shut down,” warned the government. Industrial units that discharge water into the sewers without treatment will also be closed down. There are many manufacturers, such as of plastic pellets, that dump waste into sewer lines. Improper disposal of waste in this manner will also attract strict punishment, the government stated.  The community toilet complexes in JJ clusters across the capital are connected to stormwater drains and not to the sewage network. All wastewater in such clusters flows into the the stormwater drains too. On Thursday, Delhi government stated, “It has been decided that even the smallest drain coming out of JJ clusters will be connected to the nearby sewer line so that wastewater can be treated at the STP. The target is to get sewer lines for 1,799 unauthorised colonies in Delhi by 2024.”  The plan also wants to prevent household toilet waste from going into sewage drains. “East Delhi now has provision for connecting all households to a sewage network. Yet, there are many small and big waste-carrying drains, whose contents are dumped into the stormwater drains. After this, that water then flows into the Yamuna through the bigger drains,” noted the government statement. This filthy water flows down the big drains spreading a foul smell across large areas, creating a breeding ground for flies and mosquitoes and contaminating the groundwater before eventually polluting the Yamuna.  Delhi has a sewer network that is 9,225km long, and Delhi has started the process to unclog all of them. “Wastewater from households contains silt which continually builds up inside the sewer line,” said a government official. “If the pipeline gets choked anywhere along its length, the dirty water flowing in it is blocked and overflows onto the roads and again eventually reaches the river through the stormwater and drains.  The target before the government in the next six months is to clear the sewer lines of accumulated silt. “Any area in which the sewer line is found to be clogged from 10% to 50% will be cleaned and desilted. After this, the wastewater is more likely to reach the STPs for treatment,” the government stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/target-2025-infusing-life-back-into-yamuna/articleshow/87788089.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Surat||Passenger footfall, flight numbers take off in Surat||Surat: The Diamond City flyers, after being forced to keep low due to the pandemic, are flying high and importantly, frequently again. In October, the Surat airport witnessed a footfall of 87,008 passengers compared to just 1,616 recorded in May 2020. With the increase in number of passengers, the flight traffic at Surat airport too is getting busier by the day. Just a week back, Go First’s inaugural flight on the Delhi-Surat route got the traditional water cannon salute at the Surat airport. After the Covid enforced lull, the start of the year saw flight activities picking up in Surat. In February 2021, Surat airport saw a footfall of 96,949 passengers, while last month it was 87,008. With no major disruption in sight, experts feel that the passenger numbers are likely to go as high as 1.5 lakh this month. Working for better connectivity, increased flights and better amenities for passengers is a group that goes by the name of ‘we work for working airport at surat’. The group has a big presence on social media with its Facebook page boasting of close to 92,000 members. The group has regular interactions not only with the officials of the Surat airport but also that of different airlines. Sanjay Jain, a businessman dealing in construction material, is an active member of the group. “We started this group in 2011 to get proper flight facilities from Surat. Due to our efforts now major airlines including Air India, Air India Express, Indigo, Spice Jet, Go First, Star Air and Ventura are operating flights from Surat airport for domestic flyers while Air India Express is operating the Surat-Sharjah flight,” Jain said. Jain said that Surat has now got flight connectivity with major cities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Coimbatore and Indore. He is confident that the footfall at Surat Airport will reach 1.5 lakh passengers this month. Aman Saini, airport director, Surat too said the number of flyers are increasing after the second wave of Covid-19. On November 14, a total of 42 flights (21 arrivals and 21 departures) — carrying 5,369 passengers — operated from Surat airport, Saini informed. “We are working to increase air traffic at the airport,” Saini added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/passenger-footfall-flight-numbers-take-off-in-surat/articleshow/87787309.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Majithia’s petition in multi-crore drug case bid to delay matter: AAP||Chandigarh: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has attacked Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia over his application to become party in the multi-crore drug racket case in the Punjab and Haryana high court, calling it an “attempt to delay the matter beyond the 2022 state assembly polls”. AAP state president Bhagwant Mann on Thursday alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government and Majithia were helping each other in deceiving Punjab and its people by adopting new tactics to delay the matter. He alleged that the Congress government had been making efforts to save the drug mafia and their political masters by not making the special task force (STF) report public, under the guise of its being sealed. He said in the 124-page petition, just a few days before the state assembly elections, Majithia’s demand to make himself a party in the case was just a conspiracy. The Sangrur MP also said the sealed report was just an excuse and if the government wanted, action could still be taken against drug smugglers. He said that chief minister Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa should tell whether the court had stayed the action against the drug smugglers. He argued that the state government and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) could take further investigation and decisive action against drug smugglers, bureaucrats and political leaders because the court had not restrained them from taking action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/majithias-petition-in-multi-crore-drug-case-bid-to-delay-matter-aap/articleshow/87788687.cms||---

This despite the fact that the Nainital HC has been issuing orders regarding the community’s resettlement. The HC on Wednesday reprimanded the state for not effectively executing the works of forming a committee as directed in August 2020 and asked it to form an all new committee, including DMs of respective districts, and once again restart the entire rehabilitation work. The court was unsatisfied by the representation of the state government and ordered principal secretary social welfare department, principal chief conservator, forests (wildlife), and DMs of Dehradun, Haridwar, Uttarkashi, Pauri, Tehri, Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital to be present in-person before the court on November 24. Panic has gripped Van Gujjars as uncertainty hovers over their future because the landscapes on which they live for six months and then migrate to higher altitude during summer are gradually being encroached upon for construction works, they claimed. Speaking with TOI, a Van Gujjar from Shivpuri in Rishikesh, Gaami Gujjar, 42, said, “At Shivpuri, around 200 families are being asked by forest department to leave as our permit has expired. But where do we go now?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/van-gujjars-flag-violation-of-rights-say-being-displaced-without-any-rehabilitation-plan/articleshow/87786547.cms||Shivani Azad

The two were on their way to the shrine town from Haridwar when the accident happened near Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal district around midnight. According to police, after their vehicle fell into the river, Sandeep was swept away along with the car while Aakash managed to cling to a rock for around two hours before he was finally rescued by a team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel. Divulging details, Upendra Ishtwaal, member of the SDRF team that was involved in the rescue, said, "Aakash fell into the river as his side of the door got opened. Since he knew swimming, he managed to reach a nearby rock and clung to it.” Meanwhile, the body of Sandeep Rathi was fished out on Thursday evening. “It had to be pulled out of the submerged car. The deceased ran a business at Narsan in Haridwar,” Ishtwaal said. He added that Aakash was lucky that his cries for help reached the staff of a nearby hotel on the highway, who then informed police. “It is his good fortune that the water level of the river did not rise and submerge the rock to which he was clinging.” An SDRF personnel said that Aakash was in a state of shock and trauma when he was rescued. “He has been admitted to a health facility in Srinagar and is currently under observation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-clings-to-rock-for-2-hours-after-car-plunges-into-river-near-badrinath-rescued-later-cousin-dies/articleshow/87786544.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||Two days after a leopard killed a five-year-old girl in Nainital, another four-year-old taken away by big cat in Rudraprayag||Dehradun/Nainital: With the onset of the winter season, human-leopard conflict incidents have again started surfacing in Uttarakhand. In the last 48 hours, the hill state recorded two cases where minor girls were attacked by big cats. In the most recent incident that took place in Rudraprayag, a four-year-old was attacked by a leopard while she was playing in the backyard of her house on Wednesday evening. “The girl suffered minor injuries on her forehead but is stated to be out of danger. She is recuperating. We have sought permission to trap and relocate the leopard to some other area. Meanwhile, villagers have been alerted to stay away from the forest area,” said Vaibhav Singh, DFO, Rudraprayag. He added, “The leopard probably ventured into the house for their pet dog but the young girl must have come in its way.” In an earlier incident, a five-year-old was mauled to death by a big cat in Jeolikote, Nainital. The incident took place on Tuesday (November 16), a day before the girl's fifth birthday. Following the incident, the forest department installed cages in the area and declared the leopard a ‘man-eater’. The exercise bore result as an adult female big cat on Thursday morning walked into the cage set up by the forest department in Jeolikote, a town around 15 km from Nainital. However, forest officials are unsure whether the captured feline is the man-eater. DFO Biju Lal TR told TOI, “We will conduct the DNA and pregnancy test of the leopard. As of now, we cannot ascertain if this is the same leopard that was involved in the killing of the minor girl.” He also said that a compensation of Rs 3 lakh has already been given to the bereaved family and the remaining Rs 1 lakh will be paid soon. “The trapped big cat is being given medical attention as she has an injury on her paws. Meanwhile, we have increased patrolling in the area to prevent more such incidents,” the DFO added. According to wildlife experts, the incidents of leopards entering human habitations for easy prey increase in winters when they struggle to find food and water in forests. Consequently, sightings of leopards have become a routine affair in Rishikesh, Pithoragarh, Almora, Haridwar and Nainital districts. A range officer from the Garhwal region, requesting anonymity, told TOI that defragmentation of forests is also pushing these wild animals to venture into human habitations. This year, about one-and-a-half dozen people have already lost their lives to leopard attacks in Uttarakhand.

Babies born before 37-week gestation, at least three weeks earlier than the expected date of delivery, are termed premature babies. “More than three-quarters of premature babies can be saved with feasible and cost-effective care. Care of the newborns, delivered preterm, includes essential newborn care for all babies, including thermal care, breastfeeding, infection prevention and neonatal resuscitation,” said Dr Aparna C, clinical director, neonatology and senior consultant neonatalology and paediatrics, KIMS Cuddles. Though there might be no obvious cause for premature birth, often there are common risk factors. “Some risk factors include having a previous premature birth and being pregnant with multiples. Complications associated with premature birth include immature lungs, difficulty regulating body temperature, poor feeding and slow weight gain,” said Dr M Niharika, consultant fertility specialist, Kamineni Fertility Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/interventions-and-care-key-to-save-preterm-babies-experts/articleshow/87788066.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: For 1 bottle of liquor, 70% of what you pay is tax||HYDERABAD: While diesel and petrol have a significant VAT component as part of the price, liquor prices have climbed four times since the state formation, resulting in a substantial amount of taxes on each bottle. According to an estimate, 70% of the price of a liquor bottle is tax, which is paid to the state. For the same reason, the state government earned Rs 54,000 crore in the last two years of the liquor policy, which is about to be completed. For example, the manufacturing cost of 650 ml beer is approximately Rs 22, but it is sold to consumers for Rs 140. The state government receives the lion’s share of the Rs 99, with the remainder going to the retailers as a margin. “The prices of inexpensive booze include 80 % taxes, while branded liquor includes 70% taxes, as a result, there is a gap of at least Rs 40 to Rs 50 when compared to the pricing of liquor in neighbouring Karnataka,” sources added. The state government got Rs 54, 583 crore in revenue from liquor sales in the previous policy’s two years, along with Rs 38, 200 crore in tax revenue, and another Rs 3,000 crore in application and licence fees. Since the state formation in 2014, taxes have been raised four times. Rates were raised by 8% in 2015, 10% in 2017, and 20% in December of 2019, with the state government imposing a Covid- 19 cess of 22%. Other states have withdrawn their Covid- 19 cess, but it remains in some form in other kinds of taxation in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-1-bottle-of-liquor-70of-what-you-pay-is-tax/articleshow/87788060.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Farmers said they can’t go for alternate crops such as pulses or vegetables as monkeys would destroy them. Hundreds of monkeys ravage any crop that is grown in Poachampally with calls to the forest department and local authorities falling on deaf ears. “If not paddy, what else should I cultivate? Monkeys are going to destroy everything and I am going to be left with nothing in the end,” Bikshapathi C, a 75-year-old farmer told TOI. He said protecting paddy for the monkeys itself is a herculean task and added that vegetables, corn, or pulses would not survive the monkey menace. “The monkeys will eat a part of the vegetable and will throw the rest,” he added. Many farmers said that they are yet to cultivate the land this time. Almost all farmers in Pochampally village that TOI met at the market said they would rather grow think it is better to not grow anything at all instead of opting for alternate crops. They said that the water too is not suitable to grow vegetables or pulses as it comes from the Musi river. “Using them for growing vegetables can be hazardous,” said Ram Goud, another farmer. With the state not yet procuring paddy from them, the farmers said that they don’t have the required capital to cultivate now. “I have decided not to cultivate my two-and-half acres of land this time. Growing anything else will not be feasible. Instead, I will start selling vegetables in the market. I will at least earn Rs 150 to Rs 200 every day,” said Lakshmi G, a farmer, who lost her husband five months back. The farmers said that it would cost them about Rs 20, 000 to cultivate an acre of land. Another farmer Lalitha G, who has 2 acres of land and has taken another five on rent, said that there is water on land 24*7. “If we try to grow vegetables, they get spoiled because of the presence of water throughout the day and night. This land is only suitable for paddy,” she added. An official from the agriculture department said that monkey menace is not just limited to Pochampally and that farmers should take extra care to produce alternate crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monkey-menace-forces-ryots-to-stay-away-from-other-crops/articleshow/87788081.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad professor opens new chapter on world of flexible electronics||HYDERABAD: A professor from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has written a textbook on flexible electronics, which he claims to be the first such book in the world. While one can find edited books or collated book chapters on specific topics of ‘flexible electronics’ written by different research groups or individuals, Aftab Hussain, principal investigator of the PATrIoT (Processes Architecture and Technologies Research in IoT) lab at IIIT-H, discovered a void in electronics literature with the lack books documenting it from start to finish, when he kick-started a course on flexible electronics at IIIT-H in 2018. “Book chapter collections are a good compilation of the current state-of-the-art in a specific area and are definitely very valuable but they are not a substitute for textbooks,” he said. Having to design and structure a course from scratch based on all his years of training and research in the area, Hussain realised that an old-fashioned textbook could be written following the same structure. His dedicated efforts over 2 years have now resulted in a 19-chapter first look at the world of flexible electronics. Divided into five parts, the textbook titled ‘Introduction to Flexible Electronics’ covers topics from a simple introduction to why things are flexible to the materials and their properties that make up all electronic devices. The final chapter also provides a sneak-peek into another emerging world of stretchable electronics. With the primary target audience being senior undergraduates or graduates in electrical engineering, electronics, material sciences, chemistry and communication engineering, the professor’s textbook aims to be an easy read. “This style is by design because the other edited book chapters are very technical and detailed, making them a heavy read. It is nice of course to read such detailed research if you are a PhD student but as an introduction to the field or as a course reference, there was nothing out there so that’s why I kept it extremely simple,” said Hussain, adding that it has been specifically designed to help educators in developing a course in flexible electronics. “My wish is that a lot of faculty in India and abroad use this book to structure their curriculum around it and use the exercises in it to set semester-end exam papers so that their students can refer to it as a textbook,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-professor-opens-new-chapter-on-world-of-flexible-electronics/articleshow/87788083.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

After construction of toilets in every household under Swachh Bharat Mission to make villages ODF, a new component — Plastic Waste Management (PWM) — under ODF plus scheme of Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G), is being implemented in Uttar Pradesh since plastic waste and polythene are a menace in villages too. It has been a month and a half since the villages chosen under the first phase of ODF + scheme are getting their plastic waste collected at a point from where it is sent for recycling and reuse. About 38 villages in Hardoi are implementing PWM. State IEC consultant, SBM-G, panchayati raj department (PRD), Sanjay Singh Chauhan said, “The department has appointed Swachhta Sainiks who collect plastic from households and dump it in the plastic bank, which consists of an iron mesh within which the waste is stored.” The department has made a provision of Rs 16 lakh to set up a collection centre in every block to store the plastic waste from where it is dispatched to recycling units. One-fifth of the villages will be covered in the first year of the ODF+ scheme for PWM and other components. The ODF scheme launched in 2014 to construct toilets in every household concluded in 2019, after which Centre launched ODF+ and ODF++ having more components including solid waste management (SWM) and liquid waste management (LWM). ODF+ villages make toilets sustainable by constantly monitoring their maintenance, use and covering the new emerging families under the scheme. ODF++ villages also ensure safe collection, conveyance, treatment, disposal of faecal sludge and sewage besides proper maintenance of toilets. “We also inform villagers about the hazards of plastic, its proper disposal and motivate them by telling its benefits,” said Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/villagers-take-cue-from-odf-dispose-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/87788723.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Delhi||Clean Yamuna: Not lacking for effort, Delhi has spent over Rs 1,500 crore, but cleanup battle is far from won||NEW DELHI: An analysis done by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says Delhi has already spent over Rs 1,500 crore on cleaning the Yamuna, excluding the cost of the common effluent treatment plants built in the city. CSE says this is possibly the highest amount spent on river cleaning in the country, but it has not worked as is evident from pollution data. CSE had analysed the data received from Yamuna Action Plan (YAP), which was launched to reduce the pollution load in the river with the first phase being started in 1993. In 2005, the Rs 380-crore YAP-II was sanctioned for Delhi. About 50% of this was to be used to rehabilitate 30.2km of defunct sewers by 2008. In 2006-07, Delhi Jal Board introduced its interceptor plan to lay over 60km of sewers along Najafgarh, supplementary and Shahdara drains. “This massive hardware programme, however, has not proved effective in terms of controlling pollution. An analysis of biological oxygen demand (BOD) indicates that nothing has changed in terms of pollution load in the river,” said the CSE analysis, which added that BOD load had gone up from about 129 tonnes per day in 1982-83 to over 261 tonnes per day in 2019. Explaining the issue of pollution in Yamuna, CSE said, “Delhi has already built 17 sewage treatment plants (STP), which together add up to 40% of the total installed sewage treatment capacity in India. But these plants remain grossly underutilised. The city does not have the drainage to convey all its excreta to the treatment plants. The untreated sewage from unauthorised colonies, which are unconnected to drainage, flows into open drains crisscrossing the city. But these are the same drains, flowing past colonies, in which the STPs dispose of their treated effluent. Hence, the illegal unconnected waste of the majority is being mixed with treated waste of the minority.” The report said the Yamuna could be cleaned when all sewage in the city was treated. It would require providing drainage to all colonies and sewage treatment for all. As Yamuna’s water quality could improve if there was more water for dilution of waste, CSE said, “Delhi can demand more water from Haryana, but this will be difficult. The second option is that Delhi can begin to reduce its own water demand and build harvesting for capturing rainwater for discharge in the lean season, so that it can allow water to flow in the river.” Sushmita Sengupta, senior programme manager, water and sanitation programme, CSE, said, “The treated effluent should not be put back into the same open drain that carries the untreated waste of the majority. We spend huge money first pumping sewage long distances for treatment and then waste this effort by dumping the cleaned water in unclean drains.” Among other measures suggested by CSE included treating sewage directly in open drains, building STPs close to the river banks to treat whatever waste remained in the drains and recycling and reusing treated waste to reduce the cost of pumping. The report also suggested treating all sewage by intercepting from open drains, not by building interceptors on existing drains and pumping waste to existing STPs. Yamuna conservationists said the river’s water quality had not seen much change. Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said, “Over the years, the Yamuna has gone from bad to worse. The only improvement seen in the Yamuna was in April 2020 due to the lockdown when industrial pollution was zero and there was good flow in the river. Yamuna then spoke what it actually required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-lacking-for-effort-delhi-has-spent-over-rs-1500cr-but-cleanup-battle-is-far-from-won/articleshow/87788098.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Taking to reporters after presenting a memorandum on the state’s paddy procurement issue at the agriculture commissioner’s office here, Revanth accused both the governments of defrauding farmers. “Would anyone sit on a dharna with air-conditioning, all comforts and large-scale arrangements? We were waiting to hear the chief minister’s speech on the paddy procurement issue,” he said. He said if any leader or minister was concerned about safeguarding the interests of farmers, they should first go to the fields instead of sitting on dharnas. “Or they should go to families of farmers who ended their lives,” he said. “PM Narendra Modi and KCR are working for a few business magnates,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-t-playing-with-farmers-lives/articleshow/87788092.cms||---

Scores of them, travel agencies say, have started queuing up to book themselves a place at the Qatar 2022 football world cup — scheduled to kick off on November 21, next year. “At the moment, counters have opened only for corporate bookings. They are most expensive and can go up to US $10,000 to US $15,000 (between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 11 lakh approx). But there are takers even for these packages,” said Suresh Kumar who is curating a trip for a gang of footfall enthusiasts from the city for 2022. According to him, the hot picks this season are the desert and cruise packages that will give visitors a chance to either stay in tents (in the desert) or luxury rooms on the cruise, after watching their favourite teams face off on the field. “There is a significant population from Hyderabad that goes for every football world cup. During the last one in Russia too, we had booked a huge group of 20 to 25 people. And most of them had opted for matches in the semi-final stages, with some staying back till the finals,” Kumar said, adding how the high cost of the experience is rarely a deterrent. Indranil Chowdhuri whose travel consultancy, Travel with Neel, is also set to take a team of people from Hyderabad, and other cities of India, to Qatar next November-December. “There is great demand this time also because people realise that this is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity for them to watch a football world cup at a venue that is so close to home. Right from the league matches right up to the semis and finals — it starts from $100 and $300 or more per match — there’s sure to be a rush for every game,” said Chowdhuri who himself has attended three FIFA tournaments so far. He has four confirmed travellers on board and is certain that the numbers will go up over the next few months. Also in talks with his agent is Mithilesh G, a businessman from Hyderabad who is hoping to have a ‘boys’ week out’ with his friends in Qatar. “Much like Russia, this time too we have decided to go during the semi-finals and come back after the final game. This is a ritual with us friends — about seven or eight of them — and we go irrespective of which team makes it how far,” the Brazil fan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-destination-qatar-for-hyderabadis-in-2022/articleshow/87788085.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The police are now investigating about the funding channel and also if the money was also used for anti-national activities. The entire racket got exposed after a converted man returned to his own faith and also filed a complaint about mass conversion of 100 people of 37 families of Kankaria village of Bharuch. Aamod police registered an offence and arrested four accused, namely Abdul Aziz Patel aka Ajit Chaganbhai Vasava, Yusuf Jivanbhai Patel aka Mahendra Jivanbhai Vasava, Ayub Barkatbhai Patel aka Raman Barkatbhai Vasava, and Ibrahim Punabhai Patel aka Jitu Punabhai Vasava. All the accused are residents of Kankaria village. The local court granted police five days custody of the accused for questioning. According to the cops, the four accused are small fries in the racket while the big fish are the smokescreen. Cops are now trying to identify other suspects who may have helped the racketeers directly or indirectly, said an official. All the four accused too have been converted and are not cooperating with the investigators, cops added. Police team will visit Surat According to the police, the four acused had made fake Aadhaar cards and other legal documents of converted villagers in Surat.

The daily routine of farmers now includes paying a visit to the ground where their paddy heaps are waiting to be weighed and see if there is any official who could answer when would the government procures paddy. They said that due to rains the crop is getting damaged and they are incurring additional expenses to store paddy for a longer duration. “I am among the first few to bring my paddy here. Every day, I come here and see if any official came here to weigh my produce. The crop is getting damaged, we can see small saplings growing in the paddy because of rains,” said a 66-year-old farmer, who is waiting for the government to procure paddy grown in his 4 acres of land. According to farmers in Pochampally, only in this market, there are 370 heaps of paddy waiting to be weighed and procured. “Every year, as soon as 50 to 60 farmers shift their produce to the market, the officials used to come and start weighing. Now, there is no one even to give us information,” said Bikshapathi C, who has 3 acres of land.

---||Lucknow||Nadda election blitz from Yogi backyard||Lucknow: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah setting the tone for BJP’s election campaign in the build-up to forthcoming state elections from the politically crucial east UP region, it’s the turn of BJP national president J P Nadda to set party’s gargantuan poll machine rolling in Purvanchal from the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath — Gorakhpur. The BJP boss is scheduled to reach Gorakhpur on November 22 to hold a meeting with booth-level presidents from 10 districts of east UP, including Mau, Azamgarh, Ballia, Deoria, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, Basti and Siddharthnagar. Sources said, around 27,000 booth-level functionaries, assembly seat conveners and divisional in-charges have been asked to attend the crucial meeting, which could potentially lay a formal template of BJP’s electoral campaign to take on political rivals. All top BJP organisational leaders, including party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh, UP election in charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, CM Yogi, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal are expected to attend the meeting. BJP’s Gorakhpur president Yudhistir Singh Saithwar told TOI the party chief is expected to hold a review of booth-level activity undertaken in past few months. “The attestation of booth-level committees that forms the basic unit of the party’s organisational is likely to be assessed by the party chief. He will give further directions before the party scales up its grassroots electoral spade work,” a senior BJP leader said. Nadda reaching Gorakhpur, the political nerve centre of Purvanchal, attains significance even as the Opposition, mainly the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party flexes muscle to take on the saffron outfit, especially in the east UP region. BJP also faces the fractious ally turned rival, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has allied “unconditionally” with the SP to sabotage BJP’s bid to return to power. Ostensibly concentrated in the east UP region, the Rajbhar community is being wooed by both BJP and SP as part of their electoral calculations. BJP sources said, the party plans to set out on a strategic note from east UP before launching a full-fledged campaign across the state. This will include organising ‘yatras’ in different organisational regions in coming days. BJP’s deft attempt to consolidate its position in east UP comes in the backdrop of the party’s worries in the restive west UP region, which remained affected by the farmer stir against the three new farm laws of the Centre. The Lakhimpur violence, which saw the killing of eight persons including four farmers, has only added to the worries of the BJP. Sources said the party was in no mood to relent and sought to chart out an adept strategy to take on the opposition which has been harping on a potential anti-incumbency against the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-election-blitz-from-yogi-backyard/articleshow/87788740.cms||Pankaj Shah

On Wednesday, 101 fresh cases were detected by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (Harsac). With this, the total number of stubble burning cases (active fire locations) in the state has reached 6,094 since September 15. However, the number of stubble-burning cases is lower than the last year’s figure during the corresponding period. According to data provided by the agriculture department, Fatehabad has reported the maximum number of 1,299 cases so far, followed by Kaithal (1137), Karnal (935), Jind (757), Kurukshetra (535), Sirsa (349), Ambala (297), Panipat (192), Yamunanagar (144), Sonipat (153), Hisar (138) and Palwal (113). However, no farm fire cases have been reported from Charkhi Dadri, Gurugram, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Sirsa, Panchkula, and Rewari district so far. As per Haryana agriculture department, till November 14, it has recovered Rs 49.37 lakh fine from 2379 erring farmers and got 94 FIRs registered in the state. On the other hand, the air quality of 19 cities and towns in Haryana remained worse on Thursday. According to the Central Pollution Control Bureau (CPCB), the AQI level in 10 cities — Hisar (365), Rohtak (351), Faridabad 349, Bahadurgarh (341), Panipat (340), Manesar (330), Gurugram (323), Jind (310), Narnaul (305), Fatehabad (303)— was in ‘very poor’ category. Similarly, Karnal (294), Bhiwani (292), Yamunanagar (292) Ambala (288), Dharuhera (282), Kurukshetra (275), Ballabgarh (260), Kaithal (260), Sirsa (256), which falls in the “poor” category. Govt issues appeal The Haryana government has appealed to the farmers of the state to refrain from stubble burning as it leads to pollution, thereby increasing the risk of respiratory diseases and cancer. Not only this, the biological quality of the soil is also affected by it. Sharing information in this regard, an official spokesperson of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare said that 50 to 80 per cent subsidy is given by the state government on Crop Residue Management machinery. He said that if any person burns stubble in the fields, then he can be booked Under Section 188 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-hefty-fines-and-close-to-100-firs-crop-burning-cases-rising-across-haryana/articleshow/87788743.cms||---

The CM reached Karnal on late Thursday evening. Reply to a question about the allegation levelled by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that stubble burning in the neighbouring states was causing air pollution in Delhi, Khattar said the allegations were baseless as only accusing farmers for the crisis was not justified. Khattar said," I don’t deny that the straw burning was adding to the air pollution, but there are several other factors, including emission from vehicles and industry and construction activities, also responsible for the air pollution. Even the Supreme Court has also observed the same”. Khattar claimed that with the efforts of Haryana government, farm fire incidents had come down as compared to last year. The chief minister added that the decision on odd-even would be taken on Friday. He added that the government had introduced several schemes to encourage farmers for stubble management. Under the schemes, Rs 1,000 per acre for making bales and subsidy for machinery was also being provided to the farmers, the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/decision-on-odd-even-today-khattar/articleshow/87788741.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Not scared of cases, time for another movement against Centre, says K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said that he was not scared of cases as claimed by some BJP leaders at the TRS’ ‘Maha Dharna’ at Indira Park on Thursday. The fight was for farmers and not for power or political gain, the CM said, adding that he was not afraid of anything, indirectly mocking BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay’s remark that he (KCR) would soon know fear. Warning that there was no party like TRS when it came to fighting spirit, the CM said that the time had come for another movement against the Centre. The TRS, once it begins a fight, would take it to its logical end, the CM thundered at the ‘Maha Dharna’. “During the Telangana movement, TRS leaders quit their posts as ministers, MPs and MLAs, and faced bypolls for the cause of statehood. KCR is not scared of anything or anybody. We are asking the Centre to react to people’s and farmers’ issues. We will play politics later,” KCR said. The CM said the Centre has to clear stand on paddy procurement as farmers should not face difficulty after rabi season. He also appealed to farmers to not go for paddy and instead sow other crops suggested by agriculture officials. “I understand it is difficult to switch to other crops immediately, but it is essential,” he said. Earlier, ministers S Niranjan Reddy, G Jagadish Reddy, party secretary general K Keshava Rao, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, whip Gongidi Sunitha also spoke at the dharna. They said the fight was not between TRS and BJP or political, but it was between state and the Centre over farmers’ issue. “Telangana government brought back the agriculture sector on track by providing free power, investments support such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bheema, waiver of agriculture loans and above all irrigation. But policies of the BJP government has left the farming sector in doldrums over paddy issue,” Niranjan Reddy said. BJP chief Sanjay and said: “State government set up procurement centres and procured 11 lakh MTs of paddy in kharif season. Why is Sanjay creating problems? Farmers have taught him a lesson.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-scared-of-cases-time-for-anothermovement-against-centre-says-kcr/articleshow/87788100.cms||Koride Mahesh

The four-lane road will connect to narrow village roads. Near the police station and the church, two buses cannot pass at the same time. There are houses that abut the road,” said advocate Godfrey Pimenta who represents villagers.

ATS sleuths also recovered cables, routers, laptops, and phone lines of a telecom company from the location. ATS officials said Mishra had been running the racket for the past two months and was diverting internet-based international phone calls, causing loss of crores of rupees to the government. The racket was busted in a joint operation with the department of telecom. The accused was arrested on inputs from a private telecom operator. The firm had informed authorities about the illegal exchange based on the inputs from its fraud management team. Sources in ATS said the company had provided a phone connection in the name of a woman hailing from Vadodara, Gujarat, for setting up a call centre for an IT firm. The telecom firm’s fraud management team found that this connection was being used for connecting international calls and diverting them to phone numbers in India as domestic calls. Sources in Anti-Terrorist Squad said Mishra seems to be a cog in the wheels and the ATS is hunting for the mastermind of the racket. Officials said Mishra, who hails from Purnia district of Bihar, was arrested on the charges of  cheating, criminal conspiracy, and provisions of the Indian Telephone Act 1885.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-busts-intl-call-routing-racket-1-nabbed/articleshow/87788760.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||FCI buying 20LMT of additional parboiled rice from Telangana: Centre||HYDERABAD: On a day when CM K Chandrasekhar Rao went all out on the BJP on the paddy procurement issue, the Centre clarified that it had already agreed to procure 24.75 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of parboiled rice from the 2021 rabi crop and the rest as raw rice. According to official sources in the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, the FCI currently has a stock of 46.28 LMT of parboiled rice and another 32.73 LMT is on the way. “By the time the season ends, the total stock of parboiled rice with the FCI will be around 79 LMT. About 20 LMT of parboiled rice is consumed annually from the FCI stock in parboiled rice-deficit states. It will approximately take four years to liquidate the parboiled rice stock available with the FCI,” sources said. Officials said that delivery of an additional 20 LMT of parboiled rice — in addition to the previously sanctioned 24.75 LMT of rice from the 2020-21 paddy — was permitted at the request of the Telangana government. Officials said Telangana consumes just raw rice but generates more parboiled rice, which must eventually be sent to parboiled rice-deficient states.Volume of its exports has declined overtime because of increase in output in parboiled rice-consuming states. Official sources said that it was agreed during a meeting held in August that Telangana’s procurement of estimate for kharif was 40 LMT rice, which was 22.47% more than previous year’s kharif procurement. However, in a letter to PM Narendra Modi, KCR had requested the Centre to procure 90 LMT of rice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fci-buying-20lmt-of-additionalparboiled-rice-from-t-centre/articleshow/87788106.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The scheme also covers those from other states and countries. The scheme – Nammai Kaakkum 48 (saving our lives in 48 hours) — announced on Thursday will be offered to all road accident victims for a year. It will be dovetailed with the Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme next year after review. Officials said the scheme will cover all those who don’t have insurance. The state has set aside Rs 50 crore for the first phase of implementation of the ‘Innuyir Kaappom Thittam’ (saving precious lives). “The procedures performed under the new scheme are not included in the current state insurance scheme,” said a senior official. After chief minister MK Stalin‘s review meeting on road safety with ministers and officials on Thursday, the government announced a comprehensive policy including legislation of emergency medical services and setting up a road safety authority. The state will frame a Medical Emergencies Act that will focus on five elements -- emergency response, rescue and resuscitation, damage control surgeries, bring people back to normalcy and rehabilitation. “The idea is to empower more people to help road accident victims, create awareness, set protocols and bring in standard of care. We will create emergency codes and detail things to be done in the act,” the official said. The state would involve students from schools, colleges, NGOs, and members of the public to convert road safety into a people’s movement, it said. The state will also set up a road safety authority that will offer administrative and financial support to implement road safety policies, maintain registry, research on causes for prevention of accidents and monitor road design and quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-accident-victims-to-get-free-care-in-609-govt-pvt-hosps/articleshow/87788108.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Farmers can’t be satisfied until Congress government implements full loan waiver, says Sukhbir Singh Badal||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Thursday that farmers as well as farm organisations can never be satisfied until the Congress government implements the promised full farm loan waiver. Sukhbir was speaking at a function in which Congress intellectual cell president Anish Sidana joined the SAD along with his team. The SAD president appointed him his political advisor for urban areas. Launching an attack on the chief minister, Sukhbir accused Channi of being the ‘biggest illegal coloniser’ in the state and responsible for the mushrooming of illegal colonies in the Kharar-Ropar belt besides holding control over the sand mining business in the area. “Chief minister was known to patronise illegal colonies as well as the sand mafia. This is the reason why Channi has played a farce on the people in the name of reducing sand prices,” alleged Sukhbir. People are not getting sand at Rs 5 per cubic feet as announced by the chief minister anywhere, but the state exchequer has lost Rs 50 crore advertising this falsehood, he added. He said the chief minister had also come up with false claims about making petroleum prices cheapest in the region and had also tried to hoodwink Punjabis by reducing power tariff by Rs 3 per unit till March 31. On the ongoing STF report case in the high court, Sukhbir said, “No one is stopping the Punjab government from nabbing the drug lords.” He said it was strange that instead of arresting the drug lords, the Congress government was politicising the issue in the same manner as it had done in the sacrilege case. He also challenged the state government to present a single shred of evidence against him in the sacrilege case. “The chief minister, home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and DGP IPS Sahota are liable to be held to account under Section 120 (b) for hatching a criminal conspiracy to frame me in a false case which has been exposed by the SAD.” On cancellation of bus permits of his transport company, Sukhbir said they had been cancelled even without issuing any notice to it. “We do not owe even a single rupee in taxes to the Punjab government. In direct contrast, companies of Congress leaders are defaulters, but are not being proceeded against,” said Sukbir, adding that the state also owes Rs 280 crore in taxes from buses of the state transport undertaking. The SAD president said he was surprised after the farmer organisations expressed satisfaction on meeting the Punjab chief minister on Wednesday. Sukkhbir said farmers expected the Kisan organisations to take up the issue of extreme shortage and black marketing of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser with the chief minister in their meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-cant-be-satisfied-until-cong-govt-implements-full-loan-waiver/articleshow/87788759.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 arrested without Delhi cops in loop, UP govt forms SIT||NEW DELHI: The Uttar Pradesh Police Wednesday told Delhi High Court that it has formed a special investigative team (SIT) to look into the arrest of two city residents by them without intimation of local police. The high court was also informed that the two family members of a boy who married a girl against her family’s wishes, have also been released and a closure report filed. The counsel for UP government submitted that the SHO concerned and the investigating officer involved in the incident have been suspended. “State (of Uttar Pradesh) has taken it very seriously. A DSP rank officer is heading the SIT. We will ensure justice is done. All wrongs will be inquired into at length,” the counsel told the court. Justice Mukta Gupta then asked UP Police to file a status report based on the SIT’s report and observed that when the FIR itself disclosed that the girl in question was a major, the officers concerned should have first recorded her statement to ascertain her will. “The fact is that the FIR says she is a major. First thing, you will record the statement of the girl. When the girl is a major and has gone on her own free will, where is the offence made out?” Justice Gupta asked. “I have seen the case diaries. I know what is there, what is the investigation carried out. I don’t want to interfere but if the petitioner’s version is correct (that the family members were arrested from Delhi by UP Police), it is very serious and the arrest is shown at some other place. What is your investigation on that?” the court asked UP Police and posted the matter for further hearing on January 11. The court was hearing a case where a couple had approached it saying they married of their own volition in July, against the wishes of the girl’s family and were now getting repeated threats from them. The petitioner also claimed that the father and brother of the boy were taken away by UP cops and for more than one month and their whereabouts were not known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-arrested-without-delhi-cops-in-loop-up-govt-forms-sit/articleshow/87788134.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Pay Rs 50,000 for seeking adjournment: Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of Telangana high court, who commenced hearing in a batch of quash pleas filed by several accused in the quid pro quo case, said on Thursday that advocates or their clients who seek adjournment on the day their case was listed for hearing will have to pay Rs 50,000 towards costs. “This amount will go to the high court legal services authority,” the judge made this observation after coming across requests from a few advocates who sought adjournment of their case to some other day. Dozens of accused in the 11 chargesheets of the quid pro quo case have filed pleas seeking to discharge them from CBI and ED cases or to quash the case against them. All of them have now come before Justice Bhuyan, who may hear them by allotting some time. Judge reminded advocates that it was only after everyone agreed to argue their cases, the matters were listed and it will not be fair on the part of some advocates to seek adjournment citing various reasons. While some advocates contended they were of the view that the court may follow the old order where their cases were lying at the bottom of the list, some cited personal reasons. The judge, however, made it clear to all that they have to argue on the day their cases are listed. The judge also brushed aside the contention that the CBI has not filed its counter in some of the pleas. “No need of counters in quash pleas,” he said. Later, the judge began hearing in the Vanpic case. Senior counsel Vinod Kumar Deshpande argued the case of former IRAS officer KV Brahmananda Reddy, who was made an accused in the Vanpic chargesheet filed by the CBI in 2013. He came on a deputation to AP in 2012 and was made special secretary in the infrastructure and investments department of the state, he said.  Case was adjourned to November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-rs-50k-for-seeking-adjournment-t-hc/articleshow/87788123.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Thampy Kurien of Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union said this may reduce operational and maintenance costs by over 50%. He demanded that the government expedite setting up of electric battery swapping facilities at various locations along feeder routes in suburbs. “We are willing to cooperate with the government in the experimental run of electric autos on shared routes in the suburbs of Mumbai,” Kurien added. The city has 2.3 lakh autos of which several are on 100 share routes in the eastern and western suburbs. For auto as well as Kaali Peeli taxi drivers, CNG was now “more expensive” than what it was in January this year. CNG rate increased by around Rs 10 per kg in just nine months of 2021, escalating the operational expenses for cab owners by 20% despite getting a fare hike, a driver said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/share-autos-willing-to-go-electric-if-govt-helps-in-mumbai-union/articleshow/87790046.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers’ loans increased to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, says AAP||CHANDIGARH: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Thursday that the Congress government had promised in writing in 2017 to waive the entire loan of about Rs 90,000 crore of the farmers and farm labourers, but now the debt had increased to nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore. It included loans raised from government, cooperative and private banks, as well as, from the unorganized sector, it added. Leader of opposition (LoP) in Punjab legislative assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said for this promise, forms were also filled by farmers and labourers but as soon as the government was formed, the Congress showed its real “deceit”. If the Congress government had released Rs 300 crore of subsidies on time, it would have been in a position to say to have done at least a bit to save agriculture. The AAP leader said since SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, being then Union minister, had a role to play in all three agriculture laws passed in Parliament, the people of Punjab would teach a lesson to the Badal family in the upcoming assembly elections. Taking a dig at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Cheema asked whether he would waive the entire loan of farmers. “If you do, then declare its time limit and the entire loan of the farmers and labourers should be waived before the code of conduct is in force,” the LoP said. Reacting on withdrawal of cases against farmers for stubble burning, Cheema asked if Punjab government did not have the solution to stubble burning, should a case be registered against it as well. On the compensation amount of Rs 17,000 per acre to the farmers for cottomn crop damaged by pink bollworm, AAP said that the Congress government could not escape the questions of the farmers. Was the compensate amount enough when farmers had spent anything from Rs 60,000 to 70,000 per acre to grow the crop that was damaged by the bollwarm pest, he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/loan-of-punjab-farmers-has-increased-to-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-aap/articleshow/87788775.cms||---

Rajewal was in Karnal on Thursday to record his statement before the oneman commission formed of inquiry to probe the sequence of events that led to police lathi-charge at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal on August 28. Rajewal said, “Politics is not an agenda of Morcha. SKM leaders had requested him that he should not hold meetings in poll-bound state Punjab, but to no avail. Hence, we have decided to oppose Charuni in Punjab if he holds any political programme there. We will also show black flag to him like other political leaders.” Asked about agitation, Rajewal claimed that the agitation was going in the right direction and it will be successful and the government will have to accept their demand. Reply to a question about SKM’s proposed protest march from Ambala to Tikri on November 24, Rajewal said that the decision is being reviewed and the final decision is pending. The two senior leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, GurnamSingh Charuni and Balbir Singh Rajewal, have openly come against each other as a day before Charuni, without naming anyone, had said that Punjab farmer leaders were jealous of his increasing popularity in their state. Now, Rajewal openly said that they would oppose Gurnam Singh Charuni in Punjab due to his political motive. However, he denied any rift in the morcha and said all is good. When asked about his statement before the commission, the SKM leader said that he told the commission that he was not present at Karnal when the lathicharge took place. But he was in Karnal on the day of the mini secretariat was gheraod. He said that he demanded strict action against the then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who was seen in a video ordering the cops to smash heads of protesters on August 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-show-black-flags-to-charuni-in-punjab-rajewal/articleshow/87788780.cms||---

Two bridges meant to connect Western Express Highway with Eastern Express Highway will be built and an administrative process for it is in the final stages. Works on the challenging part — the tunnel to go below the National Park — will be taken up later. While one bridge will be built ahead of Oberoi mall towards Film City, the other would be built at Khindipada (Bhandup), connecting the tunnel to the Eastern Express Highway. A senior official from the civic bridges department said, “The inauguration of the work for the two flyovers that will connect the tunnel may take place very soon as the proposal has already been sent for administrative approval. Once construction begins, we even plan to push for the tunnelling works.” GMLR will pass under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), affecting about 19.43 hectares of the park. The loss of plantation was proposed to be compensated by the BMC in villages near Tadoba by acquiring a similar-sized plots. The total end-to-end length of the road starting from Western Express Highway in Goregaon up to Eastern Express Highway in Mulund is proposed to be over 12 km. The road will have two tunnels and the SGNP tunnel is expected to be 4.7 km in length. Meanwhile, a box tunnel through Film City in Goregaon has also been proposed which would be 1.6 km. The initial estimated cost of the GMLR project was pegged at Rs 4,700 crore which has now increased to over Rs 6,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-eye-on-polls-bmc-races-to-initiate-gmlr-project-work/articleshow/87790048.cms||Richa Pinto

While Malik claimed that he has submitted all the relevant documents to prove that Sameer is Muslim before the Bombay high court in a defamation suit filed by his father ‘Dawood’ Wankhede, Sameer’s wife Kranti Redkar Wankhede hit back, saying there seems to be a planned effort to malign Sameer’s image. As far as Sameer’s certificates are concerned, certain errors were made, but were later rectified by Dnyandev Wankhede with all legal formalities in 1989. “All along, Sameer Wankhede was claiming that he is scheduled caste and not Muslim. We have procured his school leaving certificate and school admission form, where it has been mentioned that his religion is Muslim and his father’s name is Dawood Wankhede. From the documents, it appears he is Muslim and not scheduled caste. Under such circumstances, all the benefits taken by him on the grounds that he is scheduled caste should be withdrawn forthwith,” said Malik. Another member of Wankhede’s family accused Malik of selectively leaking documents. When Sameer was being admitted to school, his mother had made certain errors. When they were brought to the notice of Wankhede’s father, they were legally rectified, the person said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sparring-between-parties-continues-outside-court/articleshow/87789339.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The yatra, that started from Ghazipur at 12:30 on Wednesday afternoon, concluded before daybreak (around 4am) on Thursday. Moved by the crowds waiting to welcome him on either side of the Expressway even after dark till beyond midnight, Akhilesh tweeted a photograph of himself waving at the crowds atop his Vijay Rath with thousands of people standing around. “But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep … ,” he wrote under the photograph that he tweeted around 1am. Hours later he tweeted again: “ … It’s now time for a new dawn, time for change” apparently referring to the upcoming assembly polls in UP. But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep…. https://t.co/OuxeuoGBnJ— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) 1637177473000Emboldened by the response to the Vijay Yatra on the expressway, which SP described as “unprecedented”, the former UP CM announced that more such yatras will be undertaken and the process will be repeated till SP government is formed in UP. “The historic response and support extended all along the Expressway from the people of Purvanchal and workers, office bearers and leaders of Samajwadi Party and alliance partners who stood by throughout the day and even at night – I heartfelt thank you to all,” Akhilesh tweeted in Hindi. He said the way people lined up all along the Expressway to express their support to SP was a befitting reply to ruling BJP’s move to remove the word Samajwadi from the name of the Expressway. SP chief said the expressway was originally named “Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway”, but the ruling BJP dropped the word “Samajwadi” from it. Now people lined up the entire length of the Expressway to express their support to the Vijay Yatra and have proved that “Samajwadi” was wrongly dropped from the name, Akhilesh said. Vijay Yatra that started from Ghazipur passed through Mau, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Ambedkarnagar, Sultanur, Amethi, Ayodhya and Barabanki before reaching Lucknow around 4:30am on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sps-vijay-yatra-ends-at-dawn-miles-to-go-tweets-akhilesh/articleshow/87788788.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The EPCC members across the country were demanding an amendment in the EPS 1995 Act to pave way for increasing their pension.The members submitted a detailed list of demands to divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Varma, collector R Vimala and divisional provident fund manager. National secretary Prakash Damle, treasurer Anil Kusare and assistant treasurer Arun Karemore were part of the delegation besides Deshmukh and Pathak.The EPCC members have appealed to the PM to take necessary action as per the recommendations of Bhagat Singh Koshyari Committee. The penisoners said they avoided inviting their members for the protests in view of Section 144 of IPC being enforced in the city in the aftermath of Amravati riots.According to them, the issue was related to 67 lakhs pensioners and 17.2 crore existing working employees.

During her speech in Chitrakoot on Wednesday, Priyanka had quoted this poem to bolster the Congress’s campaign ‘Ladki hoon lad sakti hoon’ for the 2022 UP elections for which the party has promised 40% tickets for women candidates. Reacting sharply, Upadhyay tweeted from his handle @viYogiee: “I wrote this poem for women of the country… not for your petty politics… Also, neither I support your ideology, nor have I allowed you to use my literary creation for political use.” He concluded by questioning what the nation could expect from “someone who steals a poem”. Though he later removed the main tweet, he maintained his objection. In another tweet, he said, “The message is clear… poem ‘Suno Draupadi’ is not meant for political use.” “The message of this poem written in 2012 after the Nirbhaya case is totally different from your political frustration and has a much wider meaning. I hope that no political party will make it an instrument of politics in future,” he said in another tweet, adding that the subject should not be seen as a mere controversy but of a larger issue which is protection of literary property. Congress members reacted sharply. “Use of popular poems by social and political leaders is not new. It seems that the poet was simply playing with words when writing this because by targeting a woman who voiced the sentiments in his poem to voice the larger cause of women, he has defeated the cause of his own writing. Sadly, he has brought a bad name to the poets’ fraternity who p r actise to see the larger canvas of life,” said Surendra Rajput, All India Congress Committee spokesperson. MLC Deepak Singh said, “Poet Ramdhari Singh ‘Dinkar’ was a Congress MP and his famous poem ‘Singhasan khali karo ab Janata aati hai’ was used by leaders in the Opposition in his presence.

The process started from October 1 had bought in 4.98 lakh metric tonnes, against an announced target of 70 lakh metric tonnes, and instead of the promised 4,000 procurement centres, only 1,712 were running, it alleged. “Farmers are desperately selling their paddy at significantly lower prices in the open market at around Rs 1,250 per quintal, whereas the minimum support price was Rs 19,40 per quintal. While 6,42,224 farmers have registered themselves for procurement benefits, paddy procurement from only 71,352 farmers had taken place,” it claimed, adding that BJP had said that MSP was there, MSP was continuing and MSP would remain in future but it stood exposed fully. BKU Tikait, AIKS, AIKM, AIKMS were engaged in mobilising farmers for Lucknow ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ scheduled for Monday. SKM has also asked citizens to join the dharna at Hansi SP office on Friday in large numbers. SKM said Telangana chief minister, ministers and TRS leaders were insisting on paddy procurement by the Government of India. The state government was also now vocally critical of the Centre’s farm laws. The FCI reneged on its commitment to procure parboiled rice from Telangana in a callous fashion, pushing farmers in losses now, SKM claimed. It said that in a letter on November 12, United Nation’s Special Rapporteur on Right To Food Michael Fakri presented an analysis of the farm laws and raised questions about it with the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paddy-procurement-unsatisfactory-in-up-telangana-says-skm/articleshow/87788792.cms||---

NMMC has also been urged by green activists to conserve and develop the wetland in Nerul. Navi Mumbai is blessed with the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary along the Thane coastline between Airoli and Vashi. It is visited by scores of bird lovers from across the MMR. Around 1 lakh flamingos throng this sanctuary from various parts of the country, every year. Considering the presence of so many flamingos for around seven months here, the green activists have asked to brand Navi Mumbai as a Flamingo City. “The chief minister’s response came in less than 10 minutes. We will now follow-up with the concerned government departments,” said NatConnect Foundation director B N Kumar. NatConnect also requested the Chief CM to facilitate the take over of the wetlands at NRI and TS Chanakya in Nerul by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) and then the NMMC can maintain them as wetlands with the help of the State Mangrove Cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-cm-tells-secys-to-look-into-plea-for-flamingo-city-tag-for-navi-mum/articleshow/87788833.cms||B B Nayak

Left with nearly 17,000 vaccine doses, the hospital has tied up with LIC HFL and NGO Golden Hour Foundation to fund the doses. The hospital will only provide Covishield doses and people can come for first and second shots. Till now, private hospitals have only vaccinated people living in slums for free with the help of CSR (corporate social responsibility) funding. “We will perhaps be the first in the country to roll out vaccination for people from all walks of life at no cost. It will be done with contributions from two agencies,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital. The hospital will bear the service charge of Rs 150, which means the agencies would be paying the hospital only the cost of the vaccine. “It will help us cover more people,” he said. The agencies have given Rs 50 lakh to the hospital. With paid vaccinations witnessing a drastic drop in demand since October, over 45 lakh doses are lying with private hospitals in Mumbai, Thane and Pune. Several experts have advised that the private hospitals should vaccinate for free or find CSR donors so that doses don’t get wasted or lie idle. But with an overall drop in demand for vaccination and the public sector too have abundant doses, private players are unable to find many takers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/free-vaccines-for-everyone-at-bombay-hospital-now/articleshow/87790070.cms||---

Farmers said they can’t go for alternate crops such as pulses or vegetables as monkeys would destroy them. Hundreds of monkeys ravage any crop that is grown in Poachampally with calls to the forest department and local authorities falling on deaf ears. “If not paddy, what else should I cultivate? Monkeys are going to destroy everything and I am going to be left with nothing in the end,” Bikshapathi C, a 75-year-old farmer told TOI. He said protecting paddy for the monkeys itself is a herculean task and added that vegetables, corn, or pulses would not survive the monkey menace. “The monkeys will eat a part of the vegetable and will throw the rest,” he added. Many farmers said that they are yet to cultivate the land this time. Almost all farmers in Pochampally village that TOI met at the market said they would rather grow think it is better to not grow anything at all instead of opting for alternate crops. They said that the water too is not suitable to grow vegetables or pulses as it comes from the Musi river. “Using them for growing vegetables can be hazardous,” said Ram Goud, another farmer. With the state not yet procuring paddy from them, the farmers said that they don’t have the required capital to cultivate now. “I have decided not to cultivate my two-and-half acres of land this time. Growing anything else will not be feasible. Instead, I will start selling vegetables in the market. I will at least earn Rs 150 to Rs 200 every day,” said Lakshmi G, a farmer, who lost her husband five months back. The farmers said that it would cost them about Rs 20, 000 to cultivate an acre of land. Another farmer Lalitha G, who has 2 acres of land and has taken another five on rent, said that there is water on land 24*7. “If we try to grow vegetables, they get spoiled because of the presence of water throughout the day and night. This land is only suitable for paddy,” she added. An official from the agriculture department said that monkey menace is not just limited to Pochampally and that farmers should take extra care to produce alternate crops. “It is advice from the government to go for alternate crops. If the farmers think there is no other alternative to paddy, they should be ready to explore the market to sell their produce in near future,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monkey-menace-forces-ryots-to-stay-away-from-other-crops/articleshow/87788168.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Dehradun||21 years on, asset distribution row settled by UP & Uttarakhand govts||DEHRADUN: In a crucial meeting at Lucknow on Thursday, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath resolved several asset distribution matters — pending for 21 years — between the two states. A major decision was to hand over Alaknanda hotel in Haridwar to Uttarakhand, once the construction of a new rest house of Uttar Pradesh was completed by December this year. Besides, UP has agreed to reconstruct two barrages – Banbasa and Kiccha – damaged due to heavy rains. Also, Uttar Pradesh state road transport corporation has agreed to clear dues of Rs 205 crore of Uttarakhand transport corporation.  In some other matters, 15 days’ time has been sought to arrive at a consensus. Both states have also agreed to withdraw the asset distribution cases pending in court, agreeing to mutually take a decision. “UP is like an elder brother and with the cooperation of CM Yogi Adityanath, we were successful in resolving matters pending for the past 21 years,” CM Dhami said. He further stated that soon more matters would be resolved. “The BJP government in both states has taken a positive step and it was with the cooperation of Uttar Pradesh that our efforts have fructified,” he added.  Since 2004, both states had been contesting a civil suit in the SC over the ownership rights of the Alaknanda hotel in Haridwar. In 2017, the apex court, had directed both states to resolve the issue and also pulled up the governments for “behaving in a childish manner”.  While both states had earlier agreed on the transfer, it was decided that the Alaknanda hotel would be handed over to Uttarakhand once a new tourist rest house building of Uttar Pradesh was constructed nearby. With the new tourist rest house building almost complete, possibilities are that the handover of the “old” TRH to Uttarakhand would be done in December. In the meeting, it was also decided that both states would conduct a joint survey on 5,700 hectares and 1,700 houses of Uttarakhand irrigation department to identify land and houses which would be suitable for UP irrigation department. UP has also agreed to clear Rs 90-crore dues of the forest department of Uttarakhand. The neighbouring state has approved the transfer of Kiccha bus stand land -- which is at present in the possession of UP irrigation department – to the Himalayan state.  UP has approved tourism and water sport activities in the water bodies of Dhaura, Baigul and Nanakmatta in Udham Singh Nagar district. The state has also given consent for water sport activities in the upper Ganga canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-yrs-on-asset-distribution-row-settled-by-up-ukhand-govts/articleshow/87786679.cms||Kautilya Singh

Houseowner D Rajasekar, 62 and his wife R Shanthi,57, were fast asleep on the ground floor of the house when the robbers barged in around 2am, the Ramanathapuram police said. “The miscreants, who were wearing masks and gloves, jumped over the compound wall of the house and broke open the main door to enter the house.

GSPCB has issued showcause notices to three ore beneficiation plants for functioning on the basis of “illegal permits” issued by the chief inspector of factories and boilers. Goa Foundation’s Claude Alvares had filed formal complaints on March 8 against the Vedanta beneficiation plants at Amona and Surla, and the Fomento plant at Santona, asking for their closure. Beneficiation is a process that improves the quality of the ore by removing the impurities, which results in a higher grade ore concentrate. The Union environment ministry has made it clear that such beneficiation plants cannot be granted consent to operate unless they have an environmental clearance under the EIA notification of 2006. “It has taken several months for the pollution board to act. Finally, showcause notices have been issued,” Alvares said. In the showcause notice, GSPCB member secretary Sanjeev Joglekar has directed Vedanta and Fomento to respond within seven days with reasons why the plants should not be shut. “Failure to comply with the aforesaid notice will compel the board to initiate stringent legal action,” Joglekar said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jains rush to watch life-changing biopic on Shrimad Rajchandraji||MUMBAI: It’s the wake-up show. The one for which you shower, wear clothes fit for a temple and scurry to the closest cinema. Once there, slip out your footwear, sit in padmasana and join your palms and later walk out so inspired that life takes a turn. Jains across the city have been rushing to watch a biopic on Shrimad Rajchandraji that encapsulates his life: from his very first day in school when he wowed his teachers, to the last calm moments when his soul was slowly “absorbed in true nature”. Shrimadji’s 33 years offer teachings that are central to every being. Each moment lived was filled with an acute sense of consciousness, and capturing that state of absolute awakened being makes the biopic by non-profit Bhakti Trust a Jain blockbuster. Almost all shows for November and December are booked. “We conceptualised the idea 8 years ago. It has been a long journey of 2.5 lakh manhours and over 45 hours of computing time,” said Bhairav Kothari, a CA and devout Jain who wanted to introduce the world to Shrimadji, well known as the spiritual guru of Mahatma Gandhi, and lovingly called Krupaludev for his immense compassion. “From the fast corporate life of finance, this was a project I thought I would take up after retirement,” said Kothari. But this was not to be. From the fall of Krupaludev’s muslin kurta to the clean layers of the turbans, from the magical simplicity of those times to wholeheartedness that shone in the eyes of every follower, the power of detailing overwhelms every viewer, Jain or not. “We have over 350 character models in the movie and more than 200 different modelling versions of Krupaludev were created, to match him pixel to pixel, before which we were certain about one. We took two months only to get the pagdi (turban) right. We used a lot of actual photo images, did age regression or progression. We took a lot of time and effort to recreate even the stone texturing of Idar (in Gujarat) where Krupaludev used to meditate for hours,” he said. Scooping out the vital bits, this 100-minute-biopic, with the ceremonial half-time popcorn break, takes the audience back eons ago to Vavania in Saurashtra, close to modern-day Morbi in Gujarat. The idea of the movie also underwent iterations. Starting out of a garage with a two-member team, it was initially a low-cost project to be made by zooming in and panning out paintings. A little animation was then planned. Then the entire 2D movie was scrapped and a full-blown 3D animation biopic was planned, with generous contributions of hundreds of believers who read the storyboard and felt it came with a sense of purpose for mankind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jains-rush-to-watch-life-changing-biopic-on-shrimad-rajchandraji/articleshow/87790100.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra has 2 crore doses & 2 crore population awaits 1st jab but turnout dips||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has more than 2 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine available with public centres and incidentally an almost equal number of people waiting for their first doses. Yet, there are no long queues or blocked appointments, giving rise to concerns about the state approaching vaccination saturation. The current stock of vaccines is the highest it has ever had since the drive began in January. Maharashtra has administered the second-highest vaccine doses in India (10.5 crore) after UP, immunizing 77% of its eligible population with at least one shot and 38% with both. The state’s first dose coverage, though, is marginally below the national average (81%), with over 2.1 crore people yet to take first shots. Turnout at vaccine centres started to see a slump with the start of festivals in October. In the first week of November, after hitting a rock-bottom daily average of less than 2 lakh jabs, it showed a minor rise recently. However, the daily numbers have stalled at 6 lakh to 7 lakh, of which around 55% are second doses. Nationally, too, an inertia has been observed with the average shots in the past month dropping to 18.8 lakh per day against the target of 40.8 lakh. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said a slowdown is expected. “It happens in any public health campaign,” he said. “As vaccination coverage increases, every incremental percentage point will need much harder efforts as all low hanging fruits have been plucked,” he said and assured the state continued to do reasonably well considering its heterogeneous demographics. In terms of supply, even Covaxin is in abundance now. Dr Sachin Desai, the state’s immunization officer, said the state has been assured of 40 lakh doses. “Typically, we used to receive 15-20 lakh doses of Covaxin,” he said. Besides the 2 crore doses in the public sector, the private sector is estimated to have 45 lakh-50 lakh. Dr Naveen Thacker, a paediatrician and expert on vaccination, called the slowdown an expected phenomenon once coverage hits 70-80%, but also blamed complacency. “People are perhaps no longer afraid of Covid. Also, TV debates and announcements saying the third way may be blunted or not come at all, could be emboldening people to skip vaccination,” he said, cautioning protection against Delta would need minimum 90% coverage. “We should target 100%.” Out of 35 districts, Mumbai is the only one to have achieved 100% first dose coverage. While another three districts, Pune, Bhandara and Sindhudurg have achieved more than 90% coverage. There are nine districts in the 80% first dose coverage bracket and four in the 70% bracket. Majority districts (16) are in the 60% bracket and two (Beed and Nandurbar) have only reached 57%. Dr Thacker said that the time for awareness campaigns is over. What districts need are rapid surveys to understand the pulse of the community. While districts such as Aurangabad have linked vaccination to ration and fuel supply, most don’t want to take a hard stand yet. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said they have been struggling to achieve coverage in tribal pockets. “We are no longer convincing people and waiting for them to show up at centres. We are taking the mobile vans to their doorsteps. Anyone who is counselled and has shown any willingness, is vaccinated on the spot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-has-2-crore-doses-2-crore-population-awaits-1st-jab-but-turnout-dips/articleshow/87790004.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Experts from the minority communities as well as educational institutes are expected to submit the report within three months.The committee will look into the existing schemes and new ones to improve minority education and submit its recommendations, the government resolution released on Wednesday said. It further said that the Supreme Court has passed four judgments explaining various clauses in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which are not applicable to the minority institutions. The panel is expected to study judgments regarding minority institutes and formulate administrative and educational policies related to schools, students and teachers in minority institutes. “Till now, there has not been any policy specifically for minority education. This has created some issues because there are ambiguities when it comes to implementing some Acts. Such a policy will help clear them,” Markus Deshmukh, an advocate and an educational consultant for many minority schools, said. “Secondly, there are many schemes available but implementation may be an issue because the educational department officers do not know them well. Their training is a must. Thirdly, there are areas in the education of minority communities where we can do better as a state. This will also be studied and a draft policy will be recommended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/16-member-panel-to-recommend-edu-policy-for-minority-institutes-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87790108.cms||Ardhra Nair

At this rate, it is extremely doubtful how the department will be able to honour its commitment.” The bench also observed that the department’s communication to enforcement agencies to detect and book motor cabs that have not yet installed digital fare meters, was dated November 15, the same day the status report was submitted to the high court. “We expect the transport department/authority concerned to give greater details of the steps taken by agencies to detect and book motor cabs which have not installed digital fare meters, as well as the number of vehicles which are found plying without digital fare meters,” the bench comprising justices M R Dere and M Pitale stated. In the status report, transport director Rajan Satardekar said that the department would issue a public notice within five days, notifying all motor cab owners that they should not ply their vehicle without digital fare meters, and if any such vehicle is found plying, violations would be booked and strict action will be taken in terms of law. With regard to vehicles that have not yet installed or booked appointments for installation, the department stated that it has “blocked the process of renewal of permit and fitness certificate for such vehicle unless the digital fare meter is installed”. “The department is further in the process of compiling the data and within 15 days, the permits of all vehicles which have neither fitted nor booked an appointment for installation will be cancelled.” The department added that it would restore cancelled permits only once vehicles are fitted with digital fare meters. Till date, 4,109 vehicles have been fitted with the meters, and 2,631 bookings are awaiting installation, the director submitted. “Though the process was expected to be completed by October 31, 2021, the same is taking further time... The department has continued with the process of accepting bookings and installation of the meters to all vehicle owners who have come forward,” he stated. Satardekar added that the department has written to the enforcement agencies to detect and book motor cabs that have not yet installed digital fare meters. “The agencies have been requested to ensure that no motor cab plies without an installed digital fare meter,” the transport director added. At the last hearing, the Goa government assured the HC that licenses of taxi owners who failed to install digital meters by October 31, would have their licenses cancelled, and the transport director assured the court that the process would be completed by October 31. The state government had submitted to the court that it has taken a decision to subsidise the entire cost of the device (including backend and data service costs). The high court has closely been monitoring the installation of digital fare meters in taxis after the TTAG filed a second contempt petition within two years over the delay in their installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-pulls-up-govt-for-slow-pace-of-taxi-meter-drive/articleshow/87788200.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Delhi||Just 30% of Delhi pollution of its own making, says Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Pointing out that external pollution sources were hampering the city’s air quality and contribution from local sources was much lesser, environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday urged the Union environment minister to call a meeting with the NCR states to prepare an action plan to tackle pollution in the region. Rai asserted that over 69% of pollution in the city was due to sources in NCR towns or neighbouring states, while only 30% was generated locally. He cited a study conducted by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) based on data from ministry of earth sciences’ IITM, which had analysed per hour data of SAFAR to understand the sources of pollution. The minister said Delhi government had taken enough measures to control the local sources, adding that the study had shown reduction in pollution in the city. He further stated that Delhi government was taking a number of steps, from anti-dust to “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaigns, to control internal pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityCSE analysed data from IITM's Decision Support System between October 29 and November 8, which found that biomass burning contributed to 14.5% of the overall PM2.5, while the NCR districts added about 54.5%. Delhi’s local sources contributed 31% to the finer pollutants. The study also pointed out that transport was the biggest contributor of local emissions, followed by residential emissions, construction, industries, etc. “The contribution comes from 19 NCR districts as well as biomass burning in the neighbouring states. From November 2 to 6, the contribution of NCR dominated in the initial phase going till 70-80%, but its share declined during the smog episode post Diwali when contribution of Delhi’s own sources increased. Similarly, the contribution of biomass burning from other states remained low in the pre-Diwali phase, but peaked post Diwali,” the CSE study found. Citing a similar Teri study of 2016, Rai said while Delhi was doing its bid to control pollution, others must also join in. This study showed that 64% of pollution was due to external sources and 36% was because of Delhi’s internal sources. “Residents of Delhi can’t reduce the 69% external sources of emission. That’s why I’m requesting the Union minister to call a joint meeting of environment ministers from Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh,” Rai said. Alleging that construction activities were going on unabated in the neighbouring states, Rai pointed out that Delhi government had taken a slew of measures, like providing 24-hour electricity to reduce dependency on diesel generator sets, banning the entry of trucks, among others, till November 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-30-of-city-pollution-of-its-own-making-rai/articleshow/87788214.cms||---

The special drive, which began on Tuesday, concluded on Thursday. City police said the drive was held to find out buses which indulge in racing with each other and those who ply violating norms. The special drive by the city police commissionerate was held in collaboration with the motor vehicles department. City police in a statement said that the drive was held considering the rise in complaints by passengers. The rise in number of accidents due to the competition between private buses also led to the special drive. Police also said in the statement that due to the rash driving of private buses, other vehicles couldn’t travel safely through the roads. TOI had the other day reported about the rise in complaints against rash driving by private buses. Police said that cases were registered against private buses for driving rashly. Deputy commissioner of police, Kochi City, Aishwarya Dongre said that the police will ensure a situation in which commuters can safely travel in private buses and that the licences of conductors who misbehave with passengers would be suspended. The officer added that stricter action including revoking of permit would be taken against private buses if they are found to be in violation of the law. Police said they have got complaints about private bus staff not wearing proper uniform and about misbehaviour towards passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/281-cases-against-private-buses/articleshow/87787518.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa’s demand for power will double in next 15 years: Teri||PANAJI: The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) has said that power demand in Goa has increased steadily over the past six years, and is expected to double over the next decade and a half. The per capita consumption of power in Goa is almost double the national average, Teri found in a recent study. The institute added that despite achieving 100% electrification, various challenges continue to hamper the state’s efforts in ensuring 24x7 supply to all citizens.  The institute stated that it is important not only to meet the ever-growing demand for power, but also to progressively increase the share of renewable energy (RE) to achieve overall energy security. In the detailed study to identify strategies for ‘greening the sector and improving the reliability of power supply’, it said it was also important to meet the renewable purchase obligation as per the target fixed by the joint electricity regulatory commission (JERC) from time to time. TERI also identified strategies to ensure reliable power supply, which include deployment of smart grid technologies for peak load and outage management, promotion of consumer-side demand management interventions, upgradation and augmentation of transmission and distribution networks, and increasing local generation through renewable energy sources. “The importance of reliable power for a growing economy cannot be overemphasised, as the economy is becoming more and more dependent on electricity for everything,” said TERI associate director Narayankumar Sreekumar. “This study suggests a way forward for increasing the quality and reliability of power supply and greening the power sector for the state of Goa, which will be of immense value to policymakers in establishing the need for additional investments and identifying the appropriate mix of resources to meet the growing power demand of the state.” Important demand-side management measures include accelerated adoption of energy-efficient appliances among consumers, and carrying out comprehensive load research and integrated resource planning studies from time to time. It is also crucial to ensure grid modernisation utilising smart grid technologies as a fault-proof efficient distribution network for maintaining reliable power supply, the study states. There is a need for a long-term strategy based on cost-effectiveness and availability for increasing the ‘green’ energy share in the supply mix, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-demand-for-power-will-double-in-next-15-years-teri/articleshow/87788208.cms||Lisa Monteiro

At an emergency meeting convened by additional chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal, it was also decided that government employees in 14 NCR districts of the state would work from home till November 22. Private establishments were asked to do the same. Industries, where such an arrangement is not possible, will have to take a special permission from the deputy commissioner. In the four NCR districts, work from home had anyway been advised till November 17. On Tuesday, officials attending the meeting with Kaushal decided to extend it to all 14 NCR districts till November 22. These 14 districts are Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat. Officials said the idea behind encouraging the work from home concept was to ensure there were fewer vehicles on the roads. “The transport department should implement the odd-even policy in at least four districts on a trial basis from next week. There will, however, be no restrictions on CNG vehicles,” an official said, quoting from the minutes of the meeting. Air quality across NCR has deteriorated to alarming levels. On Saturday, the Supreme Court took cognisance of the foul air quality in the region and directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent steps to reduce AQI levels, asking “how will people breathe?” Apart from the restrictions, the government also decided to fine heavy vehicles that are found carrying construction material uncovered. Vehicles once challaned will not be allowed to move until the amount is paid. A drive is also being planned to phase out vehicles that are more than 15 (petrol) and 10 (diesel) years old. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said he would implement all the decisions taken at the meeting on Tuesday. “Decisions on mitigating pollution are being taken by the higher authorities. We will implement the odd-even rule in keeping with the rule. Now that most people are working from home, it should not be too difficult to implement the scheme,” he added. The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM), meanwhile, carried out a meeting with representatives of Haryana and other NCR states on Tuesday to discuss the action plan on how to jointly deal with the deteriorating air quality. “We are preparing a short affidavit on the action we have undertaken and what we plan to do. We will submit the affidavit to the Supreme Court and CAQM. We have included all the decisions that were taken at the meeting, such as the implementation of the odd-even scheme and extension of work from home,” said S. Narayana, a member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). However, many HSPCB officials hoped that the AQI would improve again after reaching the “severe” levels. “Our AQI has improved from severe to very poor. We are hopeful that it will improve further if construction activities are stopped completely. AQI, however, depends on meteorological conditions as well. In addition to the restrictions, the weather conditions should also be by our side,” said Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer at HSPCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-will-enforce-odd-even-traffic-rule-in-four-ncr-districts/articleshow/87746633.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Delhi||That morning stroll in Delhi may do you more harm than good||NEW DELHI: Outdoor activities, including walks, should be avoided till 10am in the winter season. Reason: an analysis by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, found the PM2.5 level peaking between midnight and 10am. Experts said the calm wind, low night temperatures and low mixing layer height in this period cause accumulation of pollutants. The SAFAR analysis the hours between 2pm and 6pm, though also polluted, are relatively better than in the morning. According to SAFAR, the average hourly PM2.5 concentration at midnight in the days between November 12 and 17 was 246 micrograms per cubic metre. This rose to 304 micrograms per cubic metre by 11am, but reduced to 158 micrograms per cubic metre by 2pm and further to 128 micrograms per cubic metre by 4pm. It then climbed to 158 micrograms per cubic metre by 6pm and continued to rise further into the night. The SAFAR analysis is based on the average hourly PM2.5 concentration. This should not be confused with the 24-hour average PM2.5 readings. Gufran Beig, SAFAR’s founder-project director, said, “People should limit their outdoor activities during the peak hours of PM2.5 concentration. The period during the afternoon and evening is polluted, but relatively better than the peak hours.” Confirming this, Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said that over the past few days, PM2.5 levels were peaking in the evening and morning hours in Delhi due to relatively calm winds around those times. “Faster surface winds favour pollution dispersion, but relatively calmer winds impede their dispersal,” she said. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, explained, “The inversion conditions deepen during the night which intensifies trapping of pollutants. Due to cool, calm and stable atmospheric conditions, air cannot rise high enough for effective mixing and dispersion.” She added, “A relative improvement in the atmospheric conditions during the day allows better dispersion of pollutants. This is the reason why we see comparatively lesser buildup of pollution in the afternoons in winter.” Experts said exposure to high PM2.5 concentration can be harmful. Arun Sharma, who was earlier with University College of Medical Sciences and is currently director of ICMR-NIIRNCD, Jodhpur, said, “If a person with healthy lungs inhales large quantities of PM2.5, the small pollutant particles go past the windpipe and get deposited in the lungs. These toxic elements can cause difficulty in breathing. If the particles get deposited in the eyes, it causes itchiness and watery eyes.” Sharma cautioned that exposure to PM2.5 for a longer duration of around eight hours every day would allow particulate matter to get deposited in the lungs in a progressive manner and damage the lungs. “Besides, long exposure to PM2.5 can aggravate the health condition of people suffering from asthma and other lung diseases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/that-morning-stroll-may-do-you-more-harm-than-good/articleshow/87788231.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Nagpur||Nagpur power plants making water toxic: Study||NAGPUR: At a time when India has objected to coal ‘phase out’ at the recently concluded United Nations meet COP26, an in-depth investigation of the country’s two major coal-fired power plants has revealed that villagers living around their periphery are drinking and using highly contaminated water, with toxic elements exceeding the safe limit by 10-15 times. The two power plants found to be a threat for public health are Maharashtra State Power Generation Company’s (Mahagenco) Khaparkheda and Koradi thermal power plants. Both the power plants are in Nagpur district. Carried out by Nagpur’s Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) and Pune’s Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt. Ltd, the study found surface and ground waters contaminated with toxic metals like mercury, arsenic, aluminium, lithium and also recorded widespread contamination of air, water and soil due to unscientific disposal and handling of fly ash. The study — ‘Polluted Power: How Koradi And Khaperkheda Thermal Power Stations are impacting the environment’ — highlighted that the power stations and their ash ponds were discharging effluents directly into local streams and rivers including the Kolar and Kanhan. During the investigations, water samples were collected from 25 locations including surface and groundwater. “Almost every water sample, in every season including monsoon, failed to pass the standards set for drinking water by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the IS 10500:2012 (acceptable limits) and other relevant standards. Several water samples and dangerous elements like mercury which is is among the most toxic substances known to mankind and arsenic that can cause cancers of liver and bladder,” the study stated. The analysis further found presence of high level of turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in both surface and groundwater sources. Apart from this, antimony, aluminium, arsenic, boron, fluoride, iron, manganese, magnesium, mercury, molybdenum, lithium, lead, and selenium were found in dangerous quantities. The biggest concern is that contaminated ground and surface water is being used by local communities extensively, for all purposes including drinking (with and without treatment), domestic use, bathing, washing clothes, fishing, irrigation and for cattle. High levels of aluminium, boron, fluoride magnesium and lead in water used for drinking or domestic use has been known to cause serious health hazards like cancer, respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular disorders, according to inverventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat. “Short-term exposure to antimony in drinking water at extremely high concentrations (more than 30 mg/L) can produce nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Molybdenum concentrations in finished water can reach 200 g/litre in regions near molybdenum mining activities,” he said. Dr Arbat added that as per findings, high molybdenum consumption (10–15 mg/day) is linked to a “high incidence of gout-like illness, joint aches in the legs and hands, enlargement of the liver, gastrointestinal, liver, and renal diseases, increased blood levels of molybdenum and uric acid, increased xanthine oxidase activity, reduced blood levels of copper, and increased urine copper were all symptoms of the condition”. A questionnaire-based survey, which was also a part of this study, revealed that out of 21 villages surveyed, 18 are being affected due to fly ash depositing in various parts of the village. It also found that airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollution. “We initiated this study together given the long history of pollution due to these power plants and their related infrastructure like ash ponds and the complete failure of official agencies in addressing the problem,” said Leena Buddhe, director of CFSD and a co-author of the study. Shripad Dharmadhikary, co-author of the study and coordinator of Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said, “Till now, air pollution due to the plants had received some attention, but detailed analysis of water pollution was not available. Our study is probably the first such attempt to comprehensively map out the water contamination due to these power plants,” he said. WHAT THE STUDY FOUND - Villagers living near Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants drinking and using highly contaminated water - Toxic elements exceeding safe limit by 10-15 times - Contaminated water being used by villagers for drinking purpose too, major threat to public health - Doctors warn it can cause severe health ailments - Airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollution||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/villages-around-nagpur-drinking-heavy-metal-contaminated-water-due-to-pollution-from-koradi-khaparkheda-power-plants-study/articleshow/87787519.cms||Manka Behl

The corporation authorities couldn’t even complete the amendments in the street vending bylaw which they presented in the council a couple of months ago. Though the corporation authorities have been discussing the issue of fixing street vending zones and rehabilitating the vendors for more than five years, what the rulers could do in this regard so far is just completing the registration of the vendors. “After completing the registration, we have issued ID cards to more than 700 vendors. We have prepared a draft on the vending zones. It is up to the town planning committee to give final shape to it,” mayor M Anilkumar said. “The committee had been headless for some time. Now, a new chairman has been elected to head the standing committee. So, we will be taking measures to abide by the court order,” Anil Kumar said. Though the corporation presented street vending bylaw at the council, many of the members suggested changes in it. “So, a threemember committee comprising councillors Priya Prashanth, V K Minimol and P S Viju were authorized to make amendments in the bylaw. It is learnt that there required comprehensive changes in the bylaw. Now, amended bylaw should be considered by the town planning standing committee. The standing committee, with its suggestions, should place it before the council for detailed discussion and approval,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader, Kochi corporation. Unregulated street vending is causing hardships to pedestrians and the public. “Though street vending is a means of livelihood for hundreds, it causes problems for many. Pedestrians, especially aged, have to walk through the busy roads as footpaths are being occupied by the vendors. The authorities should take urgent steps for rehabilitating the vendors to street vending zone,” said T N Prathapan, an RTI activist. “I have lodged complaint before the state human rights commission seeking justice to the pedestrians,” he said. Meanwhile, there is a lobby which runs street vending stalls using benamis. “There are many genuine street vendors. At the same time, there are some people who own several street vending stalls. They would either deploy other persons to run the stalls offering salaries or would rent out such stalls,” said Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi president K S Dileep Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-yet-to-fix-vending-zones-for-street-vendors/articleshow/87787526.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Hyderabad||P Venkatrama Reddy still IAS officer, can’t contest MLC poll: PIL||HYDERABAD: A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court on Thursday challenging the acceptance of the resignation of P Venkatrama Reddy, who quit as an IAS officer recently, and requesting the court to issue a direction to the election authority to reject his nomination papers for the ensuing MLC polls.  The PIL, filed by J Shankar, an unemployed youth from Jagtial district, and R Subender Singh, a research scholar from Sangareddy, stated the IAS officer cannot be considered a free citizen to contest polls till his resignation is accepted by Union government The petitioners questioned the competence of the chief secretary to accept the resignation of the collector. Though senior counsel S Satyam Reddy made a mention before the court to take up the matter as a lunch motion, the HC declined to do so and asked him to first file the petition and come through the regular procedure. The petitioners said the Centre was the competent authority to relieve all India service officers. The resignation or voluntary retirement of an IAS officer was governed by Rule 5 of the All India Services (death cum retirement benefit) Rules, 1958, they said. They said that the state has to forward the resignation to the central government along with a vigilance report and a no dues certificate. The resignation cannot be accepted if the officer was under suspension, or in pending disciplinary proceedings. “The authorities have to verify whether accepting the resignation is in the public interest or not. The officer has to give the Centre three-month notice before resigning. Hence, it has to go to the Centre through the state,” the PIL said. In this case, the collector attended duties on November 14 and forwarded his resignation. It was accepted by the chief secretary on same day. On November 15, TRS chose him as its nominee for MLC seat and on the next day he filed his nomination, they said. A government servant cannot contest polls and, as on the date of nomination, he continued to be a government employee, and his nomination cannot be considered as valid, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/venkatrama-still-ias-officer-cant-contest-mlc-poll-pil/articleshow/87788219.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pocso court rejects plea to recall 12-year-old||MUMBAI: Dismissing the defence plea to recall a now 12-year-old girl, victim in a sexual harassment case, a special Pocso court recently held that the right of the accused has to be balanced with the act in the interest of the child, so that she does not have to relive the trauma by repeated testimonies. The child had completed her deposition against the 23-year-old deaf and mute accused in 2019. However, the defence wanted her back in court “to confront her with her statement given to the magistrate.” It said that this had to be done to bring out contradiction, omissions and improvements between the statements. While an opportunity was given to the defence in April, the lawyer did not turn up as he had a “cold”. “Though the application for recalling of the victim was allowed previously and the opportunity was granted to the accused, the accused failed to avail the opportunity... only a vague statement is made about the illness (of the lawyer) without any supporting evidence for the same. Therefore, the accused cannot claim that his right to fair trial has been extinguished,” the Pocso court said. The accused has been out on bail since April 2018. The accused lived in the child’s neighbourhood. The FIR was lodged in 2016. The court said that in March after the application to recall the child was allowed, it was informed that she was now in Surat. The court directed her to appear virtually. It further said that on April 8 the child was present virtually through WhatsApp from Surat for her cross-examination. However, the accused and his advocate were absent. The court noted that on the same day, the investigating officer had also come from Pune but had to go back without any progress in the case.  It said that from April 21 to October 4, the accused and his lawyer remained absent. Two days later they moved a plea for recalling the witness. The prosecution opposed the application and submitted that it was filed after six months without any reason. It submitted that the child should not be harassed by repeatedly calling her. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pocso-court-rejects-plea-to-recall-12-yr-old/articleshow/87790110.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Goa||Goa frames rules to allow limited killing of wild boars||PANAJI: In a radical move, the state government has allowed site-specific culling of wild boars in private cultivated lands, after due assessment and authorisation by forest department officials. While the notification has brought smiles to the faces of farmers who complain about crop damage, it has evoked howls of protest from activists, who allege the tool could be misused and “will only hasten extinction of human species and all life forms”. For years, Goa’s farmers have been demanding that wild boar, peacock and bison be declared as vermin, alleging huge losses to crops. The notification authorises deputy conservators of forests for North and South Goa, who are wildlife wardens, to permit controlled killing of wild boars based on farmers’ complaints. Chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar said that both officials have been delegated powers to issue permits for hunting the wild animal after a site visit by the range forest officer (RFO), along with the farmer and a village panchayat member, and a requisite panchanama. “No permission will be granted for hunting of wild pigs in any protected area or government forest area. No permission will be granted for removal of squeaker and juvenile,” the order states. In turn, the RFO will submit a detailed report, if the culling is warranted, to the wildlife warden, seeking his permission. The permission — which will be accorded to experienced shooters — will be for a specific period, will be site-specific, and non-transferable. The animal carcass will be government property, and its disposal will be as per provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, for scheduled animals, and any breach will invite penal action. “No part of the removed wild animal like meat, skin, tushes, trophy, etc, will be consumed, possessed or displayed by any person,” the order states. The government’s move has upset activists and wildlifers, who blamed the forest department for wildlife conflicts. “The forest department has proven yet again that it is the biggest enemy of forests and wildlife, as well as the local population,” said activist Abhijit Prabhudesai. The department has failed to identify almost half of Goa’s forests till date, and reduced eco-sensitive zones of wildlife sanctuaries from 10km to 1km, he said. “It has also allowed large-scale mining in the western ghats, massive infrastructure projects crisscrossing the state and industries, airports, real estate and large institutions in forests and on plateaus,” Prabhudesai said. Another wildlife enthusiast, Edward Rodricks, a former honorary wildlife warden, said that the state has enacted many laws, but they are not always implemented and can be misused. “By shooting these animals, we will soon be exterminating them. How can we let other offenders off the hook — those who have destroyed forests, animal habitats and the fragile environments for sheer greed?” he asked He said the farmers should erect infrastructure to guard their crops. “There are means like making loud noises or bursting crackers to drive away wild animals. But farmers leave their fields unguarded,” Rodricks said. Prabhudesai said that restoring forests is crucial to solve wildlife conflicts and our children’s survival. “We have to restore and return the forests and plateaus to them and local communities after stopping all destructive activities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-frames-rules-to-allow-limited-killing-of-wild-boars/articleshow/87788213.cms||Paul Fernandes

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought a response from the government while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by S Ramesh Kumar, an advocate from Sivaganga district. The petitioner stated that Spices Park in Sivaganga was established in 2013 by the Union ministry of commerce and industry in order to facilitate the processing and to improve the quality of spices such as turmeric and chilli in the region. The park in Sivaganga was the fifth of its kind established in the country. He stated that the park is fully equipped with all the infrastructure facilities. However, even after eight years the same was not functioning. As per information obtained through RTI, he learnt that there was a delay in the functioning of the Spices Park, due to lack of permission from the directorate of the town and country planning. He further stated that though the Spices Board has sent a requisition letter in September to the directorate of town and country planning seeking to grant permission for the functioning of the park, no steps were taken. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/petition-in-hc-seeks-nod-for-spices-park-in-sivaganga-district/articleshow/87788226.cms||---
---||Madurai||Revise protocol for health screening of arrestees: Madras high court||MADURAI: Observing that it is time the state revises the protocol for medical examination of arrestees, the Madras high court has said that the proforma for health screening of prisoners must contain a specific column on their mental wellbeing. Justice G R Swaminathan observed that the column cannot be filled up after posing a formal question to the arrestee. The duty doctor must observe independently and gather inputs from the arrestee’s next friend or relative. The judge observed that psychiatric ailments are ticking bombs. They lie beneath the surface. Unless they manifest themselves in a concrete manner in the behaviour and conduct of the patient, one is hardly aware of it. “Time has come to conduct awareness programmes in police training academies and judicial academies to sensitize the officers concerned,” observed the judge. Suggesting that every police officer and judge should read Jerry Pinto’s ‘A Book of Light : When a Loved One Has a Different Mind’ and should also watch the film ‘A Beautiful Mind’, the judge observed that only then one will understand about depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. “The expression ‘reason to believe’ warrants a purposive construction... The police officer is obliged to undertake a basic enquiry. He has to find out from the person on whom the intimation of arrest is served as to whether the accused is a normal person,” observed the judge. The duty doctor examining the accused must satisfy himself that the arrestee is not suffering from any mental illness before certifying that he is fit for remand. The remanding magistrate is under an equal obligation. The court made these observations while hearing a plea moved by a woman seeking transfer of her husband suffering from bipolar disorder from the Tuticorin government hospital to the Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital. The petitioner’s husband was arrayed as an accused in a usury case. The judge took note of the fact that the police officials and the doctor who examined him before remand were not aware of his medical condition. Taking into account that the facilities at the Tuticorin government hospital were not sufficient, the judge directed the authorities to take immediate steps to shift the man to Tirunelveli MCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/revise-protocol-for-health-screening-of-arrestees-hc/articleshow/87788220.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan also directed the authorities to file a detailed report along with a sketch indicating that the work has been completed. The court passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by M Periyaswamy, a farmer and a resident of Trichy district. In his petition, Periyaswamy stated that the flow of Cauvery river which is a major source of water for agricultural activities is divided in many places for irrigation purposes. One such water channel flows for nearly 12km from Thayanur village to Santhapuram village in Srirangam taluk. The water in the channel finally flows into the Uyyakondan river. He stated that the farmers of eight villages depend on the water from the channel for irrigation purposes. However, several encroachments inside the channel over the years has reduced its width. He stated that earlier this year, the PWD officials carried out the works of removing the encroachments in the channel till Melasaveriyarpuram village, however they did not continue the work in the remaining stretch. Despite submitting several representations to remove the encroachments in the remaining stretch, no steps were taken so far. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to the authorities to survey and remove the encroachments to ensure the free flow of water for irrigation purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-pwd-to-free-trichy-channel-of-encroachments/articleshow/87788223.cms||---

On Thursday, the court also granted bail to the 21-year-old woman, Simran Verma, who was arrested in the case. Police arrested Himanshu Devkate (22), a Nagpur resident, who has a previous offence of outraging the modesty of a woman registered against him at the Marine Drive police. Police said they found a Rolex watch, stamp of Maharashtra government, several debit cards, a visiting card of Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa high court and various other cards from his possession. Advocate Sunil Pandey for Simran Verma argued that she is innocent and only an employee of the accused who has been falsely implicated in the crime. The case pertains to a complaint lodged by Rahul Bokadia, who runs an electronic shop on Lamington Road. Bokadia stated that on November 8, he received a call from an unknown person, who identified himself as advocate Himanshu from Himanshu and Associate law firm and placed an order for a laptop and a mobile phone. Himanshu agreed to pay the quoted price of Rs 2.4 lakh for the purchase of the gadgets. Later, Himanshu sent Bokadia a fabricated screenshot of the payment and asked for the mobile and laptop to be urgently delivered to his office address — Sagar Mahal near Sydenham College in Churchgate. But when Bokadia called up Himanshu to inform him that he was sending the goods, Himanshu said the office was closed and asked him to send the goods near Churchgate station. On reaching Churchgate station, when the delivery man called up Himanshu, he asked him to come to a burger shop nearby and deliver the goods to Simran. The next day, on realising that the money had not been credited, Bokadia sent his peon to Himanshu’s law firm at Churchgate and learnt that no such firm existed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-who-duped-electronic-shop-owner-held-his-employee-granted-bail/articleshow/87790117.cms||Ahmed Ali

Within six hours, the bedridden woman suffering from neuromuscular disease was vaccinated at home by the nearby Har Ghar Dastak team.The youth, an IT professional, told TOI that he was pleasantly surprised when the NMC team responded to his online concern. “I thought it will take a lot of time. The vaccination centre is just 200 metre from my home but my mom can’t go there. I am happy that the NMC team came and gave her the first dose,” said Kartik, adding that only his mother was left to take the jab in the family.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the NMC will vaccinate anyone, irrepective of the manner in which the demand is raised. “We are vaccinating individuals at home whenever they seek help on social media, over phone or through zone offices. The facility can be extended after November 30 for the second dose too,” he said.Civic officials said citizens shouldn’t delay their first dose any further as this is the best opportunity to get jabbed with all focus on complete coverage. They added that even citizens making phone calls are given response with the same zeal.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said this should have been the policy to reach out to everyone right from February but the demand-supply imbalance posed hurdles. “Such innovative ways will help clear decks for the booster doses of HCW, FLWs and high-risk individuals,” he said.Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said this is a very good mop-up strategy. “We are standing at a very critical point and need very high herd immunity. Many have taken the first dose while the second jab of many is remaining. This will impact where it must. This is wonderful,” he said.Dr Shinde said this drive is like pulse polio and this is how it should be. “This is a guarantee that vaccination is reaching everyone. Many people still avoid jabs worrying about long queues, registration, the time it will take and so on. So, if you call or tag NMC on social media and they respond,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tweet-tag-call-nmc-all-ears-to-vaccination-demand/articleshow/87787555.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

He also announced a slew of new projects under the Tito’s brand on the 50th anniversary of the club, which is on Friday, November 19. Talking to the media at Baga, Ricardo said, “We changed our mind about selling. We never sold. Talks were at an advanced stage with a buyer, but we decided to stay on and continue running Tito’s.” In late June, in a surprise move, Ricardo had announced in a social media post that “Tito’s has been sold” because of some problems with government departments, amongst other reasons. “We were overwhelmed with the messages of support and help we received from across Goa, India and abroad, and that made us decide to fight it out,” Ricardo said. On Thursday, Ricardo, along with brother David, announced that they’re now looking to expand their business operations. “We’re going to create a Goan company which will take on the world,” he said. The new projects include Tito’s Hotels, which has begun with two properties, with six more to be added soon, Tito’s Eats, a food-restaurant chain which starts on Friday, Tito’s Travel, a tour operator, and Tito’s Spirits, a alcohol and beverage company. They are also launching franchises of Club Tito’s and Tito’s Fashion. Talking about his entry into politics by contesting from Calangute at the upcoming assembly elections, Ricardo said he would have liked to, but the circumstances are not right at the moment and his family members are also opposed to his entering politics. “So, no politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/titos-will-not-be-sold-says-co-owner/articleshow/87788259.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thanks to the Maharashtra transport department, all the three regional transport offices — city, deputy RTO east and rural RTO — will receive two simulators each.Deputy transport commissioner Dinkar Manwar said that it will not be mandatory for an aspirant to pass the simulator test to go for the final driving test. The simulators will help the licence seekers to evaluate their driving skills before appearing for the final test.Manwar said it will provide training to the applicants on various aspects like basic driving skills on road, following traffic signals, use of accelerator, clutch, brake, steering, turns and speed limits. The training will also be useful for the applicants to learn how they should drive on different roads, timings like peak hours and about the movement of pedestrians among other important road safety aspects.Apart from three RTOs, 13 more offices in the state will get two simulators each. Similarly, 33 offices including Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Bhandara and Gondia will get one simulator each.The department is procuring 65 simulators from a Hyderabad firm at a cost of Rs3.90 crore.Manwar said all RTOs and deputy RTOs have been asked to identify the place for installation of simulators in their respective offices. The simulators will be operational within two months.“Besides, nodal officers from 50 offices across the state have also been selected for a special training programme,” he said.The move is part of the road safety initiative adopted by the state government. Figures of road accidents in the city had also revealed the involvement of four-wheelers have increased manifold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/before-seeking-licence-assess-your-driving-skills-on-simulators/articleshow/87787547.cms||---

It was in July 2019 that KSERC announced a power tariff hike in state and KSEB has not filed a revision petition since then because the government did not want a revision for political reasons. The new multi-year tariff, for five years, will come into effect on April 1, 2022. Sources hinted that KSERC may even concede an overall hike of 10%, depending on how craftily KSEB prepares the tariff revision petition. KSEB said it would take an appropriate decision after diligently going through the new tariff regulations. How much hike KSEB would seek would depend on various factors, including the fresh financial commitment brought out by the recent pay revision. Meanwhile, power minister K Krishnankutty said on Thursday that there were no plans to increase the tariff. “Though a proposal to introduce higher tariffs for energy used during the peak hours (6pm to 10pm), KSEB is yet to take a call on the same. The proposal is aimed at reducing power consumption in peak hours, rather than eking out more money from it,” he said. At the same time, KSERC has dropped several key recommendations it made in the draft regulations for determination of power tariff. The new regulation notified by the commission in Nov 2021 has dropped the recommendations that endorsed the demand for different tariff structure for distribution licensees under KSEB. The board had strongly opposed the recommendation on the ground that it would adversely affect its financial position. It also scrapped the suggestion that excess power should be made available to open access consumers at power exchange price. If the control period for the earlier tariff was two years, the new tariff determination regulation has set it for five years. This can even go beyond five years, if deemed appropriate by KSERC. The new tariff would be applicable from April 1, 2022 to March 1, 2027. But, there will be a mid-term performance review in 2024-25 – based on the truing up figures for 2022-23 and 2023-24 – and KSEB’s annual performance review (till Sept 2024). It also stipulates that one-third of KSEB’s financial gains be transferred to consumers as rebate in tariff. But, the aggregate loss to the utility can’t be passed onto consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/regulator-moots-another-round-of-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/87787550.cms||---

As per the KSEB dam safety wing data, the dam was opened four times in the 1981 period within a month for an experimental purpose. After increased inflow to the Idukki reservoir, the shutter number 3 of the Cheruthoni dam was opened at 10am on Thursday. The shutter has been raised to 40cm and 40 cumecs of water is being released. According to KSEB officials, the shutter was opened to regulate the water level as it was nearing the upper rule level of 2,400.03ft. The water level reached 2,399.44ft at 9am. The water level in the Idukki reservoir was at the red alert level for the past two days. The full reservoir level is 2,403ft. There was a storage of 95.74% on Thursday, which was 88.86% on the same day last year. After opening the shutter of Cheruthoni dam, the water level in Idukki continued to increase and it reached 2,399.46 ft at 5pm. In 1981, the dam shutters were kept opened initially from October 29, to November 5. The shutters were closed on October 31 and opened again on November 1 and released an amount of 23.42mcm of water. “The dam was opened again on November 10 and closed on November 12. It was opened again on November 14 and closed the same day. The longest opening of the dam was in 2018 when a total amount of 1,069.29 mcm water was released within 32 days,” said a KSEB dam safety official. KSEB advisory board member James Wilson said that the shutters of Cheruthoni were opened to strictly follow the rule curve. “After the central water commission fixed the revised rule curve, the KSEB rule committee decided to strictly follow the rule curve in Idukki and other major hydel dams. It was decided to ensure that the opening of shutters did not create any damage in the downstream areas of the dam,” he said. “The weather conditions and the water level of Mullaperiyar dam were also considered before the early opening of the shutters of Idukki. In addition, we strictly opened the shutters before the water reached the rule curve level,” said Wilson. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu opened four spillway shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam on Thursday morning after the water level reached the upper rule curve level of 141ft. Two shutters were closed by 10pm after the water level decreased to 140.90ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/after-four-decades-idukki-dam-opened-thrice-in-a-year/articleshow/87787561.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Residents come out with action plan to restore Vandiyur tank||MADURAI: Residents of K K Nagar and Gomathypuram have chalked out an action plan for the conservation and restoration of the Vandiyur tank which would solve the water woes of the wards in Madurai north and east constituencies. The action plan, which is to be submitted to the state government through the district administration in a few days, includes deepening and desilting the tank to its original capacity, planting native breeds of plants to strengthen the bund and establishment of a sewage treatment plant on the western end where corporation sewage flows into it through the Athikulam channel. President of the Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar residents welfare association, D Raghavan said that the Vandiyur tank, one of the largest in Madurai, originally had a water spread area of 600 acres and had a command area of 1,000 acres. However, infrastructural encroachments on its banks on all sides, agricultural encroachments and invasive species have resulted in the area shrinking to 572 acres and the area under agriculture which depended on it now has just less than 100 acres. The water storage capacity of this tank was originally 107 mcft, but now it has shrunk to just 71 mcft, said Pandi, the secretary of the association. In 2012, the tank, which had held water throughout the year, became bone dry due to encroachment of its supply channels. As a result, the groundwater in the wards neighbouring this tank - Gomathypuram, Tahsildar Nagar, Vandiyur, K K Nagar, Anna Nagar, Anbu Nagar, Yagappa Nagar and Melamadai - went down to as low as 600 feet below the ground level. Many resident welfare associations joined hands with the Walkers Club and formed the Federation for the Vandiyur Tank Development in 2013. Raghavan said that every year they have to cough up nearly Rs 2 lakh to clean the 30th sluice of the Periyar 9th main channel which brings water to the tank from Vaigai river. “If the PWD can undertake stone wall pitching of this channel to a distance of 1,350m, it would be solve a perennial problem,’’ he said. “Open defecation is rampant on the banks of the tank. Civc body should install mobile toilets,” said A A G Rajkumar, president of the Walkers Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-come-out-with-action-plan-to-restore-vandiyur-tank/articleshow/87788235.cms||---

Aliyar reservoir in Tamil Nadu is part of the inter-state Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) and Tamil Nadu has to issue two warnings before releasing the water so that people living along the river banks can take precautionary measures. The Tamil Nadu water resource department claimed it had informed about the release of water to its Kerala counterparts. Palakkad district disaster management authority (DDMA) in a statement here on Thursday said that there was no need for anxiety as the rivers were flowing below the danger levels. Chitturpuzha overflowed with Tamil Nadu releasing as much as 6,000cuscus of water on Wednesday night which was brought down to 2,500cuscus on Thursday. Chitturpuzha was in spate by Thursday early morning and waters entered several some houses at Thirunellayi. People living along the banks said no warning was issued about the opening of the dam shutters. Three councillors of Palakkad municipality blocked the road at Thiruvalathur to protest against the opening of the dam shutters without informing the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opening-of-aliyar-dam-sparks-panic/articleshow/87787573.cms||---

Meanwhile, in a boost to the students, the opposition AIADMK has demanded that the government conduct online semester exams. Since syllabus was not completed in colleges and model exams could not be conducted due to various factors like holidays for rain and festivals, exams should be conducted online for this semester alone, opposition leader and AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami said in a statement. He also pointed out that not all college students have been vaccinated. He said that though offline classes commenced from September this year, there were several interruptions in regular conduct of classes due to heavy rains. Palaniswami also urged the government to drop the cases booked on college students protesting against the announcement on conduct of offline exams.In a separate statement, OPS also demanded online exams to be held for this semester. “Government’s announcement that offline exams would be conducted has disappointed students as well as their parents who are worried that the score would go down because of offline exams,” he said. OPS too urged the government to withdraw cases booked on protesting college students.On Thursday morning, students of the Government Law College in Tallakulam staged a protest in front of the college. The protesters held banners and shouted slogans before dispersing. With protests continuing for the fourth day, police have tightened security outside various colleges in Madurai.In Madurai, cases have been registered against more than 1,000 students for taking part in the protests in the last three days. Cases were registered against 300 students from various colleges at Anna Nagar, Thirupparankundram and Tallakulam police stations under section 151 CrPC. The police action has created concern among the student community and social activists who said that students have a right to protest in a peaceful manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-backs-students-protesting-for-online-exams/articleshow/87788239.cms||---
---||Madurai||Students back to dangling footboard travel||Madurai: With schools now holding classes on campus for classes I to XII and TNSTC buses running packed across Madurai, footboard travel by students has become rampant. The district child welfare committee (CWC) has taken note of the dangerous travel by students following a video that has surfaced showing them not just on footboard but also by grabbing onto the ladder at the back of a bus.The viral video shared on various social media platforms showed six students with school bags on their backs climbing onto the ladder behind a TNSTC bus in Narimedu and clinging to it dangerously. Across Madurai, at various bus stops outside schools, children indulging in footboard travel have become a common sight after schools reopened for most classes. This is particularly rampant in cases of buses plying to and from the city’s outskirts like Alanganallur and Avaniyapuram as they are more crowded.“With buses crowded during peak hours now, especially for areas to which only few of them operate, children are forced to take the bus even if it means footboard travel. Even if we create awareness on its dangers, children will not stop travelling on footboard unless there is another solution for them to be on time,” said the headmaster of a government aided school.Bus drivers and conductors are also able to do little to prevent footboard travel effectively. They say that despite warnings, children continue the practice. “This can be resolved only if some alternative is arranged. Especially with free travel now allowed for school children, government TNSTC buses are jampacked during school hours on all routes. Steps must be taken to increase the number of buses or schools should be made to have different timings rather than all of them in peak hours,” said A Kanagasundar, Madurai district secretary of CITU.CWC members B Pandiaraja and L Shanmugam have written to the police, school education and transport department officials to ensure the safety of children and prevent such dangerous practice. “It was already brought to our notice when schools reopened for Class IX to XII. One accidental slip can cost the life of a child. All three department officials must work together to ensure the practice is stopped. We have also requested for more buses to be deployed for the welfare of students,” said Shanmugam. The CWC has sought a report in 15 days from district officials on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-back-to-dangling-footboard-travel/articleshow/87788249.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 2% on Thursday as wind direction was not favourable for transfer of pollutants. Track the pollution level in your cityStrong winds are likely to help in cleaning the air from Sunday and AQI may touch “poor” category, predicted Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi. Central Pollution Control Board’s data shows that AQI improved marginally on Thursday from Wednesday’s 375. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting agency, said the contribution of farm fires decreased to 2% from 6% on Wednesday. “AQI is likely to improve but remain in the same category for the next two days as transport-level winds are coming from the east direction, preventing intrusion of pollutants from the upwind region. From November 21, surface winds are likely to be strong, resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality,” said SAFAR. “The effective farm fire count is 773 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 is negligible,” it added. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature was recorded at 26.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, and the minimum, which dipped to 9.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, rose to 10.5 degrees, two notches below normal.

Twentyone children in the age group of 8-13 also had a memorable meeting with Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu in Nellore in Andhra Pradesh. The tribal children, including eight girls, walked from Srisailam forest area to Muppavarapu farmers training centre of Swarana Bharati Trust in Nellore where they met the Vice-President on November 13. The walk, which began from Yerragondlapalem in Prakasam district on November 4, ended on November 17. Apart from the 21 tribal children, there were four other children and six elders who accompanied them on their marathon walk. While 20 children hailed from Nagarkurnool district in Telangana, one was from Mekalabanda in AP’s Kurnool district. The children are students of government schools. “We also had a car in which the children could rest after they completed their walk for the day before they would join the walk again. It was all about exposing the tribal children to the world outside of their tribal habitations,” said Children of the Forest founder Vamsidhar Kalidasu. The marathon walk was intended to inculcate in them sportsmanship so that they are exposed to the world of sports and also develop interest in them, he said. The walk was also for a cause. They were taken to a temple but the surroundings were littered with plastic and other waste materials. The children picked up and segregated one tonne of waste. A more challenging task was taken up by 18 Chenchu youth earlier this year who embarked on a 9,000-km cycle journey as an expedition to the Himalayas. However, they could not complete the expedition because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a meeting convened by the joint director of urban affairs on October 30, the city corporation presented a set of issues regarding the software. In response the Information Kerala Mission cited in the meeting that a report would be furnished on November 10. Seven days later, the city corporation has yet to receive a response from IKM. Even in the list of arrears being published across wards, tax dues are dated from the fiscal 2016-17. The status of tax payments before this period has remained a case of concern for the city corporation. The software allows assessment of tax only with effect from 2016-17. The software does not have an option to assess buildings based on annual rental value before this period. Unless the city corporation gets a way to assess and calculate dues based on the old system of tax assessment for buildings for the period before 2016-17, actual dues may still remain unclear. The city corporation had also sent a letter to the Information Kerala Mission on October 15, flagging glaring shortcomings in the IKM software. During the tenure of the previous council, the corporation had highlighted the issues and glitches in IKM software but to no avail. References to similar communications in the past had also been mentioned in the letter sent on October 15. While the corporation is updating records of around 4.5 lakh tax assessments and even though service cess is being calculated in the city corporation along with property tax for the past three years, the software has no facility to add service cess in buildings which were assessed before service cess came into effect. While merging the data base before 2016, the officials tried posting the tax for a whole year; however, the system would still reflect that of half a year, the letter sent to the IKM shows. It also lists out other technical glitches like delay, frequent instances of system snags which have delayed the process of data updation. As regarding relaxation of tax for ex-service men, the software has no provision to update the relaxation annually after scrutiny of necessary documents. The officials fear that even after undertaking a laborious task of updating tax data, the corporation would still face the predicament of dealing with irregularities unless the software is updated. Besides, in the absence of calculating dues with retrospective effect, defaulters will also find a way to evade the dues, the officials pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/software-issues-on-tax-data-updation-not-resolved-yet/articleshow/87766678.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolkata||After a decade, parking fees set to double in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Motorists may soon have to cough up twice the amount to park their cars at designated fee parking lots across the city. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is set to revise the parking fee structure after more than a decade to make it Rs 20 per hour instead of Rs 10 now for cars. For two-wheelers, the proposed parking fee is Rs 10 per hour instead of the current Rs 5. The KMC car parking department may soon notify the new fee structure that will be applicable from 7am to 10pm. The department had in April 2019 attempted a similar revision but then rolled it back under public pressure. On Wednesday, the proposal was mooted again and placed before the board of administrators for discussion. It was thereafter forwarded to an expert committee comprising senior civic officials and traffic police officers for deliberation. Though a formal decision will be taken after the expert committee gives its view, sources said it was likely to be passed this time as municipal commissioner Binod Kumar had himself advocated the need for a change in the fee structure in March. The reason cited for the fee hike is two-fold. While it will augment the revenue, KMC also hopes it will discourage some people to take out their cars on a regular basis, thereby putting less pressure on parking lots. More importantly, that would lead to less emission, and hence, reduce the air pollution. While appearing to be contadictory, even a 20% reduction in vehicles will lead to more revenue in the revised rate. Revenue from parking had been severely affected in the past 18 months due to the pandemic. While there were no vehicles on the road during the lockdown, even during the unlock period and subsequent restrictions during the second wave, there were fewer cars on the road. The parking department had also announced a waiver of the amount it collected from the parking agencies during the lockdown in 2020 as there were no earnings during this period. A section of car parking department officials said parking cooperatives who deploy attendants to collect the fees had been demanding a revision for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-a-decade-parking-fees-set-to-double/articleshow/87787582.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cellphone fight with mom ends in suicide||KOLKATA: A Class-X student of a Budge Budge school was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her room at Balurghata on Thursday after her mother had reportedly stopped her from taking her cellphone to school. The eldest among three siblings, the girl used to attend her online classes on her mother’s cellphone as the parents would leave the phone with her when they went out to work. However, since the physical classes began from Tuesday, the mother insisted on taking her cellphone to work and didn’t allow the girl to keep it with her any more. This apparently led to a bitter fight with her mother on Wednesday. The mother took away the cell phone from her on Wednesday and on Thursday she took the cellphone to her workplace. The 14-year-old girl was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room by her younger brother after both the parents had left their home. “My daughter had become addicted to the cellphone. As Madhyamik exam was due shortly and since the physical classes had begun, my wife had rebuked her on Wednesday for being hooked on to the cellphone and took it away from her. On Thursday, both of us had left for work by 6.15am. My son found her hanging around 7am,” said the father, who works at a local jute mill. The incident has brought to focus the dangers associated with over-dependence on electronic gadgets, which children had been forced into since the start of the pandemic. “It was pretty much expected that once the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions ease down, the dangers of over-reliance on digital media will turn out to be a serious concern and tackling the withdrawal symptoms will become a major challenge. The entire problem has been triggered by unrestrained screen addiction,” said child psychologist Devika De. Psychiatrist Siladitya Ray pointed out that the incident proves two things — how increased screen time along with phone addiction can create mental instability leading to impulsive behaviour and how modern technologies of distraction can tear apart the cohesive fabric of human society. “The most reliable way to tackle this crisis is to teach children and help them to develop an insight into the core issue that excessive screen time leads to addictive behaviour which eventually might go out of hand and generate frustration and disgruntlement. However, parents need to be patient, said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cellphone-fight-with-mom-ends-in-suicide/articleshow/87787589.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Most of the current variants, including the AY.4.2 strain, are the offspring/descendants of the Delta variant, against which the Indian population is believed to have a fair amount of protection owing to wide exposure in the past. “The latest AY.4.2 strain comes from the lineage of Delta strain. It does not appear to pose major challenges,” leading epidemiologist Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said. Gangakhedkar is part of the World Health Organisation’s 26-member expert team to examine the origins of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. He is also Dr CG Pandit National Chair at ICMR. “The threat of a third wave, which was expected to be more severe, seems to have receded in India. If at all the third wave occurs, we are more likely to have only minor spikes in cases among the vulnerable and unvaccinated individuals,” Gangakhedkar said. After the initial Wuhan strain last year, the more infectious Delta strain spread much faster and infected a significantly large population in a short span of time during the second wave. High-seroprevalence of Delta variant in the community is also among the positive indicators. “The second wave in India was almost four times more widespread than the first wave, with a rapid rise and equally sharp fall. It left a large chunk of our population with immunity after recovery from natural infection as seen in latest serosurveys,” said senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. The high antibody level against the Delta variant seems to have acted as brakes. “The fact that India with high population density is likely to have reached an endemic status after widespread natural infection, can be substantiated when we compare the current surge in cases in the European countries. These nations with a fairly high vaccination coverage are experiencing peaks, while infections in India are plummeting,” Banerjee said. Nevertheless, virologists are closely watching the evolution of the Delta and other variants. Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology’s (ICMR-NIV) senior scientist Pragya Yadav said, “Immune-mediated mechanism (waning immunity) or viral evolution for immune escape is unlikely to drive a severe third wave unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed. Likewise, a new more transmissible variant will have to exceed a high threshold of Rnaught (R0) value (average virus spreadability value) to cause the third wave on its own, which seems unlikely as of now.” The experts, however, have underscored that the duration of protection of the natural and vaccine-induced immunity and the emergence of any immunity-evading variant will determine the nature of the future covid waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-dont-see-europe-like-severe-wave-of-covid-in-india/articleshow/87787588.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The order was issued after Anupama, who has accused her parents of giving out her baby for adoption to the council without her consent, claimed that the child was hers. After the government informed the court about the claims of Anupama over the child, the court had directed the council and child welfare committee to take steps for conducting the DNA test of the child. Reacting to the latest development, Anupama, who is staging a protest in front of the welfare council, said she was happy about the order, but would continue the stir till she gets her baby back. “The order says the child would be brought back to Kerala in five days for the DNA test. The district child protection officer would be the custodian of the baby till the DNA test is over. The child would be housed in a government facility is what I assume,” she said. The child would be brought from Andhra under police protection. “Getting back my child is one of the most important demands I have raised. But there are other important problems that need attention. It includes action against the authorities who failed to do justice. My fight would continue until all those responsible for the forced adoption of my child are punished,” Anupama said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cwc-orders-dna-test-on-child/articleshow/87787587.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||KCR on dharna, rips Centre on paddy row||Hyderabad: Ratcheting up his fight against the Centre over procurement of paddy, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Thursday sat on a dharna — a first in seven years after taking over the reins of Telangana — demanding that the Union government announce a procurement policy for the coming rabi season. Protesting along with his cabinet colleagues, elected representatives and TRS functionaries at Indira Park, the CM thundered this was only a beginning and that his party would take the lead against ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the Centre as and when required. KCR, who led the separate Telangana statehood movement for 13 years staging dharnas/rasta rokos and addressing scores of public rallies, was trenchant in his criticism of the Centre at the ‘maha dharna’. “Started the battle because the farming community is suffering due to the Centre’s policies,” the CM said. During his 40-minute long speech, the CM announced he would fight for the cause of the farmers till the last drop of his blood. “This battle will not end today. If the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre does not procure 5 lakh metric tonnes of rice from last year’s rabi quota, we will dump it in the BJP office at Nampally,” he warned. The CM said the farming community in the entire country was beset with problems with farmers agitating on the borders of Delhi, but the Modi government was reluctant to change its policies. “We are asking only one straight question: Are you (Centre) going to procure paddy in the coming rabi season or not.” He recalled the state had stoutly opposed when the Centre insisted on fixing power meters to agriculture pump sets and borewells. “The central government has been harassing the state government for the last seven years by stopping loans and creating problems. Since Telangana is a new state, we have been very restrained. But, there is a limit to our patience,” he said. Gross injustice was done to Telangana after the BJP came to power at the Centre, the CM said. “Seven Telangana mandals were given to AP, they gave Sileru power plant to AP, they did not sanction tribal university, ITIR project and even Navodaya schools. Many resolutions like BC caste census, ST reservations and SC categorisation are still pending with the Centre,” KCR added. BOX CM hits out at BJP Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao hit out at the BJP alleging that it was busy ‘creating communal tensions’. “The BJP knows only how to encash on sentiments of people by creating communal tensions and raking up Bhainsa incident, Pakistan sentiment and surgical strikes during elections. BJP leaders even resort to character assassination by spreading lies on social media. Did people elect you for this? People also understand your dramas,” KCR said. The CM also said the parties that ruled the country all these decades have failed the country and because of their inefficiency, the country has been facing several problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-on-dharna-rips-centre-on-paddy-row/articleshow/87788928.cms||Koride Mahesh

According to the police, the accused, Jesu Antony Raj, is the second husband of Suja from Periyavilai in Kanyakumari district, mother of three children -- two daughters and a son. The couple got married after the death of Suja’s first husband and settled down at Kavalkinaru in Tirunelveli district. On Wednesday, Antony Raj’s 10-year-old stepdaughter, who had gone to a bakery, took a biscuit packet without paying for it. The bakery owner complained to Antony Raj about the incident. Angered by the girl’s action, he came home that night and gathered all the three children and poured kerosene on them and set them on fire, police said. On hearing the screams of the children, neighbours rushed in and extinguished the fire quickly. The boy and a girl escaped unharmed but the 10-year-old girl suffered burn injuries.  She was admitted to Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital, where Antony Raj was also admitted with minor injuries.

Protesters also blocked the VC’s vehicle as he proceeded from his house to the varsity. Youth Congress staged a sit-in before the VC’s residence at 9am, locked the gate and chanted slogans alleging nepotism in varsity faculty appointment and that Varghese was not qualified for the post. Ravindran told the media that there were no violations of norms and that the varsity will proceed with the interview for the appointment of associate professor in Malayalam department. The same was held online during the day. Save Education Campaign Committee had alleged that Varghese lacked the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor that requires a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. The petition claimed that Varghese joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012 and while working there she had availed three years’ leave under FDP programme for completing her PhD. They had cited Clause 3.9 of UGC Regulations 2018 to claim that the time taken by candidates to acquire MPhil/PhD degree shall not be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to the teaching position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/youth-cong-stages-protest/articleshow/87787595.cms||---

Instead, one has to make a request on a WhatsApp number (8335999111) to book a slot and meet a designated official at the civic headquarters to get the work done. This system will replace the existing ‘drop box’ system of applying for birth or death certificates. According to a KMC health department official, under the drop-box system, thousands of applications were pending for several months. The new system will start working from this week-end, said KMC BoA chairman Firhad Hakim. “All a citizen will need to do is book a slot through WhatsApp and visit the civic headquarters at a time to be allotted by a designated officer who will be assigned to meet the applicants and do the needful after checking the valid documents,” said a KMC health department official. According to a KMC official associated with the birth and death certificate wing, the new system will bring transparency in issuance of birth and death certificates. “Citizens who particularly need help in cases of rectifying errors will be benefited after introduction of the new services,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/whatsapp-facility-for-birth-death-certs/articleshow/87787600.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s WPR down to 1%, testing up 31% compared to last week||PUNE: A 31% increase in Covid testing and 0.35% drop in weekly positivity rate were registered in the state in the seven-day period ending on November 17. Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) dipped to 1% from1.35% last week, stated the state public health department’s data. On the other hand, the weekly tests went up to 7.33 lakh in the state between November 11 and 17 from 5.6 lakh in the previous week — an increase of 1.73 lakh. Of these, more than 4.16 lakh were RTPCR tests and over 3.16 lakh tests were antigen tests. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said the dip in WPR was a good sign and most districts in the state were slowly inching towards the endemic stage. “Post-Diwali, the state’s WPR has decreased despite more relaxation in curbs. Still, we need to keep a close watch as most districts are reaching the endemic stage of Covid-19 and protocols should be followed strictly,” he said. A senior public health department official said, “Strict instructions were issued to local authorities conducting less than 1,000 tests weekly. Some of them were carrying out 500-600 tests each week. Six districts were pulled up and directed to scale up tests in a meeting.” Another official attributed the low testing in the previous week to shortage of staffers in many laboratories because it was the first week after the Diwali. Many did not even go for tests either, he felt. According to the recent data shared by the public health department, all districts had conducted over 1,000 tests in the November 11-17 week and WPR was dipping gradually in most districts. About 24 districts’ WPR was below 1%. With no fresh cases, Washim’s WPR was zero. Ten districts’ WPR was above 1%. Public health experts stressed on scaling up testing even if Covid cases continued to dip in the coming two weeks. Stating that it would be a good sign after all the curbs were lifted, one among them said, “Double-masking and increased vaccination is the way ahead.” Public health expert Dr R Jotkar said the testing should be scaled up and if WPR remained low , it would boost the confidence of planners to chalk out future strategy. “Testing volume should be scaled up where cases are comparatively higher,” said the expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-wpr-down-to-1-testing-up-31-compared-to-last-week/articleshow/87787602.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Jaipur||Parties should have power to disqualify MP/MLAs under anti-defection law: CP Joshi||JAIPUR: Assembly Speaker CP Joshi has advocated that the power to disqualify MPs and MLAs under the anti-defection law should also be given to political parties rather than limiting the power only for Lok Sabha and assembly speakers. He was speaking at the 82nd All India Presiding Officers' Conference held in Shimla. Joshi said if a member of the assembly, who wins the election on a ticket from a particular political party, is not behaving properly, then the party president should have the power to disqualify him/her under the anti-defection law because the party gives the MLA a ticket. But he said many of his colleagues do not agree with it. He appealed to the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to convene an all-party meeting to form a consensus on the issue. He argued that there are rules and regulations for a party member. If a party member does not behave, the party has the right to initiate action against that member. He said the party president should have the power to write to the election commission seeking disqualification of a member who won on a party ticket but violated party discipline. He said such a step would also help to discipline the members in the house. Joshi also said, “the Speaker often takes decisions influenced by the presidents of their respective parties. Therefore, we also need to introspect the role of the Speaker.” Citing an example, Joshi said if we look at the history from 1952 to 1967, the country was ruled by the Congress. But the more dominant personality than the president of the Congress party was Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parties-should-have-power-to-disqualify-mp/mlas-under-anti-defection-law-joshi/articleshow/87788274.cms||Joychen Joseph

Now, it is time for them to shift to the temporary shed built especially for them.” The fish vendors’ leader Caridade Pereira said, “We have been saying that nobody should be allowed to sell fish outside the market. This is not happening even after assurances from the municipality.

The project is being launched under the auspices of Haritha Kerala Mission and Suchitwa Mission. Keltron is in charge of developing and monitoring the web-based programme required for the mobile application. In the first phase of the project, mobile apps will be set up in 300 grama panchayats, six corporations and 70 municipalities. The mobile application will help to understand and manage the details of the amount of bio-inorganic waste collected from each household in the wards of the local bodies and how it is treated. QR codes will be provided to households using the mobile application and the information is collected with the help of the QR codes. The amount of waste collected from each location and their disposal figures will be made available in the app to enable all local bodies and related state and district level systems to track the progress of waste collection and treatment activities. The minister said that the project will be executed in local bodies with better infrastructure in the initial phase. Once the Smart Garbage mobile app initiative starts fully functioning, the plan would be expanded to other local bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mobile-app-for-waste-collection-monitoring/articleshow/87766691.cms||---

The school staff planted 60 areca trees four years ago, which are now yielding arecanuts. Fruits and medicinal plants have also been planted on the campus, that generate additional income for the school. The school is situated in a remote village in Bantwal, about 25 km from here. Its campus is spread over an acre. Due to the efforts of its teacher Bhaskar Naik M, the students actively participate in farming on campus. Half of the campus is covered with areca and fruit-yielding trees. Close to 150 varieties of trees, including medicinal plants, can be found on the school campus. Four years ago,class VII students had planted about 60 areca trees. “I am happy to say that this year they has started to yield arecanuts and we expect a good income,’’ said Bhaskar, a physical education teacher. He has been serving in the institution for the past three decades. Bhaskar added that his efforts have brought laurels to the school, as it has bagged the Green School Award or Hasiru Parisara Mitra Shale more than five times in the district. Farming activities are looked after by the students. The school has about 227 students studying from LKG to class VII. The profit earned from farming is utilised for school activities and for the development of the institution. Before the pandemic, the school campus used to grow vegetables, which were used for the midday meal programme. However, the land was lying unused due to the closure of schools owing to Covid-19. “The work done by Bhaskar is an inspiration for all of us, including the children, who love the environment and contribute towards preserving nature. He has turned our campus green. It has encouraged us to plant saplings and look after them,”said headmistress Umavathi N. The school has been there for 85 years. Umavathi said that most of the school infrastructure has got dilapidated, and that there is a need for a new building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-school-generates-income-through-farming/articleshow/87787545.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Aurangabad||Experts pitch for 4% education quota for 50 marginalised castes among Muslims||Aurangabad: Experts and researchers pitched for 4% reservation in education for 50 marginalised castes from the Muslim community while quoting statistics from different reports. Experts of the Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP), along with the Dua foundation, had gathered in Aurangabad on Thursday to highlight the need for reservation in education for the deprived sections of the Muslim community. During the meet, CDPP director and economist Amir Ullah Khan said that the PM’s dream of five trillion economy cannot be achieved by failing to bring women, who are over 49% of the population, and Muslims, who are 14% of the population, into the mainstream. He told TOI, “The data shows that Muslim representation is far below the acceptable level in the country. For positive GDP, merely doubling the production is not enough, there should be doubling of consumption by the citizens as well.” Speaking on the occasion, professor Venkatnarayana Motukurri showed reservations across the country and the background of each reservation. Tata Institute of Social Science’s prof Abdul Shaban, who joined the meeting from Paris, cited findings of different surveys by committees and commissions, and demanded implementation of the Mahmoodur Rehman Committee recommendations, including share of Muslim women in 33% reservation, minimum 8% reservation in state services as well as education, expansion of OBC list, inclusion of Dalit Muslims into scheduled caste. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said this is the first step towards bringing the community into the mainstream and contributing towards the overall development of the country. “To get what the Muslims deserve rightfully, we will not hesitate to take to the streets,” he said. Speaking on the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in Maharashtra, high court advocate Sagheer Khan said, “For similar offences, 47-57% Muslims, Dalits and scheduled tribes are failing to get bail, while the upper castes and influential people have bail rate of 97%.” While demanding substantive study on the issue, he said the disparity is either due to lack of resources or due to institutional bias. The experts also stated that various surveys and commissions have found that 83.2% Muslims in the state do not hold agricultural land, 56% of the Muslim population in Maharashtra does not hold any assets, while only 0.7% Muslim families have an annual income of over Rs 3.6 lakh per annum, and every third persone in prison is a Muslim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-pitch-for-4-education-quota-for-50-marginalised-castes-among-muslims/articleshow/87786074.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He said the investigation is essential to find the real perpetrators of the violence and to ascertain involvement of political parties, if any. “We not only condemn the violence, but also appeal for peace. There should be an inquiry to find out why and how the violence took place and whose dereliction it was,” said Owaisi. Answering a question on different civic bodies in Gujarat ordering the removal of non-vegetarian food stalls from streets, Owaisi said that it was an anti-poor move. “Not all the non-vegetarian people — Hindus or Muslims — can afford to go to lavish restaurants to eat non-vegetarian food. The decision to remove roadside non-vegetarian food stalls is anti-poor.” On the reservation issue, Owaisi said his party will take to the streets and reach out to people in each district in Maharashtra and raise the issues of reservation and wakf properties. Asking why the Maratha community has suddenly become silent ob reservation, Owaisi said: “If the Maratha community is willing come with us, we are ready to support them. We will demand reservation for the Muslims, whether people come with us or not,” he said. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said in the coming month, as a show of unity and strength, people from across Maharashtra will head to Mumbai to demand rightful reservation, which even the high court has favoured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/owaisi-condemns-violence-seeks-probe/articleshow/87786064.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Hyderabad||JNTU-Hyderabad nod must for new engineering courses, rules SC||HYDERABAD: Making it clear that Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, has the final say in approving new engineering courses or enhancing seats in Telangana, the Supreme Court on Thursday made it mandatory for several private engineering colleges in the state, including Hyderabad, to obtain affiliation from the university after meeting its set criteria. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and A Bopanna pronounced this order after hearing the appeal filed by JNTU registrar Dr M Manzoor Hussain, who challenged an interim direction given by Telangana high court ordering affiliation to all those colleges which had obtained permission from AICTE. JNTU-Hyderabad oversees technical education across Telangana. Several private engineering colleges, which have secured AICTE nod for an additional 2,500 seats in computer science engineering, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the Internet of things, etc, have to now submit themselves to the authority of JNTU-Hyderabad and prove their infra credentials. While the colleges were insisting that they should be given permission to go ahead because AICTE had permitted them, JNTU said that they have to first obtain a no objection certificate (NoC) from the state and the process of affiliation would start only after that. Senior counsel C S Vaidyanathan, defending the action of JNTU, said the state has to plan the educational facilities in a proportionate manner and it had a bounden-duty to prevent mushrooming of similar courses at one point and the university has the responsibility to grant affiliation to only those colleges that have the required infrastructure. As the state later accorded NoC to several colleges, the bench, however, recorded the assurance of JNTU that it would complete the inspections within 10 days. The bench, while staying the Telangana HC order, however, directed JNTU to place its reports before the HC after inspection. The HC would take decisions in respect of each of the colleges after verifying the inspection reports furnished by JNTU.

The move comes amid reports of a 29-year-old MSRTC employee allegedly dying by suicide in Buldhana district. Vishal Ambalkar, a resident of Matargaon in Khamgaon taluka, had consumed poison at his house on Tuesday night. A senior MSRTC official told TOI, “We have floated a tender to invite private bus contractors to provide 500 buses on an urgent basis in the first phase along with drivers under a ‘wet lease’ model. These buses will cater to at least a lakh commuters in various districts across the state.” He further said that if the agitation continues for a longer time, the MSRTC will float more tenders to hire 500 to 1,000 additional private buses along with drivers in subsequent phases. Meanwhile, the talks with unions remained inconclusive on Thursday as the bus corporation’s treasury was hit hard with losses to the tune of over Rs 200 crore due to the bus strike, sources said. Transport minister Anil Parab met the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis to discuss several issues, including the ongoing strike of the ST workers. “The state government has made multiple appeals asking the striking employees to report to work, but they have not responded yet. Fadnavis has made some suggestions. We will examine those and a decision will be taken,” said Parab. On the passenger front, several daily commuters and passenger rights activists on Thursday demanded that bus services be restarted. “There are many villages which depend entirely on ST (state transport) service and where there is poor availability of private vehicles such as autos or taxis,” said Jayawant Darekar of Kokan Vikas Samiti. Also, office-goers in the Mumbai metropolitan region depend on ST to travel to work. Passenger rights activist Gaurang Vora said, “It’s an essential service and you cannot hold commuters to ransom.” Vinod Gholap, president, Fight for Right Foundation, which represents commuters, said, “The commuters are facing a major hardship as they are at the mercy of private vehicle operators, who charge more than double the MSRTC fare.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-to-rope-in-500-pvt-buses-to-deal-with-strike/articleshow/87790143.cms||Somit Sen

The protesting farmers claimed that the centre in charge had rejected their paddy on the ground that “it doesn’t meet the procurement standards fixed by the government,” leaving them with no option but to sell their produce to private vendors at a lower price. Farmer leader Shyamu Shukla told TOI, “We staged protests in various parts of Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur districts against discrepancies in paddy procurement. The protest was called off after the assurance that tehsildars would visit the procurement centres to address the farmers’ issues.” Maiganganj police station SHO Chiranjivi Mohan said, “The farmers withdrew their protest after over three hours when administrative officials assured them of transparency in the procurement process. The situation is under control, and the paddy procurement is going on at the centres.” Earlier, a farmer had set his paddy crop on fire after the procurement centre in charge in Mohammadi town had allegedly refused to buy his produce. Kheri’s DM had already asked the farmers to make videos and share them with his officials if they faced any difficulties in selling paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/failing-to-sell-their-paddy-at-msp-farmers-climb-atop-water-tank-to-protest-discrepancies-in-procurement/articleshow/87786835.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Online game addiction takes boy’s life||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The parents of a 14-year-old boy who was found dead at home two weeks ago under unnatural circumstances have claimed that their son was addicted to video games, which affected his mental wellbeing and eventually led him to take his own life. The parents Shanavas and Sajeena of Chirayinkeezhu have told the media that they discovered about his online gaming addiction only after his death, when they examined his mobile phone which they provided him for online classes. Their son Sabith was found dead on November 8, hanging in his room. The police had taken possession of his mobile phone as part of the investigation. However, the phone was handed back to the parents after they requested it. It was after that the parents found their son’s collection of online games locked away in a folder secured with password. The parents also told the media that they have spoken out so that other parents would take this as a warning and take necessary measures to ensure that their wards are safe from such addictive games. Following this revelation, the police officials on Wednesday visited the couple and took back the phone for detailed scientific examination. They said that the phone will be sent to the cyber experts for examination. The police have acted after the higher ups in the department directed the local police to investigate whether the allegations made by the parents of the boy are true. The senior officers of the department are also of the opinion that the local police should not have given the phone back to the parents instead of sending it to the scientific experts. Meanwhile, sources in the police also said that the parents must not have made these remarks without scientifically confirming their doubts. “The boy has not left any clue to the actual reason behind his death. The reasons could be anything such as personal issues or even cyber harassment as kids these days spend most of their time online,” said an officer who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/online-game-addiction-takes-boys-life/articleshow/87766704.cms||---

While the dues concerned is the highest in the past five years, the authorities said the Covid outbreak in March last year has further mounted the dues. Of the total outstanding amount, Rs 263.4 crore are pending towards the non-irrigation sector, which includes public water supply schemes of different local self-governing bodies and industries etc. The remaining Rs 87.7 crore dues are pending towards the irrigation needs, including the farming community. S K Sabbinwar, the superintendent engineer of the Command Area Development Authority of the GMIDC, said the financial crisis arising out of the pandemic situation among different water users has hampered the recovery of irrigation dues. “Both local self-governing bodies and the farming community cite weak financial conditions when it comes to payment of dues. The timely payment of dues is essential for upkeep and value-addition of different infrastructure involving the dam and canal systems,” he said. Sabbinwar said the department engaged in the recovery of irrigation dues was reeling under staff crunch. Assistant engineer with CADA Jaisingh Hire said some of the industries and power plants also figure among defaulters. Water rights activist Abhijeet Dhanorkar said a huge recovery amount of GMIDC, especially that from the non-irrigation sector was a reason to worry. The local self-governing bodies need to improve their tax-recovery to pay money towards public water supply scheme, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mwada-irrigation-dues-highest-in-5-yrs/articleshow/87786081.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), public health services, Pune circle, told TOI, “Over three lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin are available with the public health services units. The state has asked us to exhaust the current stock to get the new one.” According to Deshmukh, there was a vaccine stock crisis in the district in May, June, and the first-half of August. He said the vaccine stock had never been an issue for Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad or Pune rural — the main vaccination units of the district — from September onwards. The November 11 Covid-19 vaccination report of the district health office stated that around 6 lakh Covishield and around one lakh Covaxin doses were in the buffer stock. Most of them were with Pune rural, it stated. Deshmukh said the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive has pushed up the pace of vaccination and helped in creating awareness among the hesitant population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dists-buffer-stock-surpasses-3-lakh/articleshow/87787630.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Delhi||E-vehicles in Delhi can ply in no-entry hours||NEW DELHI: In a move that will contribute to the battle against air pollution and also give a boost to the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) in the national capital, transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Thursday announced exemption for e-light goods vehicles (e-LCV) during “no-entry” hours. Gahlot said there would be no prohibition on e-LCVs from plying and idle parking on identified roads during the “no-entry” hours as notified by the transport department. Earlier in the day, he took to social media to announce that the department will empanel manufacturers of electric kits for retrofitting conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric ones. Transport officials said this would be particularly beneficial to the owners of diesel-run vehicles that were more than 10 years old and were not allowed to ply in Delhi. “Delhi is now open to ICE to electric retrofitting! Vehicles, if found fit, can convert their diesel into electric engine, dept'll empanel manufacturers of pure electric kit by approved testing agencies. Once empanelled, this’ll enable vehicles to continue plying here beyond 10 years,” Gahlot tweeted. Later, Gahlot said the movement of commercial vehicles had been restricted on over 250 major roads from 7am to 11am and 5pm to 9pm due to congestion during peak hours and vehicular pollution. On average, 300 challans are issued every day by the department’s enforcement teams against vehicles without a valid pollution under control certificate (PUCC), he added. A total of 280 challans were issued on Tuesday and 390 on Wednesday at petrol pumps, where the department has deployed enforcement teams and civil defence volunteers for PUCC checking, Gahlot said, adding that stringent enforcement had led to a big rise in the number of PUCC being issued. “We are committed to implementing each and every promise made under the EV policy in the best way possible, and implementing this provision is a proof,” Gahlot said. The L5N category electric three-wheeler goods carrier and N1 category electric goods carrier with gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes will now be allowed to ply in Delhi at any time, he added. Delhi Traffic Police has also issued a circular in line with the Delhi government’s decision, he pointed out. “Since the launch of EV policy, the sale of e-LCVs has gone up from just 46 to 1,054, a 95.6% hike in the registration. We are hopeful that today’s decision would give a huge push to mass adoption of EVs across categories in Delhi,” Gahlot said. He said that with a target of 25% of new vehicle registrations by 2024 to be electric, the Delhi government put a significant focus on the electrification of shared and commercial transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-vehicles-can-ply-in-no-entry-hours/articleshow/87788346.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Unable to handle the rejection, the accused kidnapped her, assaulted her and abused her before dropping her home. A complaint in this regard has been filed with the Anandnagar police on Thursday. The woman, who works as a recruiter with a firm in Satellite, told police, “I came in contact with Ghanshyam Rajput, a resident of Hatkeshwar, when I was in Class 10. My friend was in love with him. After many years, I met him in July 2020. By August 2020, we began meeting regularly and exchanged numbers. Once when I did not have my vehicle, Rajput dropped me home. Later, however, I found out that he was married with two kids. Meanwhile, my parents had begun looking for a match for me so I blocked Rajput and stopped talking to him.” She alleged that when she was leaving office around 7.30pm on Wednesday, Rajput was waiting for her in a car. “He intercepted my vehicle and, with the help of his friend Rajesh Marathi, kidnapped me and moved towards Sarkhej. She claimed that she shouted for help but the two speeded the vehicle. “In the car, Rajput assaulted and abused me. My spectacles fell off and I was unable to figure out where they were taking me. After nearly 30 minutes, they stopped outside my house. My mother was rpesent there. Rajput kept abusing and assaulting me. Meanwhile, a third man came and started abusing me too,” he said. Hearing the ruckus, people began to gather at the spot. When the woman’s father and elder brother arrived, Rajput and his friend fled the spot after threatening her to leave her job and stay in her house if she did not want to die. A complaint under IPC Section 365 (kidnapping), 294. (b) (utters obscene words), and 323 ( voluntarily causing hurt) has been lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jilted-man-kidnaps-assaults-24-year-old/articleshow/87787614.cms||---
---||Thane||Thane Municipal Corporation allegedly spent Rs 5 crore on beautifying pvt garden||THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has spent nearly Rs 5 crore on redeveloping and beautifying a private garden in the Shrinagar area of the city, corporators informed the Thane general body, on Thursday. The startling expose was made in the House, Thursday, after Shiv Sena corporator Gurmukh Singh raised a question over the ownership of the garden in his ward. He claimed the corporation had recently moved a plan to rename the garden even and sought to know if the facility was owned by the corporation. A red-faced administration claimed it was unaware of the ownership status of the garden and hinted it could possibly be a private property. Officials from the corporation told the House that the redevelopment and beautification was approved by the general body previously, which made the members ask why the administration had failed to check its ownership title. Meanwhile, Singh also pointed to a similar situation where the corporation was unaware of a 10k sqm plot in the Wagle estate ward that was to be handed over to the transport undertaking several years back. Fellow corporator Radhika Fatak also pointed out a discrepancy where a developer had encroached upon a nullah adjoining his project. Mayor Naresh Mhaske took cognisance of the issues and ordered the administration to ensure the garden was acquired at the earliest else launch a probe on how and why the corporation spent money for beautification and upkeep of a private facility. “The estate department has to keep records of corporation property and ensure it isn’t usurped,” he said, directing the administration to survey the city and keep record of all corporation owned and acquired properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-tmc-allegedly-spent-rs-5cr-on-beautifying-pvt-garden/articleshow/87790147.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Under the programme, book stands will be put up at various public places, mainly bus stands, of every gram panchayat. The books will be placed in a glass case for the public to use. Meanwhile, notebooks were distributed to 285 government school students from Siribagilu and Kombaru. The programme was undertaken as part of CSR activity of Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd (KIOCL) in association with the District Working Journalists’ Association (DWJA). The ZP CEO said in January, DWJA held a village-stay programme and was able to find solutions to several problems of Siribagilu and Kombaru. The association’s concern towards social needs is laudable, he added. “Government school children from these remote villages do not receive government facilities on time. When classes went online due to the pandemic, many children here were not able to get access to online classes due to poor internet connectivity. Some parents have no cellphones. In such a scenario, government school teachers have a major responsibility to teach them. The scene here is quite different compared to urban areas, where parents take interest in their child’s academic performance,” he said.

Arpita managed to persuade the Maoists to free Ajay Roshan Lakra, 35, on Wednesday after he was held captive for six days. Journalists and social organisations of Bastar too had approached the Maoists to get Ajay released. The sub-engineer and peon Lakshman Partagiri, 24, were kidnapped on November 11 from a Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna work site. Partagiri was released after two days but Lakra continued to be held hostage. Bijapur police said Ajay was released on Wednesday after Arpita, who had carried her son into the dense forest, requested the Maoists to free him. According to Bastar journalists, when Maoists came to know that he is not a road contractor but an engineer, they decided to let him go. Ajay was brought before a ‘people’s court’ in a village in the interiors of Bijapur. He was then blindfolded and taken to a rendezvous spot in the jungle from where villagers escorted him to Gangloor Road. On seeing her husband, Arpita broke down and the emotional reunion moved villagers and journalists who had accompanied them. Arpita couldn’t stop thanking the people for intervening on her behalf. According to police, the Maoists took Lakra for a road contractor and abducted him. When Arpita reached the forest, along with a group of activists, journalists and villagers, looking for Lakra, the Maoists released him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhattisgarh-baby-in-lap-woman-walks-into-jungle-frees-hubby-from-naxals/articleshow/87790145.cms||---

Inspector general, prisons, Manoj Kumar, confirmed the development saying, “The jail administration of Saraikela had requested that Bose and five others be shifted on security grounds. The administration had also stated that Bose was suffering from various ailments and needed to be kept in a centre with better medical facilities.” Kumar said in view of the concerns raised by the authorities and the recommendation of the Saraikela deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police in this regard, the order for shifting them was issued on Thursday. Official sources said Birsa Munda Central Jail has the best medical facilities among the prisons in the state. Besides, the patients could be refrred to higher medical centre, Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (Rims) without difficulty from the jail. The decision to shift Bose and others to Birsa Munda Central Jail was also taken as it would be more convenient for investigating agencies arriving from different parts of the country to interrogate him. The responsibility of transferring the Maoists to the Birsa Munda Central Jail lies with the district administration concerned. The authorities have to, however, take permission of the local court before implementing the decision. It may be stated here that Sheela, who was admitted in Rims on Wednesday after an attack of epilepsy is stated to be stable at present. The doctors said further investigations would be carried out later. Bose, his wife and four other Maoists were caught by the police under Kandra police station area in Saraikela district on November 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kishan-da-aides-to-be-moved-to-birsa-munda-jail-for-better-security/articleshow/87787419.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Chairing a meeting of the party’s office bearers and functionaries on Thursday afternoon, Mahto, the Silli MLA, accused the government of trying to make the panchayati raj system irrelevant by delaying the . “It is clear that the government has given a free hand to bureaucrats and it is not keen to decentralise the governance. The delay in elections is having adverse effect on the development at the district and panchayat levels,” Mahto said. The state government has postponed the panchayat elections, originally due last year, by over 12 months citing the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 4,000 panchayat bodies in Jharkhand received an extension in their tenure in August this year through an ordinance which was brought about by the state government. Mahto also criticised the government for failing to fulfill its poll promises. “Two years is a long time for a government to deliver. Ajsu will tell the people of Jharkhand how many steps has this government has taken in the last two years,” Mahto said. At the meeting, Mahto directed the party officials to strengthen their grassroots units for the panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ajsu-slams-govt-for-delaying-rural-polls/articleshow/87787462.cms||---

In September this year, the civic body had served notices to the cable companies and the customers and sought to know whether they had obtained the RMC’s permission to use the electric poles for hanging the cables. “The electric poles come under the state electricity department but the land comes under RMC’s jurisdiction. There are cables dangling all over the city and they often lead to accidents, sometimes eve fatal ones,” Kunwar Singh Pahan, the deputy municipal commissioner of RMC, told TOI when asked the rationale behind the notice. “For instance, there are naked wires dangling in Main Road which can lead to accidents. So it is important to cut the unauthorized wires,” Pahan added. The move is in pursuance with Section 126 of the Jharkhand Municipal Act, 2011 where there is a provision about vesting of property and the municipality had already ordered three notices in the wake of Jharkhand high court’s mandate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rmc-notice-to-remove-cables-from-electric-poles/articleshow/87787301.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Anil Deshmukh will be out of jail soon, get his job back: NCP leader Praful Patel||NAGPUR: NCP leader Praful Patel said former home minister Anil Deshmukh would soon be out of jail and, with the blessings of party supremo Sharad Pawar, reinstated in his previous position in the MVA government. Pawar was present when he spoke. Addressing party workers, the former aviation minister said Deshmukh’s rehabilitation was on Pawar’s mind too. “Nobody should think that a big vacuum has been created in Deshmukh’s absence,” he said. Stressing that the former minister and Katol MLA was a key figure in NCP, Pawar said he missed Deshmukh’s presence on his visit to Nagpur. “Today is the first day in many years that I have come to Nagpur, and Anil babu is not here with me. We have been working together for many years, but this had never happened before,” he said. Alleging “misuse” of Central agencies in targeting the state’s ministers and destabilising the MVA government, Pawar said the opposition would be made to pay for putting Deshmukh behind bars. “You will be made to pay the price for every day and every hour” that Deshmukh spends in jail, he said, without naming the BJP. ‘After losing power, some sending list of possible targets to Delhi’When you have power, you need to handle it carefully and respectfully, with feet firmly on ground…those who lost it, resort to intimidating tactics like harassing and defaming others.” Taking a dig at the local BJP leadership, the former Union agriculture minister said after losing power in the state, some unscrupulous elements were sending their senior leaders in Delhi a list of possible targets and accordingly the central agencies were targeting them. “After switching sides, senior leader Eknath Khadse and wife were summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). As nothing could be done to MP Sanjay Raut, his wife was targeted. Similarly, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sister was harassed after the government failed to indict him. Minister Hassan Mushrif's home was raided but nothing found. There are numerous examples.” Flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, the veteran politician said even as the prices of essential commodities skyrocketed, the regime was busy harassing opposition leaders. “I recently visited Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur district, where farmers, including senior citizens and women, were fighting for their rights for over a year. Similar protests are happening in other states like Rajasthan and Haryana. However, the NDA government does not have time to listen to the grievances of those who feed the nation. Its leaders are piling up miseries on the farmers and common citizens, and there is a need to teach them a lesson.” Calling on workers to work under Patel’s guidance in strengthening the party’s base in Vidarbha, Pawar said the change would begin from Nagpur and spread across Vidarbha. “I was a bit sceptical of workers’ morale while arriving in the city in Deshmukh’s absence. But looking at your enthusiasm, I am sure that any misuse of power would not deter you in standing behind the party. With all your hard work, we have formed the MVA government under CM Uddhav Thackeray. Our aim is to provide a stable government that will take Maharashtra to prosperity,” he said. The NCP chief later cancelled his Wardha and Yavatmal tours due to official reasons, according to NCP city chief Duneshwar Pathe, who was with him at Wadsa in Gadchiroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anil-deshmukh-will-be-out-of-jail-soon-get-his-job-back/articleshow/87790192.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In his letter, Dubey batted for a viable and lawful alternative to cryptocurrencies in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) which several central banks are exploring for use in their economies. A digital currency issued by central banks may remove intermediaries, such as retail banks, and will use blockchain to ensure it is not replicated or hacked, Dubey said. “Cryptocurrencies can be used anywhere and cannot be easily traced,” the Jharkhand parliamentarian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-mp-seeks-ban-on-unregulated-cryptos/articleshow/87790247.cms||---

The child had completed her deposition against the 23-year-old deaf and mute accused in 2019. However, the defence wanted her back in court “to confront her with her statement given to the magistrate.” It said that this had to be done to bring out contradiction, omissions and improvements between the statements. While an opportunity was given to the defence in April, the lawyer did not turn up as he had a “cold”. “Though the application for recalling of victim was allowed previously and the opportunity was granted to the accused, the accused failed to avail the opportunity... only a vague statement is made about the illness (of the lawyer) without any supporting evidence for the same. Therefore, the accused cannot claim that his right to fair trial has been extinguished,” the special Pocso court said. The accused has been out on bail since April 2018. The FIR was lodged in 2016. The prosecution submitted that the child should not be harassed by repeatedly calling her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pocso-court-rejects-plea-to-recall-survivor-for-questioning/articleshow/87790266.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi: After years of trying, plan to clean Yamuna by '2025'||NEW DELHI: Yamuna, virtually a dead river in Delhi with 22 drains spewing sewage into it across its 22km stretch in the city, may get another shot at salvation. Decades after the first clean-up attempts, CM Arvind Kejriwal unveiled a major six-point plan on Thursday to cleanse the river by February 2025. He said he will himself take a dip in the river before the next assembly elections. The plan includes setting up new sewage treatment plants, increasing the capacity of the existing STPs, roping in new technology to make sure no pollutant enters the river, going for in-situ treatment of the major drains in the city and diverting all industrial waste to treatment plants. The drains of public toilets in JJ clusters will be connected to the larger sewer network to completely stop stormwater drains from being polluted. The government also plans to connect every household to the sewer network so that no waste from household toilets flows into the drains. The entire sewer network of Delhi will be desilted and rehabilitated, it said. It's a tall order but the chief minister said the work was being undertaken on a war footing. He will be personally monitoring the entire exercise. Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said his government has fixed timelines. "We are aiming to completely clean the Yamuna by February 2025. I will keep revisiting the progress of the plan every 15 to 30 days," he asserted. He later tweeted: "I do what I say. I always deliver upon my promises. Will definitely clean Yamuna before the next election." The 22-km urban stretch of the river, from Wazirabad to Okhla, is severely polluted, as reported recently by TOI. The latest report on the water quality by Delhi Pollution Control Committee in October this year, based on data from eight monitoring stations, revealed that it does not meet the standards set for dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). According to the report, DO, which is the amount of oxygen in the river water, had failed to meet the criteria of 5 mg/l or more at all the eight stations. A higher BOD indicates that the amount for oxygen-demanding species to feed on is less. The prescribed standard for BOD in Yamuna is 3mg/l or less but it was 34 mg/l at the ISBT bridge, 40mg/l at Agra canal (Okhla), 58mg/l at downstream Okhla barrage and 54mg/l at Asgarpur. The toxic foam covering the river often makes headlines and recently lead to a political uproar during the Chhat puja. The CM had then said that the buck stops with him and that his government will clean the river. "The current state of the river is a result of 70 years of pollution - carrying all of Delhi's waste - and cannot be undone in two days," said Kejriwal. "Many untreated sewers end up flowing into the Yamuna, carrying a large volume of chemicals and pollutants, thereby contaminating it. Currently, we are equipped to treat around 600 MGD when we need our capacity to be around 850 MGD," the CM said. "For this, work is going on to improve treatment and cleaning of sewers on three fronts - building new sewer treatment plants such as the ones at Coronation Park, Okhla, Kondli and Rithala; increasing the capacity of the existing treatment plants; and lastly, adopting new technologies for the treatment plants because the current outdated mechanisms give out polluted sewage even after treatment. We will ensure a 10:10 ratio of output after treatment," he asserted. The government says it will also ensure in-situ treatment of the water in four major drains in Delhi, that is, the cleaning work will be undertaken on the spot, using new technology. " Kejriwal said his government will crack down on industries not treating industrial waste. "On paper, industrial waste gets treated before being disposed of, but in reality there's not much substance to it. We will ensure that all the effluent treatment plants work to the best of their capacity. If an industry is found not to be sending its waste to treatment plants, it will be shut immediately by the authorities. There will be no compromise," he said. The plan envisages connecting all JJ clusters to the sewer network. At many places, public toilet complexes have been connected to stormwater drains instead of the sewerage. The CM announced that under Mukhyamantri Sewer Connection Yojana, all households will be connected to the sewer network.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-after-years-of-trying-plan-to-clean-yamuna-by-2025/articleshow/87790262.cms||Alok KN Mishra
---||Goa||‘Non-issuance of e-visas to UK tourists may impact bookings’||PANAJI: Even as the Union government has started issuing visas to travellers from the UK, British tourists planning holidays to Goa aren’t likely to have a smooth ride here. Since India does not provide them e-visas, they are left with no option but to visit their local high commission office for a visa. “It is not easy to get a visa. Goa has a huge number of repeat clients with long stays, and usually they are senior citizens who travel to avoid the harsh winters of England. They are eager to come, but are having difficulties getting visas,” said Ralph de Souza, president, Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). Even as getting the visa isn’t easy, there’s also the pendency of applications to account for, as several Indian expats were unable to visit their home country over the past two years, due to the pandemic. Sources said that the Indian expats too are having problems getting their visas stamped, as processing of applications takes time. “But when tourists apply for visas, they are likely to have to wait for (even) longer,” said de Souza. He added that although India has removed quarantine conditions and permitted vaccinated travellers entry, the crucial factor now is that visas are hard to come by. “The only solution is that India starts issuing e-visas. Otherwise, bookings by tourists are likely to be affected,” he said. The GCCI president said they have made a representation to chief minister Pramod Sawant “to use his good office to intervene in the matter”. The chamber has also sought the help of Union minister Shripad Naik. Interestingly, India is also not issuing e-visas to travellers from Kazakhstan, another country that matters to Goa for tourism. “With regards to the UK, we will again approach the government. If the issue is not sorted out, we will have fewer footfalls from England. If Goa is not available, there are other destinations that offer e-visas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-issuance-of-e-visas-to-uk-tourists-may-impact-bookings/articleshow/87787976.cms||---

The visit assumes significance as the former chief minister, who was first elected to the Goa legislative assembly in 1994 and won six elections from the Panaji constituency, always began his campaign with a visit to the Mahalaxmi temple. Responding to a query on whether his visit was to kickstart his own campaign, Utpal said that he has already started meeting people. “It being my birthday, everyone requested me to pray at the temple. I’m getting the people’s support,” he said. “I prayed to the goddess to give me strength. There are plenty of my father’s supporters, and they are my strength.” Former CM's brother Avdhoot Parrikar was also present. On Thursday, Utpal reiterated that he has informed the party that he wants to contest, and was confident BJP would give him the ticket. However, he didn’t comment on what he plans to do if the party denies him the ticket. While Utpal has been vocal about his political aspirations, he was not active in politics before his father’s death. As of now, none of BJP’s senior functionaries or leaders have commented either for or against his move to secure the party ticket from his father’s longtime constituency when the party has a sitting MLA there. “I don’t want to talk about it now, but Manohar Parrikar did not get anything in his life without a struggle,” Utpal said. “Similarly, I too will have to work hard, and may have to take some difficult decisions.” He, however, didn’t divulge what those “difficult decisions” could be. Political observers say that Utpal received good response from BJP karyakartas and former defence minister’s supporters, on his birthday. In 2014, when Manohar Parrikar vacated his seat to become India’s defence minister, his aide Sidharth Kuncalienker was elected in the bypoll. In 2017, after his resignation as defence minister, Kuncalienker stepped down and Parrikar was re-elected as Panaji MLA. However, after Parrikar’s death in 2019, Kuncalienker was defeated by then Congress candidate Atanasio Monserrate in the bypoll. However, Panaji returned to BJP in July, when a breakaway group of Congress MLAs led by current deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/utpal-visits-city-temple-reiterates-confidence-in-securing-bjp-ticket/articleshow/87787984.cms||---

The party said that traffic along the route is heightened due to tourism and the festive season and the government needs to ensure that commuters do not suffer. GFP functionary Jagdish Bhobe who stated that he will contest St Andre constituency seat said that it takes almost two hours to cross the 7km-stretch till Cortalim with serpentine queues of vehicles seen on a daily basis. “There are feast and novenas. During this festive period people will suffer commuting from this area as traffic jams are witnessed every passing day,” Bhobe said. GFP has sought chief minister Pramod Sawant’s intervention. “There is threat to people’s life who wait for buses along the road as there are no proper bus stands in this area,” said Bhobe. GFP thanked the state government for finally hiking the salary of Ayush doctors from Rs20,000 to Rs50,000 per month. The 82 Ayush doctors who are under the national health mission (NHM) got the hike after GFP president Vijai Sardesai raised the issue in the assembly.

During the 45-minute meeting, the financial statements of the company for the year 2020-21 were also approved. “He emphasised on scheme management. None of the scheme beneficiaries should be made to come to any government office for application. There are many schemes that are coming and all should be uploaded on Goaonline,” an official said. GEL has also taken over the ore tracking and management system, which has helped bring down the monthly cost for truck owners from Rs 850 per month to Rs 450 per month Additionally, with the setup of the control room the complete data monitoring and management will be handled by GEL at the mines department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-urges-gel-to-maximise-e-gov-bring-all-depts-onboard/articleshow/87788009.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Govt opposes Majithia’s plea to be made party in drug haul case||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Thursday vehemently opposed the plea filed by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia asking to be made a party in the Punjab’s drug haul case pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court. When the matter came up for resumed hearing on Thursday before the division bench comprising Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Maudgil, senior advocates Dushyant Dave and A P S Deol informed the court that they would be representing the state of Punjab in this case. The bench, however, observed that it would need some more time to examine the record of the case as Justice Maudgil is a new member to the bench and would require time to summarise the case. Dave, representing the state of Punjab, however, requested the bench to fix the matter for an early date of hearing. Dave said that the situation of drugs in Punjab had already been aggravated and the case had been pending in the court for a long time. He also added that even the Supreme Court (SC) had also said in 2015 for early disposal of this case. He stated that the Punjab government was committed to take action in the matter and requested the bench read the reports and hand it over to the state so that they can act accordingly. Dave also opposed the plea move by Majithia. He said the former minister did not have the right to be heard in the case. On this, the counsel representing Majithia said that before taking any decision, he should also be heard on the issue. The bench said that they would first examine the plea and then take any decision on this issue. Thereafter the matter was adjourned for December 6 for further hearing. In his plea, Majithia had contended that a malicious and mala fide agenda had been launched by his political opponents in the garb of public interest only to target him. The former minister also alleged that Punjab’s deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu were running unwarranted propaganda on drug issue against him. He has also claimed that neither the STF of Punjab police nor ED had found any evidence against him in relation to the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-opposes-majithias-plea-to-be-made-party-in-drug-haul-case/articleshow/87788649.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Khaira alleges his arrest as vendetta by Cong, insists money was collected by AAP workers||Mohali: Former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and Punjab Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira alleged that his arrest is an act of vendetta by some party insiders. He said, “Some hidden devils in Congress were conspiring to defame me and I will expose them at right time.” Khaira said this during his court appearance in Mohali on Thursday before being sent to judicial custody. He was produced in the court after seven-day police remand by the enforcement directorate (ED) in money laundering case. The case was adjourned for December 2. Khaira said truth can be suppressed but could not be overpowered and added that he would continue to fight until his last breath. On the money laundering case, Khaira said ED had not given them the copy of the case nor given the grounds for his arrest till date. He said his lawyer was only allowed to read ECIR registered against him. He said only thing which came to the fore in the paper presented by the ED was that he collected money in the name of Aam Aadmi Party. He said he had visited 16 cities and the tour was sponsored by the AAP and the money was collected only by the AAP workers. Khaira said ED has taken the scheduled offence on the basis of the NDPS case of 2017, in which one of the accused was arrested in NDPS case and was later sentenced to 20 years in jail. Supreme Court has granted stay in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khaira-alleges-his-arrest-as-vendetta-by-cong-insists-money-was-collected-by-aap-workers/articleshow/87788666.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The post had fallen vacant after the resignation of Veerendra Dhavlikar. Councillors Archana Dangui and Jaya Sawant had filed their nominations for the post and a special meeting was convened at the PMC hall to vote and elect the new deputy on Thursday. Ponda deputy collector Pradip Naik, who was observer for the meeting, declared the Sawant winner after she secured nine votes against her rival Dangui’s seven votes in the 15-member council. The voting was held by secret ballot, Naik said. The party had suffered first jolt when Kolvenkar, then BJP Ponda block president, had wrested the post of chairperson of the council on May 18 by defeating his own party candidate Ritesh Naik, son of Ponda Congress MLA Ravi Naik. Almost four months later, on October 4, BJP’s efforts to oust Kolvenkar fizzled out as no councillor, including those who had moved the motion, turned up for the special meeting to vote on the no-trust motion .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-backed-jaya-elected-to-ponda-councils-dy-post/articleshow/87788044.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

We strongly condemn this act of terror and firmly stand by the family of the deceased,” Vaidya said in a statement after visiting the bereaved family. He lamented that the democratically elected state government had failed to prevent such targeted killings. “Since it’s evident from the previous experiences that there’s a clandestine understanding between the ruling CPM and Islamist forces in the targeted killing of Swayamsevaks, we demand a fair probe in this matter and the perpetrators of violence should be booked and punished at the earliest,” Vaidya said. “We demand the central government to intervene in the matter if justice is not delivered under the CPM government. We also demand a detailed NIA probe into the murder of Sanjith as the perpetrators allegedly have terrorist links,” he said. Vaidya urged both the state and Centre to further probe the terrorist connections and anti-national activities of PFI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manmohan-vaidya-accuses-kerala-govt-of-targeted-killings-of-rss-workers/articleshow/87790308.cms||---
