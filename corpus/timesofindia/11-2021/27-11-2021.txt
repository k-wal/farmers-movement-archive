No decision to halt flights had yet been made, he said.  The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said White House officials were discussing potential travel restrictions on southern African countries. Those officials were expected to meet with agency officials this afternoon to make a recommendation, the newspaper said, without specifying which agency.  The White House referred to Fauci's earlier comments when asked about the report and declined further comment.  Global authorities have reacted with alarm to the new variant, detected in South Africa, with the European Union and Britain among those tightening border controls as scientists seek to find out if the mutation is vaccine-resistant.  The World Health Organization (WHO), however, has cautioned against hasty measures and South Africa said a British ban on flights seemed rushed.  "There is always the possibility of doing what the UK has done, namely block travel from South Africa and related countries," Fauci said in an interview on CNN.  "That's certainly something you think about and get prepared to do. You're prepared to do everything you need to protect the American public. But you want to make sure there's a basis for doing that," he said.  "Obviously as soon as we find out more information we'll make a decision as quickly as we possibly can."  Fauci said US scientists would speak with South African counterparts on Friday about the new variant, called B.1.1.529, which has raised concern about its transmissibility and whether it might evade immune responses.  He added that there was no indication that the new variant was already in the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/travel-ban-over-new-covid-19-variant-a-possibility-says-fauci/articleshow/87938418.cms||---
---||Mumbai||End colonial linguistic baggage, stop terms like 'ruling party'; we are 'governed': Bombay high court judge||MUMBAI: Justice Gautam Patel of the Bombay high court on Friday said it is time to stop using terms like ‘ruling party’ and ‘rulers’ as people are ‘governed’, not ruled. It is time to get rid of “colonial linguistic baggage’’ he said adding, “India has no rulers and so long as the Constitution exists it never will. It may be governed for a limited period of time, but never ruled,’’ he said. The judge was speaking on ‘Undermining the idea of India: The Way Forward’ at an event hosted by an online portal, said “There is only one idea of India. The Constitutional idea. It is in an Article of the Constitution that is seldom discussed or addressed. Article 1. The Article 1 states that India, that is Bharat, shall be a union of States.’’ “ This has to be the idea of India, for without it India cannot exist,’’ he stressed adding, “everything in the Constitution flows from this concept’’ so pithily said, he added. “What it tells us in this incredibly compact sentence… is while we may differ from State to State and region to region, all of us are one.’’ “Governments will come and governments will go, but the idea of India, the Constitutional idea of India, resilient though it has proved to be must be protected,’’ said Justice Patel adding, “History will not judge us by our highways or bridges or statues, it will judge us by how well we have preserved the Constitutional idea of India and saved it from being undermined.’’ Justice Patel said there are two “beacons’’, one is the Judiciary, the “last bastion or the final frontier’’. “The judiciary frightens the government seeking to cling to power like nothing else does. Our own history shows repeated attempts to weaken the judiciary, most especially during the Emergency and we are again, by no means, alone. From Turkey to eastern Europe to South America and the United States, this is a tale with regional variations,’’ said the Judge. Justice Patel spoke of the internet and said, “a fundamental truth about the internet is this: no government can shut it down, at least not completely and without risk of the government itself collapsing.’’ “Everything that the government now does, from communication to financing, every single aspect is now dependent on internet’’. He said business also depends on the internet. “…it doesn’t matter today if someone in America speaks of ‘two Indias’ or 10 or 29, like the smog in our city the message will get through and will creep in even under the most solidly closed doors’ “if illiberalism is the biggest threat to Constitutional democracy, then the internet is the biggest threat to illiberalism,’’ said Justice Patel. On the unprecedented change in access to justice delivery from physical to online Justice Patel said, “Perhaps something good did come of the SARS Covid virus… as now one can marry technology to justice delivery system.’’ “It is futile to pretend any longer that online hearing or hybrid hearings are transitory or that we will soon return to our creaky, dusty and expensive ways…more importantly it should not be allowed,’’ said Justice Patel. “The counter points and counter narratives are now, thanks to technology, almost impossible to silence. There may be more adverse comments and more noisiness now than ever before. But is that not the point. Is it not what our Constitution contemplates or even demands, when it says the idea of India is embedded in the concept of union of States and of its Constitutionally mandated choice to give any government its marching orders at defined intervals.’’ He went on to say, “ In the Constitutional scheme of things there is no such thing as too much noise or too much dissent. If there is one thing the Constitution does not contemplate it is the comfort of conformity or the tranquility of the familiar.’’ He said the seeds planted in the Constitution has taken hold but said “We should not I think be too sanguine, as we have seen there will be continued attempts by every government everywhere to maintain control, to transition from government to ruler. That is something we must guard against.’’ Justice Patel was speaking on the occasion of Constitution Day. Justice Patel said the right of people to choose by whom they wish to be governed came to India 72 years ago when the Constitution was adopted. Governments, both at the Centre and State, have a “limited shelf lives’’ “If there is one lesson politicians in India have learnt and learnt the hard ways is to never take the electorate for granted,” he said adding, “and that is why our elections are so spectacular.’’ “India going to the Polls is like all of north America and all of Europe going to polls, simultaneously,’’ said. “If we merely have freedom to choose without the right to act on the freedom then the freedom of choice is an empty promise,’’ said Justice Patel before adding “to put it even more bluntly…the right to choose one’s own government is the express recognition of the right to disagree with the present government. It is a right to dissent,’’ he said. He said “it goes further, it is a right to disavow the government and to deny any illegitimacy to continue …and it is not just a right, because it is tied to universal franchise the Constitutional ideal compels us every five years to choose.’’ Justice Patel said, “the first self preservation strategy is to criminalise dissent and disagreement altogether. This takes many forms. The deployment of harsh criminal and anti terror statutes beyond their avowed purpose and…invocation of sedition law.’’ The second approach is to weaponize ordinary laws such as taxation laws.’’ “These are openly used as threats to muzzle disagreement and to ensure that a contrary voice remains unheard,’’ he added. “The third tactic is to entirely trivialize dissent’. Former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Madan Lokur who spoke after Justice Patel said "We do not give as much importance to human rights as we should'' and the other area to be focused on is independence of judiciary. Freedom of speech is vital he said “and dissent is the essence of freedom of speech. It is the essence of good governance. There are hundreds of cases filed where people are accused of sedition. Nothing has happened in those cases except the accused has spent time in jail unnecessarily’’ and it has affected “their future”. He spoke of "an environmentalist" who was arrested in the ‘toolkit’ case. She applied for a passport to be able to attend the COP26 but she could not go, said Justice Lokur. He said "from sedition, we have gone to UAPA and the recent trend is use of NSA or in some parts of the country Public Safety Act.’’ Elaborating on the need for dissent, Justice Lokur said, “why can't you disagree. Just because you happen to be a government doesn’t mean that everything you say is right. It can’t be.’’ He said his idea of India is “an independent Judiciary is a must." Justice Lokur said, "transfer of Chief Justices I think has to be abolished and when we talk of Independence of Judiciary isn't it time that Judiciary sits down to introspect. I would recommend that every two years there be a conference of Chief Justices. How about one next year?''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/end-colonial-linguistic-baggage-stop-terms-like-ruling-party-we-are-governed-bombay-hc-judge/articleshow/87938593.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Pune||Maharashtra govt to give Rs 50,000 ex-gratia to kin of Covid-19 victims||PUNE: The Maharashtra government on Friday announced financial aid of Rs 50,000 to kin or immediate relatives of people who lost their lives due to Covid-19 through a government relief (GR) issued on Friday. The government plans to have a web portal which will enable the kin of the deceased to apply directly by providing documents using the Aadhaar verification process, stated officials. "The testing of the web portal is almost complete and it would be made available for applicants in the coming week,'' shared the official. As many as 1,40,891 people have died due to Covid-19 in the state according to the latest figures issued on November 27. The order was expected earlier in the month as the National Disaster Management Authority had directed states to disburse the amount through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The SDRF would have to allocate nearly Rs 750 crore towards the payment. The government has also appointed committees in every district under the additional collector to take care of any grievance redressal. After the death certificate is provided the submission of the application can be made to any common facilitation centers or at ward offices as has been designated by the local authorities, stated officials. The process has specified that the concerned families submit their claims through a form issued by the state authorities along with specified documents, including those certifying the cause of death. The district disaster management authorities will ensure that the process of claim, verification, sanction, and disbursal is simple, robust, and people-friendly. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of the required documents and disbursed through the Aadhaar-linked direct benefit transfer procedures On September 3, the top court had expressed displeasure over the delay in framing guidelines for the issuance of death certificates to the families of those who died of Covid-19. The apex court had in its June 30 verdict directed the NDMA to recommend within six weeks the guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of persons who died due to Covid-19. The funds will be paid by state governments, sourced from their respective disaster response funds, and will be channelled through the District Disaster Management Authority or the district administrations. In a letter written in late October to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti (CEMPS), an NGO working for Covid-19 affected families in the state, sought at least Rs 2 lakh compensation for each family. Maharashtra Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat too had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking Rs 4 lakhs for the families who lost their members to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-govt-to-give-rs-50000-ex-gratia-to-kin-of-covid-19-victims/articleshow/87938685.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||India||Developed nations’ colonial mindset impeding India’s development: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at the colonial mindset of developed nations which is attempting to restrict developing nations like India from using those resources and paths which they themselves took to become developed and regretted that some in India are using western benchmarks and environment to impede the country's progress Speaking at the Constitution Day celebration at Vigyan Bhawan, the PM said, "Today there are no colonies of any country in the world, But, the colonial mindset has not ceased to exist. This mindset is giving birth to many skewed ideas. Glaring example of this is the impediments put in the (way of) progress of developing countries. The resources and the path which led to the western countries reaching the status of 'developed', today there is an attempt to restrict the same resources and the same path for the developing nations." "In the last few decades, these attempts have been variously nomenclatured. But, the internecine agenda of all these attempts is the same - stop the progress of developing nations. Environment as an issue is also being attempted to be hijacked to achieve this end. We saw its live example at COP26 a few weeks back," he said. Modi also said "separation of power" (between legislature, executive and Judiciary) is often talked about and forcefully reiterated. But in taking the country to new heights by the time it celebrates the centenary of independence, for which the government has set extraordinary goals, all institutions must come together in achieving those targets which are a common goal. Without referring to numerous PILs by activists on environmental issues in the Supreme Court leading to stalling of many hydro-electric projects, road construction and power plants, the PM said though India is among the leading nations focussing on clean fuel and various green measures, and the only country which is going to achieve the goals set in Paris Agreement, various kinds of pressure is brought to bear to distract it from its goal of reaching the benefits of development to each and every citizen in every nook and corner of the country. He said those who do this (impede development) do not face the consequences. "The consequences of their action cause distress to a mother whose child cannot study because of the stalling of a power plant, to a father who cannot take his ailing son to hospital because of under constructed roads. The impact is felt by the middle class, who cannot enjoy modern facilities as these go beyond what they can afford. This colonial mindset has turned the hopes and aspirations of crores of people into desperation," he said. "Judiciary has a big role in "Sabka Prayas' (collective effort). In our discussions, we often hear and reiterate 'separation of power'. Separation of power between the Executive, Judiciary and Legislature is very important. In the next 25 years, there is a need for collective resolve. Whatever the common man has today, he deserves much more... To make this dream come true, we all have to work with collective responsibility. Without compromising on the 'separation of power' we have to chart the roadmap for collective responsibility to take the country towards its desired goal," the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/developed-nations-colonial-mindset-impeding-indias-development-pm-modi/articleshow/87938818.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Goa||FC Goa fail to fire again as Jamshedpur win 3-1||Panaji: FC Goa had another forgettable night in the Indian Super League (ISL) as Jamshedpur FC cruised to a 3-1 win at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. After the 3-0 loss against Mumbai City, coach Juan Ferrando made four changes as he introduced Jorge Ortiz, Seriton Fernandes, Devendra Murgaonkar and Aiban Dohling to the starting lineup. At least on paper, this looked promising, but Goa never got going against Jamshedpur, who made three changes, including sacrificing a foreign defender (Eli Sabia) for midfield control through Greg Stewart. Goa’s defensive frailties cropped up again as Nerijus Valskis (51st minute and 61’) scored twice and Jordan Murray (80’) added his name to the scoresheet. Goa did open their goal-scoring account through Airam Cabrera (86’) late in the game. Edu Bedia saw his shot hit the crossbar and there were other misses, but nobody was left in any doubt that Jamshedpur were deserving winners. Jamshedpur coach Owen Coyle had a simple plan -- let Goa have as much as the ball. In the first session, the hosts enjoyed 69 percent ball possession, and 67 overall, but the Red Mariners were set up so well that they were rarely threatened. In fact, the more Goa had the ball, the more they were susceptible to making mistakes which Jamshedpur failed to capitalise in the first 45 minutes. There were plenty of chances for Jamshedpur, all stemming from Goa’s lapses. The impressive Komal Thatal ended with a poor cross after some brilliant work on the left flank, Valskis failed to get past Dheeraj Singh in a one-on-one situation and Len Doungel hit straight at the goalkeeper. In the second session, it were Goa who came closest to breaking the deadlock. Alberto Noguera found himself with space inside the box after being picked up by Edu, but his fierce attempt on goal was tipped away by goalkeeper TP Rehenesh. Then, Valskis took over. The Lithuanian striker punished Goa for Dheeraj’s poor clearance – which Len intercepted -- with a delectable left-footed strike that ended his 10-game goalless run for Jamshedpur. Ten minutes later, there was another one. This one came from a free-kick as Stewart floated the ball inside the box and Valskis outfoxed everyone, including Dheeraj who had stepped out to collect. Jordan Murray had barely taken the field when he added the third for Jamshedpur, scoring with his first touch of the game as Goa defenders struggled to keep pace. Ferrando had made a string of attacking changes, including fielding an all-Indian defence, to salvage something out of the game. Cabrera scored Goa’s only goal of the match in the 86th minute as he controlled a cross from Ortiz and then drove it home from inside the box for an impressive finish. The Spanish striker could have had a second. He timed his run to perfection to beat the offside trap and meet a lobbed ball inside the box, but mistimed his shot, even as the rival goalkeeper was stranded in no man’s land. That miss summed up Goa’s night. They had the sight of goal but never really close. Jamshedpur deserved full points for the planning and execution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-fail-to-fire-again-as-jamshedpur-win-3-1/articleshow/87938839.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Judicial intervention to nudge exec, not usurp its role: CJI||Excerpts from CJI NV Ramana’s speech at Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court registry on Friday.The framers of the Constitution made accountability an integral element with respect to the legislature and executive. However, they consciously decided to keep the judiciary on a different pedestal. They trusted the competence of the men and women who would adorn the Bench, in upholding the Constitution. Looking back, I can proudly claim that, as an institution, the judiciary has lived up to the faith reposed in it by the Constituent Assembly. The general perception is that securing justice is the responsibility of the judiciary alone. This is not correct. To the contrary, it is all the three organs of the state which are responsible for upholding this commitment to secure justice… While the judiciary is the “guardian of the Constitution”, its role and scope of action is ultimately limited by the very nature of the judicial process… Any deviation by the legislature or executive from the path prescribed by the Constitution will only lead to additional burden on the judiciary. The Laxman Rekha drawn by the Constitution is sacrosanct. But, there are times when courts are compelled to pay attention to unresolved grievances, in the interest of justice. The intention behind such limited judicial interventions is to nudge the executive, and not to usurp its role… Attempts to project such interventions and constructive observations as the targeting of one institution by another, are totally misplaced. If encouraged, such attempts will prove to be detrimental to the health of democracy. …The same judiciary which offers solutions based on a mere post card, paradoxically, struggles for years to take regular litigations to their logical conclusion due to various complex reasons. The question is, how to address the issue of protracted litigations and pendency… Pendency in lower judiciary is particularly alarming… The solutions that we could think of are: • Filling up existing vacancies of judicial officers • Creation of more and more posts • Filling up vacancies of public prosecutors, government pleaders and standing counsel • Creation of necessary infrastructure • Sensitising the police and the executive about the need to cooperate in court proceedings • Deployment of modern technological tools …Recently, we have witnessed many appointments in the higher judiciary being cleared by the government. It is very heartening to note that the number of vacancies in the apex court is reduced to just one. Now, there are four women judges in the Supreme Court for the first time. I hope to see this number grow further. My brothers in the collegia worked overtime to facilitate filling up of vacancies across the high courts as well. This is an ongoing exercise, and I am sure vacancies will be reduced to the bare minimum soon. I look forward to the continued cooperation of the government. An area of grave concern for the judiciary is the increasing attacks on judges. Physical attacks on judicial officers are on the rise. Then there are attacks on the judiciary in the media, particularly social media. These attacks appear to be sponsored and synchronised. The law enforcing agencies, particularly the central agencies, need to deal with such malicious attacks effectively. The governments are expected to create a secure environment so that the judges and judicial officers can function fearlessly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judicial-intervention-to-nudge-exec-not-usurp-its-role-cji/articleshow/87938875.cms||---

It has however allowed promoters of banks to hold up to 26% in their banks, which is a positive for many lenders including Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank and CSB Bank. The new norms allow those who have already diluted stakes to hike their shareholding. RBI on Friday said it has accepted 21 of the 33 recommendations made last year by an internal working group to review extant ownership and corporate structure for Indian private sector banks. A key proposal that was accepted was to increase the capital requirement for new applicants to Rs 1,000 crore instead of Rs 500 crore. In November 2020, the Internal Working Group to Review Extant Ownership Guidelines and Corporate Structure for Indian Private Sector Banks had said that corporates may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulations Act, 1949. This would enable RBI to have the power to do consolidated supervision of conglomerates. It had also said that well-run NBFCs including those owned by corporate houses should be considered for bank licences. Industry insiders speculate that Bajaj Finserv, L&T Finance and Piramal might be the corporate houses still interested in pursuing bank licences. While Bajaj is active in most banking activities, Piramal has acquired DHFL as part of its goal to increase retail business and has bought in a former banker to head its financial services. L&T Finance had earlier declared its intent to pursue a bank licence. The recommendation had faced criticism from several quarters and RBI too has been uncomfortable to allow business houses into banking. The regulator remained mum on this specific proposal but said that the proposals not accepted are under examination. One of the proposals not accepted in full was that payments banks be allowed to convert into small finance banks after three years. Current rules require promoters’ stake in private banks to be diluted to 15% after 15 years. According to sources, RBI agreed to this as the ceiling on the voting rights which a shareholder in a banking company may exercise has been raised by RBI in July 2016 to 26%, which is the level permitted in Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the new limit aligns with the legislative intent. This is also consistent with the foreign direct investment policy. Bankers said that a higher limit was required as it will enable promoters to infuse higher funds/capital which is critical for the growth of banks and function as a cushion during distress or a cyclical downturn. Ashok Hinduja, chairman of IIHL, Mauritius, promoter entity of IndusInd Bank, said the increased promoter holding of 26% will benefit all stakeholders, particularly at this time when Indian economy is poised for exponential growth. “We eagerly await the operating guidelines as it gives the promoters an opportunity to inject capital to increase stake up to 26%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-keeps-big-business-houses-out-of-banking/articleshow/87938913.cms||---

He has been suspended based on a police report and an extensive manhunt has been launched to track him. On Wednesday, Ashok Kumar attacked a couple and their two daughters with a sharp-edged weapon killing three of them. He first attacked Devi Prasad to death and then his wife Parvati, 50, who had rushed on hearing his cries. Thereafter, Ashok hit Shimpa, 26, whose marriage had been fixed recently, and her younger sister Sapna, 24. Only Shimpa has survived. Investigations revealed that Kumar was drawn to one of the girls, but was agitated as the latter did not reciprocate to his advances. Gonda SP Santosh Mishra said that there was a Rs 1 lakh cash reward on Kumar. “We have also recovered a sword, a knife, and toy guns from the spot and traced transactions of Rs 2 lakh made by the accused in a span of 15 days. It seems he was preparing to flee after the murders,” said Mishra. Kumar worked as a ‘gangman’ in railways under Group D services. Police said he had planned to kill the entire family in advance and was helped by his friends. Police sources said that Kumar’s bike had been recovered near the crime spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-manhunt-for-jilted-lover-who-killed-three-of-a-family-in-gonda/articleshow/87938801.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

A day after the airport project was launched by the PM, officials said when the concessionaire, Zurich AG, and the UP government had signed the final agreement, it had been decided the company would be liable to pay 0.1% of the bank guarantee it had deposited every day as liquidated damages if the project breached the deadline. Zurich had deposited Rs 100 crore as the bank guarantee, which means it would have to pay a daily fine of Rs 10 lakh for any delay. YIAPL is the subsidiary of Zurich AG entrusted with the job of setting up the airport. YIAPL is likely to submit a plan with a timeline for delivering various elements of the project, such as the terminal building, stations for metro and high-speed rail, the air traffic control tower, cargo and logistics centre, 186 aircraft stands, hotels and other real estate ventures, to the government by December 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/jewar-airport-builder-to-pay-rs-10-lakh-per-day-for-delay/articleshow/87939012.cms||Shalabh

While one still awaits those rallies this season, a recent event in Gurgaon saw some vintage cars lined up, and among those marvelling at them were members of royal families and diplomats. Gaj Singh of the Jodhpur royal family was the chief guest for the evening. The event was the preview of an inaugural auction to be hosted by an auction house founded by a group of automobile collectors, connoisseurs and automotive historians. The auction is scheduled for December, and nine out of the 20 selected vintage cars were on display at the preview event. Understanding heritage:Gul Panag was one of the guests admiring the beauty of the vintage cars, and she told us that out of the nine cars that were displayed there, her favourite was a pink 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville. “I have been an automobile enthusiast ever since I can remember, but I must confess that the world of heritage motoring is new for me. I am looking forward to learning more about it because you can’t really appreciate the present without understanding its history. While I do love my cars and bikes, I think I would understand them a lot better if I knew the history they come from and their heritage,” she told the gathering. She was happy to meet Gaj Singh after almost two decades. “We had met when she had won the title of Miss India (in 1999),” said Gaj Singh. The recent event in Gurgaon saw some vintage cars lined up, and among those marvelling at them were members of royal families and diplomats.A trip down memory lane:The event also had an exhibition of paintings by filmmaker and fashion designer Muzaffar Ali. “I have been brought up playing in cars, so as an artist, I always looked at the beauty of these machines and started sketching them. From my childhood, cars have been something more than what meets the eye. A car is something that a pencil can flow around, it is like an artist’s dreams. I am so happy that I had an opportunity to bring alive stories from my childhood through these paintings,” said Ali.

---||India||India to Pakistan: Expedite 26/11 trial, give up double standards||NEW DELHI: Underlining that it is not ready to accept any sort of "closure" on the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the government gave a renewed push to punish the guilty on the 13th anniversary of the terror strikes by summoning a senior Pakistani diplomat and calling for an expeditious trial in the long pending case. In a note verbale, it also asked Pakistan to abide by its commitment to not allow territories under its control to be used for terrorism against India. The government said in a statement it was a matter of deep anguish that even after 13 years of the heinous terror attack, the families of 166 victims from 15 countries still awaited closure, with Pakistan showing little sincerity in bringing the perpetrators to justice. The statement by MEA also said India will continue to make every effort to seek justice for the families of the victims and the martyrs. "The 26/11 terrorist attack was planned, executed and launched from Pakistani territory," it added. "The former Prime Minister of Pakistan had gone on record and admitted that the terrorists were sent from Pakistan’s soil. We once again call on the Government of Pakistan to give up double standards and to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of the horrific attack to justice," said the government. The trial in Pakistan has dragged on, marred by change of judges and prosecutors and various senior Lashkar-e-Toiba figures being let out on bail. The MEA said Indian missions in 14 other countries, whose citizens lost their lives in these attacks, were organising memorial events remembering the victims, both national and foreign, reminding the world of the continuing global threat of terrorism. The US also called for perpetrators to face justice. In a tweet, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “On today’s anniversary, we remember the victims, including six Americans. It is long overdue for the perpetrators to face justice.” The Mumbai trial in Pakistan has been delayed further with Islamabad insisting that 27 Indian witnesses travel to Pakistan and get their statements recorded. India, however, wants the witnesses to be examined in an atmosphere free of fear and intimidation and has offered to host a Pakistani judicial commission here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-pakistan-expedite-26/11-trial-give-up-double-standards/articleshow/87939101.cms||---

In June this year, ED issued a showcause notice to one leading exchange in India after the agency failed to track the real beneficiary who had laundered more than Rs 2,800 crore using crypto currency. In two related transactions, the agency found receipt of Rs 880 crore and transfer of Rs 1,400 crore worth of crypto currencies, but none of the transactions had details of beneficiaries. In this particular case, criminals converted ‘proceeds of crime’ stashed in Indian rupee into crypto currency ‘Tether’ and then transferred the same to ‘Binance Wallets’, a crypto wallet service registered in Cayman Island where the illegal money was converted into dollars with the ease of being laundered back into the legal banking system using shell companies. This Indian virtual crypto currency exchange, according to the ED, provided all services of conversion of Indian rupee into virtual currency and end-to-end transactions in complete secrecy, including person-to-person transactions in foreign locations. “None of these transactions are available on the blockchain for any audit/investigation. It was found that the clients could transfer valuable crypto currencies to any person irrespective of its location and nationality without any proper documentation whatsoever, making it a safe haven for users looking for money laundering/other illegitimate activities,” the ED said in its recent show cause notice to one of the crypto exchanges in India. The government listed a bill in the winter session of Parliament to ban all private crypto currencies not only to curb increasing instances of money laundering in the country using the virtual currency but also to meet the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris-based intergovernmental watchdog. In a paper released on crypto currencies, the FATF had noted that many of these exchanges are “designed to avoid regulatory law enforcement scrutiny and help criminals distribute, store and launder the proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking and child pornography by enabling them to conduct anonymous and untraceable financial transactions”. In one such case mentioned by the FATF in its study, an entity Liberty Reserve, having its own crypto currency called Liberty Dollars, was busted by the US enforcement agencies. The money transmitter operated on a massive scale with over a million users worldwide and over 55 million transactions, all found to be illegal. In December last year, the ED had arrested one person from Bhavnagar, Gujarat who was found to be transferring a large amount of ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal online betting to Chinese nationals out of the country converting Indian rupee into crypto currency. The accused Naisar Kothari had purchased crypto currency on behalf of Chinese nationals and transferred them to unknown wallets on foreign exchanges, the ED had said. The illegal online betting syndicate had carried out transactions worth over Rs 1,100 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-rs-4000cr-laundered-via-cryptos-unearthed-in-1-year/articleshow/87939180.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||World||US to curb travel from eight southern African countries over new Covid-19 variant||WASHINGTON: The United States will restrict entry to travellers from eight southern African countries over concerns about a new Covid-19 variant found in South Africa, President Joe Biden said on Friday. The policy does not ban flights or apply to the US citizens and lawful US permanent residents, a Biden administration official said. The restrictions will be effective Monday and apply to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi. "As a precautionary measure until we have more information, I am ordering additional air travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries," Biden said in a statement. "These new restrictions will take effect on November 29. As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team advises." The administration official said the restrictions are being “implemented out of an abundance of caution in light of a new Covid-19 variant circulating in Southern Africa.” The United States only lifted travel restrictions on South Africa on November 8. A second administration official said the restrictions are expected to take effect at 12:01 am EST Monday and came after a high-level administration meeting Friday afternoon to discuss the issue. The United States could add countries to the restriction list if the variant spreads, the official said. The Biden administration plans to hold a briefing with US airlines to discuss the restrictions later on Friday. In January, Biden imposed a ban on most non-US citizens entering the country who have recently been in South Africa in a bid to contain the spread of the new variant of the Covid-19. The United States lifted the travel curbs on 33 countries, including China, much of Europe, India, Brazil, Ireland, Britain and Iran on November 8 after blocking the entry of most foreign nationals who had been in those countries since early 2020. The administration official said the curbs were in response to "advice of the President’s Chief Medical Advisor and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-curb-travel-from-eight-southern-african-countries-over-new-covid-19-variant/articleshow/87939294.cms||---
---||India||Pre-placement offers at IITs hit pre-Covid levels||MUMBAI: It is pouring PPOs (pre-placement offers) across IITs. Most tech colleges, which start their annual placements on December 1, have witnessed an increase in PPOs from companies and the acceptance rates are also high as previous years. Students get a shot at these PPOs at the end of their internships with companies. It is expected that the rising PPOs will reduce the institutes’ dependence on final placement. IIT-Bombay has already seen 248 PPOs, of which 201 have been accepted by students. Data from the placement office shows that in 2020, due to the pandemic, companies made 153 PPOs and most were accepted. The previous year, 163 offers were made and 115 accepted. Similarly, IIT Madras has seen 231 PPOs, of which 178 have been accepted by students. This is 25% higher compared to last year—186 PPOs, of which 142 were accepted. The corresponding current numbers for IIT Delhi are 179 offers and 140 accepted, in contrast to 150 PPOs last year, when 126 were accepted. “We feel our internship process is proving to be a good mechanism for companies to evaluate our students. Students on their part get to know the company and the role they have to play. Companies are finding our students, not just of IIT Madras, but all IITs fit for their companies,” said professor C S Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement), IIT Madras. Interestingly, PPOs in the core engineering space has increased dramatically, he added. Most IITs have improved the PPO acceptance rate too, compared to the past. IIT Guwahati received 179 PPOs, highest in the last three years. Most of the offers are in the sectors of information technology/software, finance, analyst, and product profiles. The highest domestic salary offered is Rs 64 lakh per annum. The hiring trend has been on the rise specifically for technical roles, with more companies giving PPO through internships, said Abhishek Kumar, head at IIT Guwahati’s centre for career development. This year too, campus placements have been cancelled and all companies have been requested to conduct virtual interviews, as most students are appearing for placement interviews from their respective hometowns. More than 90% companies are following Covid-19 protocols of virtual hiring. “IIT Gandhinagar follows the rolling placement season. Compared to last year in the same period, we have seen 80% more organisations recruit our students. We have seen a 60% jump in PPOs this year compared to last year. The acceptance rate has increased by 30% as well,” said the spokesperson at IIT Gandhinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pre-placement-offers-at-iits-hit-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/87939504.cms||---

As a result, investors on Dalal Street too pressed the panic button, leading to a 1,688-point slide in the sensex — the biggest single-session loss in over seven months — which closed at 57,107. For a brief while in late trades, the index had even entered the sub-57k mark, its first foray in that territory in nearly three months. Friday’s 2.9% slide in the sensex was also induced by the recent weakness seen in markets globally. For the last few days, there was a new worry for investors globally after US announced that retail inflation in the world’s largest economy was at a 30-year high. This also led investors to speculate that the US Federal Reserve, its central bank, may go in for a rate hike early 2022, much ahead of the anticipated move in the second half of the year. In India, too, investors are cautious because wholesale inflation is now hovering in the double-digit region for the seventh consecutive month. The rise in crude prices to multi-year-high levels till a week ago was also bothering investors. According to Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management, Friday’s movement in the domestic market has been synchronous with the movements in other Asian markets, and quickly followed by Europe at opening. “The tapering of bond purchases by the US Fed and the rising inflation fuelled the speculations of an early hike in rates by the US central bank, that is even before the conclusion of the tapering of bond purchases. These developments lent some strength to the US dollar and also prompted exit from emerging markets by FPIs,” Thomas said. “The markets are expected to remain volatile with reports of surging infections in the next wave of the pandemic, especially in some of the European countries.” The day’s slide in the market came on the back of strong selling by foreign funds with the net outflow for the day at Rs 2,300 crore, which took the week’s net figure to nearly Rs 17,300 crore. The selloff also left investors poorer by Rs 4.7 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation at Rs 261.3 lakh crore. Since sensex’s all-time intraday high at over 62k on October 19 this year, investors have lost about Rs 16 lakh crore. The sell-off also triggered fears among investors which was reflected in a 25% spike in India VIX, the volatility index that’s also called a measure of fear on the street. The spike in VIX to above its multi-month-high level signals the dominance of bears in the market, said Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Indian investors turned to less risky assets like government bonds. As a result, the 10-year gilt yield softened to 6.33% from 6.37% on Thursday. The global selloff in risky assets, also called risk-off trades, led to a 2.5% slide in Nikkei in Japan on Friday morning while in the evening FTSE in the UK and Dax in Germany were down around 3.5%. And in early trades, the leading US indices were down by about 2% each. Risk-off trades also led to a 7% slide in Bitcoin. On the other hand, investors’ rush to less risky assets led to a nearly 1% rally in gold prices while US 10-bond yields were down 9% to below the 1.5% mark. While the price of WTI crude fell over 11%, Brent crude was 10% down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-plunges-1688-points-as-new-virus-variant-spooks-global-markets/articleshow/87939582.cms||---
---||India||Regular international flights from December 15, with ‘risk’ grading||NEW DELHI: The Centre has allowed resumption of regular international flights from December 15, nearly 21 months after services were suspended on March 23, 2020. Now both Indian and foreign airlines can add capacity. Air bubbles, that gave limited flights to some countries during Covid, will burst on December 14, allowing passengers flying between India and rest of the world to also take connections from nearby hubs as per air service agreements with those countries. The resulting increased connectivity will bring respite from sky-high airfares under the bubble system. The decision comes at a time when some countries like the UK and Italy are reimposing limited travel restrictions following the detection of a new Covid variant in South Africa. India has become the first major south Asian country to open since the pandemic shook the world early last year and could gain a lot from the first mover advantage. As on Friday, the Union health ministry’s list of “at risk” countries include the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. But since air travel demand is nowhere close to pre-Covid levels, even this limited resumption will be enough for the present times and help lower fares. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) order on resumption of regular flights has placed countries in three different categories for a graded return to normalcy. 1. Countries not categorised as being at risk: Flights can be restored 100% by Indian and their carriers as per air service agreements (ASA). This includes over 90 countries from where fully vaccinated with approved jabs and Covid negative passengers can fly in quarantine free to India. 2. At risk countries with which India has an air bubble: 75% flights can resume, subject to a minimum of a daily service. These include Germany, France, the Netherlands, the UK, Bangladesh, Singapore and Mauritius. 3. At risk countries with which India does not have an air bubble: 50% flights can resume as per ASA. These include China, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand and South Africa. Flyers from all at-risk countries will face enhanced screening, while some will have to undergo post-arrival testing. The DGCA has ordered that if an airline has sold tickets under air bubbles (which lapse on December 14) and their subsequent flight schedule is unable to accommodate such passengers, they will have to make alternate arrangements for affected flyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/regular-international-flights-from-december-15-with-risk-grading/articleshow/87939804.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Interacting with media persons after the meeting, the CM said that he invited Prime Minister Modi for the International Gita Jayanti Mahotsav.  “The PM was apprised about the ambitious Mukhyamantri Antyodaya Parivar Utthan Yojana launched by the state government. Antyodaya Gram Uday Melas will be organised in Haryana from November 29 to December 16, during which very poor families verified under the Parivar Pehchan Patra will be called and given detailed information about the scheme so that a framework for uplift of one lakh such families, whose annual income is less than Rs 1.8 lakh, can be made,” he said.  The chief minister added that there was also a discussion on the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao campaign. “This is the first time that the number of girls is more than boys in the gender ratio which is a matter of happiness and pride. The sex ratio has also improved in Haryana.”  He further said that the matter of farmers’ agitation was also discussed with the PM. “The announcement of withdrawing the three agricultural acts has sent a good message and the farmers will definitely return to their homes after the law is withdrawn in the winter session of Parliament, he said, adding that the Haryana government is was continuously working in their interest.  “Haryana is the only state, which is procuring 11 crops at MSP. Not only this, the state government has also compensated damaged bajra at the rate of Rs 600 per quintal, which has benefited the millet growers,” he said.  The chief minister also apprised the PM about the AAS-Auto Appeal software. He said that this software has been launched with the objective of providing benefits of government services and schemes to the last person standing in line at their doorstep by ensuring transparency and accountability. With the introduction of the AAS, the applicant will be given the option of auto appeal at the time of applying for any service. With this, they will not need to appeal manually and the appeal will automatically reach the appellate authority.  Khattar added that his government has also set up Drone Imaging and Information Service of Haryana Limited (DRIISHYA) to do drone mapping. With this, mapping can be done twice a year. Survey for Meri Fasal Mera Byora and surveys related to mining can be done with drones.  Apart from this, Svamitva Yojana, a large scale mapping project, is also being implemented, he said. “Under this project, lands in entire Haryana will be mapped. The entire revenue estate is being mapped as well.”  The CM then said that the subject of Orbital Rail Corridor was also placed before the PM. Along with this, the PM inquired about the issue of pollution. He, however, mentioned Haryana’s good ranking in Swachh Survekshan-2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/khattar-calls-on-pm-modi-thanks-him-for-appreciating-states-welfare-schemes/articleshow/87939581.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Business||Benchmark 10-year yield falls to near 1.5% as variant spurs hunt for safe havens||NEW YORK: The United States Treasury debt yields on Friday posted their sharpest drop since the pandemic began as investors rushed toward safe-haven assets following the emergence of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa. The two-year US Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 12.4 basis points at 0.520%, the sharpest drop since March 2020. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 13.5 basis points to 1.509%. It last traded at these levels in early November. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down 12.1 basis points to 1.850%. "The economic recovery has been quite impressive and the one thing that could knock it over completely would be a more dangerous variant. Time will tell how worried we should be, but investors are selling in front of potential bad news," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. Yields had been rising throughout the week following President Joseph Biden's announcement Monday that he would renominate Jerome Powell to a second term at the helm of the Federal Reserve. That, along with signs of strength in the U.S. economy, had pressed investors into taking bets the Fed would move more aggressively to fight inflation. European stocks suffered their worst day in 17 months as countries in Europe tightened travel controls in hopes of containing the new variant. In the United States, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2%, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled more than 3.6%. The yield curve steepened, with spreads between five- and 30-year Treasuries rising back to the levels before the news Monday of Powell's reappointment. Futures on the U.S. federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, jumped as investors rethought bets the Fed would move quickly to hike rates to quell inflation. According to CME's FedWatch tool, money market traders were pricing in a 58.5% chance of at least a 0.25% hike by the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting, down from an 82.1% chance Wednesday before the US Thanksgiving holiday, and a 67% chance a week ago before Biden renominated Powell. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was last at 2.553%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/benchmark-10-year-yield-falls-to-near-1-5-as-variant-spurs-hunt-for-safe-havens/articleshow/87937973.cms||---

The highlight of the visit will be the delivery of S-400 Triumf missile systems, whose components have started arriving in India. Delivery of the first squadron is scheduled to be completed by December. The US could impose sanctions against India for engaging in transactions with the Russian sectors. The last India-Russia annual summit was held in September 2019 when Modi visited Vladivostok. The Modi-Putin summit will coincide with the first meeting of the 2+2 dialogue between defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign minister S Jaishankar with their respective counterparts, Sergey Shoigu and Sergey Lavrov. The dialogue was agreed after a telephone conversation between Modi and Putin on April 28, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. The Russian embassy tweeted, “Ministers are expected to have in-depth discussions of the key regional and international topics, including the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and developments on #Afghanistan and #Syria, as well as exchange views on interaction within #SCO and# RIC.” Afghanistan was a big topic of discussion also among the RIC that held a virtual foreign ministerial meeting on Friday. Jaishankar tweeted after the Russia-India-China trilateral that the benchmarks for Afghanistan was set down in UNSC reolution 2593. “Afghan territory must not be used for terror activities by terrorist groups. RIC countries should coordinate respective approaches on the threats of terrorism, drug trafficking etc.” In a tweet thread, Jaishankar said he had emphasised the importance of supply chains specially in the health sector, an indirect swipe at China which had resorted to choking medical supplies and price gouging on pharma components during the second wave. He asked RIC countries to “recognise vaccination certificates issued by each other.” He told Russia and China that, “UN reform is being blocked using a smokescreen of consensus as the only way forward. The international community is being denied its democratic rights.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/putin-to-meet-modi-at-december-6-summit-in-india/articleshow/87939970.cms||---

---||World||Jittery nations rush to restrict travel as new variant emerges||European countries on Friday joined Singapore, Israel and others in restricting travel from southern Africa in a frantic effort to keep a newly identified, and apparently significantly evolved, variant of the coronavirus from crossing into their borders. In the past, governments have taken days, weeks or months to issue travel restrictions in response to new variants. This time, restrictions came within hours of South Africa’s announcement — at least 10 countries had announced measures before South African scientists had finished a meeting with WHO experts about the variant on Friday. There is no proof yet that the variant could diminish the protective power of the vaccines, but uncertainty on that question was one factor in the speed of countries’ move toward restrictions. Epidemiologists urged calm on Friday, noting that little is known about the variant and that several seemingly threatening variants have come and gone in recent months. News of the variant prompted Britain, France, Italy and others to bar flights and impose restrictions. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive arm, said in a Twitter post on Friday morning that it would also propose restricting air travel to European countries from southern Africa. Read AlsoCovid-19: New variant not here yet, checks upNo case of the new variant B.1.1.529 has been detected in India so far, health ministry sources said. However, Hong Kong and Israel have been added to the existing list of “countries at risk”. Travellers from these countries will have to undergo additional checks and scrutiny, including post-arrivalSo far only a few dozen cases of the new variant have been identified. But the case in Israel was a person who had recently arrived from Malawi, according to the state broadcaster, Kan. And Belgium’s case was detected in a woman who had recently returned from travel abroad, but not to South Africa or neighboring countries, researchers said. “More data is needed but we’re taking precautions now,” Sajid Javid, the British health secretary, said on Twitter. The discovery of the variant by South African authorities this week comes as the virus was already galloping across the continent in a deadly fourth wave, especially in Eastern Europe where vaccination levels are low and restrictions have been loose. Italy’s decision on Friday to block travel from South Africa and the region showed that even a country that has generally been ahead of the wave, vaccinating much of its population and introducing early, and then progressively stricter, health passes to keep infections low, is not taking any chances. The history of the pandemic has shown that blocking flights has not been a panacea in stopping the virus, and especially variants that spread with increasing ease. But this time, countries acted much earlier and more restrictions seemed likely. Meanwhile, after the closed-door experts’ meeting convened by WHO to assess the new variant and to designate it as either a variant of interest or a variant of concern, the organisation cautioned countries against hastily imposing travel restrictions linked to the new variant, saying they should take a “risk-based and scientific approach”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/jittery-nations-rush-to-restrict-travel-as-new-variant-emerges/articleshow/87940027.cms||---
---||World||New variant has ‘very unusual constellation of mutations’||Scientists are still unclear on how effective vaccines will be against the new variant flagged by a team in South Africa, which displays mutations that might resist neutralisation. Only several dozen cases have been fully identified so far in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. The new variant, B.1.1.529, has a “very unusual constellation of mutations”, with more than 30 in the spike protein alone, according to Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform. On the ACE2 receptor — the protein that helps to create an entry point for the coronavirus to infect human cells — the new variant has 10 mutations. In comparison, the Beta variant has three and the Delta variant two, de Oliveira said. The variant shares similarities with the Lambda and Beta variants, which are associated with an innate evasion of immunity, said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform. “All these things are what give us some concern that this variant might have not just enhanced transmissibility, so spread more efficiently, but might also be able to get around parts of the immune system and the protection we have in our immune system,” Dr Lessells said. The new variant has largely been detected among young people, the cohort that also has the lowest vaccination rate in South Africa. Just over a quarter of those ages between 18 and 34 in South Africa are vaccinated, said Dr Joe Phaahla, the minister of health. While cases of the variant are mainly concentrated in the country’s economic hub, particularly Pretoria, it is “only a matter of time” before the virus spreads as schools close and families prepare to travel for the holiday season, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/new-variant-has-very-unusual-constellation-of-mutations/articleshow/87940051.cms||Lynsey Chutel

The comments came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Latvia and Sweden next week to attend meetings of Nato and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Meanwhile, the State Department's top US diplomat for European affairs said on Friday that all options are on the table in how to respond to Russia's "large and unusual" troop buildup near Ukraine's border, and the NATO alliance will decide on the next move following consultations next week.  "As you can appreciate, all options are on the table and there's a toolkit that includes a whole range of options," Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried told reporters in a telephone briefing. Donfried said Moscow's "large and unusual" troop buildup would top the agenda at the Nato summit.  "It's now for the alliance to decide what are the next moves that Nato wants to take," Donfried said. "Next week, we will talk about our assessment of what's happening on Russia's border with Ukraine and we will begin that conversation of what are the options that are on the table and what it is that Nato as an alliance would like to do together," she said.  US, Nato and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements closer to Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack on its neighbor, accusations Russia has rejected as fear-mongering.  Asked if Blinken was going to meet with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov while in Stockholm, Donfried said she had no such announcements to make but added: "Stay tuned."  On Friday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Ukraine's head of presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, in a call spoke about their concerns over Russian military activities near Ukraine's border.  The two discussed Russia's "harsh rhetoric" toward Ukraine and agreed all sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to ease tensions, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement. "Mr Sullivan underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Horne said.  The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.  Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and said it was not threatening anyone and defended its right to deploy its troops as it wished.  Donfried was asked what the United States saw specifically different in Russia's troop buildup this time, but she did not elaborate aside from saying it was "large and unusual".  Russia's intentions remain unclear, and East-West tensions are running high with Ukraine, Russia and NATO all conducting military drills and Moscow accusing Washington of rehearsing a nuclear attack on Russia earlier this month.  Asked if recent escalation has prompted Washington to consider more seriously deploying permanent troops in Nato's eastern flank, Donfried did not elaborate on the specific point but said Nato foreign ministers next week would be discussing the wider strategy for the alliance's posturing in the 21st century.  At the OSCE meeting in Stockholm, Donfried said, Blinken will also raise Russia's occupation of Ukrainian and Georgian territories, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the crisis in Belarus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-reiterates-support-for-ukraines-territorial-integrity-says-likely-to-speak-with-ukrainian-russian-presidents/articleshow/87940075.cms||---

The S& dropped 1.3% and European markets fell 3-4%. Futures of West Texas Intermediate oil, the US crude benchmark, fell more than 6% to $73.39 a barrel. Demand for the relative safety of government bonds jumped, pushing their prices up and their yields down. The yield on 10-year US treasury plunged as much as 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 1.5%, the most since November 4th, 2020, the day after the US presidential election. The yield on Germany’s bund, Europe’s benchmark bond, fell 7 basis points to minus 0.32%. Stocks that flourished under lockdowns rose, including Zoom and Netflix. Meanwhile companies vulnerable to travel restrictions, like Carnival and Boeing fell. As several countries rushed to restrict flights from South Africa, airline stocks also dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/spooked-stocks-tumble-around-world-oil-too-falls/articleshow/87940131.cms||---

The two sides are yet to decide how the wheat will be transported as Pakistan is apparently not ready to allow Indian trucks to carry the wheat from Wagah. The official response followed a formal communication by Pakistan earlier in the week that it had approved India’s proposal to deliver 50,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan via the Attari-Wagah border. Earlier in the day, in a Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral meeting, foreign minister S Jaishankar exhorted his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Wang Yi respectively, to ensure humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. “In line with our commitment to the well-being of Afghan people, we have offered supply of 50,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan to address the drought situation. RIC countries need to work together to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches the Afghan people without hindrance and without politicisation,’’ said Jaishankar, while calling for an inclusive and representative government in Afghanistan. The foreign ministry said later it was examining Islamabad’s response to India’s proposal. “India has always stood by the people of Afghanistan, be it humanitarian assistance or developmental support. We are examining the response to our proposal to deliver humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. We are also working out the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,’’ said spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-conditionality-on-afghanistan-aid-india-tells-pakistan-as-they-finalise-modalities/articleshow/87940149.cms||Sachin Parashar

The judge, Shashikant Ray, also directed the convict to pay Rs 7 lakh as compensation for the girl’s rehabilitation. The order was passed on October 4. According to legal experts, the case in Araria was the speediest trial of a rape case in the country. Special public prosecutor (Pocso) Shyamlal Yadav said on Friday that it beat the record of a court in Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district that wrapped up in three days a rape trial in August 2018. Police sources said the Araria case was registered on July 23 this year and police completed the probe and submitted the chargesheet in the Pocso court on September 18. The court framed charges on September 20 and directed police to produce prosecution witnesses and the SHO of Araria Mahila Thana on October 4. The SHO produced all the 10 witnesses, their statements were recorded, cross-examinations were done, and arguments from both parties were presented that very day, and the court convicted the man and awarded him a life sentence with a Rs 7-lakh penalty. The entire process took one day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pocso-court-hears-convicts-sentences-man-in-1-day/articleshow/87940180.cms||---

The city's mayor, Naveen Jain, justified the rechristening of Mughal Road and said that "the demand came from residents of Kamla Nagar, a majority of whom are followers of Maharaja Agrasen". Legend has it that Agrasen was the king of Agroha, a city of traders in ancient times. He was a descendant of Kush, the son of Lord Ram. Earlier, the name of Sultanganj Ki Pulia was changed to Vikal Chowk, after the late Satyaprakash Vikal, a BJP leader and the five-time MLA from Agra East, these days called Agra North. This came even as the state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya announced on Friday that Ramghat Marg in Aligarh will now be known as Ramghat Kalyan Marg in memory of former Rajasthan governor and former UP CM Kalyan Singh. Maurya described Singh as a "devout devotee of Lord Ram". He added that the state government has announced plans to rename important roads in several districts in the name of 'Babu ji' Kalyan Singh. Addressing a public meeting in Aligarh, Maurya said "opposition leaders including Akhilesh Yadav, Priyanka Gandhi, her brother Rahul and (Asaduddin) Owaisi will chant slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat mata ki jai' after we come to power again in UP in 2022”. Maurya said that with the opening of the defence corridor in Aligarh, the district has got an opportunity to develop into a major hub for production of high-tech and precision defence equipment. “Missiles manufactured in Aligarh will be used in Islamabad if Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan encourages terror factories,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-renames-mughal-road-in-agra-after-maharaja-agrasen/articleshow/87940196.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

A view is said to be emerging within the government about the need to take a “good, hard look” to see if there is a need to re-think policies and outcomes. The survey shows the number of anaemic children under 5 years rose to 67.1% from 58.6% in the previous survey. This means that two out of every three children (under 5 years) in India are anaemic. The percentage of anaemic women increased to 57% from 53.1% and anaemic teenage girls (between 15-19 years) from 59.1% from 54.1%. The number of anaemic men also rose to 25% from 22.7%. Read AlsoRising anaemia cases: Focus now on states recording high TFRNEW DELHI: With Total Fertility Rate (children per woman) in India coming down to 2.0, which is below the replacement level, the health ministry is planning a district-level outreach focussed on states where TFR is still above 2.1 to sustain gains made in family planning. The NFHS-5 data released onThe ministry also sees the NFHS data as a good sounding board and therefore there is talk to study the strategy and see what modifications may be required. This is likely to be a wide-ranging exercise. Plans are afoot to also change the process of taking blood samples for measurement to enable more nuanced outcomes when NFHS-6 is conducted. The data also brings a focus on immunisation. It shows that more than three-fourth (76.4%) of the children in the age of 12-23 months are fully vaccinated (vaccinated with BCG, measles-containing vaccine (MCV)/ MR/ MMR/Measles, and 3 doses each of polio excluding polio vaccine given at birth and DPT or pentavalent vaccine). While full vaccination among children has risen significantly since the last round (62% in 2015-16), the ministry is now targeting 90% coverage under ‘Mission Indradhanush’ that is aimed at reaching the unreached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/report-on-rising-anaemia-may-force-govt-to-rethink-strategy/articleshow/87940214.cms||---
---||India||Rising anaemia cases: Focus now on states recording high TFR||NEW DELHI: With Total Fertility Rate (children per woman) in India coming down to 2.0, which is below the replacement level, the health ministry is planning a district-level outreach focussed on states where TFR is still above 2.1 to sustain gains made in family planning. The NFHS-5 data released on Wednesday shows that the average number of children per woman has declined from 2.2 in 2015-16 to 2.0 at the national-level. All states have achieved replacement level of fertility (2.1) except Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. Citing the TRF of 2.0 as per National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) as a significant demographic milestone, the ministry of health sees this as an indicator of better knowledge and use of family planning services and late entry into marriage. An official said there are five states where TFR is more than 2.1 so the effort of the government will be focussed on those states. “There might be districts and pockets in the state where the TFR is more and the priority will be to address these imbalances,” the official explained. According to the health ministry, the increase in the use of modern contraceptives and the decrease in unmet need for family planning has helped in achieving the TFR of 2.0. The data shows that two-thirds (66.7%) of the currently married women aged 15-49 years use any method of family planning to delay or limit pregnancies as per NFHS-5 compared to 53.5% in NFHS-4. The use of contraception prevents pregnancy-related health risks for women, especially for adolescent girls, and properly planned intervals between births prevent infant mortality. The health ministry is also planning to hold dissemination workshops on the data across indicators under NFHS-5 with states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rising-anaemia-cases-focus-now-on-states-recording-high-tfr/articleshow/87940236.cms||---

Sujela had been ailing for some time. Sujela was serving life imprisonment at Vadodara central jail and was among the 11 convicts who were given death penalty by the trial court. The Gujarat HC commuted their sentence to life term. Sujela was accused of, among other things, obstructing the way of firefighters on the carnage day on February 27, 2002. Fifty-nine Ram Sevaks who had gone to Ayodhya were killed that day. Assistant commissioner of police AV Rajgor said Bilal had been ill for at least three years. He had multiple health complications, including breathing troubles, and needed oxygen support. He was granted parole earlier in view of his health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ailing-prime-accused-in-godhra-train-carnage-dies/articleshow/87940252.cms||---
---||India||Dynastic parties threat to democracy, says PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Amid a boycott by opposition parties of “Constitution Day” celebrations and ahead of Parliament’s winter session beginning next week, PM Narendra Modi savaged dynastic parties calling them a threat to a healthy democracy and elaborated that problems arise when a party is run by the same family, generation after generation. Speaking against the backdrop of the decision of opposition parties to stay away from the event in the Central Hall of Parliament, the PM emphasised that the ‘Constitution Day’, celebrated to mark the adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly, was meant to respect the contribution of B R Ambedkar as part of the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of the lead framer of the document. On the family outfits operating across the country—from Kashmir to Kanyakumari— the PM said while it was alright for more than one person of a family to join a party and rise on the basis of merit, organisations controlled by families and geared to serve their interests are not a healthy sign for a democracy. “Problems arise when a party is run by the same family, generation after generation and the family controlling the entire system of the party,” he said. “These are parties by the family and for the family.” Modi lamented that the spirit of the Constitution is endangered when parties lose their democratic character. Modi mentioned no name, but the attack appeared to be clearly aimed at Congress and other family outfits which did not join the event. Modi said that “this event was not that of any government, or of any political party, or of any PM”. “The speaker is the pride of the House. It is a dignified post. It is a matter of Babasaheb Ambedkar’s dignity, the dignity of the Constitution,” he said. Modi said, “We all felt that what could be a greater auspicious occasion than the celebration of the gift that Babasaheb Ambedkar had given to this country. We should always remember his contribution in the form of a memory book.” He said it would have been better if along with establishing the tradition of Republic Day on January 26, Constitution Day was also established on November 26 at that time itself. The PM warned against the tendency of forgetting and glorifying convicted corrupt people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dynastic-parties-threat-to-democracy-says-pm-modi/articleshow/87940287.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Teenage pregnancies dip, but 5.4% already bearing child, finds survey||BENGALURU: Teenage pregnancies are declining in Karnataka, with 5.4% of women in the 15-19 age group opting to start a family, as per the recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 of 2019-20. This is a drop from 7.8% in the NFHS-4 of 2015-16 and 17% in the NFHS-3 of 2005-06. “Among young women of the age 15-19 years in Karnataka, 5% have already begun childbearing — they have had a live birth or are pregnant with their first child,” reads the report. As per the NHFS-5 report, the proportion of women who have started childbearing rises sharply from 2% at the age of 17 to 6% at 18 years and 17% at 19 years. The proportion of childbearing women is much higher among those who have had no schooling (18%) than those with 12 or more years of schooling (3%). Data on teenage pregnancies does not present full picture, says doctorThe study captures the presence of teenage pregnancy among religions, castes and tribes. As per the report, the percentage of women in 15-19 years of age who have begun childbearing was highest among Muslims at 6.2%, followed by Hindus at 5.4% and none in Christians. In the same group, 5.7% women from Scheduled Castes had begun childbearing, 5.1% each among scheduled tribes and other backward classes. Dr Padmini Prasad, president, Bangalore Obstetrics and Gynecologists Association (BSOG), says the data does not present the full picture. “Child marriages are still a reality. Issues like poverty and discontinued school education have contributed to child marriages, which further results in teenage pregnancies. We don’t know if this data has captured medically terminated teenage pregnancies too,” she said. She said most teenage pregnancy cases do not come to specialist doctors as they report them to police as medico-legal cases.  “Hence, people go to quacks and these cases aren’t reported. The minute the doctors tell the girl’s caregivers that the case must be reported to police, they don’t return or can we trace them,” said Dr Prasad. She said a girl below 18 is not ready to give birth to a child as it could lead to anemia, toxemia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) or gestational diabetes. Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee (for girls), sees no hint of a decline in teenage pregnancies and said underreporting is an issue. “From October 2017 when I took over as CWC chairperson, I’ve been seeing 4-5 cases a week. We get cases referred from police and hospitals. Some are results of unknown sexual activities or abuse by stepfather,” said Ramanna. A child rights activist pointed to a rise in child marriages during the pandemic and said this would push up teenage pregnancies. “Even if the report is to be believed, the pandemic has diluted efforts made by governments and NGOs in preventing child marriages and teenage pregnancies. A post-pandemic survey is needed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teenage-pregnancies-dip-but-5-4-already-bearing-child-survey/articleshow/87940288.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||CM goes slow on two projects piloted by trust||Bengaluru: Two multi-crore projects pertaining to creation of new lung spaces in the tech capital have been put on the back burner by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. This following inputs that they could give room to allegations of a land scam as they entailed handing over prime land to a trust comprising some private individuals among others.The projects — a tree park proposed on about 65 acres of land belonging to the erstwhile New Government Electric Factory (NGEF) off Old Madras Road, and a cultural hub where once Mysore Lamps Factory was located near Malleswaram — were marketed with the ‘Experience Bengaluru’ tagline two years ago. A trust was floated to execute and manage the same after detailed project reports were prepared. The two projects were in fact part of ‘Mission 2022: Revitalising Bengaluru’ programme unveiled by then chief minister BS Yediyurappa and for which Rs 1,000 crore was earmarked in the 2021-22 budget. The trust was established in June this year and its seven members included businessmen, private urban planners and government representatives. “But the issue of handing over the land to a trust comprising private individuals could send wrong signals,” sources in the chief minister’s office said while explaining why Bommai chose not to rush on the issue. A senior IAS officer said: “Both NGEF and Mysore Lamps Factory are prime land parcels. There have been many attempts in the past to hand them over to other government agencies for development, triggering heated discussions. In fact, the ruling party and the opposition locked horns in the legislative council in September last year over transferring the assets of Mysore Lamps, which include around 20 acres of land near Malleswaram. Ditto with NGEF land, which the forest department wants to declare as deemed reserve forest since there are 45,000 trees even after the factory land has shrunk to 119.6 acres from 221 acres in the last two decades. Moreover, there is a court order against any sort of development to be undertaken on NGEF land. It is prudent to protect these lands for future.”Acording to the initial plan under ‘Bengaluru Experience’ concept, the Mysore Lamps project envisaged a museum, recreation centre, cultural hub, innovation centre and cafe. The land at NGEF was to be converted into a tree park with elevated walkways and a public recreational space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-goes-slow-on-two-projects-piloted-by-trust/articleshow/87940289.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Contractors accused of cheating Metro workers||BENGALURU: Metro employees, especially those engaged in housekeeping, security and ticket office machine (TOM) work, are receiving lower salaries than they are entitled to because of alleged irregularities by private contractors. TOI accessed a copy of an email sent by a whistleblower and former senior Metro employee to the BMRCL management. Housekeeping supervisors should have a gross pay of Rs 16,835 and net pay of Rs 13,036, while security staff should get Rs 16,293 and Rs 12,610, respectively. The TOM staff should get Rs 18,318 as gross and Rs 14,381 as net pay. The net pay is after statutory deductions such as employees’ provident fund, professional tax and employee state insurance. “But contractors are paying only Rs 8,000-9,000 to housekeeping and security supervisors and Rs 10,000-11,000 to TOM supervisors,” the former employee claimed. Similarly, salaries of normal contract staff are: housekeeping (gross pay: Rs 15,487, net pay: Rs 11,979), security (gross: Rs 15,104, net: Rs 11,675), and TOM (gross: Rs 16,835, net: Rs 13,038). “But contractors are paying them Rs 7,000-9,000 a month,” he said. A senior BMRCL official said they will look into the complaints and act. How it works Explaining the contractors’ modus operandi, the whistleblower said BMRCL fixes an amount for salaries and contractors can quote only service charge. “Most contractors are quoting service charge as low as 0.01% to grab the tenders... It is a mystery how contractors earn profit by quoting just 0.01% service charge. Now they are also dividing the tenders among themselves,” he said. He alleged that contractors neither inform employees of the payment details nor display them on notice boards despite what the rules say.  “Contractors are also mandated to issue appointment letters to staff. That is never done and they normally give a fake copy to BMRCL. The employees don’t question it for fear of being removed from service,” he said. “There are nearly 3,000 contract workers in BMRCL. If an employee loses between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 each month, it will be Rs 90 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore a month in total. In addition to this, illegal deductions under retention, uniform, rent, penalty etc further reduce salaries,” he pointed out. ‘Complaints lodged’ Suryanarayana Murthy, vice-president of BMRCL Employees’ Union, said, “In many cases, contractors deduct money from employee salaries in the name of food and accommodation never provided to them. Most bills are fudged to claim money.” He said the union has filed complaints, but no action has been taken against errant contractors. He said the union has also written to the BMRCL management about salary allowances not paid to employees but claimed using forged documents. “Most signatures are not of employees. BMRCL is losing around Rs 20 lakh every month,” Murthy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/contractors-accused-of-cheating-metro-workers/articleshow/87940290.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The entire locality not only houses residential pockets, but also a tech park, many engineering colleges and a hospital, among others. There’s an exponential rise in traffic and congestion on the road.As per BBMP’s traffic cell, the road sees a traffic flow of 25,741 PCU (passenger car unit) daily and this is expected to go up to 1 lakh in 20 years.The civic body has come up with a Rs 51-crore plan to get the road ready for the challenge and make it a four-lane stretch. The process of acquiring 143 properties has been initiated and work is expected to be over a year from the starting date.BBMP has offered Transferable Development Rights (TDR) to land losers. “We will give TDRs worth twice the area for those surrendering land,” said a senior engineer. While some owners agreed to part with their land, many others are demanding cash compensation. Property owners claimed BBMP hasn’t held a single meeting to discuss compensation or project work. “TDR is a rather complicated procedure and controversial too. We want compensation in cash,” said YM Janardhan, owner of Aditya Bakery and Sweets. Murali Krishna, who will lose a part of his land, said he doesn’t trust the BBMP and expressed doubt the TDR offer will work.Documents accessed by TOI show about 23,151 sqm of land will be acquired and 44 buildings razed. The widened road will eat into parts of Mylasandra Lake, BGS Health and Education City, Turahalli state forest, Abhiman Studio, petrol bunks and a private college, among others. As the road-widening project had been mentioned in Master Plan 2015, a majority of plots adjoining the stretch are vacant, said another senior engineer from BBMP’s road and infrastructure wing.“We have written to the lakes department to grant permission for road widening; forest officials have already approved the proposal,” said a senior Palike official. “The forest department has granted permission to cut 48 trees. While some of them will be relocated, the rest, mostly old and dead ones, will be cut,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-starts-work-to-widen-uttarahalli-main-road/articleshow/87940291.cms||Nithya Mandyam

He is believed to have died upon inhaling poisonous gas. Acting on a complaint filed by the 17-year-old boy’s father, police booked three BWSSB officials under Juvenile Justice Act and IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). The firm that deployed the boy to work with the civic utility on contract basis has also been booked. The complainant, H Varadappa, a resident of JJ Nagar, said, “My son Mohan, aged 17, was appointed by the contracting agency as a waterman with BWSSB. Mohan joined work in May and was working with the water board’s Ulsoor division. On Tuesday night, he stepped into the water chamber on Cubbon Road and fell unconscious. He died en route to hospital.” “The chamber is five feet deep and he was made to enter it knowing well that it was a risky job without safety measures. I hold the executive engineer, assistant executive engineer, assistant engineer and the contract agency responsible for his death,” he said. The FIR identifies the agency as Navodaya. Police said they have served notice on all the accused, directing them to appear for questioning by next week. The accused officials told TOI they were unaware of Mohan’s age as he was sent by the contracting agency. “Till now, we have enrolled around 2,000 persons sent by the agency. We were told that Mohan was 31 years old. We suspect the agency got his age wrong,” an official said. Lack of safety gearAsked why the boy was not provided any safety gear, they said that helmets are usually given to watermen. “We are not sure whether they had carried the gear that day or not. We don’t give oxygen masks as BWSSB work is carried out on the surface,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-bwssb-officials-agency-booked-over-17-yr-old-boys-death/articleshow/87940292.cms||---

The scheme was among the 11 announced by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai during his I-Day speech to celebrate India’s 75th year of independence. The planning and statistics department will rope in National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers (mainly PU, degree and masters students) to conduct the survey which will be launched soon.70 parameters“We are drawing up as many as 70 parameters to assess poverty levels in rural Karnataka. The parameters will primarily include housing facilities, thatched, brick or concrete roofing, access to own toilets and private vehicles, owning televisions, washing machines, smart phones etc, and land holdings,” said a department official. The survey will also ask broad question about the citizen’s caste to understand which community has a higher level of poverty. This, despite the caste census having already covered this aspect.“Though there will be a caste column, we intend to not go into the depth of sub-castes. It will include the community the person belongs to, like Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes or upper caste,” said the official.Department additional chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh said the main aim of the survey is to provide some basic details of the 750 villages which are to be developed by the government under the Amrutha scheme and also to educate the students conducting the exercise.“It is primarily to help students (NSS volunteers) understand the extent of poverty in the villages and work out innovative solutions,” explained Rajneesh.The senior IAS officer said the government is not looking to allocate any funds towards the survey but will use existing facilities to assist the volunteers to carry out the work. It is said that the survey will be inaugurated by CM Bommai shortly and will be carried out in a six-month time frame.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-survey-750-villages-to-identify-poverty-levels/articleshow/87940293.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

She also allegedly made an offensive gesture after she broke the queue and avoided undergoing thermal screening. She was booked by the police for non-cognizable offence and let off after she apologised. KIA sources said the incident happened on Wednesday noon outside departure gate number 4. The woman, in her late 30s, opened the barricade ribbon and went to the entry point bypassing the mandatory thermal screening for passengers. When CISF assistant sub-inspector Mandeep Singh asked her to complete thermal screening, she abused him and made an offensive gesture with her finger. He subsequently informed his seniors. Women CISF personnel were called and the passenger was escorted out and handed over to KIA police station. Police sources said the woman, a resident of Andheri West in Mumbai, was scheduled to board IndiGo flight 6E 5399 to Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-flying-to-mumbai-abuses-cisf-officer-booked/articleshow/87940294.cms||---

The words incorporated under section 23 clearly indicate that the application under the section is prospective in nature,” the bench said. The bench pointed out that appellant Kamalamma had gifted her property under a registered deed dated August 22, 2005 to daughter L Nagalakshmi much before commencement of the Act and therefore, all transactions which are pre-enactment are saved. Therefore, assistant commissioner, Tumakuru, had no authority to entertain the petition filed by Kamalamma. The court said even otherwise, it was of the view that the appellant cannot pursue two parallel remedies on the same cause of action as she had already approached the competent civil court seeking relief of declaration and challenged the registered gift deed and also consequent sale deed executed by her daughter.The assistant commissioner, Tumakuru, had originally set aside the gift deed dated August 22, 2005 and the sale deed executed by Nagalakshmi on August 26, 2014, in favour of T Gopal, while exercising power under the Act, based on Kamalamma’s application.Gopal, a resident of Bengaluru, who had purchased the property, then filed a writ petition. He contended that in his absence, the assistant commissioner could not have given that order and the deputy commissioner wrongly rejected his appeal, though he was not made a party before the assistant commissioner.The writ petition was disposed of by the single bench and a request was made to the civil court to decide within six months the suit filed by Kamalamma. She then challenged the October 5, 2021 order of the single bench, wherein the July 15, 2015 order passed by the assistant commissioner and the July 21, 2016 confirmation order passed by the DC were set aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-provisions-of-senior-citizens-act-cant-be-invoked-retrospectively/articleshow/87940296.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bollards removed, parts of pop-up cycle lane vanish||Times News NetworkBengaluru: The pop-up bicycle lane between Central Silk Board and KR Puram on Outer Ring Road is in peril after bollards installed to demarcate the corridor were removed at several places.In May 2020, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) commissioner V Manjula and other officials visited the ORR to create a 17km lane for cyclists on the service road. DULT, along with BBMP, put up bollards for the pop-up lane on some sections of the service road but many were found removed on Wednesday in places like Agara, reportedly to facilitate traffic diversion for Namma Metro work. Bollards were installed at every metre of the service road to demarcate the two-metre-wide cycle lane. Shilpi Sahu, a cyclist, said: “Bollards in Agara have been removed. We need such lanes to be permanent with concrete partitions for the safety of our cyclists.”Globally, pop-up cycle lanes became popular during the pandemic as they helped provide temporary paths for cyclists at a short notice. They ensured more space for cyclists, thus reducing the risk of infection. While pop-up lanes started as a temporary solution, many foreign cities made them permanent.While many ORR users said an incomplete pop-up lane even after a year is testing patience of cyclists, the removal of bollards came as a shock to many as several tech parks and educational institutions are slowly opening up after the work-from-home phase.BBMP chief engineer (road infrastructure division) BS Prahlad said BMRCL has probably done this since Metro work is progressing there. BBMP has not removed those bollards. But Manjula said it’s vandalism by unknown people. BMRCL has not removed any bollards.BMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yashwanth Chavan said: “The bollards were removed by all stakeholders, including DULT and BMRCL, for a traffic-diversion plan to facilitate Metro work. This is to avoid inconvenience to ORR road users.” According to Sahu, pop-up cycle lanes should ideally come up overnight and never take this long. “The plan was to provide cycle lanes on the service road from Central Silk Board to KR Puram but even after a year the project has not been completed. We are frustrated by the half-hearted efforts of civic agencies.” Many cyclists complained the pop-up lane was poorly maintained. Bengaluru bicycle mayor Sathya Sankaran, said: “We never thought a pop-up lane on ORR would take so much time. Removal of bollards is a clear case of vandalism and wasting taxpayers’ money. There should be a permanent infrastructure as there is adequate space for cycles, buses and Metro on ORR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bollards-removed-parts-of-pop-up-cycle-lane-vanish/articleshow/87940297.cms||---

As a result, artisans working in our group had no income for over six months. We had to eat into our savings,” Pandey said. Now he and over 120 other artisans from across 25 states are pinning their hopes on the ongoing Handmade Collective by A Hundred Hands to find their feet again. After a gap of two years, the 11th edition of Handmade Collective is under way at Bangalore International Centre in Domlur. It began on November 24 and ends on November 28. All the proceedings from sales at the bazaar will go to the creators. Another artisan, Rehmat, a filigree artist from Odisha, says the platform has come as a blessing. Filigree is a 500-year-old delicate craftwork where silver strings are modified in the shape of jewellery and showpieces. “With no orders, the closing of temples, no travel and skyrocketing silver prices, I was forced to give up my craft and work in the fields. Now that we can travel, I am depending on the bazaar to support me in selling products and continuing my family’s traditional craft,” she said. City-based Sarah Thomas, a former Srishti student and proprietor of Umoya Designs, said the pandemic made her rethink the product line of her brand, which used to focus on luxury items. Sarah specializes in Shibori, an ancient Japanese manual tie-dyeing technique. In the last six years, she has trained eight women from conservative families of Kambipura village in the art with the aim of employing and empowering them. “During the pandemic, the demand for luxury products plummeted. But we had to make sure the women continued to be gainfully employed, so we started making masks, kaftan tops and comfort wear,” she says. A Hundred Hands, an NGO, was launched by sisters Mala and Sonia Dhawan to help those involved in handmade art, crafts and homemade food earn a fair and sustainable livelihood. Since they began in 2010, they have helped close to 10,000 artisans. Cotton and coffee Adding to the vibrant cultural events restarting after the pandemic is a workshop showing the connection between cotton and coffee. The workshop, organised by homegrown brands Araku Coffee and Yali, will be held from November 27 to December 18 at Araku Coffee in Indiranagar. Entry is free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/crafts-collective-gives-artisans-a-helping-hand/articleshow/87940298.cms||Farheen Hussain

No additional funds are required as grants for these roads are available, tenders have been floated and work orders approved.

---||India||Constitution Day celebrations: Event boycott reflects Rahul Gandhi’s mentality, says BJP chief Nadda||NEW DELHI: BJP president JP Nadda on Friday hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi saying the boycott of the ‘Constitution Day’ celebrations symbolises the latter’s “monarchical mentality” and reflects Congress’ disrespect for Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar. “Rahul Gandhi also opposed the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb. Today Rahul is not visible in the country, but Congress is showing the same colour. This is a symbol of his monarchical mentality. Congress had opposed Babasaheb even when he was alive,” Nadda said in a series of tweets. The BJP chief termed opposition parties’ boycott of the “Constitution Day” celebrations an insult to the Constitution and said that the “nation will not forgive those who have put the interests of party and family above the interest of the nation”. He said the day was an opportunity to honour the Constitution and pay tribute to Babasaheb’s legacy, but some opposition parties boycotted it by doing narrow politics. BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said, “The latest shenanigan by Congress and its like-minded allies in boycotting the Samvidhan Divas celebrations is yet another instance of insulting instituions, insulting the Constitution and insulting Baba Saheb Ambedkar.” Malviya said even when ‘Samvidhan Divas’ was announced in 2015, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had opposed the idea. “On other occasions too, Mr. Gandhi has not refrained from making tasteless wisecracks on the same,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/constitution-day-celebrations-event-boycott-reflects-rahul-gandhis-mentality-bjp-chief-nadda/articleshow/87940324.cms||---
---||India||Constitution Day: Opposition boycotts Central Hall event||NEW DELHI: Alleging that the government is riding roughshod over the Constitution in governance and law-making, opposition parties on Friday boycotted the “Constitution Day” function in the Central Hall of Parliament which was attended by President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi among others. Congress, Trinamool Congress, Left parties, RJD, NCP, Shiv Sena, SP and DMK among others stayed away from the function after Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge spoke to them on Thursday evening with the plan for boycott. The issue was discussed in the Parliament strategy group meeting of Congress that was chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi. “It is important to remind the government that mere observance of this day as a government function, and disrespecting the spirit and essence of the Constitution, is a very poor reflection on the state of affairs,“ senior Congress leader Anand Sharma told a press conference. “Our protest is about the manner in which the government is conducting the state of affairs, enacting laws, decision making. Every single constitutional institution has been subverted, is under constant attack,” he added. Sharma said enactment of farm laws was an example of the governments mindset, as legislations are never referred to the parliamentary standing committees and stakeholders are excluded from discussions. Congress also lashed out at the government for excluding the opposition from the planning of the “Constitution Day” function, and said mere invitation to sit in the Central Hall was not acceptable to the opposition which is an integral part of constitutional democracy. Slamming the PM’s criticism, he said democracy was strengthened from 1947–2014 by the Congress governments, as a result of which Narendra Modi could become the PM in 2014. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said celebrating Constitution Day at a time when its fundamental features are routinely undermined is complete “hypocrisy” of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/constitution-day-opposition-boycotts-central-hall-event/articleshow/87940346.cms||---

State environment, forest and climate changes department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh Bablu recently visited Tutla Bhawani waterfall in Maoist-hit Rohtas district and asked the officials concerned to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) to develop it as a tourist spot. Tutla Bhawani waterfall under Tilauthu block, about 20km from Dehri-on-Sone, once happened to be a hotbed of the Maoists and people feared to visit the place. “The Maoist activities have almost vanished from the area. It can be developed as a tourist spot. The DPR is complete and the work on the project will start soon. We will hold a meeting with the tourism officials soon,” the minister added. The department is working on other projects in Shahabad range as well. Indrapuri Barrage on Sone river, Rohtas Fort and Shergarh Quila are also likely to be developed as tourist spots. “Work on construction of a park near Mundeshwari temple in Kaimur district is likely to start next month,” the minister said, adding the projects would generate more revenue with the increase in footfall of tourists. Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said activities of the Maoist rebels have been contained to a large extent in the district. “Despite the fact that the rebels are confined to some limited regions, we keep a close surveillance on their activities,” he said. Locals said the Rohtas Fort atop the Kaimur hills was being used by Maoists as a training centre before the posting of Vikas Vaibhav as SP of Rohtas in August, 2008. “It was Vaibhav who had unfurled the national flag on the bastions of the Rohtas Fort on January 26, 2009. The fort was earlier in the control of the Maoists since 80s,” said a former mukhiya, Shaukat Ali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-develop-once-red-hit-places-as-tourist-spots-minister/articleshow/87937283.cms||Ramashankar

RJD state president Jagadanand Singh said the CM had even pledged not to join hands with BJP, but he did not keep his promise. While talking to a section of media, Singh said a person who could not keep his vow was now making others take the pledge. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, also tweeted on the same line and uploaded the screenshot of a media report dated March 1, 2015, in which Nitish had said he would better die but never join hands with the BJP. “It shows that CM Nitish has accepted that the oath taken earlier regarding non consumption of liquor had miserably failed,” RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan. Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said it was the Grand Alliance government in Bihar which had implemented the prohibition law. “But with the NDA in power, Nitish has totally failed in implementing it. I am not saying that JD(U) and BJP people are involved in illegal liquor trade, but those caught in this trade belong to either of the two parties or have association with their leaders,” he said. Rajesh further said instead of such organising such an eyewash event, Nitish should get breathalysers arranged at the entrance of Vidhan Mandal in the upcoming winter session. “This will expose the NDA people,” he said. However, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad hit back at the opposition leaders and said Tejashwi and others had taken the pledge in Gandhi Maidan regarding prohibition law and now they were deviating from it and politicising the issue. “They are actually trying to push Bihar into intoxication, but CM Nitish is a man of strong will power and determination and will never let it happen,” said Nishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-lashes-out-at-nitish-for-taking-pledge-against-liquor-again/articleshow/87937459.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Patna HC to Bihar govt: Train officers about rules to avoid procedural lapses||PATNA: The Patna high court on Friday directed the state to impart proper training to its officers about Bihar Government Servants (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 2005 so that they could conduct departmental proceedings for taking penal action against a government servant without any procedural lapses. The bench of Justice PB Bajanthri observed that a large number of litigations regarding service matters related to disciplinary proceedings were coming before it for hearing due to almost the same kind of procedural lapses in taking penal action, including dismissal from service. The bench pointed out that most of the procedural lapses are that memo of charges is supplied to the employees against whom proceeding is being conducted, but they are not provided with further documents to support the charges nor any witnesses are getting examined in the course of proceedings. The bench orally observed that why the high court should not assume that such procedural lapses are committed with the connivance of officers. The procedures of conducting departmental proceedings against a government servant are explained in Section 17 of the Rules, which are further explained in detailed manner in at least 23 more sub-sections. The bench was hearing a writ petition of Sanjay Kumar virtually when it gave directions to the state chief secretary to ensure the necessary training. The court found the same kind of procedural lapse in dismissing the petitioner after conducting departmental proceedings against him. The court granted the desired relief to the petitioner by setting aside his dismissal order. The court also set aside the appellate authority’s order, which had confirmed his dismissal, and remanded the entire matter back to the state government for carrying out a fresh proceeding. The writ petition was simultaneously disposed of on Friday. Petitioner’s counsel Siyaram Shahi, assisted by Shally Kumari, had apprised the court about the lapses and later also highlighted that even the state government’s counter affidavit doesn’t clarify if the departmental action was taken as per law to dismiss him. The petitioner was a section officer in the state home department. He was posted in the Secretariat when a Vigilance Investigation Bureau team arrested him while accepting a bribe of Rs7,000 in 2016. He was later sent to jail. Following the action, departmental proceedings were initiated against him after which he was dismissed in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-to-bihar-govt-train-officers-about-rules-to-avoid-procedural-lapses/articleshow/87937426.cms||Debashish Karmakar

However, more awareness needs to be created on the importance of institutional delivery, especially in the rural areas, for safety of mother as well as the child, they feel. As per NFHS-5 data, institutional delivery in Bihar had increased to 76.2% from 63.8% in NFHS-4. On the other hand, the findings of sample registration survey held in 2019 shows that Bihar’s IMR declined to 29 from 52 in 2009. IMR is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births till the child attains the age of one year. Bihar not only showed decline in IMR, it was also less than the national average of 30. But the same survey, which is part of phase 1 of NFHS-5 and was released in December last year, states that percentage of institutional birth in rural areas in Bihar was less than the urban areas. As per the data, while 84.1% of institutional births took place in the urban areas, it was just 75% in the rural areas. However, several states in the country have more than 95% of institutional deliveries. For instance, Kerala has 99.8% of institutional deliveries, followed Goa (99.7%), Karnataka (99.7%), Telangana (97%) and Andhra Pradesh (96.5%) Noted obstetrics and gynaecologist Dr Usha Didwania said, “The situation has improved in the state, but more has to be done in the rural areas. Institutional deliveries are must for the mother as well as the child. Pregnant women should also visit nearest health centres for neonatal check-up.” Care India project head Sunil Babu said stress was now on motivating women to go for institutional deliveries, along with training of nurses and anganwadi workers. “Overhauling of hospitals and close monitoring of underweight babies are also the reasons for the drop in IMR,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-institutional-delivery-has-few-takers-in-rural-bihar/articleshow/87937430.cms||Sheezan Nezami

However, the struggles of women who were widowed by the disease stands out as even more tragic as at least 16 of them have ended their lives in the state since the pandemic began, including some being pact-suicides. Most recently on November 19, a seven-year-old girl died while her mother and elder sister were rushed to a hospital at Goduguvarigudem area in Nuzvid town. Daida Naga Lakshmi (35) lost her husband, the sole breadwinner to the disease. She fed a poison-laced cold drink to her two daughters, Kavya (7) and Karnika (9), before consuming it herself. Kavya eventually succumbed, while Lakshmi and Karnika are still in a critical condition. Similarly, another woman from Kurichedu village in Prakasam district ended her life by hanging herself after her husband died of Covid-19. The couple had three children. Police sources indicate that a major reason behind the suicides is not just the loss of the husband but the debt and financial responsibility the women fear they have to face for the rest of their lives. The most notable case occurred last year when three members of a family committed suicide and their bodies were found in the Godavari river in West Godavari district. The deceased Parmi Suneetha (50), her son Phani Kumar (25) and daughter Lakshmi Aparna (23), from Pasivedala village in Kovvur mandal ended their lives after the sole breadwinner in their family died due of Covid-19 related complications. “I don’t even have time to grieve for my husband because I am saddled with a major financial burden. The paltry compensation from the government wouldn’t even help pay back even a pittance of my financial responsibility,” Rama Latha (name changed), who lost her 42-year-old husband to the disease, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/widowed-by-covid-16-ended-lives-in-2-yrs/articleshow/87937883.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

He said APSPDCL was successful in rectifying the affected EHT sub-stations, 33KV sub-stations and 33 KV feeders. Around 284 special teams were arranged to carry out the rectification works. The energy secretary appreciated the APSPDCL for restoring power within a record period during the floods in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Nellore districts. He lauded chairman and managing director, APSPDCL, H Haranatha Rao, and his team for their round-the-clock efforts during the floods. He also said Andhra Pradesh power utilities always strive for the state’s development by ensuring adequate, reliable and highest quality power supply and best consumer services to all categories of consumers. Speaking on the occasion of the National Constitution Day celebrations at Vidyut Soudha on Friday, the energy secretary said Bharat Ratna Dr BR Ambedkar provided the world’s best Constitution to the nation. The Preamble of the Constitution declares India as a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic and aims to secure justice, liberty, equality to all citizens and promote fraternity to maintain unity and integrity of the nation. Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship are our values and the rights of citizens under the Constitution must always be upheld responsibly. Following these principles, the power utilities give utmost importance to public welfare and provide best services to all consumers, the energy secretary added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rs-19-cr-loss-to-spdcl-due-to-floods-says-energy-secy/articleshow/87937953.cms||---

Due to the flash floods triggered by back to back depressions, the Peruru Cheruvu on the western side of Tirupati assembly segment overflowed and inundated several elevated colonies for the first time in the history of temple city. But the intriguing part is why the excess water did not take its natural course to Tummalagunta Cheruvu which has been converted into a cricket stadium now. On Saturday, Pathakaluva villagers blocked the Naidupet-Bengaluru NH and staged protests against the irrigation department’s move to divert Peruru Cheruvu flood waters towards their village. Fearing that their homes would be submerged, they squatted on the highway and raised slogans against Chandragiri legislator Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy. The protestors also gheraoed the local MLA when he tried to approach them, forcing cops to resort to a mild lathicharge. A middle aged woman sustained injuries to her head during the lathicharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/overflowing-peruru-changes-course/articleshow/87937895.cms||---

The cannabis that makes its way to Bollywood and Tollywood originates from Vizag Agency and is in high demand across the country. Enforcement officials predict prices to touch a new high in the coming days due to the widening gap between demand and supply, following drives to end ganja cultivation. Vizag Agency and the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) belt cultivate three varieties of cannabis—Raja Hamsa, Kala Pathri and Sheelavathi. The Sheelavathi variety commands a booming market in the country, with consumers choosing it over the varieties grown in Idukki Valley (Kerala) and Chamba Valley (Himachal Pradesh). Speaking to TOI, deputy commissioner, Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), Vizag, SVVN Babji Rao said middlemen procure the cannabis from cultivators, for Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per kilo. The weed has a market value ranging from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 in Vizag city. The price in cities like Hyderabad, Pune, and Chennai ranges from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 per kg. “Price of Sheelavathi in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru markets was Rs 50,000 per kg till last year. But it increased to Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 per kg due to high demand and crackdown on ganja transportation in various states. We think Vizag ganja price may further increase in metro cities,” Babji Rao added. A senior officer with the SEB said ganja from Vizag reaches every corner of the country. “We have booked cases against some drug peddlers belonging to Mumbai and we can say that the weed seized in Bollywood originated from Vizag Agency,” he added. However, ganja growers have been getting low profits while middlemen and drug dealers rake in large amounts by selling the weed in metros. Ironically, most of the victims in this illegal trade are tribal people. “Most of the remand prisoners and convicts in the ganja-related cases are tribals,” said secretary of the Joint Action Committee of Adivasi Unions and Federations, Ramarao Dora . The Sheelavathi variety commands a booming market in the country. Its price in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru markets was Rs 50,000 per kilo last year, but has increased to Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 per kg due to demand brought about by crackdowns on ganja transportation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/price-of-sheelavathi-variety-touches-new-high-after-crackdown-pushes-up-demand/articleshow/87937958.cms||Nalla.Babu

From being the second Indian to participate in Big Brother, UK, after Shilpa Shetty to winning International Fame Award just a fortnight ago, Sreedhara has had a rollercoaster life in the last ten years. Sreedhara received the IFA award on October 30 for ‘Best Cross-Cultural Psychologist’ from popular philanthropist and Bollywood actor, Sonu Sood. Speaking to TOI, Sreedhara said he revived his psychology practice during the Covid-19 pandemic by providing counselling for hundreds of families, students, as well as distressed businesspeople. “Concerns over career and loss of money were major worries amongst people across the world. The inevitability of losing money or education being affected has left them despairing. I usually try to divide their woes and make them understand that money is just a part of life’s requirement and that everything is not lost by it,” Sreedhara told TOI. Sreedhara also provided free counselling for students and professionals in trauma who could not afford psychological counselling during the pandemic year. After completing his engineering degree, the non-resident Telugu pursued his master’s in international business and psychology in London. He entered Big Brother and stayed there for five weeks and won the best housemate award. Later, he also contested and won student union elections in the UK before fetching a ticket to contest for MP elections in the UK. However, Sreedhara did not contest the elections and chose to return to Vijayawada while taking up a professor’s job in Lakireddy Balireddy College in 2011. Explaining his future as a cross-cultural psychologist Sreedhara says, “I want to help as many people as I can in coping with their stressful situations, overcoming their complexes, fears and giving them that much needed confidence and that dose of positivity. A positive mind changes a person’s behaviour to a great extent. And I believe that if a person is positive, it not only makes him better, but it also makes those around him better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ifa-winning-psychologist-sree-dasari-counsels-covid-affected/articleshow/87937933.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Patna||‘Judiciary is defender of Constitution’||PATNA: Retired Supreme Court judge and former chairperson of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, S J Mukhopadhyaya, on Friday emphasised the need of independence of judiciary for ensuring smooth working of the democratic system. Delivering an online lecture on ‘Relevance of judiciary in Indian democracy’, organised by Chanakya National Law University (CNLU) on the occasion of Constitution Day, he said the Indian judiciary has not shied away from its responsibility of upholding the goals of the constitution. “The judiciary is the defender of the constitution and the principles enshrined therein and it also serves as the promoter of peace, cordiality and balance between organs of the government,” he added. Mukhopadhyaya said the Indian constitution, the fundamental law of the land, had been drafted with the four-fold objective of securing justice, liberty, equality and fraternity to all the Indian citizens. “Even though there is no strict application of the theory of checks and balances in India, the constitution has drawn certain limits and boundaries in respect of the legislative, executive and the judicial powers,” he said. CNLU vice-chancellor justice (retired) Mridula Mishra, in her presidential remarks, said the objectives enshrined in the Indian constitution must be achieved at all costs for proper functioning of democracy in the country and welfare of the Indian citizens. “The judiciary in India, especially the higher judiciary, has been assigned a vital role in various areas like upholding the federal principle, interpretation of the laws made by respective legislatures, testing the validity of such laws and more importantly in protecting the fundamental rights of the citizens,” she said. CNLU social science dean S P Singh welcomed the guests and introduced the topic of discussion along with the significance of Constitution Day celebration. CNLU registrar Manoranjan Prasad Srivastava proposed a vote of thanks. The Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) organised a panel discussion on ‘Inculcating the constitutional values in the light of New Education Policy, 2020: Issues and challenges’ as part of Constitution Day celebrations.

The minister was speaking at CII Connect 2021, a flagship Information and Communication Technology (ICT) conference of CII and was delivering a keynote on the topic of the state’s deep tech startup ecosystem. This year’s Connect has taken up the theme of building a sustainable deep tech ecosystem in the state. Thiagarajan said he was deeply impressed when he visited the IIT Madras’ startup incubation cell recently, where he saw an ecosystem “second to none.” While building such an entrepreneurial environment was “largely not in the government's hands,” the state government will put in place basics for ease of doing business and bring in supportive policies for innovators, he said.  He said the government was already implementing measures like cross referencing data before putting out benefit schemes, and said the finance department is working on going completely digital for its payments such as salary, pensions etc. to ensure transparency. “In the last six months, we have used technology [in governance] much more than what we did in the last 10 years but we still have a long way to go,” he said. Also addressing the session as professor Mohanbir Sawhney, associate dean for Digital Innovation, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University USA, who said that the academic bodies in India can help promote the use of deep tech for various applications, and was hopeful that India will soon become a deep tech hub by creating several clusters around research institutions. Connect 2021 also features a two-day international exhibition on ICT with a participation of over 55 exhibitors from across the global. Australia, Israel and UK are the partner nations at Connect 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/our-govt-wants-to-be-biggest-consumer-of-tech-innovation/articleshow/87938553.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Private hospitals start reducing Covid beds||Kolkata: With the number of patients either remaining stable or dropping since October, private hospitals across the city have started scaling down their Covid units. While some have already reduced the number of Covid beds and merged them with non-Covid units that have seen a swell in occupancy over the last three months, others are getting ready for a slash next week. Earlier this week, the state government had asked state-run hospitals to do the same. AMRI Hospitals, which now have 50 Covid beds across its three units with an occupancy of 35, will start reducing beds next week. “We have brought down the number of beds to 50 and will scale it down to 40 next week. We hold a review meeting every week to gauge the demand, which has been going down along with the severity of the disease. The demand for non-Covid beds, on the other hand, has increased manifold,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. AMRI now has more than 600 non-Covid patients across its three units. Peerless Hospital, which has a single Covid ward comprising 42 beds now, plans to squeeze it soon if the patient inflow doesn’t rise. Occupancy has dropped to 32 beds here. “We have a long waiting list of non-Covid patients whose number has crossed 330. Unless we reduce the Covid beds, we can’t make way for other patients whose number will now keep rising due to the backlog,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Medica Superspecialty Hospital slashed its Covid beds to 36 last month. With more than 300 non-Covid patients admitted, the hospital plans to scale down its Covid unit further, provided the number of patients doesn’t rise in the next two weeks. It now has 28 patients. “Covid admissions have gone down sharply post-Puja. We are keeping a close watch and may reduce it again soon,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Hospitals, though, are not refusing Covid patients, either those with mild symptoms or the moderate ones. With units squeezed, the number of critical-care beds are often being kept unchanged. At AMRI, for instance, once the Covid ICU in one unit gets fully occupied, it is admitting patients at the ICU of another unit. “We are doing permutation-combination to make optimum use of the existing Covid units even as we keep trimming them,” said Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has 45 Covid beds with an occupancy of 22. “This number has been consistent for the last six weeks. As soon as we see a consistent fall in the number of patients below 22 over the next couple of weeks, we plan to reduce the Covid beds from 45 to 25,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. CMRI Hospital is keeping a close watch on the situation. “If need be, we can enhance our infrastructure as and when required,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO of CK Birla Hospitals. Belle Vue Clinic and Woodlands Hospital will take a call within the next fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/private-hospitals-start-reducing-covid-beds/articleshow/87938317.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

But though it was a major earthquake of magnitude 6.2 on the Richter scale, there were no reports of damage here. According to the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), a strong and shallow earthquake of magnitude 6.2 struck the Myanmar-India border region around 5.15am at a depth of 33km on Friday. According to India’s National Center for Seismology, the quake was about 135km away from Aizawl. The tremors were felt across Kolkata, its fringes and multiple districts across south and north Bengal. Large parts of north and northeastern India also felt the tremors along with several states in Bangladesh and Myanmar. With the majority of the city residents still asleep, some said the tremors made them jolt awake while early risers who were out for walks or were getting ready for work had an even better feel of the tremors that lasted around 5-7 seconds. “I was getting ready for office when the ground started to shake. I felt dizzy,” said Dipsi Das, a Tollygunge resident and a nutritionist attached with a private firm. Social media was flooded with similar reports. “Did we just experience an earthquake. The floor seemed to shake for a few seconds,” Swarup Das tweeted at 5.26am. “Those who are still wondering, yes it was an earthquake,” posted another Twitter user, Deblina Saha, half-an-hour later. Abhijit Dutta posted a video on his Facebook profile of a hanging wall clock swaying at 5.17am. However, as the tremor took place very early in the morning, a majority of citizens said they only came to know about it from social media after waking up. “I live on the 37th floor but didn’t realise there was a tremor. I even enquired with other residents in the building and the majority said they didn’t feel anything. We had experienced natural calamity at its worst during Amphan. I am glad that we have been spared this time,” said Debjani Mookherjee, a resident of Urbana off EM Bypass. In seismic parlance, any quake of magnitude above 5 qualifies as “strong”. The Richter scale stays constant in all places a quake is felt, but the damage potential varies depending on the distance from the epicentre. Kolkata is around 600km from the epicentre in Aizawl. The Nepal quake in April 2015 measured 7.8 and was classified as “major”. The epicentre had been over 900km away, but the tremors had been felt in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/morning-tremors-in-city-as-6-2-quake-hits-myanmar-border/articleshow/87938385.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Public health engineering officials have stepped up arrangements to restart the long pending drain works. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, enroute to the airport recently, identified the stench emanating from the drain at Prasadampadu and directed officials to take up the work on priority. Guntatippa drain, which starts at Jawahar Autonagar flows for a distance of 13 kilometers and merges with the Ryves canal at Prasadampadu rice mill junction. The drain is clogged with effluents from Jawahar Autonagar, with its upper portion hidden under tonnes of plastic waste that have not been cleared for years. A sewage treatment plant (STP) to clean the drain remains non-functional. CMO principal secretary Praveen Prakash inspected the drain recently and expressed anger over its condition. He directed AMRDA commissioner Vijayakrishna to take immediate measures to clear the plastic waste under the culvert for unhindered flow of water. Officials are making arrangements to install an iron mesh on both sides of the culvert on NH-16 to prevent further blockage of the drain. Public health engineering officials, meanwhile, are readying estimates to desilt the drain and take steps to prevent sewage from entering the irrigation canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/clogged-guntatippa-drain-draws-cms-ire/articleshow/87938120.cms||Venu Lanka

Repair work of the damaged roads in the township has hit a roadblock with shortage of funds, as condition of roads in several places across the township remains in poor. A commuter was recently injured after he alighted from a bus, stepped on the uneven road surface and fell on the ground near Indira Bhavan. Residents said that across the township, the road surface level has increased to about three to four inches compared to the roadside corner and pavement due to additional layer of bitumen placed on top during repairs. This has created a slope towards the pavement and an uneven surface. Several stretches of First and Second Avenue, the cross roads and the inner lanes of the blocks are filled with craters and potholes. In many places, the patchwork on stretches had washed away by heavy rains which are yet to be filled up again. Also, portions of roads seem to be sinking with a number of cave-ins at different spots which is particularly dangerous for motorists and bikers. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) had earlier started patchwork before Puja which could not be completed due to incessant rain. Civic authorities are now asking the contractors involved in road repairs to carry out patchwork as part of their three-year maintenance contract with BMC. “It is true that there has been excessive rainfall this year for which road repair has taken a hit. We are trying to repair the damaged spots by deploying road contractors with whom we have a three-year maintenance contract,” said a BMC official. Residents said most of the time the roads that are repaired before monsoon get washed away after a few spells of heavy rain. Also, in many cases the roads get damaged and craters surface on the same spots which are again taken care of through patchwork. The patchwork is not up to the mark as it gets washed away during rains. Also, the road surface level continues to increase with repeated bituminous layers being laid on the top,” said Anamika Poira Paul, a CE Block resident. Civic officials said the BMC budget allocation for roads was only about Rs 10 crore to Rs 12 crore annually which was not adequate for conducting thorough repairs across all the 41 wards as the civic body depends on government funds, too. Officials said that a Rs 144 crore detailed project report for road repairs was earlier placed before the state urban and municipal affairs department. But, only Rs 30 crore has been sanctioned so far. “A major source of income is property tax and other revenue earnings have reduced due to the Covid pandemic,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cratered-roads-cave-ins-make-commute-nightmare-in-salt-lake/articleshow/87938309.cms||Suman Chakraborti

In the past, question papers and answer keys had been leaked and even electronic devices used to help candidates cheat. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala was the first to raise this issue soon after the HSSC conducted a recruitment test for sub-inspector and constable posts of Haryana Police. It was alleged that extra OMR sheets were issued to a few examination centres as well. Confessions by Anil Nagar, the HCS officer and accused deputy secretary of Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC), and his associates Ashwani Kumar and Navin Kumar have confirmed the use of OMR sheets in cheating. The modus operandi was that the candidate left the OMR sheet blank and the answers were later filled in by a conspirator. These accused claimed to have charged between Rs 20 lakh and 25 lakh per candidate for the OMRs allegedly manipulated by them. Nagar, Ashswani and Navin have confessed to having used the strategy for HCS prelims and dental surgeon exams. Navin has also confessed to having sent impersonators to help candidates. According to information, 580 blank OMR sheets were detected by HSSC over the past six months. The HSSC chairman had ordered the registration of FIR against all candidates whose OMRs were found to be blank. “Cheaters are part of this system of recruitment and are devising new ways. Nagar’s arrest has established this,” said HPCC finance secretary Rohti Jain. When contacted, HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh said in future, invigilators will be asked to cancel such partially blank or blank OMR sheets at the centre only. HPSC chairman Alok Verma refrained from comment. “The vigilance probe is yet to be finalised. Hence, no comments so far,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-cheating-method-unearthed-omr-sheets-left-blank-in-hssc-exam-filled-later/articleshow/87939020.cms||Manvir Saini

In the video, Morari, who called himself a ‘kathakar’ (storyteller) had asked Patel to pay Rs 1 crore or face consequences. As the video went viral on social media platforms, the Banaskantha district police had formed multiple teams to nab Morari who is suspected to be facing mental health issues. In the video, Morari can be heard threatening the CM and asking him to pay Rs 1 crore within 11 days or be ready to face consequences. Banaskantha district in-charge superintendent of police Pooja Yadav said, “Morari was arrested by Banaskantha local crime branch from Revdhar village in Rajasthan.” He has been brought to district headquarters in Palanpur for further inquiry, Yadav told TOI.

---||Business||Corp exclusion from banking shrinks buyer pool for PSBs||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to keep corporates away from bank licences will help the government sidestep allegations that it is selling banks to big business. However, the number of prospective buyers for public sector banks (PSBs) will shrink. In the absence of any deep-pocketed corporate house, the bidders for PSU banks would have to be either private or multinational banks, or private equity investors who would be in a position to come up with a couple of billion dollars to buy a bank. The challenge in the case of private equity investors is that they would look for an exit after a few years, while multinational banks are increasingly reducing their retail exposure as retail banking is becoming a domestic activity because of compliance costs. Private players like HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI and Axis have the equity-raising capacity, but the pension liabilities would be a deterrent. In March this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the salary and pension of bank employees will be protected in the case of privatisation. “The deal-breaker would be the pension liabilities of these banks,” said a private banker. The fact that the pension is inflation-linked makes it worse for any buyer. The source added that this is the reason why the banks are trading at low valuations despite having cleaned up their loan books. For private banks, a bank licence or a branch network does have the same appeal that it would have for a corporate house. More so given the disruption that digital is causing. “Unlike in the past when a domestic bank licence would draw a lot of interest, there was only one serious bidder for Lakshmi Vilas Bank — DBS. When the RBI was looking for someone to take over PMC Bank, despite the lure of a licence of a Mumbai-headquartered bank, there was again only one bidder,” pointed out a banker. While the PSBs are in better financial shape, a buyer would need to put in more capital and probably see a hike in the cost of funds as the government ownership, which provides a cushion to depositors, will no longer be there. Since liberalisation, the central bank has taken the safe route of issuing bank licences to financial institutions. The first round of banks that got their licence was largely sponsored by financial institutions, including HDFC, ICICI, UTI, IDBI and some non-banking finance companies such as Centurion, Kotak Mahindra and Bandhan. The experience in granting licences to professionals has not been good (Global Trust Bank and Yes Bank). The absence of private non-bank financial institutions makes the divestment more challenging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/corp-exclusion-from-banking-shrinks-buyer-pool-for-psbs/articleshow/87939051.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI fines SBI, 2 payment system operators||MUMBAI: The RBI has imposed a Rs 1-crore penalty on SBI for contravention of the Banking Regulation Act and holding shares in borrower companies exceeding 30%. The RBI had also imposed fines on two payment system operators — Tata Communications Payment Solution (TCPSL) and Appnit Technologies. TCPSL was fined Rs 2 crore for not meeting guidelines on white-label ATM deployment. Appnit was penalised for not following RBI norms on maintenance of escrow account balance and net worth requirement. In a press release, the central bank said that during inspection of SBI, it was detected that the bank held shares in borrower companies, as pledgee, of an amount exceeding 30% of paid-up share capital of those companies. This is in contravention of sub-section (2) of section (19) of the Banking Regulation act. “In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it,” the RBI said in a statement. After considering the bank’s reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing, and additional submissions made by the bank, the RBI decided that a penalty was justified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-fines-sbi-2-payment-system-operators/articleshow/87939062.cms||---
---||Business||‘Set up disaster fund for eco loss due to natural calamities’||MUMBAI: A report by State Bank of India has called for a ‘National Disaster Pool’ to make good the economic loss arising out of natural calamities, which are increasing in number. The report has called upon the regulators and the government to come out with standardised products to plug the protection gap in each segment. According to the report, India recorded 756 instances of natural disasters (such as landslides, storms, earthquakes, floods, and droughts) since 1900 with 402 events occurring during 1900-2000 and 354 during 2001-2021. “This indicates the preponderance of tail events off late. Since 2001, a total of 100 crore people have been impacted and nearly 83,000 people have lost lives due to these disasters,” the report said. Even as the intensity of weather events increase and the economic losses soar, the protection gap continues to impoverish households and destroy small businesses. “In India, only around 8% of the total losses are covered. So, there is around 92% protection gap during the period 1991 to 2021. So, early intervention is needed to close the protection gap, which are in all lines (life & non-life) of insurance,” the report said. Assessing the damage caused by the 2020 floods, the report said that economic losses were to the tune of Rs 52,500 crore, but insurance was only 11% of these. If the government had provided insurance, the premium for the sum assured of Rs 60,000 crore would have been in the range of Rs 13,000-15,000 crore. Besides the intensity of weather events, changing trends also expose the economy to large losses. For instance, weather events can completely destroy the functionality of solar panels. In 2019, a single hailstorm generated a $70-million insurance payout for a Texas solar farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/set-up-disaster-fund-for-eco-loss-due-to-natural-calamities/articleshow/87939071.cms||---

The judge, Shashikant Ray, also directed the convict to pay Rs 7 lakh as compensation for the girl’s rehabilitation. The order was passed on October 4. According to legal experts, the case in Araria was the speediest trial of a rape case in the country. Special public prosecutor (Pocso) Shyamlal Yadav said on Friday that it beat the record of a court in Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district that wrapped up in three days a rape trial in August 2018. Police sources said the Araria case was registered on July 23 this year and cops completed the investigation and submitted the charge-sheet in the Pocso court on September 18. The court framed charges against the accused on September 20 and directed police to produce prosecution witnesses and the SHO of Araria Mahila Thana on October 4. The SHO produced all the 10 witnesses, their statements were recorded, cross-examinations were done, and arguments from both parties were presented that very day, and the court convicted the man and awarded him a life sentence with a Rs 7-lakh penalty. The entire process took one day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/araria-court-concludes-trial-awards-life-term-in-rape-case-in-one-day/articleshow/87937264.cms||---
---||Patna||Govt, opposition lock horns as Bihar rated India’s poorest state||PATNA: With the NITI Aayog placing Bihar at the bottom compared to other states on the basis of 12 parameters in its national multi-dimensional poverty index (NMPI) report, the state’s opposition and the ruling parties are engaged in a war of words. RJD national president Lalu Prasad and CM Nitish Kumar have also crossed swords in their own ways. “The NITI Aayog report has come and Bihar has been ranked as a “fissadi (worst performing)” state on the education and health fronts. The CM keeps talking about development, but he should now drown himself in ‘chullu bhar paani (handful of water)’ if there is some shame left in him,” Lalu told mediapersons. However, Nitish dismissed his remarks outrightly. Without taking Lalu’s name, he said, “It is his habit and he keeps saying things like that. People of the state are the ultimate, ‘maalik’,” Nitish said. The report, prepared on the basis of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) with reference to 2015-16, has pointed to Bihar’s startling situation at the household level, even though its gross state domestic product (GSDP) has been in double figures. Bihar has been put in the club of the three poorest states – Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. In fact, Bihar has figured poorly compared to Jharkhand and UP, as its 51.96% of people have been categorised as “poor”, another chunk of 51.88% “deprived of nutrition” and 45.62% of women as “deprived of maternal health”. The 12 parameters on which the NITI Aayog has rated states are nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, antenatal care, years of schooling of children, their school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets and bank accounts. Bihar has been rated as poor performing against seven of the 12 parameters and its best performing area is the provision of drinking water for people. Otherwise, as per the NFHS-4 (2015-16), 73.61% of households were deprived of sanitation. However, the figure dropped to at 50.60% in the NFHS-5. Only 2.34% of people are deprived of drinking water and Bihar is the second-best state in this category. As per the NFHS-5, 65.30% of households lack houses in Bihar and as many as 63.20% of people are dependent on traditional fuel like hay stalks, wood, coal and charcoal. On the property front, 24.32% households in Bihar do not have more than one television set, fridge, computer, telephone and bicycle. As per the NFHS-5, 4% of people in Bihar have no bank accounts, but the number was 26% in the NFHS-4. Overall, the shock in the ruling combine of the BJP, JD(U) and two other parties was palpable. “So much of government expenditure has happened and development activities have taken place. The state’s per capita income and budget size have increased in the last 15 years. The NITI Aayog’s assessment of Bihar is based on the wrong feedback. It should take account of the ground reality,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “Those on the government side should be realistic. They should know that the increase in GSDP does not necessarily lead to the enhancement of the standard of living of the people and their families. In fact, the actual income of people has fallen, which is why the number of poor people has increased in the state.” Patna richest district in Bihar, Kishanganj poorest: Patna district is the richest in the state and 29.20% of its people are in the rich category. It is followed by Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur. Eleven of the 38 districts of the state are “poorest” with highest number of people below the poverty line. The pack is led by Kishanganj with 64.75% of its people characterized as BPL. The other 10 other districts in the poorest category are Araria (64.65%), Madhepura (64.43%), East Champaran (64.13%), Supaul (64.10%), Jamui (64.01%), Sitamarhi (63.46%), Purnia (63.29%), Katihar (62.80%), Saharsa (61.48%) and Sheohar (60.30%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-opposition-lock-horns-as-bihar-rated-countrys-poorest-state/articleshow/87937511.cms||Abhay Singh

Sources said he was admitted to the medicine department of the hospital and his condition was stable. “He is suffering from fever. His test reports are awaited. However, he is stable,” said a doctor. He said Lalu’s exhaustion due to his hectic schedule in Patna recently might be the reason behind his fever and feeling giddiness. “Let all his test reports come,” the doctor said. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan confirmed that Lalu was admitted to AIIMS in Delhi. “But he is stable,” said Gagan. He further said Lalu’s son and leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and elder daughter Misa Bharti were at the hospital along with other family members. Lalu is a diabetic and also suffers from several other ailments. Lalu had returned to Delhi on Thursday night after spending three days in Patna. He had come to Patna on Monday night to appear before a special CBI court on Wednesday in a fodder scam case related to fraudulent withdrawal during his tenure as Bihar CM. He had also attended an RJD’s event at the party headquarters to unveil a six-tonne lantern there.

The centre, which has been built with an estimated Rs145 crore, has a seating capacity of 2,000 persons with facilities like auditorium, meeting hall, dining hall, guesthouse and other state-of-the-art facilities. Officials said finishing touches were being given to the convention centre. “The convention centre will be ready for inauguration in 10-15 days. Apart from the auditorium, a large dining hall having a capacity of 800 persons has been made. There are separate entries for VIPs and others,” DM Abhishek Singh told this newspaper on Friday. He added: “Adjacent to the convention centre building, a state guesthouse with 100 beds is also being constructed on the campus. The guesthouse will have world-class facilities.” Building construction department secretary and in-charge of Gaya district, Kumar Ravi, who inspected the centre on Thursday, instructed project manager, executive engineers of the building construction division, Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCo), Bodhgaya Nagar Parishad and other officials to finish the remaining work with efficiency. He instructed them to decorate the interiors with wall paintings. Nagrik Vikas Manch president Suresh Singh said the need for a convention centre at Bodh Gaya was being felt since long. “To organize events like Bodh Mahotsav, Buddhist conclave, conference of Association of Buddhist Tour Operators (ABTO), the organizers had to look for private space. Now, this problem would be solved. After the convention centre becomes functional, we can book it to organize international Buddhist conclave at Bodh Gaya rather than in Delhi,” he said. A Buddhist scholar, Rajiv Kumar, said, “As Bodh Gaya is well connected with air, rail and roads, big events like research oriented international seminars, conferences on Buddhism and culture, meetings, business conferences would be organized in the convention centre.” Daijokyo Buddhist Temple secretary Ven Kiran Lama said the upcoming international convention centre would be a big asset for Bodh Gaya. “It would not only promote tourism but also business opportunities for the local vendors. Large spiritual and Buddhist events, business conferences and cultural events would be organised for larger participations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bodh-gaya-convention-centre-to-be-ready-in-10-15-days-dm/articleshow/87937569.cms||---

Reacting to the PM’s statement that family-based parties are a matter of great concern for those who want to protect the Constitution and India is headed towards a crisis because of such political parties, Nitish said, “It is true that the family-based parties are causing damage to the country.” “We believe since the very beginning of our political journey that there is no requirement of family-based parties in a democracy. Today, some people want to place themselves, members of their families and their children in politics. There should be no place for dynasty in politics, but today several parties are walking on the path of dynasty politics,” Nitish said. Earlier in the day, the PM had said in New Delhi that India was heading towards “a kind of a crisis” because of the family-based parties and described it as a matter of concern for people who believe in democracy. “Party for the family, by the family. Do I need to say more? If a party is run by one family for many generations, it isn’t good for a healthy democracy... look at the political parties from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,” Modi said while addressing the Constitution Day event in the national capital. “By family-based politics, I don’t mean that more than one member of a family can’t enter politics. On the basis of potential, with people’s blessing, people can join politics. But if a political party – generation after generation – is run by one family, it becomes a threat for democracy,” Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/family-based-parties-damaging-country-nitish/articleshow/87937443.cms||---

He defeated his nearest rival by 101 votes. A large number of students escorted the newly-elected mukhiya to his home from the counting centre and offered garlands to him. The students credited another teacher, popularly known as Khan sir, for Bipin’s victory. “Khan sir had campaigned for Bipin sir in the panchayat election. Khan sir is very popular among students for his unique and simple method of teaching,” said Rakesh, one of the students. Bipin said he would continue to teach the students and also serve the people of the panchayat. “I decided to enter into electoral politics due to corruption prevailing in the government offices,” he added. Ashok Yadav, nephew of jailed former minister Raj Ballabh Prasad Yadav, was elected as district board member from Nadriganj in Nawada district. Rajballabh is serving sentence in connection with rape of a minor girl. However, luck didn't smile on Surti Devi, ‘samdhin’ of the BJP MLA from Riga in Sitamarhi district Motilal Prasad. Surti, who was in the fray from Ganeshpur Babhanpura panchayat on the post of mukhiya, lost to Asha Devi by 386 votes.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy lists reforms taken in education sector||VIJAYAWADA: “A seed sown today will reap fruits in 20 years. A child admitted into government school today will face any competition and challenge the best after 20 years. This is what our mission is,” asserted chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in the assembly on Friday during a short discussion on education, where he highlighted the list of initiatives taken by his government to strengthen and improve the education system in government schools. He also informed the House on the reforms he launched to reorganise and strengthen the schools. “English medium has been introduced in all schools and majority of the institutions are now affiliated to the CBSE to improve the standard of education in the state. The child coming out of government schools should become a global citizen who can compete with anyone,” Jagan said. The schools have been categorised into six types — satellite foundational school (PP1 & PP2), foundational school (PP1, PP2, class 1 & 2), foundational school plus (PP1, PP2, classes 1 to 5), pre-high school (classes 3 to 7/8), high school (classes 3 to 10) and high school plus (classes 3 to 12) — as part of the government’s academic and administrative reforms. “The government is planning for subject-wise teachers from class 3 and limiting one teacher to 20 students in Class 1 and 2, implement CBSE syllabus and other activities to enhance the efficiency of teaching to students,” the chief minister added. He further informed the House that the government has taken a decision to implement mandatory attendance of 75 per cent for student to get the benefits of Amma Vodi for this year. However, the government has modified the scheme to give laptops instead of cash for classes IX to XII students from the next academic year, he added. “The state government has given a kit consisting of three pairs of uniform, a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks, bilingual textbooks, notebooks, workbooks, and a school belt besides a set of three masks under the Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme to students,” he said. Referring to aided schools, the chief minister said the intent of the government is to do good for the management, teachers and students of aided institutions and to shape them into better places of learning. “They are free to accept the government offer to improve the conditions prevailing in the institutions. It’s not mandatory,” he added. Earlier, education minister Adimulapu Suresh initiated the short discussion where he also listed out the government’s initiatives to improve and strengthen government schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-lists-reforms-taken-in-edu-sector/articleshow/87937996.cms||Gopi Dara

Vijayawada police commissioner B Srinivasulu released the crime review data for the last six months on Friday. In the last six months, the city witnessed 10 murder for gain cases, the highest in the last three years. Only one case of murder for gain was reported in 2020 and 2019. Apart from murder for gain, as many as 36 murders took place in the city. Robbery, dacoity and theft cases remain more or less same during 2021 when compared to the last two years. As many as 64 cases were reported under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and 43 rape cases were reported during the last six months. The west zone turned out to be notorious for the safety of women and children as most of the cases of sexual crime were reported here. The number of ganja cases witnessed a sharp hike in the last six months, with a rise of 77 per cent. While the number of ganja cases reported during 2020 stands at 76 and 170 arrests, this year police arrested 288 persons in 135 cases. Even as ganja cases continued to rise, the number of liquor smuggling cases saw a sharp dip from 1,218 in 2020 to 250 during 2021. The steep decline in liquor cases was attributed to the reduction in prices by the state government, which made smuggling less profitable than before. The commissioner said city police did a remarkable job during the pandemic. Pointing out that 952 personnel contracted the virus, out of which 10 personnel lost their lives, Srinivasulu said police managed to crack some of the most sensational cases reported during the last six months and completed the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/10-murders-for-gain-rock-vij-in-6-mnths/articleshow/87937918.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The accused, identified as Shaik Sohail, was in possession of 4,000 child porn videos. Police launched an investigation after cybercrime police received an anonymous complaint through registered post. The sender complained about an online advertisement for child porn videos at low prices. Based on details furnished by the complainant, police registered a case and using cyber forensics traced the accused to Fakirgudem area in Vijayawada. According to Vijayawada commissioner B Srinivasulu, Sohail studied engineering at a reputed college in Vijayawada and later worked in various multinational companies (MNCs). However, he could not continue in any job and left all of them. Meanwhile, he grew addicted to watching porn on the internet. When Sohail came across with an online advertisement for the sale of child porn videos, he contacted the advertiser and paid him to purchase the videos. After the payment, Sohail received a web link through which he downloaded more than 4,000 child porn videos. With an intention to earn easy money, Sohail started posting advertisements on the internet offering child porn videos at discounted rates. Srinivasulu said police have observed that a majority of children below the age of 18 are being exposed to porn because of its easy availability on the internet. The commissioner further said stringent laws are in place with regard to child porn. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data will identify IP addresses of those who search for child porn videos on the internet, adding that parents keep an eye on the activities of children, especially adolescents. He also advised people not to open any web link received from unknown senders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-techie-who-posted-online-ad-to-sell-child-porn-arrested/articleshow/87937926.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Half of all waqf land in private hands||AMARAVATI: The state government has admitted that a massive extent of 31,000 acres of waqf land has been encroached upon by private people. The government has reclaimed only around 580 acres. Deputy chief minister Amzath Basha confirmed the encroachment of waqf land in almost all districts in the assembly on Friday. Almost 50 per cent of the total land owned by the Waqf Board has slipped into private hands over the past few decades. The deputy chief minister said the state government has started efforts to reclaim the land from encroachers. The state government has acquired nearly 580 acres and issued notices to other squatters. “The failure of the successive governments and the Waqf Board has resulted in the encroachment. The government should set up special courts to complete trial and reclaim the land,” said Muslim United Front (MUF) president Habib-ur-Rehman. He, however, added that some corrupt officials and a few board members were behind the encroachments. He requested chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to review the issue and appoint a special chief secretary or a DGP-rank officer as commissioner of the Waqf Board, at least till the government reclaims the land. About 90 per cent of waqf land in Srikakulam, Chittoor and Anantapur has been usurped by private people and a similar situation prevails in Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, Kurnool and Prakasam districts. “The government should initiate measures at least to protect the remaining land by completing the comprehensive land survey and fencing of the land,” said legislator Hafeez Khan. He said waqf land could be utilised for construction of assets for the welfare of minorities in the state. As land has become scarce, developing assets is the best option to generate revenue and protect land, he noted. “We have issued 2,407 notices under section 51 of Waqf Act, 1995 for eviction of 2,323.54 acres and issued 5,862 notices under section 54 of Waqf Act for evictions on another 4,208 acres,” the deputy chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/half-of-all-waqf-land-in-private-hands/articleshow/87938078.cms||Samdani MN

She was elected to the post uncontested. Jakia Khanam is the first minority woman to enter the legislative council. After anointing Dalit leader Mosenu Raju as chairperson, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy decided to allot the post of deputy chairperson to the minorities. Subsequently, the chief minister selected Jakia Khanam from his home district, Kadapa, to the post. After the declaration of the election result, the chief minister, ministers and MLCs escorted Jakia to the chair. The chief minister expressed happiness over Jakia’s elevation to the top post. He said that he was fortunate to be part of the process of empowerment of women from minority communities. “My sister Jakia comes from a simple family. A homemaker, Jakia had first become an MLC and is now presiding over the House. It is a historical moment in the empowerment of the women, particularly from the minority communities,” said Jagan. He said Jakia’s elevation would send a strong message to all women and added that the YSRC government has been relentlessly working for the uplift of the downtrodden classes and their political empowerment. Jakia Khanam thanked the chief minister for the opportunity to preside over the council as deputy chairperson. Mayana Jakia Khanam, a resident of Rayachoti constituency in Kadapa district, was nominated to the legislative council under the governor’s quota last year. Meanwhile, YSRC MLC Mohammed Iqbal praised the chief minister for giving four MLC seats to minorities.

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Series of delays over the years forces VMC to put on hold storm water drain project||VIJAYAWADA: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has finally decided to shelve the storm water drain (SWD) project after the agency failed to complete the works in the stipulated time. Only 62 per cent of works have been completed till date, leaving residents of the city to bear the brunt of the incomplete project. Upon a request from the state government, the urban development ministry sanctioned the SWD project to the city to solve its problem of inundation of main roads and colonies. All major drains and side drain restoration was made part of the project but works were carried out at a snail’s pace from the start. A lack of coordination with the electricity department resulted in the initial delay. Electricity officials initially delayed shifting of electric poles and transformers that obstruct the flow of water to drains. The issue was resolved after a high level meeting conducted by the former chief minister in 2018. But the agency failed to increase the pace of work due to a shortage of sand and the Covid-19 pandemic. A major portion of drain works is incomplete even as the civic body spends large amounts to drain stagnant water from these places. Expressing its unhappiness with the pace of works, the civic body has written to higher officials, seeking permission to shelve works. “Citizens are facing severe problems with incomplete drain works. Even the chief minister has expressed anger over the stench emanating from Guntatippa drain, which was left incomplete. People residing on the city’s outskirts are facing severe problems. We have requested the government to cancel the work. The civic body will take up the works of the incomplete project,” VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/series-of-delays-over-the-years-forces-vmc-to-put-on-hold-storm-water-drain-project/articleshow/87938107.cms||Venu Lanka

The court said CBI investigations indicate that certain incriminating articles and documents have been recovered from Maner and the mobile phones seized from him show that he has contacts with a number of police personnel who have figured in the phone-tapping report of former state intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla. The court said considering the overall matter, Maner’s custodial interrogation is necessary for a fair probe. The court added that the FIR has been lodged to unearth the larger conspiracy involving Deshmukh and private unknown persons in the matter of transfer-posting of police officers in Maharashtra. “Therefore, the matter requires thorough investigation by the CBI,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cop-transfers-court-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-middleman/articleshow/87939672.cms||---

Bittu, who received 25 votes in his favour in a floor test in the House of 60 councillors, threatened to move the Punjab and Haryana high court against the alleged kidnapping of his councillors before the voting started over his “vote of confidence”. Bittu said, “Our three councillors were allegedly kidnapped by the cops on Thursday on the behest of a cabinet minister against whom I have decided to move the high court. According to rules I cannot be suspended by the House until the chief secretary signs the letter (of suspension). I will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court whenever I get any such suspension letter, but so far, I am not suspended. What has been done to me is undemocratic. The ‘no-confidence’ motion could not be proved against me.” Of the 60 wards in Patiala, 32 fall in Patiala (urban) assembly segment being represented by former CM Amarinder Singh and 26 in Patiala (rural) assembly constituency represented by cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra assembly while two are in Sanaur segment represented by SAD (B) legislator H S Chandumajra. While 19 councilors from Capt. Amarinder’s constituency voted in Bittu’s support, 13 had opposed the motion. However, Bittu got support of two councillors falling from Sanaur constituency and three from Patiala (rural), including the wife of former Congress district president. There is a buzz now that Bittu will join Capt Amarinder’s political party to contest against Congress’s Mohindra. In January, Bittu had held a show of strength to stake claim in Patiala rural constituency for assembly elections, following which Mohindra shifted development works of the city wards falling in his constituency from the MC kitty to Patiala Improvement Trust. Asked whether he would leave Congress and join Amarinder’s newly floated Punjab Lok Congress, he said, “I would not comment on this as of now. My focus now is to file a petition in the high court.” Regarding two separate agendas on November 22 on vote of confidence, he said, “These were not separate... both were meant to prove the ‘no-confidence’ motion against me in the House.” Yogi said, “Besides addressing the grievances of councillors on the first day of my charge, I announced to provide a room for them (councillors), with a seating capacity of more than 25 seats, for those reaching the Municipal Corporation office to get the grievances of their ward residents redressed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-mayor-takes-over-in-patiala-capt-loyalist-to-move-court/articleshow/87939025.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Kolkata||Metro tokens back with a bang, 33k sold on Day 1||KOLKATA: North-South Metro, on the first day that tokens returned, registered a 15,405 jump in passenger count. But the number of people who actually bought tokens on Thursday was double. The various stations had sold 32,951 tokens on the first day, proving there was high demand for single-travel tickets, the risk of contagion notwithstanding. All this time, people had to buy multiple-journey smartcards for Rs 120 even if they were taking the Metro just for a day or a single ride. A token, on the other hand, would cost Rs 5 for the shortest 2km trip. TOI had reported last Saturday that around 4,000 smartcards were being returned daily, forcing the carrier to debit nearly Rs 1.7 lakh from its cash counters across 26 stations every day. At the Metro Railway Users Consultative Committee (MRUCC) meeting on November 9, Metro’s general manager Manoj Joshi had promised to reintroduce tokens soon. He was responding to queries as to why smartcards were still the only means of boarding a Metro train. In March, the utility had deferred its decision to issue tokens as Bengal’s daily Covid count rose to 700-plus. On Monday, Metro announced its decision to reintroduce tokens from Thursday and the difference in rider count was instant — 3,47,313 people used the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar stretch on Thursday against Wednesday’s 3,31,908. Most tokens were sold from Dum Dum and Daskshineswar stations, said officials. “This shows people from the outskirts are keen on tokens rather than the safer and easily rechargeable smartcards. The fact that they must shell out at least Rs 120 — with Rs 80 kept as a security deposit — for a smartcard plays on their minds,” said a station master on the North-South corridor. Officials said that in the coming weeks, sale of tokens was expected to climb up to 60,000 or 70,000 per day as more and more people get to know that they were back in circulation. Preparing itself for such a situation, Metro has fed around 3 lakh tokens into the system to ensure adequate availability of fresh tokens at cash counters of the 26 North-South stations and the seven East-West stations. “Even if passenger count rises to 3.5 lakh, we would meet three or four times the token requirement,” said an official. There are ultraviolet sanitizer machines at every station to sterilize more than 300 tokens in four minutes flat for safe reuse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-tokens-back-with-a-bang-33k-sold-on-day-1/articleshow/87938411.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Within half an hour, state Congress president Nana Patole dashed to the other side of the city to meet with the party’s civic corporators, a crucial chunk of voters, at a popular hotel.An hour after that, he rushed to meet with the party’s representatives in Nagpur zilla parishad and panchayat samitis at a different location.A Congress leader said, “Patole will have to lead the campaign because Bhoyar is an unknown entity in rural areas. Even in the civic body, he’s not of the same stature as some of the top BJP leaders. So while Bhoyar’s the party’s face for the polls, the poster boy has to be Patole.”Addressing corporators, Patole said, “Make sure that your votes are for Bhoyar only. Try to get at least one vote from the other side. Some of you are capable of getting two or even three votes. This way our party’s candidate will close in during the polls.” A corporator, who was present during the meet, said, “Patole is the leader we have all been waiting for. When such an aggressive leader enters the battlefield, all of us on the ground get rejuvenated. It was amazing to see the energy between all party leaders as they came on a common platform today.”From the civic body, Congress is eyeing its own votes, those from allies and finally counting on candidate Bhoyar to bring in the rest.“Let BJP take their corporators anywhere. Let all of them be forcefully hidden. But mark my words, when the voting happens it will be clear that the saffron party has lost the trust of its own people,” said Bhoyar.Patole’s involvement has got the party working together because both urban and rural local bodies’ representatives are voters. His presence is currently working as a glue that’s binding different factions of the Congress, at least for now.“Just like Nitin Gadkari jumped into the fray for these polls to keep the flock together, Patole too has rushed to the frontline,” said another corporator. “These senior politicians are 10 times smarter than us, just their presence is proof enough that this particular poll is going to be a very close one,” added the corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-canvasses-for-bhoyar-meets-nmc-zp-panchayat-samiti-voters/articleshow/87937626.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

There are wards where other parties have a strong presence. We won’t field candidates there. The Left Front will support the best candidate,” said CPM Kolkata district secretary Kallol Majumdar while releasing the candidate list on Friday. A case in point is Ward 45 where the Congress fielded Santosh Pathak. The Left Front didn’t name any candidate for the ward. But leaders of both parties namely the Congress and the Left Front didn’t hold talks for seat adjustments at the state level. “We didn’t hold any talks on seat adjustments with the Left at the state level. We have instead left it to the local leaders to take the call,” said Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury. The Congress question apart, the Left Front stopped short of announcing candidates for four to five seats allotted for the Front partners — Forward Bloc, RSP, CPI and Marxbadi Forward Bloc. Majumdar said that the respective parties would send the names of candidates in a day or two. The Left Front list gave preference to young candidates, particularly women. There are 56 women on the Left Front candidate list. The Front also gave weightage to experience. At least seven of the outgoing councillors of the total 11 who remained with the Left Front till the KMC board was dissolved in 2020 after completing its five-year tenure found place in the candidate list. They include veterans such as Ratna Ray Majumdar, Karuna Sengupta, Madhuchhanda Deb, Chayan Bhattacharya, Mrityunjoy Chakrabarty. Mayor-in-council member in the Left Front-run KMC board Faiaz Khan is the CPM candidate from Ward 75.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-lf-candidate-in-15-16-wards-56-women-on-list/articleshow/87938332.cms||---

The state has been objecting to the CBI probe. An HC bench of justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal took on record a sealed cover submitted by CBI containing the investigation details. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi and ASG Anil Singh for CBI sought to tender the papers for the court’s perusal. Maharashtra government, special senior counsel Darius Khambata objected to the sealed cover submission. He said he is tendering an open chart of 1,800-1,900 police transfers and postings made from January 2020 to January 2021 when present director of CBI, Subodh Jaiswal was on the two police establishment boards that dealt with such postings. The HC clarified saying, “The mere fact that we have taken sealed cover for perusal to satisfy our conscience by itself will not be construed as reflection of merits of the rival contentions before us, which will be adjudicated in the decision that will be rendered.” The high court also permitted both sides, should they wish, to file by Monday short written submissions of only their oral arguments. HC said the written summary can’t exceed 10-12 pages. HC in an order said, “It is made clear if any argument is not advanced and it is reflected in the written submissions the same will not be considered.” Khambata said the state is aggrieved and moved HC as the CBI director who, under the agency’s manual, is informed of investigations cannot be helming a probe when he himself was directly in charge of taking decisions or making recommendation for police transfers and postings during the time-period that CBI is probing Deshmukh over allegations of corruption in such postings. Khambata said all that the state wants is a fair probe and the CBI cannot have an objection to that. Lekhi said the fact that it was submitting the probe update unasked in a sealed cover for court’s perusal itself shows its probe is fair.

---||Nagpur||Cops trying to prosecute Jawade’s minor murderers as ‘adults’||Nagpur: City police are exploring the possibility of prosecuting as ‘adults’ the minors involved in the murder of social worker Sunil Jawade, 46, on Thursday, as per the amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act, 2016. The four accused were sent to the Government Observation Home after being produced before the special court on Friday.Jawade was stabbed to death near his residence at Long March Chowk by the minors, whom he had reprimanded in the past to try and reform them. The minors were angry as Jawade’s nephew had allegedly raped one of their cousins. The minors felt Jawade would seldom discipline his nephew but mostly targeted them. Local residents had earlier said Jawade would scold youngsters if he found them indulging in addictions or neglecting studies. He was also known for helping local residents during any difficulties.CP Amitesh Kumar said he had issued instructions to legally explore possibility to ensure the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) treats the minors as adults as per the amended provisions. “Going by the gravity of the murder and the brutality, police would try to ensure JJB takes a call to categorise the minors as adults,” said the CP. He said efforts are being made to bring minors having crime records under surveillance. CP said NGOs would be roped in to help police in efforts to ensure minor offenders or juvenile delinquents are counselled along with their families. “We are trying to ensure minors who have dropped out of education system get help to resume studies with the help of NGOs,” he said.Additional CP Navinchandra Reddy said a dedicated drive against bootleggers and drug peddlers would be launched with special emphasis on the eastern part of the city (Zone IV). “Every bootlegger and peddler on record will be under scanner from now on. They generally rope in someone else to sell the narcotics, which will also be unearthed,” said Reddy, adding the network of drug suppliers and bootleggers would be busted.In the latest murder, the minors had consumed ganja and also some sedatives before zeroing down upon Jawade to eliminate him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-trying-to-prosecute-jawades-minor-murderers-as-adults/articleshow/87937640.cms||Soumitra Bose

The party will contest its maiden Chandigarh MC election on the party symbol. The move will mean formal registration of AAP as political party in Chandigarh. During Parliamentary election in 2019, AAP candidate and former union minister Harmohan Dhawan was considered an independent candidate on broom symbol. Due to this, his symbol drastically slipped to the 23rd slot in the Electronic Voting Machine queue. This time, AAP planned accordingly and applied for its symbol as recognition of a political party. “AAP’s central leadership prepared documentation keeping all the minute legal and election related aspects in mind. First, documents were submitted in the Election Commission of India in New Delhi and later, these were given to the State Election Commission in Chandigarh, within 24 hours of announcement of election. The State Election Commission, Chandigarh asked for some more documents, which we have submitted,” a senior party leader said. He added, “In case of a political party, its symbol comes first followed by symbols of independent candidates on Electronic Voting Machines. Therefore, the political party gets a major edge. Moreover, we have been keeping an eye on related legal and election issues on a regular basis.” AAP sources said that since the central leadership of the party is committed to contest the maiden Chandigarh election with full zeal, Chandigarh in-charge Jarnail Singh has been constantly visiting the city and discussing all campaign, legal and election-related aspects with the senior local leaders. Soon, senior leaders of AAP will visit the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-applies-for-party-symbol-ahead-of-mc-elections/articleshow/87938349.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||Man arrested for faking gold theft||Kolkata: A 25-year-old shop owner, who was under pressure from moneylenders, hatched a plan to ensure that he could delay the repayment. He “stole” over 316gm of gold ornaments — worth Rs 15.6 lakh — belonging to his 23-year-old sister and tried to pass it off as a theft by “an organized gang” inside New Market. He went to the moneylenders stating that since all the valuables of his family were now gone, he needed more time to pay them back. But on Wednesday, four days after the Broad Street shop owner and his sister lodged the FIR, the New Market police arrested the youth. His sister, too, is being questioned on suspicion of being a part of the conspiracy. The ornaments — that were gifted to the accused’s sister by her husband who works in the Middle East — were recovered on Thursday. According to police, the complainant’s sister approached them on Friday, stating that she wanted to withdraw the case. “We will inform the court about our findings and will follow its instructions,” said an officer from New Market police. On November 20, the complainant told cops that she had left her Broad Street residence with a few family members and went to New Market, where 316gm of gold ornaments were stolen from her.  “Their move of going to New Market with the huge amount of jewellery in itself raised suspicion. It could be a ploy to evade the moneylenders. But there was nothing conclusive that any outsider was involved in the theft,” said a senior police officer. “During the investigation, the complainant was closely interrogated and after checking CCTV footage the accused was arrested. All stolen ornaments were recovered from his possession,”said DC (central) Rupesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-arrested-for-faking-gold-theft/articleshow/87938353.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sunil Jakhar take swipes at each other||CHANDIGARH: A verbal spat broke out between Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu and his predecessor Sunil Jakhar on Friday with the former taking a dig at him for not raising key issues during his stint as the PPCC chief, to which Jakhar responded with a sarcastic tweet. Sidhu also questioned his party’s government in the state, asking why it has not filed a plea in the Supreme Court against the blanket bail to former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini. Interacting with mediapersons in Amritsar, Sidhu said, “The previous president, who tweets very enthusiastically, has he ever raised such an issue?” He was referring to the issues of sacrilege and drug abuse in the state. Sharing the video on his Twitter, Jakhar responded sarcastically with a couplet – (boot humko kahe kafir…) the “idol” is calling him an “infidel”. Sidhu also questioned the state government over the steps taken for justice in desecration cases and making the STF report on drug issue public. In reply to a question, whether he had complete coordination with the Punjab cabinet and was getting support from the Congress government, he said it was due to the concerted efforts of everyone that the electricity tariff and sand prices had come down. Sidhu said when he resumed charge as the PPCC president, he gave lists of district COngress presidents and spokespersons of the state unit to the party leadership. “I will give a list of 500 more persons. I am doing my work,” he said. Despite persistent efforts by the Congress central leadership, the Punjab unit has been marred by infighting ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Jakhar, who had reportedly turned down the offer to become a deputy CM in the new government under chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, has been taking swipes at both Sidhu and Channi. Sidhu took over as the PPCC president from Jakhar earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-jakhar-take-swipes-at-each-other/articleshow/87939047.cms||---

NMC’s medical superintendent, Bapusaheb Nagargoje, said instructions have been given to health officials to conduct random Covid tests of students and teachers. For this, teams, comprising health employees and lab technicians, will be deployed in all six divisions of the municipal corporation. Physical classes for students from Std VIII to XII began in Nashik city from November 22. And now the state government has also given permission to start offline classes for primary students from December 1. “We will visit the schools randomly and conduct health check-up of students. Those students or teachers having Covid symptoms would have to undergo RT-PCR test. Moreover, random Covid tests of students and teachers will be conducted during special drives,” Nagargoje said. There has been a marginal rise in number of active Covid patients in the city during the last few days. This may be because of the huge rush in markets during Diwali festival and also due to the ongoing wedding season. Hence, the NMC has also increased the number of RT-PCR tests from 2,000 to 3,500 per day during the last two days. Around 85% of the Covid tests are being conducted by the laboratory of the civic body at Bytco hospital, while the remaining 15% of the tests are being conducted by private hospitals. Currently, there are a total 164 active Covid cases in Nashik city, out of which 27 are under home isolation and 164 under hospitalization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-set-for-random-covid-tests-on-students-teachers/articleshow/87936972.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Hubballi||Kanakadasa’s first work ‘Mohana Tarangini’ being digitised||Haveri: Bhakta Kanakadasa was a poet, saint and reformer, who sought to question the status quo of his society, is rightly regarded as one of the greatest historical icons of Karnataka, and over the past few decades, much work has been done towards preserving his legacy and his vast corpus of works for posterity. Now, eager to preserve what is believed to have been the saint’s very first work, ‘Mohana Tarangini’, the palm leaf manuscript of which has fortunately survived till this day, two groups of friends in Byadagi and Kadaramandalagi, with the help of the Anjaneya (Kantesh) Swami Temple Pancha Committee, has undertaken the onerous responsibility of digitising this seminal text. Thus far, they have scanned more than a hundred pages of the manuscript. Those involved in this endeavour are hoping to publish the manuscript in the form of a book, while also ensuring that the digitised manuscript, in its original form, is available for the public. Malatesh Badiger, Jearaj Chatrad, DB Kusugur, Shashidharswamy Hiremath are among those invested in this exercise. Pointing to the antiquity of the text, which is more than five centuries old, they said that the contribution of Kanakadasa to Kannada literature was invaluable. Some of the historical records pertaining to Kanakadasa’s life state that he sojourned at the Kadaramundalagi Anjaneya Swami temple for a few days when he was en route to Tirupati. It was in Kadaramundalagi that the saint-poet is believed to have composed ‘Mohana Tarangini’, which is an ode to the God Sri Krishna. Jeevaraj Masanagi, a high school teacher involved in digitising the text, said that the primary objective of their endeavour was to ensure that Kanakadasa’s works could be accessed by all. “We undertook this work by ourselves,” he said. President of the Sri Anjaneya (Kantesh) Swami Temple Pancha Committee DC Kulkarni said, “The digital version of Mohana Tarangini will be accessible to all through the internet. We must preserve and spread the message of Kanakadasa’s works across society.” ‘A commendable effort’ Kanakadasa was a pre-eminent saint-poet and social reformer, and an iconic figure of the 16th century. The decision to digitise and thereby preserve Kanakadasa’s first work ‘Mohana Tarangini’ by these like-minded individuals is to be appreciated. - Ramesh Nayak | Professor, Department of Archaeology, Hampi Kannada University||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kanakadasas-first-work-mohana-tarangini-being-digitised/articleshow/87936970.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Only six out of 29 MPs turned up for the meeting which was supposed to be briefed on ‘doubling of farmers’ income by 2022’ by agriculture ministry officials. Headed by BJP Lok Sabha member P C Gaddigoudar, the committee has 21 members from Lok Sabha and eight from the Rajya Sabha. Sources said that though there was some informal briefing held for a few minutes while waiting for the members to turn up, it was later decided to adjourn the meeting when only six MPs could finally show up. Another meeting of the panel is expected to be called within next two weeks, they added. The ministry officials during the meeting were expected to brief the panel over the measures being taken to increase farmers’ income and the progress which could have been made so far. The Modi government had during its first term set a target of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022. Subsequently, an inter-ministerial committee on this issue was set up in April, 2016. The committee had submitted its report in September 2018, recommending various measures to achieve the target from 2012-13 level when average monthly income per agricultural household from all sources, as per NSO survey results, was estimated at Rs 6,426.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/just-6-of-29-mps-turn-up-parliamentary-panel-meet-on-farmers-put-off/articleshow/87940386.cms||---

Water supply on Thursday was low in some places due to this as the reservoir needed to be filled up. Work to fit bellmouths inside the reservoir that was left to be done will be completed from Saturday night till early Sunday. Two new pumps were recently installed at the Central Park pumping station to increase its pumping capacity for BMC to supply more water across Salt Lake.

Tenders regarding tarring of road, worth Rs 200 crore, have already been floated. The NMC is expecting to give the work orders for road tarring within a month so that the work can be started immediately. An NMC official said the road works worth Rs 250 crore were carried out a few months ago. “Some people had raised complaints alleging that the quality of the roads constructed by the NMC were of poor quality. The complaints were made to the urban development department that directed the civic administration to conduct a probe in this issue,” he said. Accordingly, the NMC had conducted third party inspections through the same agency and had submitted the report to the urban development department. “Considering the past experience, we have appointed a government agency to conduct the third party inspection of the roads constructed by the contractors to ensure the quality of roads is good and as per the SOP,” the official said.This is in line with the quality inspection the civic body had done during Kumbh Mela in 2015 when the NMC had roped in IIT-Bombay for the third party inspection. The NMC had carried out road works worth Rs 450 crore during Kumbh Mela and most of the roads constructed then are still in a good condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-ropes-in-3rd-party-forf-inspection-of-road-works/articleshow/87936984.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Chandigarh||‘Akali leaders to court arrest outside Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi house today’||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday announced that his party’s core committee members would court arrest in front of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s residence on Saturday in protest against what he described as the “Congress’s conspiracy to implicate MLA Bikram Singh Majithia in a false drugs case”. After the party’s core committee meeting, Sukhbir told media that SAD’s senior leaders would court arrest at noon on Saturday and this will be followed by a “jail bharo” andolan at the district level. “We have definite information that the chief minister has ordered the DGP to register a false case against Majithia. This has been done after the chief minister held a meeting with the Punjab Congress chief and home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa,” said Sukhbir. The SAD president said the Congress had earlier hatched a conspiracy to register a false case against him, but failed as the SAD had exposed the Congress leaders’ plan. Pointing out that the CM and his cabinet colleagues among other officials involved in the conspiracy were committing a criminal offence, Sukhbir said: “All of them are liable for prosecution.” Sukhbir announced that the SAD-BSP alliance would establish a commission to probe all false cases once it assumed power in the state. He aslso demanded that the entire drugs case be probed under the direct supervision of a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. It was apparent that both Channi and Sidhu were engaged in a vulgar one-upmanship race to commit vendetta against Akali leaders to divert attention from their government’s failure on all fronts, he added. The SAD president hailed the victory of the farm agitation and said it had created a unique example for the entire world by achieving its goal through peaceful and democratic means. “We want to tell Prime Minister Narendra Modi that if the BJP-led government had listened to the SAD, it would not have had to see this day,” he said. The Akali leader asked the central government to make minimum support price (MSP) a legal right and withdraw all cases registered against farmers during the course of their struggle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akali-leaders-to-court-arrest-outside-cm-house-today/articleshow/87939057.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Thane resident granted bail in ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh's corruption case||MUMBAI: A special CBI court has granted bail to Thane resident Santosh Jagtap, who was arrested last month in the corruption case the CBI is probing against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Granting bail to Jagtap on Wednesday, the court observed that substantial investigations have been completed against him and nothing is brought on record to show that he had any criminal antecedents. The court refuted the defence arguments that since Jagtap was not a public servant, he cannot be charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI had accused Jagtap of not cooperating with the probe. But Jagtap told the court that since he had Covid-19 and dengue in August and September, respectively, he could not remain present before the CBI. The court said, “He has not avoided joining the investigation deliberately. He has produced the medical papers to support his stand. Be that as it may, the applicant (Jagtap) is a permanent resident of Thane. There is less likelihood of his fleeing from justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/thane-resident-granted-bail-in-ex-home-min-corruption-case/articleshow/87939704.cms||---
---||Nagpur||BJP unfazed, confident of securing over 400 votes||Nagpur: Even as Congress candidate Ravindra Bhoyar refused to withdraw his nomination from the MLC elections, BJP seems to be undeterred by the development. The refusal means Nagpur will be the only seat among six going to the polls to witness the electoral battle between two national parties – Congress and BJP. In other five constituencies, the rivals have reached a consensus like in the 2015 elections, with candidates elected unopposed.“In Nagpur, the Congress might be hoping for a miracle, thinking they have granted the ticket to a former BJP leader. However, no miracle would take place as our nominee Chandrashekhar Bawankule would emerge victorious with a big margin,” leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said. He was in Delhi for a meeting with party’s top brass, including home minister Amit Shah.Even local BJP leaders are unfazed by Bhoyar’s refusal to withdraw the nomination. They expressed confidence in the party’s victory on December 14, when the counting takes place.“We are sure of getting over 400 votes for Bawankule and winning by a landslide. We have been preparing for the polls for a long time. Our activists and leaders are fully geared up for the big day,” city BJP chief Pravin Datke said.Agreeing with him, sitting MLC Girish Vyas pointed out that it was Congress state president Nana Patole who initiated a dialogue to have the elections unopposed. “There was no statement by our party in this regard. Bhoyar contesting or not hardly matters, as our victory is a foregone conclusion. We already have a sure shot vote bank of 400. We are also in talks with other voters, who want to be with us. Additionally, Bawankule has done a commendable job in the rural areas and, therefore, there is no question of cross voting. Even I worked hard during my tenure, which would certainly benefit the party,” he said.Leaders like spokesperson Archana Dehankar said their party was already ahead in all constituencies in terms of voters. “We are far ahead in votes in comparison to the combined strength of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). So Bhoyar’s entry hardly matters. I would rather say that withdrawal of their candidate would have turned out to be a face saver for the grand old party. Now, they would not only face the humiliation of losing the polls by a huge margin, but it would also dent its prospects in next year’s civic elections,” she said.Taking a dig at Bhoyar, who switched over to the Congress from BJP, other BJP leaders accused Congress of sacrificing Bhoyar even after being fully aware that he would be fighting for a losing cause. “If the party was really serious about winning, it would have nominated former minister Rajendra Mulak or senior corporator Praful Gudadhe. Everyone in BJP was aware of Bhoyar’s negativity and credentials. He was always negative and was never satisfied with the party. He got the corporator’s ticket only due to Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s blessings,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-unfazed-confident-of-securing-over-400-votes/articleshow/87937659.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||EDMC proposes increase in property tax, new levies||NEW DELHI: To improve revenue generation, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Friday proposed an increase of 2-3% in property tax on residential and non-residential categories, 5% on government accommodation, 10 times (Rs 5 to Rs 50) increase in fees for sanctioning building plans, among other levies. Presenting the proposed budget for financial year 2022-23, EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand proposed to increase property tax on residential properties in C, D and E categories from 11% to 13 %, and in F, G and H categories from 7% to 10%. The tax proposed for A–E non-residential categories was 15% of the annual value of the property and 12% for F, G and H categories. A 20% tax was proposed for residential quarters of government companies, autonomous bodies, statutory corporation, etc against the existing 15%. “Similarly, we have proposed new taxes, such as education cess, betterment and professional tax, some of which are already implemented in other states,” said Anand. Till November 5, EDMC had collected Rs 112 crore as property tax against a total target of Rs 350 crore. Last year, Rs 209 crore was collected. “We are also emphasising on bringing more properties under the tax net. While UPIC numbers have been issued to 7 lakh dwelling units, we are assessing people liable to pay tax with the help of the councillors. As of now, we have 2.5 lakh regular taxpayers. Besides, 1.9 lakh new people have registered on the property tax portal,” said the commissioner. For combating dust pollution due to illegal dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, EDMC has issued an order for direct disposal/transportation of malba from all construction sites to the C&D waste processing plant at Shastri Park. “While we have reduced the number of sites (from 61 to 17) for dumping waste in small quantities, there is a plan to start online services for collecting waste directly from properties at minimal charges,” Anand said. To get better rankings in Swachh Survekshan 2022, EDMC would be giving maintenance of public toilets (50 to begin with), especially those meant for women, on a PPP basis to private organisations. Faecal sludge management would be done at selected places and the civic body would apply for ODF++ certificate. “EDMC will provide a subsidy of Rs 25,000 or 25% of the cost of the machine, whichever is less, to bulk waste generators for processing their waste at source,” said the commissioner. Arrangements for e-waste disposal, scrap collection from houses and developing a technology park at New Jafrabad for treating floating material in drains have also been made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-proposes-increase-in-property-tax-new-levies/articleshow/87939078.cms||Vibha Sharma

On Sunday, Pravin Kakad (23), a resident of Dindori Road was killed around 5.30pm by three men. They got Kakad drunk and then attacked him with a sharp weapon. The police arrested the three suspects on Monday. The three men are in police custody till November 28. The Panchavati police have arrested a person and detained a minor in connection with the murder of a 33-year-old vegetable vendor, Rajesh Shinde, near the RTO office along Peth Road on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday. Seetaram Kolhe, senior inspector of the Panchavati police station, said the main accused and Shinde knew each other and the vendor had lent Rs5,000 to him. The police said the arrested accused claimed that he had returned the amount, but Shinde was demanding more money. “This led to the crime and the man was arrested from a spot near Sangamner,” he said. DCP (Zone 2) Vijay Kharat said the three murder cases, including that of Satpur mandal BJP president Amol Ighe on Friday, were cracked within five days. “In all the three murder cases, the suspects were arrested within 12 hours after the respective complaints were registered,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/four-arrested-for-two-murders-in-mhasrool-and-panchavati-this-week/articleshow/87936989.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chandigarh||Out-of-job Chaudhary enjoys powers of CM: Punjab ex-CM Amarinder Singh||Chandigarh: Former chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday lashed out at Congress incharge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary, accusing him of dictating terms to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Capt Amarinder also trashed accusations of being hand in glove with PM Narendra Modi and BJP, while he was the CM. Amarinder said although he owed no explanation to an “out-of-job legislator” who had been sacked as a minister in Rajasthan, he still wanted to set the record straight. He also questioned Chaudhary making Punjab his “permanent abode” and turning the present CM into a rubber stamp. He questioned the legality of Chaudhary getting a ministerial bungalow in Chandigarh and the entire Punjab Bhawan at his disposal, from where he commands and dictates orders to the chief minister, other ministers and the officers. “Who is paying for his expenses,” he asked. “Here is a man, who has been sacked from the government in his home state and is enjoying chief ministerial power and privileges in Punjab, turning Channi into a rubber stamp by dictating terms to him,” Capt alleged. He said Chaudhary had been even attending the cabinet and other meetings of officers, which was “illegal and unconstitutional”. “Had I had any understanding with the Prime Minister or BJP when I was the chief minister, I would not have supported the farmers’ agitation and demanded repealing of the agriculture laws and passed law in the Vidhan Sabha against these,” he pointed out. Meanwhile, Amarinder said, as the chief minister and home minister of Punjab, he was supposed to meet the Prime Minister and the Union home minister and so were his ministers who would meet their central counterparts. Amarinder said, it was for the first time that a party incharge had made the state as his permanent abode. “I have worked with 14 party incharges, like Pranab Mukherjee, Mohsina Kidwai and Janaradhan Dwivedi to name a few, and they would rarely interfere, leave aside visiting or settling down in Punjab,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-out-of-job-chaudhary-enjoys-powers-of-cm/articleshow/87939061.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New Town gets another pedestrian subway, two more work cocoons||KOLKATA: The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) on Friday opened two more work pods or cocoons named as ‘Happy Works Working Pods’ in New Town, one near Sankalpa 2 building and another near Eco Park Gate No. 4. The authorities also inaugurated the second pedestrian subway at Biswa Bangla gate or Narkelbagan crossing, connecting Biswa Bangla gate ticket counter side to the Tata Medical Centre end. The four point crossing will have four subways at each corners, with two more due to come up at the remaining corners soon. According to officials, the work pods have been set up with the idea to let people work from a quiet space which is close to their home. Many have already availed the facility. The first work pod, located opposite Nazrul Tirtha off the main arterial road, was opened earlier in August this year. “About 500 persons have so far availed the facility of the first work pod. The two new work pods are close to those residing in Action Area II and III,” said a Hidco official. There are 20 working desks for people to sit and work on their own in the pods. For convenience of the guests, each desk is numbered and a shelf full of books placed along with a tea table has been kept for reading. All the pods are air-conditioned with free high-speed WiFi facility. There are a few additional features in the two new work pods. Both have separate eight-seater facility for organising group study or small meetings. A women self-help group, which is under the guidance and supervision of Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage, has been engaged to look after and facilitate work at the work pods. The rental charges is Rs 30 for the first one and half hours, after which one would have to pay only Rs 20 for each additional hours. It was during the lockdown last year that Hidco had come up with the concept of having neighbourhood work cocoons for those who were working from home for a long time with boredom setting in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-gets-another-pedestrian-subway-two-more-work-cocoons/articleshow/87938384.cms||Suman Chakraborti

He also said even as there can’t be any comparison of conditions and challenges in Punjab as compared to Delhi, things were better in Punjab and schools will be compared on the central government’s Performance Grade Index (PGI). Later, Sisodia tweeted that he would wait for the list of 250 schools from Punjab which improved in last five years and he would also send his list. He said they would go to these schools together and would also invite the media. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Pargat said that the Aadmi Party government in Delhi invested all the money on 10 schools and now these were being used for publicity. “Increasing publicity budget of Delhi government from Rs 22 crore to Rs 600 crore speaks a lot about AAP government’s priorities,” he said. “Punjab has over 19,000 schools, while Delhi has just over 2,700. Punjab has large rural areas and border region. Kejriwal is just running a municipality, but rushes to compare everything with Punjab, which has much bigger challenges. Still, there has been a lot of improvement in government school education in Punjab,” he said, adding: “Even AAP’s first leader of opposition, H S Phoolka, praised Punjab’s improvement in school education.” Later, Pargat in a series of tweets said, “We will have a debate on school infrastructure and number of smart classrooms. We will debate about development of schools in rural and border areas of the state. We will compare data on newly recruited teachers and permanent teachers. We will take the data of increased number of teachers in border schools. We will compare the pupil-to-teacher ratio of the two states.” He added: “We will also compare challenges and complexes of managing seven times more schools in farflung areas of Punjab compared to a compact place like Delhi. We will also compare the number of students enrolled in government schools in the last 4.5 years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pargat-ups-sisodias-dare-on-govt-schools/articleshow/87939066.cms||---

On Monday, the detection of crime branch (DCB) sleuths had seized one tonne of marijuana that was being trafficked into the city from Odisha. This was the first time that marijuana in such a big quantity was being brought into Surat from this route, cops said. The confession of one of the accused, who revealed that this was the second time he had received the contraband of the same quantity, has put the cops on alert. Cops had seized 1009.290kg of marijuana from a truck with Maharashtra registration near Niyol check-post on Monday. Mohammad Faim Shaikh (24) and Mohammad Yusuf Shaikh (45), both living in Nanpura area of Surat, were arrested for ferrying the truck. The two revealed that one Dilip Gowda had loaded the marijuana from Barampura village of Odisha and told them to deliver it to Arun Mahadik in Dinoli, Surat. Mahadik, a city-based transporter, admitted that this was the second time he had ordered large quantities of the contraband from Gauda. After Mahadik’s confession, police have started investigating the local chain of this racket. Police sources said that the marijuana consignment was being smuggled into the city from Odisha using a road route.

Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob, sources said. The cops have so far arrested five accused and a heavy police force has been deployed at the village. Cops said that a ruckus created by the five accused at a pre-wedding function triggered the clash. The complainant, Arvind Nayani, stated that a dandiya program was organized at his home on the eve of a wedding. Two of the accused — Aarif Kumbhar and Ashraf Kumbhar — sped past Arvind’s house on their motorcycles several times. Arvind and his brother Bharat scolded the two and asked them not to drive rashly on the road as people were enjoying dandiya. The complaint alleged that after some time five people including Sale Kumbhar, Aarif Kumbhar, Ashraf Kumbhar, Bhaylo Kumbhar and Asif Kumbhar rushed to the function venue with sticks, pipe, and axes. They allegedly attacked the Nayani brothers. While Bharat was hit on the head with an axe, Arvind suffered injuries on hands. As the news of the attack spread in the village, a mob of around 200, that included people from both the communities, gathered and torched around six vehicles and six shops and cabins. The police rushed to the spot and resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob. B M Chaudhri, police inspector of Nakhatrana police station said: “We have arrested all the five accused and the situation at the village is under control. We have deployed a heavy police force in the village to avoid any untoward incident.” The accused were booked under IPC sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (armed with deadly weapons), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) and 307 (attempt to murder).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pre-wedding-bash-triggers-communal-clash-in-kutch/articleshow/87938570.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Arvind Kejriwal should deliver Punjab promises in Delhi: Congress||JALANDHAR: The Congress has said that Arvind Kejriwal should deliver in Delhi what he is promising in Punjab. It also said in the coming days they would be busting the “hollow claims” made by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders about their work in Delhi. “Whatever he is promising in Punjab, he should first deliver in Delhi. Is he promising the allowances in Delhi that he is promising here? Forget about adding anything new in infrastructure or facilities in Delhi he could not save what was built during Sheila Dixit’s government in 15 years and just focuses on publicity. The only thing he has scaled up in Delhi is budget on advertising which has been raised from Rs 22 crore to 600 crore there,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged, while addressing a press conference here on Friday. “Both PM Narendra Modi and Kejriwal are obsessed with publicity and are ‘vigyapanjeevi’,” he said. “His claims about increasing health facilities went up in the smoke during the pandemic. Delhi was the worst-hit metropolitan in the country,” he said. “Kejriwal changes his stand when he changes the place. Earlier, he would blame stubble burning by Punjab farmers for pollution in Delhi, but when elections are around the corner in Punjab, he is staying silent on that. Moreover, his earlier false propaganda on the issue against Punjab farmers has already been exposed during recent hearing in the Supreme Court,” Khera said. “The Delhi CM remains conscious about stunts to look like a ‘aam aadmi’ (common man). Recently, an AAP MLA who joined the Congress told us that he went in a meeting chaired by Kejriwal wearing a new swatter of a top brand, the Delhi CM asked if it was new and when he replied in affirmative he advised that it should have a hole on front side. This is the type of stunts he does,” he claimed.  Meanwhile, Khera also defended the different noises being made in the Punjab Congress stating that these reflected internal democracy in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/kejri-should-deliver-pb-promises-in-delhi/articleshow/87939072.cms||---

Since Tuesday, fishermen from Diamond Harbour have been bringing back 16,000-20,000 kg of hilsa everyday. This is thrice the quantum of catch they recorded during monsoon. “In the past couple of years, there were hardly any hilsa catches at this time of the year. This year, the monsoon catch was disappointing. But there has been a windfall this week,” said a trawler operator in Diamond Harbour. Scientists and fisheries department officials said the unusual catch may be linked to climate change. “The multiple depressions in the Bay of Bengal may have led to a change in the fish behaviour,” remarked state assistant director of fisheries (marine) Jayanta Pradhan. Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture-Kakdwip principal scientist and officer-in-charge Debasish De pointed out that hilsa sholes move to shallow to breed and then return around this time of the year. “Hilsa breeds twice in a year, once in February-March and again in October-November. To lay the eggs in the river, some fish start the journey from the sea early. Many have already laid eggs,” he said, while expressing concern for the hilsa population . Though the catch is in abundance with fish weighing between 700gm and over 1.5kg, it hasn’t quite enthused the markets. “We are getting a lot of hilsa at the right price, but not many customers are keen on purchasing it in this off-season. Had this arrived two months ago, there would have been tremendous excitement,” said Maniktala fish market joint secretary Bablu Das. Many in wholesale business are lifting stocks and putting them in cold storage for sale next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/out-of-season-hilsa-floods-markets-scientists-smell-climate-change-link/articleshow/87938387.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Those who are found without masks will be slapped with a fine of Rs 1,000 each and wedding hall owners will have to pay Rs 5,000. If the individuals are found for the second time without masks, then the wedding hall will be closed, said NMC officials. NMC officials said they will start a drive in this connection from next week. Huge overcrowding during the wedding functions was one of the major reasons for the second wave of the Covid pandemic in April this year. “We are worried that a section of people are still not following the Covid appropriate behaviour. We all need to maintain all the Covid safety protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” said Avesh Palod, director of the solid waste department of the NMC. “The wedding season has begun from this month.

As on date, the coastal district has 115 active cases. Among them, six of the infected are below 15, and about 20 of the infected are in their 20s, said Kishore Kumar M, DHO. “The second wave started with the outbreak of Covid-19 in nursing and medical colleges. This time we are extra vigilant. Therefore, we have asked every college to report students who have any symptoms of Covid-19. Follow regular SOPs and get vaccinated,” said Kishore. Meanwhile, the directorate of medical education has sent a circular to all colleges in the state to adhere to Covid-19 SOPs on Thursday. “Ensure that all eligible staff and students receive two doses of vaccine, wear masks and maintain social distancing. “As of now, there are no Covid-19 cases reported in any campus in the district.” “We have warned students who are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. The college is planning to fine students who fail to wear masks inside the campus,” said Tharanath, principal, SDM Law College, Mangaluru. “We are also discouraging students from Kerala to go back to their hometowns on weekends. Kerala still has the highest positivity rate,” said the head of a nursing college. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer for Covid-19, said that Mangaluru is vulnerable, since it has an international airport with travellers arriving from various countries. “Through children, we are now requesting everyone above 18 to get vaccinated to protect against Covid-19 at the earliest. NSS volunteers too have been roped in. In the second wave, 953 people lost their lives to Covid-19. Among them, 42 people were vaccinated, including 23 with a second dose,’’ he added. “The district administration will soon call a meeting of all heads of educational institutions to discuss the spread of Covid-19 in campuses,” said KV Rajendra, deputy commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/coast-on-alert-after-edu-campuses-in-other-dists-record-covid-cases/articleshow/87937674.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

He has served three terms as an independent councillor in Mahadulla Nagar Panchayat adjoining Koradi. He also contested the assembly elections from Kamptee constituency as an independent.As per the norms, a candidate needs the support of 10 voters to become eligible to fill the nomination form. “There are 19 councillors and the municipal council chief who are elected directly by people in Mahadulla. 10 councillors, six from BJP, two from Congress and one from BSP, supported me in filing the nomination form. I will try to convince them to vote for me as well as for other members,” Deshmukh told TOI.Deshmukh, who exposed the coal scam at Koradi thermal power station recently, is said to be an activist from Prahar Janshakti Party which is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi. The party’s leader Bacchu Kadu is a minister in the government.“I contested the Mahadulla Nagar panchayat elections as an independent candidate. Here too, I’m contesting as an independent. Therefore, I should not be linked with Prahar,” he said.BSP is having 10 seats in Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The party also has some more seats in rural. Still, BSP did not field its candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-support-of-bjp-cong-bsp-members-ind-candidate-deshmukh-remains-in-fray/articleshow/87937684.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The petition filed through advocate Anand Yagnik states that many families living within the ashram trust premises have been offered large sums as compensation for their proposed displacement. The slum dwellers are also going to be displaced but have not been offered either any compensation or alternative accommodation. These hutments are behind a water tank adjacent to the ashram. The petition claims that the Regulations for Rehabilitation and Redevelopment of Slums 2010 is a welfare legislation, enacted for the benefit of slum dwellers. Section 3 of the regulations defines an eligible slum dweller and says that whoever has remained an occupant of a slum for a minimum period of 10 years and has a domicile of Gujarat for 25 years or is a descendent of such a person would fall within the definition of an eligible slum dweller for relief. The occupants of hutments near the ashram have been living there for over 15-20 years and are hence entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with the law. The high court is likely to hear this petition on November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eviction-bid-for-ashram-revamp-slum-dwellers-move-hc/articleshow/87938403.cms||---

The state logged 21 new cases, which took the tally to 174. However, experts said out of the total infected people, 66% of the patients are fully vaccinated, while 14% of them have received a single dose. Hence, they have very mild symptoms, they said. Also, presently the hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients has been negligible so far. Doctors associated with Covid care and management, however, urged people to continue following Covid appropriate behaviour and get fully vaccinated. In Jaipur, the hospitalisation is almost nil, and experts attributed it to the vaccination. With nine fresh cases, the number of active cases is now 100 in the city. "Majority of the patients are getting treated at their homes by following prescriptions and tests suggested by their consultant doctors," said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college. Meanwhile, experts said vaccination had saved many, who recently contracted the virus. "We have found that out of the total Covid-19 positive people, 66 % are fully vaccinated, while 14 % have received a single dose. So far people are with the mild symptoms, thus hospitalisation is presently negligible," said Vaibhav Galriya, principal secretary, health department. "We have got patients of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) at the RUHS, but the number of patients admitted for Covid-19 is almost zero," Galriya added. He added that people, who are yet to get jabbed, should go for it as it had been showing good results. A total of 21 cases were detected in the state out of which Jaipur reported 9 cases, Ajmer 2, Alwar 2, Nagaur 2, Rajsamand 2, and one case each came from Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, and Udaipur. Now, the number of active cases in the state is 174. "A fortnight ago, the number of active cases was merely 40, which has increased, but the severity is so far not much. Still, people should continue following Covid appropriate behaviour and those who are yet to get vaccinated, should go for it," said an officer with the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/9-fresh-covid-cases-in-jaipur-state-logs-21/articleshow/87939080.cms||---

Justice Gita Gopi was not pleased with the efforts undertaken by the Women Cell of Ahmedabad city to bring the accused back. The court cited earlier orders by which the HC had in 2018 directed the authorities to ensure the man’s presence in court. Citing 2019 guidelines and the 1987 treaty between India and Canada and said that a mechanism for extradition of offenders from foreign countries has been provided in these documents. “In the present case, the Investigating Officer concerned has not taken any steps for the purpose of securing the presence of the accused persons before the court of law in India in spite of the directions of this court,” the high court said and granted the last opportunity to the Assistant Commissioner of Police of Women Cell to bring the man to Indian court to face a trial on the basis of a criminal complaint that the wife had lodged in Ghatlodia police station. The HC has sought report from the ACP by December 21 to show what actions have been taken in this regard. The woman was represented by advocates Arun Oza and Meet Shah in this case. The cops also faced court’s wrath in this case for not following CrPC and for showing reluctance in asking Interpol to issue a redcorner notice because it was a case under section 498A of IPC. After the man dumped his wife in India and fled to Canada, divorce proceedings were instituted in Ahmedabad’s family court, but the husband continued to dodge the proceedings leading to frequent reprimand from the court for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-told-to-bring-wife-deserter-from-canada/articleshow/87938407.cms||---

---||Nashik||Nashik commuters complain about cleanliness in inter-city express trains||NASHIK: Railway commuters from Nashik have complained about cleanliness in two inter-city express trains — Panchavati Express that runs between Manmad and Mumbai, Nanded-Mumbai Rajya Rani Express whose 10 coaches open exclusively at Manmad. The Nashik Pass Dharak and Pravasi Welfare Association Nashik has claimed that the coaches of both the trains are not as clean as they used to be some time ago and this has consistently been observed for over a long time. “The daily travellers are complaining about dirt and dust in coaches on regular basis, though not on daily basis. At a time when Covid has brought the world to a standstill, hygiene needs to be maintained by the Railways,” Rajesh Fokane, president of the association, said. The coaches of Pancahvati Express are shared with Jalna Janshatabdi Express and the Rajya Rani Express comes from Nanded. The dirt and dust is visible in coaches when the trains start from Mumbai or when the coaches are opened at Manmad and Nashik Road. “The dirt and unclean environment can be easily noticed. Hence, we are saying that the coaches are not being cleaned. The stains of water or tea donning the floors and food particles in the corners are the basis of our allegations,” Sandesh Karade, another frequent traveller, said. “Like in cinema halls, schools and auditoriums where the organisers or service providers need to ensure cleaning of the premises, same is true for the Railways as well where the administration needs to ensure clean coaches,” he added. Rohini Patil, another frequent traveller, found the coaches to be better than what it was in the past. “The railway environment has changed a lot than what it was five years ago. Thanks to railway authorities we are now used to travel in clean coaches. So even smallest of things now irritates us. We are much concerned about Covid infection. I am sure railway authorities will take corrective measures regarding this,” Patil said. Authorities have directed the officials concerned to take the necessary steps. “Cleanliness is being given the top priority. There may be some instances which we do not deny. Officials concerned have been asked to find out the issue causing the problem and rectify the same,” a senior railway official from Bhusawal division of Central Railway said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-commuters-complain-about-cleanliness-in-inter-city-express-trains/articleshow/87937028.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Chandigarh||Congress doing ‘tamasha’: BJP||CHANDIGARH: Opposition party BJP said on Friday it had always been clear that Punjab chief minister Charanjit Channi and state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu are not on the same page, because of their conflict of interest, but it was shame that in the process they had made Punjab a stage for ugly political gimmicks. BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh said Channi and Sidhu had made ‘tamasha’ (drama) out of the entire state. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) were also doing the same, he said. “Instead of making sensible statements and promises to the people, they are ridiculing people of Punjab by making false and baseless promises,” he said. In response to the reports that Channi’s brother was involved in the ‘Ludhiana City Scam’, Chugh said BJP had been always saying that the Punjab Congress was nothing but mafia gangs and corruption personified. The BJP functionary said the Congress government in Punjab did not know what the right hand was doing and what the left one was doing. The way Channi and Sidhu had been at crossroads indicated clearly that the party high command had no idea how a sensitive border state like Punjab has been handed over to political ‘tamashbins’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-doing-tamasha-bjp/articleshow/87939082.cms||---

Now rechristened Yantra India Limited (YIL), the factory has bagged a Rs40 crore contract to make railway axles. The company has also finished price negotiations for another deal worth Rs400 crore. The Rs400 crore deal is expected to be clinched in this month. Talks are also under way with automobile makers to get orders for making auto components too. YIL has approached a rail coach factory to make fabricated structures like doors and windows too. The factory has machinery which can also be used for making products catering to these sectors. The measures are part of efforts to increase the turnover of YIL. As a PSU, the company will have to emerge as a self-sufficient business entity. From October, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which had 41 factories under it, has been split into seven PSUs. YIL has seven factories under it and is headquartered at Nagpur. YIL’s present turnover stands at Rs1,500 crore and to break even the turnover will have to be increased, said director (operations) of YIL AN Srivastava. He was speaking to TOI on the sidelines of a seminar on MSME’s participation in defence manufacturing sector. The seminar was organized by Vidarbha Defence Industries Association (VDIA). Another major order for making 60,000 shells of 155 mm calibre is also expected to be finalized by the end of this month. The order has come from a middle eastern country, and is worth Rs200 crore, said Srivastava. The fresh orders are expected to take the company’s turnover to the break even level. Apart from manufacture of items, YIL is also foraying into engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contracts. A Rs2,500 crore deal is being eyed from a contract to build a factory to make shells in the middle east. YIL has bid for the contract. Diversification will help the company maintain sustainable business as orders from armed forces fluctuate depending on the requirement. Pursue export and civil orders, addl secy tells YIL Additional secretary (defence production) Sanjay Jaju had visited the factory last week. The officer held a meeting with the board of directors. He said YIL should aggressively pursue export and civil trade orders. This would help the company increase its order books and reach new levels, said a press release issued by the company. Jaju said YIL has huge potential in the supply chain management due to the skill sets and infrastructure at its disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yantra-india-takes-ambajhari-of-to-rlys-auto-sector-orders/articleshow/87938470.cms||Shishir Arya

G Amrutha, DCP (traffic), said: “Yes, they are being removed. Directions have been issued to DDA from traffic for the same. DTP gave permission to install speedbreakers, not rumble strips, hence, the removal has been ordered.” Recently, the speedbreakers appeared overnight on a road opposite a five-star hotel in Vasant Kunj area. They became a nuisance for residents and commuters and the hotel authorities said they were unaware of who had installed them. Rajiv Singh, a local resident, said he was happy with the quick response of the officials and also thanked TOI for highlighting the issue.

The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta spoke strongly for the protection and conservation of the Asiatic lions when advocate Hriday Buch placed a photograph showing a lioness being surrounded by many tourist vehicles in Gir. The image recently went viral. Advocate Buch is representing an NGO which has filed a PIL opposing proposal of a tourism zone in Girnar sanctuary. He submitted that there is a need to strike a balance between the interest of the species and the interest shown by them in the lions. “This needs to have some checks somewhere,” he submitted. On this, Justice Pardiwala said, “Personally, if you ask me, humans should not meddle in the animal kingdom. There is no doubt about it. But we don’t have facilities like Maasai Mara and Kruger National Park (of Africa). It is not easy to reach to that place. People get so excited having a look at one lioness. Oh God.” The discussion soon led to the issue of illegal lion shows, of which an image was published in newspapers. On the problem, the court told the state government, “You come out with something. Let lions and lionesses live in peace. Why do you harass them? If anyone wants to have a look, go to the zoo. Don’t meddle with nature. Now they have started walking in towns.” Justice Mehta said that due to these lions shows, there is an apprehension that the hunting skills among the lions would decrease on day. This will be another problems for the humans because they would attack the humans. The judges insisted further to the government, “This activity of safari should be minimal. Come out with some policy. Don’t allow humans to interact a lot with these animals. What do you get out of it? Let them live in peace. Try to read the policy in this regard of other countries. What are their policies? How do they take care of this? Do some research. We take so much pride in the Asiatic lions. What does Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan say, ‘yeh nahi dekha to kuchh nahi dekha’. Save it, or you will not have anything to see.” When the government lawyer tried to defend the concept of safari by submitting that those lions, which lose the ability to hunt are kept here, the judges said, “Put them back into forest. Why do you need the safari at all?” The court, however, appreciated the regulation of tourist flow in Sasan. The judges have asked the government to come out with a plan to regulate tourist activities by next week, “otherwise we will suggest what to do”, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/let-lions-live-in-peace-dont-meddle-in-animal-kingdom-hc/articleshow/87938449.cms||---
---||Shimla||Covid-19: Himachal Pradesh struggling to achieve 100% vaccination target by December 3||MANALI: Achieving the deadline of completing the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine by December 3 has become an uphill task for the Himachal government as people are not showing any interest in visiting the health centres. Lakhs of people who received the first dose four or five months back have missed their second dose. The deadline has been extended from November 30 to December 3, but it is likely to be extended further. Himachal become the first state in the country to administer the first dose to its entire adult population in August this year. With more than 84 days gone since, all the 18+ people in the state are eligible for second dose. Now, the government is taking help of panchayats to motivate eligible beneficiaries to get their second dose. While 58.02 lakh beneficiaries received their first dose of vaccine in the state, around 49.2 lakh only have received the second dose. An official said second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is being administered at almost all health centres of the state. “All deputy commissioners and chief medical officers have been asked to achieve the target. Eligible people are being requested to get vaccinated at the earliest. Door-to-door campaigns are also being run to ensure that nobody is left out. Elderly, sick and physically challenged people are being inoculated at home or in their vehicles outside health centres,” he said. The new deadline can be achieved only if more than one lakh people are given second dose every day. On Thursday, only 72.9 thousand people received second vaccine dose. However, officials claim that number of beneficiaries was more as many migrant labourers and officials on leave during lockdown had received first dose in the state and have now returned to their respective states. In Kullu, a gram sabha was organised in all panchayats to motivate people to come forward for second dose. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said, “In Kullu, 3.39 lakh people above 18 years were administered first dose, while only 2.84 lakh people have received second dose. It will be a matter of pride for Himachal to become the first state in the country to have its eligible population fully vaccinated. However, many people are still not coming to get second dose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-struggling-to-achieve-100-vax-target-by-dec-3/articleshow/87939095.cms||Suresh Sharma
---||Kolhapur||MSRTC staffers call off strike in Kolhapur district||KOLHAPUR: Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) staffers called off the strike in the district on Friday night, following which some buses of the utility returened to the roads. The state transport body, MSRTC, had on Thursday issued a two-day ultimatum to workers to end their ongoing strike and resume duty by Friday, failing which they could face suspension or dismissal from work. The MSRTC workers have been on a strike demanding a merger of cash-strapped corporation with the state government. This, the agitating staffers, said would give them the status of state government employees and better salaries. Uttam Patil, head of the MSRTC workers’ union in Kolhapur, said, Älmost 70% of our demands have been approved. Transport minister Anil Parab has pledged to fulfill the rest of the demands We are suspending our strike to avoid the passengers’ inconvenience.” He said, “MSRTC divisional controller Rohan Palange has given us a letter that they are cancelling the suspension orders issued against 58 staffers who had participated in the strike. They will resume work on Saturday morning.” On Friday morning, the Kolhapur-Ichalkaranji bus services resumed after a gap of 18 days. Later, around 20 buses from Kolhapur plied on various routes (Kolhapur-Swargate, Chandgad-Shinoli, Kolhapur-Sangli, Kolhapur- Ichalkaranji, Chandgad- Halkarni, Halkarni-Shinoli and Chandgad-Patne). Harsh Shah, a textile engineer, said, "I have to travel daily to Ichalkaranji for my work. As the buses were not plying due to the strike, I had to travel on my bike to Ichalkaranji. Private transport vehicle and cab operators were fleecing the passengers. The news of the MSRTC buses returning to the roads is a big relief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/msrtc-staffers-call-off-strike-in-kolhapur-dist/articleshow/87937042.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Mumbai||MVA’s report card a mixed bag: Covid management fair, can do better in healthcare||MUMBAI: With the first novel coronavirus case in Maharashtra detected barely four months after Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as chief minister on November 28, 2019, his Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s two-year report card reads more like a Covid management statement. Maharashtra’s Covid burden of 66 lakh patients and 1.4 lakh deaths so far is higher than that of many countries. Experts believe the hurriedly patched-up coalition of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress handled the pandemic better than what many feared, but there is still a lot to do. As health economist Ravi Duggal put it: “The MVA government has done a good job in comparison to other states as far as Covid is concerned, but what about routine healthcare?” If MVA ticked the right boxes for mobilising beds quickly, recruiting temporary manpower (at times from other states) and carrying out one of the most accessible vaccination programmes in the country, some experts point out little has been done to carry out systemic changes to bolster the state’s flagging public health system. For instance, despite having over 2,000 primary health centres on paper, a well-staffed one is not easy to find in rural areas. Doctors forecast a mild third wave and believe the lull is the time to kickstart long-term steps. “The stop-gap arrangements required to handle the pandemic caseload have to give way to permanent solutions,’’ said a state official. During the two Covid waves, the inadequate rural healthcare infrastructure and lack of trained manpower became glaring. “Critical patients had to travel kilometres to other districts, increasing the time taken to start treatment. Simply erecting hospital buildings without trained manpower and equipment is no longer enough,” said Ramesh Patil, a health activist from Latur. Over 18,000 people were recruited on a temporary basis to work in the Covid centres, but intensivists and ICU nurses were conspicuous by their absence. Moreover, the government was caught napping between the two waves: no measures were taken to bolster the system for the second wave. As a result, shortage of oxygen, medicines and the appearance of opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis made headlines. The will to do something lasting seems to be missing, said experts. “The government presented a budget amid the pandemic, but made no effort to increase the health budget allocation from 0.5% of the State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) to, say, 1% or even 1.5%,” said Duggal. The budgetary allocation for 2021-22 was Rs 16,839 crore, about 3.5% of the total budget outlay of the state government. State health minister Rajesh Tope visited Chennai to study its drug purchase policy but hasn’t taken a step forward. “If we allow the TN system to buy our medicines, we will get three times what we get now. Wouldn’t that be helpful?” asked Duggal. According to the National Public Health Profile 2019, Maharashtra has six doctors for every one lakh population and 67,087 people are dependent on one primary health centre. Dr Abhijit More, member of NGO Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Aam Aadmi Party, said there are over 17,000 vacant posts in the health department. “Three exams were held to fill up these vacancies, but by a blacklisted company. The result is that no recruitment has taken place so far,” he said. While Covid underlined the need for better mental healthcare response, the system is grossly inadequate. An official said up to 40% posts for psychiatrists and therapists are vacant. “Districts such as Satara and Sindhudurg don’t have a single psychiatrist in the government set-up,” said a senior official. Any government has to work towards a single goal if it has to be considered health-friendly, said Duggal. “Raise the health expenditure to Rs 4,000 per capita as opposed to Rs 1,400 at present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mvas-report-card-a-mixed-bag-covid-mgmt-fair-can-do-better-in-healthcare/articleshow/87939771.cms||Bhavika Jain

People who have older pets or ones with health complications, can now breathe easy, with a new facility, BestBuds Hospital in Ahmedabad, offering ventilator support and even an isolation ward for pets. The not-for-profit facility was founded by Ahmedabadbased entrepreneur, Shaival Desai. He opened the hospital after preparing for over a year, after he lost his own pet due to the lack of proper treatment. “Last year, my dog, Buddy, died from a relatively minor health problem. He was sick for about 12 days and was barely a year old. The experience was traumatising because he was too young and I thought that if he had received timely treatment, he would have been with us. This led me to start a hospital which has all facilities to be able to treat pets,” said Desai, who is the trustee of the hospital. The facility is equipped to treat dogs, cats, birds, turtles, iguanas and many other exotic animals and birds. Two doctors have been roped in for the facility, which has ventilator support, two operation theatres, a digital x-ray machine, a lift and stretchers for injured pets that cannot walk. “An isolation ward has also been set up for pets infected with communicable diseases. Moreover, dogs who have carcinoma can also get chemotherapy here,” said one of the veterinary doctors who will be running the facility. The facility can come handy even for treatment of stray dogs, apart from the guard and sniffer dogs of the CISF and BSF. “After the lockdown, the number of pet-owners in Ahmedabad has increased dramatically. With more pets, it is important to create medical facilities for them. We aim to start facilities that will be able to admit pets with serious complications as well,” Desai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gets-its-1st-veterinary-ventilator-hospital/articleshow/87938436.cms||---

The idea is to increase the revenue of the corporation and provide better civic facilities to citizens,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Creating more multi-level parking lots and e-charging facilities, better utilisation of healthcare facilities, maintenance of parks and nurseries, maintaining public toilets, lifting of illegally parked vehicles, renting or leasing out part of new EDMC zonal building at Karkardooma: These and many more projects are proposed to be taken up under the scheme. “By doing this, we will be able to at least speed up work on areas/projects that are pending for a long time. For example, to reduce congestion on roads, we need multi-level parking lots. At present, there is only one multi-level parking at Krishna Nagar available,” said Anand. An EDMC official said that the engineering department had finalised two sites for developing parking on PPP basis, including surface parking near Karkardooma District Court and Laxmi Nagar District Centre. The east corporation will soon sign a contract with DSIIDC for identifying sites and allowing advertisement on revenue sharing models. There is also a plan to allocate space in parks to companies for opening milk booths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cash-starved-corpn-looks-at-ppp-mode-for-projects/articleshow/87939104.cms||Vibha Sharma

The traders and vendors were supposed to get Rs 50,000 each. The authorities have claimed that the funds have been released recently, but many lacked documents required to be eligible for the compensation. Some have also lost the documents during the floods, while some have not renewed their licenses. Hence, district authorities have expanded the list of valid documents for getting compensation. Shankar Jadhav, the resident deputy collector of Kolhapur said, "The traders and vendors holding shop cabins can provide any certificate issued by any government agency, which shows their presence at flood-affected localities.

---||Mangaluru||Govt doc in custody for indecent behaviour with women colleagues||Mangaluru: Police on Friday took into custody a government doctor on the charge of behaving indecently with his women subordinates. Earlier in the day, Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K V Rajendra confirmed that Dr Ratnakar, the district leprosy officer, had been suspended pending inquiry following anonymous complaints related to alleged indecent behaviour with women colleagues. City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that based on a complaint filed by a representative of a women’s organisation, which accused the doctor of sexually harassing women subordinates, a case was registered at the Mangaluru women’s police station, which will investigate the case. Several pictures and videos had gone viral on social media of the doctor and some women. The inspector of the women's police station reached out to the women working in the office with the request that they file a complaint. Several of them said they would support the investigation but refused to lodge a complaint. DC Rajendra told TOI that after the department of health and family welfare received some photographs of the doctor, “an internal committee was set up based on the Visakha guidelines and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. We conducted an inquiry. Based on the recommendation of the district complaints committee, the administration sought disciplinary action against the official in August. Following this, as per the government orders, the officer was suspended on November 8. He was transferred to another district for some technical reasons.” The DC said: “This is a sensitive issue because it involves the dignity of women. We have received several anonymous complaints and calls regarding the officer.” Asked about reports that the doctor tried to bring a stay on the inquiry, the DC did not say anything directly. “Till the final inquiry is complete, we cannot discuss finer details,” he said. There is also an allegation that the doctor misused funds. When asked about it, DC Rajendra said that the doctor has allegedly submitted exorbitant bills. The financial angle would be probed. Dr Ratnakar also held additional responsibilities. He was the district nodal officer for the Ayushman Bharat scheme and programme officer for National Blindness Control Programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-doc-in-custody-for-indecent-behaviour-with-women-colleagues/articleshow/87937697.cms||---

The report was released in a webinar organised by Consumer Voice in collaboration with ESM Cell of Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. The report — Big Tobacco, Tiny Targets — revealed that tobacco companies are allegedly systematically targeting children as young as eight-year-old in Haryana by selling tobacco products and placing tobacco advertisements near school premises in clear violation of sections 5 and 6 of Cigarettes & Other Tobacco Products Act. Over 72% points of sale around educational institutions in 25 cities were found displaying cigarettes, bidis and smokeless tobacco products near candies and sweets at the eye level of children. These were selling single stick cigarettes and offering free/ discounted tobacco products to schoolchildren. Dr Rita Kotwal, deputy director (public health) and state nodal officer National Tobacco Control Program (NTCB), Haryana, said elaborate steps have been taken to check tobacco sale. “Recently, the government has reinforced the ban on sale of tobacco,” she said. To strengthen tobacco control, Voice COO Ashim Sanyal suggested that the government strengthen monitoring of COTPA 2003 to protect our children and youth from falling prey to the tactics of tobacco companies. “Tobacco Vendor Licensing is beneficial in all aspects looking at the current pandemic as well. Vendors can sell products lawfully and it can save children luring towards tobacco addiction,” said Sanyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/survey-cigarettes-kept-near-candies-sweets-to-attract-kids/articleshow/87939102.cms||---

His condition is stable and his blood samples have been sent for investigations, reports of which are awaited. “He is suffering from fever and the test reports are awaited,” said a doctor.

That figure represents an increase of 5.40 crore trees as compared to the 2017 survey number of 34.35 crore trees in the non-forested rural area. The number of trees has increased by 15.73% over the past five years. The previous tree census was carried out in 2017. The census data shows that the total tree density per hectare in the state has increased to 25.74 in 2021 against 22.38 reported in the 2017 census. Overall, the tree density in all the 33 districts has increased marginally by 15%. Anand district recorded the highest tree density rise at 71.44% followed by Valsad with 69.5%. The lowest percentage increase of tree density in the state was recorded in Surendranagar district at 4.5% and in Devbhoomi Dwarka at 8.79%. A random sampling was done in 933 villages of 251 talukas in all the 33 districts covering non-forested village area of 7,34,041 hectares. The survey was conducted in 4.06% of the total state area. The census data shows that per person tree numbers rose from 5.6 in 2017 to 6.58 in 2021. Trees per family of five members rose to 33 from 28. Districts with tree density above 50 per hectare include Anand, Tapi, Navsari, Valsad, Dang, Vadodara, Gandhinagar, Panchmahal, Nadiad, and Mehsana. Ahmedabad, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, and Surendranagar are districts that have tree density below 10 per hectare. These are considered ‘tree-poor districts.’ The data shows that over five years, gando baval has been on the decline in the state. The bush tree was brought to India in 1877 by the British, and introduced in the 1950s and 1960s in Kutch and Saurashtra to check the spread of the Little Rann of Kutch. It became a major concern later due to its aggressive expansion. Eucalyptus and neem are the top trees in the state in terms of population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/natures-highrises-villages-beat-cities-in-tree-spike/articleshow/87938467.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

With this, 22 temporary workers of the MSRTC in the division have been terminated from service so far. The MSRTC workers have been on a strike demanding a merger of the cash-strapped corporation with the state government. This, the agitating staffers, said would give them the status of state government employees and better salaries. On Friday, none of the 4,500 out of the 5,000 striking employees of the MSRTC in Nashik division joined duty. “The only buses that were running to Dhule and Pune were that of the Shivshahi services, which belong to a private fleet operator,” the officer added. The officials said that after the announcement of a salary hike by the state government, 35 employees came back to work. “But none of them was related to the MSRTC buses,” the officer said. MSRTC, had on Thursday issued a two-day ultimatum to workers to end their ongoing strike and resume duty by Friday, failing which they could face suspension or dismissal from work The citizens have started expressing their anger against the striking MSRTC staffers. “The demands by MSRTC employees may be genuine and the government has reciprocated to their causes. The employees should now take up their duties and not hold commuters to ransom,” city resident Mustaq Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/12-more-temporary-st-workers-in-nashik-divn/articleshow/87937094.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||No fairness left after appointment of SPP by lieutenant governor in riots cases: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: The AAP government told Delhi High Court on Friday that on account of the lieutenant governor appointing lawyers recommended by police as special public prosecutors (SPPs) for sensitive cases, including last year’s riots cases, there is now “no difference” between the investigating agency and prosecution. The government submitted before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh that in the criminal justice system, prosecutors are “officers of the court”, but there is “complete synergy” between SPPs and police at present. “There is no difference between the police and prosecution today. What is the fairness left in the entire criminal procedure?” questioned senior advocate Rahul Mehra who appeared for the AAP government. He maintained that the appointment of prosecutors lies in the domain of the government and the LG is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, also representing Delhi government, stated that while the matter was of great urgency, the LG and the Centre were yet to file their response. “The court gave four weeks for filing counters. Now, it is more than nine weeks and no counter is filed,” he argued. The bench then granted time to the respondents to file their response and listed the case for further hearing on January 28. It had earlier issued notice on the Delhi government’s plea and asked the LG and the Centre to respond, while refusing any interim stay. Delhi government has challenged the LG’s July 23 order appointing Delhi Police-chosen lawyers as SPPs to appear and conduct prosecution in cases relating to violence during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 this year and the northeast Delhi riots cases of February 2020. The petition has also challenged the July 26 notification on the appointment of the Delhi Police-chosen SPPs to conduct the cases and also the August 4 order of the Centre backing the LG’s view and approving the appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-fairness-left-after-appointment-of-spp-by-lg-in-riots-cases-govt/articleshow/87939111.cms||---

The court said that his conduct indicated that he allegedly intentionally tried to influence the judicial process. Special Judge Shailender Malik said it was a serious case and not a simple matter of trap and recovery of bribe money. “More particularly, the accused was a Delhi Police officer who did not appear before the court despite service of notice for influencing the bail order. He was also found to have a huge amount of around Rs 1,12,00,000 in his possession without any just explanation.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court to take steps to cut plastic waste||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday decided to take up the issue of curbing plastic waste menace and said public awareness should be created to do away with excessive usage of plastic. Putting a question about bringing in deterrence to resolve this growing problem, it said, “This is going to be an uphill task, but there is always hope.” The court has been hearing two litigations filed in 2018 seeking strict implementation of plastic waste management rules and complete ban on paper cups and dishes, in which multi-layered plastic material is used. Besides, the petitions seek prohibition on manufacturing and sale of plastic products that are not recyclable. The petitioners also asked to create public awareness to curb plastic waste problem. On this, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta said, “This is very important issue. We want people to realise the health hazard being created due to excessive usage of plastic. We want to take some steps to create public awareness to do away with the use of plastic.” The court further said, “We shall try to work out something so that the society gets some respite from the problem. We are sorry to state but people lack this awareness. Everywhere be it a city, town, village, seashore or public park, we get to see empty plastic bottles, bags etc. all around the place. This plastic over a period of time starts accumulating at different places. According to recent research, plastic takes millions of years to dissolve. It will lead to a serious ecology problem as the earth will suffer a lot of damage because of it.” The HC was alarmed at the reports placed by the civic chief of Bhavnagar and Rajkot saying that paper and plastic products block sewers and cannot be removed using machine, forcing manhole workers to fix the problem. Further hearing is on December10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-to-take-steps-to-cut-plastic-waste/articleshow/87938472.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Centre-Maharashtra relations plunge to all-time low||MUMBAI: As the MVA completes two years in office, the public take-down of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer Sameer Wankhede by skill development minister Nawab Malik is the latest chapter in the all-out war between the Centre and the state. With a BJP worker emerging as a witness in the cruise ship drug-bust case, Malik has accused the party of colluding with the NCB to defame the state and the government. Indeed, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has accused central agencies of working as “contract killers” of the central government, working to eliminate political opponents. On the other hand, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has said central agencies keep coming to Maharashtra to uproot massive corruption in the MVA government. The raids by central agencies have mainly impacted leaders of Shiv Sena and NCP. From the I-T raids on properties linked to deputy CM Ajit Pawar and rural development minister Hasan Mushrif of NCP, to the ED case against Sena MP Bhavna Gawli and MLA Pratap Sarnaik. Sarnaik had even written to CM Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to ally with BJP to save party leaders from “unnecessary harassment by central investigation agencies”. The ED has questioned Sena minister Anil Parab in a money laundering case and former Sena MP Anandrao Adsul in a bank fraud case. It has arrested former home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP for money laundering . The Centre versus state battle also played out in the high-profile Sushant Singh Rajput case with the probe finaly going to the CBI. “After Sena split with BJP and formed its own government, BJP has behaved like a government-in-waiting. But once it saw that the MVA’s internal clashes were not causing its collapse, BJP became much more aggressive in trying to take down the government,” says political analyst Abhay Deshpande. “In particular, it has targeted Sena and NCP who are perhaps potential allies,” he adds. “Relations were never this acrimonious when the Vajpayee-led NDA was at the helm in the Centre and the Congress-NCP government in the state,” Deshpande points out. The equation between Governor B S Koshyari and the MVA government also reflected the tension. A year after the government submitted a list of 12 nominees for MLC posts through the Governor’s quota, he has yet to clear them. His decision to hold review meetings with the collectorate during his visit to Marathwada was viewed by the MVA government as an attempt to create an alternative power centre. The MVA has retaliated whenever it could. For instance, it denied Koshyari the state airplane to fly to Uttarakhand. Central minister Narayan Rane was arrested for saying he would have slapped CM Thackeray. It is probing the Jalyukta Shivar scheme, a pet project of Fadnavis, and the Mumbai district central cooperative bank led by BJP leader Pravin Darekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-centre-state-relations-plunge-to-all-time-low/articleshow/87939785.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

A magistrate court issued a notice on August 8 to the accused, to be served through the IO, to appear before it. On September 16, the court noted that the notice issued to the accused was not reported back to it by the SHO of the Bhajanpura police station. It then said since the DCP (northeast) had failed to ensure the return of the processes to the court on time from the SHO concerned despite repeated directions, it was appropriate to direct the SHO and the DCP to remain present on the next date of hearing. On police plea, a sessions court exempted the DCP from personal appearance, but asked the IO and the SHO to be present in person with explanations in the magistrate court.

The petition complained about industrial pollution, about contamination of water in borewells and release of gas during the night. The HC intervened and pollution could be brought under control to some extent. The HC has expressed satisfaction about efforts undertaken by the industries and the government authorities in this regard. On Friday, the petitioner complained that solid waste from CETP is dumped on near the water body. The government opposed this, saying the water body was de-notified in 1980s for erection of treatment plant. The Green Environment Services Cooperative Society Ltd, which runs the CETP and fenton catalytic reactor and CETP, asserted that the disposal of solid waste takes place at designated sites only.The HC has ordered GPCB to submit a report by December 10.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Bichu Thirumala, who gave us timeless hits, passes away||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Veteran lyricist Bichu Thirumala who melded his poetic, lucid style to pen a string of melodious hits died at a private hospital here early on Friday morning. He was 79. He was admitted to the hospital four days ago. Known for his prolific creativity, Bichu Thirumala (B Sivasankaran Nair) had written songs at a frenetic pace at his peak -- working for as many as 35 films in a year. He would say in his later years that he was a contented man for he knew not a single day went by in the life of a Keralite without humming one of his songs. He had written songs for over 400 films. As a lyricist, he was a master at evoking gentle, tender emotions and his songs celebrating the bond between mother and child -- like 'Unni aarariro...', 'Olathumbathirunooyaladum...', 'Kannanararo...' and 'Kannodu kannoram nee kanimalaralle...' -- became timeless hits. Bichu had a bleak start to his career; the first two films for which he wrote songs never saw the light of the day. 'Akkaldama', directed by actor Madhu, was the first released film for which he wrote songs. His song `Neelakashavum Meghangalum...', composed by Syam, was widely applauded. He forged an association with Syam in the following years and the duo became a hit combo for mainstream Malayalam cinema. He had written most of his songs for Syam. Bichu was a director’s lyricist as he was adept at absorbing the need of a scene and situation and he would create songs that perfectly gelled with the script in very little time. He could straddle fast-paced songs and slow, poignant melodies with the same ease. Rarely did he take longer than usual and one such moment was when working with Fazil for the film 'Nokkathadoorathu kannum nattu'. Fazil wanted a song for a crucial moment in the film and Bichu and music director Jerry Amaldev just couldn’t find a way ahead. Later, Bichu casually recited lines from Changampuzha’s (poet Changampuzha Krishna Pillai) 'Bashpanjali' and an excited Fazil asked him if he could produce something like that; in a few minutes he was ready with 'Ayiram kannumayi...' and it became a massive hit. Bichu won the state film awards twice -- in 1981 for songs in films 'Thrishna' and 'Thenum Vayambum' and in 1991 for songs in 'Kadinjool Kalyanam'. He was born as the son of C G Bhaskaran Nair and Parukutty in Cherthala in 1942. He is survived by wife Prasannakumari and son Suman Shankar Bichu. The cremation was held with state honours at Santhikavadom at 4.30pm. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was among those who condoled the death. "He struck a chord with music lovers with his inimitable verbal repertoire and rhythmic language. He was the creator of numerous hit songs that echoed in Kerala in 80s and 90s," Vijayan said in his tribute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bichu-thirumala-who-gave-us-timeless-hits-passes-away/articleshow/87938477.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 26/11-like terror attack can happen yet again, says ex-DGP||MUMBAI: Former Maharashtra director general of police and senior security expert D Sivanandan on Friday said a 26/11-like terror attack may happen again as the nature of such attacks had changed. He was speaking at the inauguration of Brahma Research Foundation (BRF), a think tank focusing on public policy and strategic issues impacting India, nationally and internationally “In the 13 years since 26/11 Mumbai attacks, there have been attacks on Indian soil, like the ones in Uri and Pathankot. Mumbai Police, Navy and Coast Guards are better trained and equipped now to prevent and tackle terror attacks, but it can’t be said that another 26/11-like attack can’t happen. We have to prepare ourselves for cyber attacks as the nature of terror attacks has changed,” Sivanandan told the media after a presentation on implementation of Pradhan Committee report at BRF’s seminar. Sivanandan took over as city police chief after 26/11 and implemented steps Pradhan Committee had recommended to strengthen police. BJP legislator Ashish Shelar was among those who attended the discussion. Retired IPS officer and special secretary, cabinet secretariat, V Balachandran said the security establishment in US saw 26/11, the first urban terror attack which was controlled by handlers based in a foreign land (Pakistan’s Karachi) as a ‘dress rehearsal’ for attacks on mainland America. Applauding the brave officers and police personnel who fought terrorists valiantly, Balachandran said “our police did not run away” though fired upon by fidayeen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/26/11-like-terror-attack-can-happen-yet-again-ex-dgp/articleshow/87939791.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: MLA drives truck ‘to expose cops’, SP orders probe||NASHIK: Jalgaon superintendent of police Pravin Mundhe has ordered a probe after Chalisgaon BJP MLA Mangesh Chavan, posing as a truck driver on November 24, exposed policemen taking bribes from truck drivers to use the Kannad Ghat, which has been banned for heavy vehicles. The heavy downpour in Jalgaon and Aurangabad districts in August caused landslides at eight locations in the Kannad ghat area. The landslides disrupted traffic movement on the Dhule-Aurangabad-Solapur highway, which is a key route taken by goods vehicles from Rajasthan and Gujarat to reach Marathwada and Vidarbha regions as well as several other southern states. Only recently, movement of light vehicles was allowed on the stretch. After getting several complaints about alleged corruption by policemen, the MLA drove a truck posing as a truck driver. The policemen at the ghat took Rs 500 from him and one of the MLA’s associates made a video of the transaction on the cell phone and put it on the social media. Chavan told TOI, “There are boards up at the start of Kannad Ghat that owing to work of road repair, the road has been closed for heavy vehicles. However, truck drivers were being allowed to use the road by taking money.” He alleged that the policemen took Rs 100, Rs 500 and even Rs 1,000 from truck drivers. “I decided to do a sting operation. On the night of November 24, I drove a truck in the Kannad Ghat. When I was entering the ghat, I was asked for Rs 500 by policemen if I wanted to go ahead. I have the video of the same.” He added that he and his supporters had also taken the bytes of nearly 15 to 20 truck drivers, who all told them that they were allowed to use the road if they paid some money. Chavan said that he would be meeting senior officials of the police and the Anti Corruption Bureau to register complaints against the concerned policemen and would also demand that the policemen are suspended with immediate effect. DIG of Nashik Range, B G Shekhar Patil has instructed the Jalgaon SP to take strict action against all those involved. Shekhar Patil told TOI that he has informed Mundhe to probe the matter and suspend the policemen concerned involved in accepting money from truck drivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mla-drives-truck-to-expose-cops-in-kannad-ghat-sp-orders-probe/articleshow/87937105.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chandigarh||For railways & NHAI, stir cost Rs 3,600 crore and counting||Bathinda: Once the President gave his assent to the farm laws on September 27, 2020, the call by farm unions to block railway tracks and free toll plazas proved expensive for transport services in this part of the country, public ex-chequer, and companies operating toll plazas. Train services remained off the track for three weeks. Just when freight trains resumed on October 22, 2020, railways again suspended services in the state after farmers stopped an empty passenger train in Faridkot district and laid siege to a train at a corporate group's silo at Dagru village near Moga. Taking it further, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) disrupted rail tracks outside two independent power plants (IPPs) — Talwandi Sabo Power Limited in Mansa and Nabha Power Limited near Rajpura. Train services resumed only in the first week of November that year. By then, however, the Indian Railway claimed to have suffered huge a loss of Rs 2,400 crore in freight and passenger charges. Toll plazas, on the other hand, continue to suffer losses as they have not been allowed to collect toll since October 1, 2020. As per National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the disruption of toll plazas has caused a loss of over Rs 1,200 crore in 14 months. The social impact of the protest is being felt by people residing in the vicinity of houses of BJP leaders. Locals said farmers continuously used loud speakers and had blocked the streets, so students and elders suffered the most. Business person who had leased out petrol pumps to corporate houses too suffered losses and so did malls run by corporate firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/for-railways-nhai-stir-cost-rs-3600-crore-and-counting/articleshow/87928530.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Chandigarh||Rename Chd rly stn as Pkl-Chd Railway Station: Speaker||Barinderjit.Saluja Chandigarh: Since the Chandigarh railway station is catering to both residents of Chandigarh and Panchkula, it must be renamed as Panchkula-Chandigarh Railway Station, said Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker, Gian Chand Gupta. He also submitted a memorandum to the chairman, Passenger Services Committee (PSC) (Railway Board) of the ministry of railways, Ramesh Chandra Ratna here on Friday. The PSC team inspected Chandigarh and Mohali railway stations on Friday and announced Rs 10,000 award for maintenance of cleanliness. Apart from chairman, the PSC team comprised additional director, Railways Karan Singh, Passenger Services Committee member Gurvindra Sethi and Ramveer Bhatti. Gupta also pushed for provision of world class facilities at the Panchkula side of the railway station. At this, the chairman, Passenger Services Committee assured him that he would take up the matter on priority during the next meeting of the committee on November 29. During the meeting of the standing committee of railways, Gupta asserted that facilities being provided at Chandigarh railway station should also be provided in the Panchkula side for the benefit of passengers in Panchkula. He had raised the issue before then Union railway minister Piyush Goyal in 2020, after which a team of the ministry of railways visited the railway station. The Vidhan Sabha speaker said as about 400 acres of land was available with the railways on the Panchkula side, there was greater scope of expansion in this area. The speaker said he had also demanded a 24-hour ticket counter facility at the railway station towards Panchkula on the lines of Chandigarh. He said that a bus facility had been started to facilitate passengers of Panchkula to reach the railway station. At present, the morning and evening bus service has been started in line with the timing of the Shatabdi train, but in view of passenger demand, arrangement of more buses will be made. Start Shatabdi Express from Mohali The Mohali BJP unit has demanded extension of Shatabdi Express to Mohali. They also want the train to originate from and culminate in Mohali.

---||Kochi||Panel approves over 1k deaths as Covid fatalities in district||Kochi: Over 1,000 ‘missing’ deaths from the Covid fatality records of the government have finally found a place in the Covid records in Ernakulam. Covid-19 death ascertaining committee (CDAC) in Ernakulam, headed by additional district magistrate, has approved 1,100 deaths as Covid fatalities in the district. The death of these people were not earlier recorded in the Covid fatality category. The committee, constituted in each district following the directive of the national disaster management authority, has rejected only 25 appeals till November 26 in Ernakulam. The panel issues a document certifying that the death occurred due to Covid, based on the guideline issued by the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). For this, kin of the deceased should appeal before the CDAC. The certification is necessary for the kin to avail compensation for the death of his or her relative due to Covid. The government has recorded only 4,831 Covid deaths in Ernakulam till Thursday. With the certification of 1,100 more cases, the Covid fatality tally will come to 5,931. The first Covid death recorded in Kerala was in Kochi on March 28, 2020. The death of a West Kochi native was recorded as the first Covid fatality in the state. “The kin can appeal to the committee through the e-health portal. Medical officers in respective districts will examine it and forward it to the committee, which can approve or reject it. If the appeal is approved, they will be issued with the certificate, with which the kin can apply for compensation ,” said a committee official. Meanwhile, health officials said that the district was witnessing a declining trend in Covid cases. “Regarding the new variants reported in South Africa and two other countries, we need to strengthen screening and testing at airports. We don’t know how the mutated virus reacts,” said a health official in Ernakulam. Meanwhile, the opening of schools on November 1 has not resulted in many Covid cases being reported among students in Ernakulam. When a teacher is tested positive, only students in that specific bio-bubble are sent to quarantine. Decline in Covid cases in the society is also reflected in the attendance of students in schools too. Schools witness more than 90% attendance every day and those coming to attend offline classes are rising in the district. “A teacher in a school in Neriamangalam was sent to quarantine after being tested positive. No instance was raised in the district where a school had to be closed due to Covid. Rural areas witness 100% per cent attendance of students in schools. It is in the city limits that the attendance of students in lower primary classes has to pick up,” said Honey G Alexander, Ernakulam deputy director of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/panel-approves-over-1k-deaths-as-covid-fatalities-in-district/articleshow/87937742.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Chandigarh||When 2-day call turned into year-long saga||Bathinda: When the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a body comprising 200 farm organisations, gave a call for 2-day protest in Delhi on November 26-27, 2020, little did anyone anticipate that this call would pave the way in shaping up one of the biggest and largest struggle movements in modern India, creating farm protest a history. One year down the line, the sustained struggle against contentious farm legislations turned into a biggest headache for the BJP-led central government as the protest not only made its presence felt across the length and breadth of the nation, but its echo was heard in several foreign countries wherever Indians, especially Punjabis, are settled as immigrants. According to insiders, it was a routine call for showcasing anger against the central government after nothing much had come out of the two rounds of talks — the first being held on October 14, 2020 with the Union agriculture secretary where farmers had come out of meeting after finding no ministers, and the second with Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and commerce minister Piyush Goyal on November 13, 2020. The denial of permission by the governments and the way Haryana government dig out trenches, put boulders on highways to stop protesters from marching further and Delhi police stopping them from entering the national capital made all the difference. As the saying goes that when the oppression rises, the sections being oppressed either submit or further firm up their resolve to fight. The farmers chose the latter and decided to toe the line ‘Mannu saadi daatri asi manu de soe, jyon jyon sanu vadh’da asi doon savae hoye’ (Mannu is our sickle, we the fodder for him to mow, the more he cuts, the more we grow), describing the barbarity of Punjab’s Mughal governor Muin-Ul-Mulk also known as Mir Mannu from 1748 to 1753. “When the central government felt the going tough, the back channel diplomacy was put on a fast track. The services of premier central agencies were sought to sniff out at what point the farmer leaders can get ready to settle the issue. Those activities, however, failed to yield the desired results,” said reliable sources within the farmer groups. After failing to reach any middle path and the loss caused by happenings at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, the government started making up its mind to toe the line for which the farmers had been sitting at the borders of Delhi, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/when-2-day-call-turned-into-year-long-saga/articleshow/87928561.cms||Neel Kamal

The humancostoffarmersprotest.blogspot.com has compiled the data of protesters who died between November 24, 2020 and November 19, 2021. The blog is a collective effort, with major contribution by research scholar Anuroop Kaur Sandhu and activists Amar Mander, Harender Happy and Jai Singh Sandhu. “We have gathered the details from various sources, including stories in newspapers about the deaths of the farmers either at the protest sites, while returning from the protests or at their villages after having returned from the protests. We collect data and verify facts about the association of the deceased with the protest. It is ten added at to blog. We have taken extra care that only those farmers are included who had been associated with the protests in some either at Delhi borders or the protest sites in Punjab,” claims Sandhu, who is a comparative Indian literature in English research at the Delhi University. Sandhu comes from farmers’ family in Kaniawali village of Muktsar district. She said, “I started collecting data on December 9, 2020, and found the first casualty reported on November 24 when farmers had decided to head towards Delhi.” The farmers died for various reasons, including old age, cold, accidents and even suicide. The most common cause of deaths had been found to be cardiac arrest, says Happy, who is working for Kisan Ekta Morcha, the IT cell of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. While there has been no word from the central government, the Punjab government has announced to provide jobs to kin of the deceased farmers, apart from compensation of Rs 5 lakh. The state government is getting details of such farm activists and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi even handing over appointment letters to their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/671-protesters-lost-lives-claims-blog-keeping-count/articleshow/87928550.cms||Neel Kamal

The victim, posted at Park Street police station,was riding a scooterette on the Science City-bound flank of the flyover to return home at Gopalnagar in New Town when the incident happened. The woman fell off her two-wheeler on the flyover and suffered serious cut injuries on her chin. Adhikary was admitted to the Belle Vue Clinic, where her condition was stated to be stable, according to a joint commissioner of police. Cops said the area on the flyover, where the accident happened, does not have wire nets. However, cops have decided to flag this issue to the KMDA officials. “The woman had a narrow escape as she fell on the flyover. She was wearing a helmet. She got up and larted other cops with the help of other motorists,” said an officer at Lalbazar. This was the 17th accident involving kite thread (manja) this year. Three other cops had been injured earlier in the same way. However, this was the first time a woman cop was injured in a kite string accident. “The KMDA is putting up nets on the Park Circus-bound flank of the flyover in the second phase.

---||Delhi||A third of Delhi men have hypertension||NEW DELHI: Nearly one in every three men (32.8%) in Delhi suffers from hypertension or takes medicine to control blood pressure. This is 8.8% higher than the national average. The prevalence of hypertension among women in the capital is 24.1%, which is also higher, albeit by a lower margin of 2.8%. This was revealed in the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data released by the Union health ministry recently. Hypertension is a non-communicable disease, which left untreated can lead to heart disease and stroke. Public health experts said unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity and increased prevalence of obesity were the major factors for increased incidence of hypertension. These lifestyle issues were also linked to diabetes or raised blood sugar levels, another non-communicable disease, known to weaken the immune system in addition to predisposing a person to diseases of the heart, liver, kidney and other organs. The NFHS data showed that 12.2% women and 14.1% men living in Delhi had raised blood sugar levels for which they took medicines. At the national level, the prevalence of raised blood sugar-necessitating medication was 13.5% in women and 15.6% in men. Obesity is a common factor responsible for the early onset of both diabetes and hypertension. The data showed 41.3% women and 38% men, aged 15-49 years, were either overweight or obese in Delhi. Among children under five years, 4% were found to be overweight. World Health Organisation has called upon countries in South-East Asia Region, including India, to accelerate action to address insufficient physical activity that is as high as 74% among adolescents, to arrest and reverse the growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases and promote physical and mental well-being. “Physical activity helps prevent non-communicable diseases, such as stroke, diabetes and some cancers, which continue to be leading killer diseases in the region and a risk for severe disease and deaths in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region. Singh said this while addressing a virtual meeting of health officials and partners from member countries where the Regional Roadmap for implementation of Global Action Plan for Physical Activity was launched recently. The roadmap aims at achieving 10% reduction in insufficient physical activity by 2025 and 15% improvement in global levels by 2030. Experts also stressed on the need to encourage more people to undergo screening for cancer. In the NFHS survey, less than 1% said they had ever undergone a screening test for cervical cancer or a breast examination for breast cancer. Oral cavity examination for oral cancer found few takers among both women and men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-3rd-of-delhi-men-have-hypertension/articleshow/87939145.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Fiftyfive-year-old farmer Kummari Rajaiah of Adloor Yellareddy village in Sadashivnagar mandal died of a heart attack while waiting for his paddy to be procured. Rajaiah, who brought the paddy to the Sadashivnagar procurement centre 10 days ago, collapsed on a paddy heap in the evening. Locals and other farmers rushed him to Kamareddy government hospital where he was declared brought dead. Rajaiah is survived by wife, daughter and son. Beeraiah of Ailapur village in Lingampet mandal too met a similar fate on November 5. Anguished over the delay in procuring his paddy, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died at the Lingampet procurement centre. Farmers, who bring their produce to the procurement centres, stay back there in the night to keep an eye so that their stock is not stolen, officials said. Meanwhile, farmers staged protests to force the government to buy their paddy. In Indurthi village of Chigurumamidi mandal in Karimnagar district, farmers climbed atop a water tank and staged a protest. They said their produce was not purchased despite bringing the paddy to the IKP centre 15 days ago. Following the intervention of revenue officials, the farmers climbed down from the water tank. Farmers in Wanaparthy set fire to paddy to protest . Hundreds of farmers sat in protest at the collectorate office in Jagtial district on Friday. They demanded that stern action be taken against rice millers for exploiting them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/another-farmer-dies-in-tawaiting-paddy-purchase/articleshow/87938517.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The PCB manages the same. Hence, it is the PCB’s responsibility to remove the debris. We had written a letter to them earllier and will write to them again,” the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited’s (PMPML) traffic manager Dattatray Zende said. TimesViewTwo citizens were injured when a bus stop on Moledina Road had caved in three months ago. Ever since the incident, the PMPML, which operates the buses, and the PCB, which governs the area where the bus shelter was located, are passing the buck to each other over cleaning the debris. It is high time that the top brass of both the organizations stopped the ongoing blame game. They need to work hand-in-hand and must replace all old dilapidated bus shelters on priority.On the other hand, a PCB official said that several letters from them had gone to PMPML regarding the issue, they had now finalized on an agency to remove the debris. “The bus shelter is the PMPML’s property and the PCB only manages it. How can we remove something that is not our property? We will write them a fresh letter telling that we will remove the debris,” the official said. Commuters and businessmen with shops in the area said that the spot had become dirty. A regular PMPML commuter, in the area said, “How can both agencies just keep writing letters to each other for over three months to do such a simple task?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/debris-of-caved-in-bus-stop-not-removed-in-3-months/articleshow/87939140.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Centre takes umbrage at action on Bennichan Thomas||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In an unprecedented move, the Centre has taken exception to the state government’s decision to suspend IFS officer Bennichan Thomas without informing it, and has summoned the relevant documents that led to the suspension of the officer. In a communique from the ministry of environment, forests and climate change addressed to state chief secretary VP Joy on Wednesday, it has been said that despite being the cadre controlling authority, it is unaware of the suspension of the officer and came to know about it from media reports. “The ministry has come to know from media reports that Bennichan Thomas IFS has been placed under suspension. However, the ministry, being the cadre controlling authority, is not aware of the reasons for placing the officer under suspension. In this regard, it is requested that all the relevant documents for placing the officer under suspension may please be sent to this ministry at the earliest for taking further action in the matter,” said the communication from A K Mohanty, inspector general of forests. The matter comes close on the heels of the all-India services officers taking strong exception to the suspension of the officer. The IAS and the IPS associations had passed resolutions in favour of Thomas, and had asked the state government to revoke the suspension of the officer, who has been cited by all as an officer with unblemished track record. Going by the rules of the suspension of officers under the all-India services (1969 rules), a copy of the suspension order along with the reasons or grounds of suspension should be communicated to the cadre-controlling authority at the Centre within 48 hours of the suspension. A detailed report should follow within 15 days during which the suspension will be valid for 30 days. The extension of the suspension for further 30 days will require confirmation by the Centre. Also, the period of suspension of an officer under AIS, other than for corruption, can extend only up to one year, and any further extension will require the clearance from the Central review committee. The cadre-controlling authority of the IFS officers is the MoEF, while that of IAS and IPS officers are department of personnel and training (DoPT) and the ministry of home affairs, respectively. The detailed procedure to be followed for suspending an IAS officer as stipulated in the notification issued by the Centre on December 23, 2015, is seen to be violated in this case. The forest officer from the 1988 batch was placed under suspension on November 11 for issuing orders permitting Tamil Nadu to cut 15 trees from baby dam in Mullaperiyar. The government order issued to suspend the officer said, “The order concerns interstate matters and has been issued without any consultation at the ministerial level and was against the stand taken by the state government in the cases on Mullaperiyar dam issue under consideration of the Supreme Court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-takes-umbrage-at-action-on-bennichan/articleshow/87938542.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Chandigarh||Fight against farm laws saw many lows too||Bathinda: While the nation witnessed the emergence of farmers as a pressure group which forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to concede to their demand, the sustained struggle against the three farm laws had its shares of lows too. Even before the unified battle was to be undertaken against the mighty central government, two of the big farm groups — BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) having a large presence in Malwa region and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee which has a sizeable hold in Majha area — declined to be part of 32 farm groups. Only a few days into the struggle, the first feud surfaced when groups went against BKU (Lakhowal) for single-handedly approaching the Supreme Court against the farm laws on October 5, 2020. When BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) observed the International Human Rights Day on December 10, 2020 while waving pics of those facing charges under UAPA and Delhi riots cases, including Umar Khalid, Gautam Navlakha, the farmers were branded as Maoists and BKU (Ugrahan) had to single-handedly face the onslaught as other groups distanced from the event. The biggest low point during the farm struggle came on January 26 when many protesters reached the Red Fort and put up a farmers’ flag and Nishan Sahib on an empty flag post and a dome at the historical monument, prompting the authorities to dub farmers as Khalistanis. Farmers had to face the impact of this act for long and cases were registered and many had to stay in jails too. While on January 29, 2021, an attack was made at the camp of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee after January 26 violent happenings, other groups did not come forward to its rescue except for BKU (Ugrahan), which provided some support. The struggle had to face some anxious moments too when complaints of sexual harassment of West Bengal woman, killing of a man at Singhu border were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fight-against-farm-laws-saw-many-lows-too/articleshow/87928574.cms||Neel Kamal

Even if residents are segregating dry and wet waste, private garbage collectors mix the same while collecting it from the households. The garbage is reaching the secondary garbage collection points in a mixed form and it goes to main dump in a similar way. The civic officials, however, claimed that they are waiting for arrival of e-rickshaws and start of garbage processing. Since 2018, the civic officials had been trying to achieve the target of source segregation in the city. In June 2019, then MC commissioner K P Brar had to knock on the doors of residents and encourage them to go for source segregation. The ward number 81 was selected as a model ward where MC achieved 90% success. But Congress councillor Rashi Aggarwal said all efforts have now gone waste as people have gone back to usual way as garbage collectors have stopped the practice of collecting segregated waste. She said there is a need for regular checking and awareness. Sunita Gupta, a resident of Haibowal, said, “At the secondary garbage collection points, heaps of waste could be seen lying. The garbage collectors do not have such rehdis to keep dry and wet garbage separately.”MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said, “The e-rickshaws are about to arrive and we will give those to garbage collectors so that collection could be done quickly.” He said in the existing system, many things are not possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/few-takers-for-waste-segregation-in-absence-of-checks/articleshow/87937752.cms||---

During the state executive meeting on Friday, the saffron party’s Telangana in charge Tarun Chug told senior leaders to be more active and tour districts on a regular basis. The two-day executive meeting began at Mahaveer College in the Old City with 60 prominent figures attending, including state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Union minister G Kishan Reddy, Eatala Rajender and DK Aruna. Chug reportedly told them in a lengthy meeting that high command will begin directly monitoring the state unit in the coming days, and that each leader would be tasked with significant responsibilities. The party leaders were also asked to be ready for micro-level work at the mandals and the meeting took stock of the work. Chug interacted with all the district in charges to find out about their efforts to establish connect at the mandal and village levels. The party is also preparing resolutions on Dalit Bandhu plan, Dharani portal, job notifications and farmers’ difficulties. The primary political resolution to be adopted on Saturday will focus on the TRS government’s failings. The meeting praised all workers for their contributions to the party’s win in the recent Huzurabad bypoll. On Saturday, the leaders’ views on the next steps will be solicited.

The properties include vegetables markets, shops and other commercial establishments operated by the former gram panchayats in these villages. The PMC has got the administrative powers from the district administration though. The civic administration was eyeing the rent revenue from these properties to boost its coffers. “Once the PMC gets control of these buildings, it may use its rules and regulations for finalising the rents for these properties. As per PMC’s guidelines, the ready reckoner rates will be considered as the base rate for finalising the rent amount,” a PMC official said. Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official, told TOI that a demand to pay Rs 64 crore to the district administration for getting these properties has been made. “The civic and district administrations are completing the formalities.

Nirmalsinh Vaghela lodged a complaint of cheating alleging that he was swindled by an unidentified person who posed as a customs officer from Delhi. Vaghela stated that he received a friend request from on Dr Kalyana Bodhan in July. Bodhan identified himself as a doctor from the UK, saying he was working as a dental assistant in London. The two began chatting over social media and Bodhan sought details about Indian culture, which Vaghela provided. Bodhan said he going to visit India soon to purchase Indian artefacts, clothes and ornaments and asked the complaint if he would help. Later, Bodhan sent him a British Airways ticket and said he was coming to Delhi on August 4 and would return on August 30. At about 10.30am on August 4, he received a call from one Raghvendra who identified himself as a customs officer and told Vaghela that Bodhan had come to India with more money than permissible and had to pay taxes on the excess amount. Bodhan then made a video call to Vaghela and asked him to help and promised to repay the Rs 75,000 once he got his demand draft encashed. The ‘customs officer’ then gave him a bank account number, an IFSC code and a PAN number, saying it was of the customs department.

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘School timings can be extended’||General education department has suggested that the functioning of schools can be extended till evening. At present, classes are stopped by noon and online classes continue in the evening. At a high-level meeting convened by general education minister V Sivankutty on Friday, this suggestion was put forward since there were widespread complaints about the non-completion of portions and the difficulties faced while continuing classes online. The education department is of the view that online classes should be discontinued. It also found that around 90% of the children are coming to schools and Covid cases among school children have come down considerably after schools reopened. It has proposed that classes can be divided into two batches in each class and conducted thrice a week. The education minister had accepted the suggestion made by the department officials but made it clear at the meeting that the same has to be ratified by the chief minister too. The minister will submit the proposal to the chief minister and the same will be later discussed during Covid review meet. The approval of the health department is also required for extending school timings till evening. Plus One Seats: The meeting also decided to resolve the complaints that arose due to the lack of Plus One seats. It has been decided to sanction 50 more batches to tide over the problem. The department also found that there is a severe shortage of seats in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Palakkad when it came to Plus One. The principal secretary (education) and director of public instructions have given a report in this regard to the education minister. This report will be submitted to the chief minister for final clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/school-timings-can-be-extended/articleshow/87937759.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Year of struggle did the unthinkable: United farmers from across India||Bathinda: A year of struggle has come with its share of heartburn and sacrifices, but it has also done the unthinkable — united farmers across the nation, brought their issues to the centrestage and made the Centre bend for the first time in seven years. They are yet again turning into a big pressure group. While the opposition has been bulldozed in Parliament, the protest has gained the political heft which even political parties in the opposition could not achieve. The farmers have been able to make the Centre roll back the three farm laws, but they plan to sustain the struggle to get the government to concede to their demand of a legal guarantee on a minimum support price (MSP) for crops. This was also the first time in the over seven-year rule of PM Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre that the government acted cautiously against protesters and restrained itself from using force. Throughout the protest, say people involved in the agitation, farmers were told to inculcate in them that they could make even the mightiest bow. This was the spirit which put them on the offensive after BJP failed to win West Bengal elections, where farmers had directly taken on the saffron party on the political front. "Fighting against a mighty and formidable opponent was not easy. For it, we needed a lot of energy and stamina. It was the firm resolve and never-say-die spirit of farmers that they fought like warriors and made the powerful government bite the dust. But, it is not enough as our fight is still on for a complete victory," says farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) is the largest farm outfit of Punjab with thousands of farmers as its active members. "Going by the enormity of the fight, as the farm laws were to affect farmers in every part of the country, not only those from Punjab and Haryana, farmers and farm groups from many states also came forward, making it a pan-India agitation. This is the victory of each and every farmer of the country," says BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/year-of-struggle-did-the-unthinkable-united-farmers-from-across-india/articleshow/87928587.cms||Neel Kamal

The utterances made the difference and the government started the dialogue route by involving Jyani and another BJP leader Harjit Singh Grewal, but as the talks progressed, both Jyani and Grewal started going down in the eyes of the farmers when they started using harsh words for farmers while asking them not to stick to repeal demand, but move forward. Grewal had said the farm leaders had been residing in 5 star hotels in Delhi, leaving farmers in the trolleys in the biting cold. On January 10, 2021, the flash point reached when the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) took note of their utterances and called for social boycott of Jayani and Grewal, while asking farmers to oppose their entry into Punjab. It was said that these leaders crossed the limits by levelling false allegations against farmer leaders. A call was given, restraining farmers from taking land of Grewal on lease or face boycott too. Large rallies were held at villages of Grewal and Jyani by BKU (Ekta Ugrahan). Jayani and Grewal termed it a Talibani order issued by those frustrated. Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh though were not part of the group of ministers holding talks with farmers, they kept on playing a part from behind the scene. Rajnath Singh had talked to farm leaders on phone after BJP leader Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjit Grewal had met him. Amit Shah too had talked on phone with BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugraghan in the beginning of protest before he had a meeting with farmers on December 8, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/once-a-bridge-between-govt-and-farmers-2-bjp-leaders-lose-out-on-trust/articleshow/87928597.cms||Neel Kamal

After a discussion with members of BJP, SAD, Congress and Lok Insaaf Party, mayor Balkar Sandhu approved the fare revision. It will be taken up with the Ludhiana City Bus Services Limited (LCBSL) board of directors, who will take the final decision.The fare will be revised on Chandigarh pattern, wherein minimum charge will be Rs 10 and the maximum Rs 25. The move comes after the operator offered to surrender the buses to the municipal corporation, citing difficulty to run these on low fare.For almost two years, the bus service was not regular and operational on only two routes. After the lockdown due to Covid-19 in 2020, the service could not be made fully-operational. The fare revision has been pending for over four years. Now, it has been proposed that passengers will pay Rs 10 for the first five kilometres, Rs 20 for 5 to 10km and Rs 25 for more than 10km. Earlier, it was Rs 5 minimum. The MC officials said the minimum fare for travelling in auto-rickshaws is about Rs 20 and the maximum has no limit, so the bus service will benefit the commuters.Sandhu said, “If we have to continue the service for the public, then we will have to revise the fare as diesel prices are very high at present. The operator has agreed to take back the court cases he had filed against LCBSL. We will go ahead with the fare revision. The service will cover more routes.”Meanwhile, leader of opposition and Akali Dal councillor Jaspal Giaspura said, “The fare revision is fine, but the mayor should take action against those officials who did not take interest in running the buses for the public in the past four years.

The woman, who had been residing in Bengaluru, had returned to the state after developing stomach ache and fever on Nov 15. District medical officer Dr Ummer Farook said that there was no reason to panic as the woman did not have many contacts in the district; she was admitted to the hospital immediately on arrival. The samples of the patient were sent for testing on Nov 16 and her results from NIV, Pune, were received on Wednesday and the infection was confirmed. The patient, who was cured, is recuperating at home. “There is no need for concern as no other case has been reported. However, we conducted a survey in 652 houses in the locality and also a vector density study. Mosquito control efforts have been intensified in the area,” he said. District health authorities said that mosquitoes found in the locality were of Aedes albopictus variety and two rounds of fogging were carried out in the area. As the woman had visited Wayanad some time ago, authorities there have been asked to maintain a vigil. Though Zika virus doesn’t pose serious complications for most people, an infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly to the baby. Zika is a contagious disease spread by Aedes species of mosquito and symptoms include headache, body pain, joint pain, red eyes and rashes on the skin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/zika-infection-resurfaces/articleshow/87938601.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Over 420 employees working on one post for over 5 years in Chandigarh: RTI||CHANDIGARH: In an RTI reply, it has been revealed that the health department has over 420 employees working on one post in one place for more than five years. Some are working from 1989 onwards. Some have been working on one post for the entire service period. The RTI filed by city-based RTI activist R K Garg said, “Out of these 420 employees there are over 50 on deputation from Punjab, 35 on deputation from Haryana and 36 on deputation from Himachal and rest are from UT, as per the RTI replies.” TimesViewIn a government set-up, everyone needs to be shuffled once the set tenure is over. If the same people stay put in positions perceived to be important, the others won't get a chance to serve on these posts. Being on the same post at the same place for years together also leads to monotony and impacts work.He said, “There must be an audit system to see who has been in a single post in the department and for how long.” There is no specific transfer policy of the health department. The RTI information stated that there are over 420 employees of the department, including doctors, senior medical officer, medical officer, nursing staff, dental staff, ministerial staff and class IV students, who have been working on one post in one place for more than five years. There are 133 doctors who are gazetted employees, who are getting non-practising allowance. “I am yet to check but the possibility cannot be ruled out. We will see and discuss what can be done in this regard,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. The oldest employees in Chandigarh since 1991 are 49 nursing staff, while medical officers since 2004 are seven. Also, from UT, the highest is the number of Class 4 employees who are 106 since 1984 while there are 31 medical officers since 2003 from Punjab. “These are sensitive posts and as per the CVC guidelines, there has to be rotation after every three years. Majority of the employees in the UT health department are not abiding by this. Whoever gets posted here uses their influence and stays on for years,” said a senior official in UT administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-420-employees-working-on-one-post-for-over-5-yrs-rti/articleshow/87938554.cms||Shimona Kanwar

As soon as fireman Dharamjot threw water on the blaze, it spread and burnt his cheeks. He was rushed to a hospital. Fire officials said a factory worker had also received minor burns on an arm.The incident once again rakes up the issue of equipping all firefighters with fire safety suits and helmets.A fire official said, “The boiler has capacity of 3,500 litres of oil. Unless that oil stopped, fire could not be brought under control. Fire-suits can save firefighters from such incidents. But we have limited suits. One station has been given three suits, so it is not possible to give these to everyone. Such suits are required in bulk so that every on-duty fireman can wear these.”Leading fireman Rajan Singh said, “The fire was only in one section of the factory, in its boiler. Sparking in motor wires triggered the blaze, which was soon caught by oil. We first tried to douse it with water, but it spread and so we used foam. Three fire tenders were stationed at the spot. Five to six tenders were put into service. Rice husk, which was stocked near the boiler, had soaked the oil.”The flames were brought under control around 7.30pm.Assistant divisional fire officer Swaran Chand could not be contacted for comments on fire-suits. In another incident, a 425-kg LPG gas cylinder leakage was reported at a factory in Focal Point, Phase 6, on Friday.

Mehta was speaking through video-conference on the occasion of Amul’s centennial year celebrations on Friday. The 100th year of Amul is celebrated as National Milk Day. Fondly remembering Kurian, Mehta said, “Meaning of Verghese in Greek is ‘Kisan.’ Kurian went on to dedicate his life for ‘kisans’ and improved their lives and earnings by setting up Amul. He envisioned Amul as an umbrella which would protect farmers. Their interest and his vision led Amul to 50 countries across the globe. Till date, 80% of the share in Amul goes to farmers.” A seminar was also held on the theme, “Legacy of Dr Verghese Kurien” at Chandigarh Club, Chandigarh. Dr Verghese Kurien (November 26, 1921 – September 9, 2012), is known as the “Father of the White Revolution.” He was a social entrepreneur whose “billion-liter idea,” Operation Flood, made dairy farming India's largest self-sustaining industry as well as the largest rural employment sector, accounting for a third of all rural income. It made India the world's largest milk producer, doubled the milk available for each person and increased milk output four-fold in 30 years. He pioneered the Anand model of dairy cooperatives and replicated it nationwide, based on various “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches, where no milk from a farmer was refused and 80% of the price paid by consumers went to farmers. Dairy farmers controlled marketing, procurement and processing of milk and milk products as dairy owners. It was Amul that launched the production of milk powder from buffalo milk instead of cow milk, which was in short supply in the country. Besides, Dr Kurien was instrumental in setting up a number of institutes of repute, including Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA), National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI). He was also the founder chairman of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited (GCMMF). He created the brand Amul, which became a household name in India. The ceremony was also addressed by Dr R S Sodhi (managing director), GCMMF, who told the audience how Dr Kurien made brand Amul a national and international success. He described cooperatives as the best option for the prosperity of farmers not only in dairy but in other agri-based ventures. Sanjay Setia, chief general manager, Vita, spoke about the importance of dairying in doubling farmers’ income, particularly in Haryana. Vice-chancellor of a private university Dr Madhu Chitkara, Dr G S Rajorhia, president, Indian Dairy Association and Biraj Patnaik, executive director, NFI, described Dr Kurien as an exceptional leader. Other speakers discussed various aspects of agri ventures. Dr Ashok Kumar, dean, college of agricultural engineering, PAU, Ludhiana delved into various post-harvest technologies which could make farming more profitable and sustainable. Rainoo Dhar, GM, Verka outlined the role of cooperatives in upliftment of the rural population and women. Dr S K Tomar, principal scientist (retd), National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal spoke about importance of balanced feed for livestock while Chandigarh Club president Sandeep Sahni described Dr Kurien as a role model for the youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/milkman-of-india-remembered-on-amuls-centennial-year-celebrations/articleshow/87938573.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Fifteen people have been booked for the attack and murder. The dead man was identified as Brijendra Kumar. His brother, Jaspal, who survived the attack, claimed the family was under pressure to “compromise” in a case of murder of Brijendra’s elder son. He alleged the family was attacked while they were returning home to Sisona village from a wedding at Kubri village in their SUV. Suddenly, their SUV was intercepted by two vehicles, who forced it to stop. Then, a group of men, all armed with sticks and sharp objects, got off the other two vehicles and attacked them, he claimed. Brijendra, his sons Sachin and Abhishek and Jaspal were left to die bleeding on the road. Police rescued them and took them to a community health centre, where Brijendra was declared dead. Brijendra’s eldest son was murdered four months ago and a named accused is lodged in jail for the murder, Jaspal told police. Since then, his “brother's killers” were putting pressure on him to compromise. However, Brijendra refused to budge. Alok Jaiswal, additional SP, said preliminary investigations revealed that both the parties belong to Sisona village and have an old enmity. They had an argument at the wedding venue at Kubri village, and even exchanged a few blows. The locals managed to control the situation and sent both parties home. However, one group returned with more men and attacked Brijendra’s family. “We have registered an FIR for murder and rioting and deployed five teams to arrest the accused,” added Jaiswal. Jaspal, who has registered an FIR, naming some of the alleged assailants, said, “We are afraid that the accused may target other members of my family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-killed-kin-hurt-for-refusing-to-compromise-on-sons-murder-case/articleshow/87937829.cms||---

The officer was transferred from Aluva East police station to police headquarters on Wednesday but the opposition parties -- led by the Congress -- were continuing their protest. The Congress called off its sit-in protest in front of Aluva East police station following the suspension. Mofiya (21), who took her life on Monday night, had filed a police complaint earlier against domestic violence and dowry-related harassment. Her family alleged that the inspector verbally abused Mofiya and her father Dilshad K Salim when they went to the police station for a discussion. An FIR was also not registered on her complaint. The suspension order, issued by state police chief Anil Kant, said the DIG (Ernakulam range) had submitted a "special report" against Sudheer and it prima facie revealed "certain lapses in the disposal of the petition submitted by Mofiya Parveen against her husband". Kant also ordered an oral inquiry against Sudheer and authorized Francis Shelbi, ACP (Traffic East), Kochi City to conduct the probe. The suspension was made public hours after minister P Rajeeve visited Mofiya's parents. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan interacted with Mofiya's father Dilshad over phone when Rajeeve was at their home. Dilshad said besides promising action against the culprits, the chief minister has given his phone number to contact if they found any problem with the ongoing probe. The district crime branch team, probing the case, on Friday collected detailed statements from Mofiya's family members. It will be seeking the custody of Mofiya's husband Muhammed Suhail (27) and in-laws Rukhya (55) and Yousuf (63) soon. Mofiya and Suhail, who got acquainted on Facebook, had married in April this year. An initial investigation has revealed that the woman underwent physical and mental torture at Suhail's house. Her father has also alleged that Suhail sought Rs 40 lakh from him to produce a film.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/inspector-named-in-mofiyas-suicide-note-suspended/articleshow/87938719.cms||---

---||Kochi||Women script success in waste management||TRIPUNITHURA: At a time when many local bodies are finding it difficult to deal with tonnes of daily domestic waste, a Kudumbashree unit has been successfully running a waste management unit here, and recycling both food and plastic waste for the past two years. “With the repeated request from a section of residents of ward number 41 in Tripunithura municipality, ward councillor Jaya Parameswaran had put forward this idea of a waste management unit,” says Ramani, who is part of the three-member unit headed by Ramlath. With technical assistance of the health department of the municipality, the unit started functioning on February 11, 2019. “Fortunately, we could find a puramboke land of the municipality for installing the waste processing unit. In the beginning, the waste collection process was segregated as food waste and plastic waste. We charge Rs 100 from each house in the ward for food waste collection and Rs 50 per month for plastic waste,” she said. Rathi, another member of the unit said, that as the municipality has started collecting plastic waste directly, they have started focusing on managing food waste. “Four brick chambers are used for converting food waste into compost. Food waste collected from houses is kept in a separate cabin, which covers a layer of chemical stimulant to convert it into compost. We got a short-term training in Palakkad for processing compost from food and other biodegradable waste,” Rathi said. Later, they started to do the same process by replacing chemical stimulants with leaves. After crushing these layers for two or three days, it would be transferred to the second cabin. At first, residents had feared of foul smell from the unit. “However, they were later convinced that no foul smell or worms would come out from the unit,’’ Rathi said. Moreover, the three women are very keen to keep the unit clean. Of the total five hundred families in this ward, around 180 families are giving food waste to this unit. “Residents from other wards are asking us to collect waste from their compound too. But as per the present system, we are bound to work only in ward number 41,” said Ramani. The three women were honoured during the last Gandhi Jayanthi day for their efforts. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/women-script-success-in-waste-mgmt/articleshow/87937787.cms||Sivadas Varma

I-T raids are being conducted at 12 locations, including Ludhiana, Delhi, Gurgaon, Shimla and Kota in Rajasthan. Out of the raided premises, three are residential, including Singh’s Ludhiana home, while others are commercial buildings. I-T officials are tight-lipped over the entire operation and despite repeated attempts, senior officers did not respond to requests for more information.According to highly-placed sources, ED raids ended on Thursday night and teams had left all the premises of Singh, but on Friday around 11:45am, more than 100 I-T officials and police personnel simultaneously raided the 12 premises. Though several people in the city were linking these raids with ED’s action, sources claimed Singh was on the income tax investigation wing’s radar on the suspicion of suppressing his income and for some other violations. The I-T department can, however, seek information unofficially from ED on agency’s preliminary findings or other angles. Singh is often targeted by the Opposition allegedly for being a close ally of the Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. Along with transport, he also has a huge business of cable TV, broadband, media and real estate among other ventures. One of the offices of the income tax department is located in a mall owned by one of Singh’s groups. However, people close to him have denied any tax evasion or default by him and said all his businesses were legitimate and all rules were followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/i-t-raids-on-fastway-jujhar-groups-after-ed-ends-action/articleshow/87937799.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Nagpur||BJP, pro-Vid activists flay govt over shifting winter session to Mumbai||Nagpur: The pro-Vidarbha activists and BJP leaders have flayed the Maharashtra cabinet’s decision to shift the winter assembly session from Nagpur to Mumbai, for the second year in a row. On other hand, the Congress leaders are also upset, but are now demanding the budget or monsoon session to be held in Vidarbha to compensate for the loss. Last year, it was held in the state capital due to the threat of Covid-19 pandemic. The decision was taken during Thursday’s cabinet meeting, primarily on account of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s health, as it would take about a couple of months for him to fully recuperate. The December 10 MLC elections for six seats was another reason provided along with the code of conduct in place. “We have demanded to conduct a monsoon session here, which should be at least three weeks long. The questions and issues pertaining to Vidarbha region should be accorded top priority during the monsoon session,” guardian minister Nitin Raut said. Slamming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), MLA Krushna Khopde said the Thackeray government was apprehensive of conducting a session in Vidarbha anticipating that they would be cornered over local issues. “As per the Nagpur pact, it is mandatory to hold the session here, but the government is running away from their responsibilities. Even the Vidarbha ministers — Sunil Kedar, Vijay Wadettiwar and Raut had not uttered a single word during the cabinet meeting,” he said. Congress state president Nana Patole said their party would demand to convene a month-long budget session in Vidarbha. “If the winter session could not be conducted on account of the CM’s health, at least a budget session should be held here, for discussions on region specific issues.” Maha Vidarbha Janjagaran convenor Nitin Ronghe said the winter session was kept here as per the Nagpur Pact, but all the successive governments had never taken its conditions seriously. “I personally feel that deliberate attempts are being made by the governments to cancel this assembly session year after year and would be discontinued permanently in near future.” Some Congress legislators like MLC Abhijit Wanjari were also upset over the cancellation of session. He had also sent a letter in the past to CM for conducting a month-long session in the region. “I am strongly in favour of having a session here where new legislators like us get a golden opportunity to raise issues pertaining to our constituencies. The Nagpur Pact has led to a tradition to convene a session here for the last six decades. I think at least a budget or monsoon session should be held here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-pro-vid-activists-flay-govt-over-shifting-winter-session-to-mumbai/articleshow/87937816.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

While Bharat Biotech has developed Covaxin, Bio E has developed Corbevax that is currently undergoing Phase-3 trials. He pointed out the country is on track to achieve its exports target of $400 billion of merchandise goods this fiscal year and the pharma sector is expected to be a major contributor. Meanwhile, he said the bank is targeting financing of $7 billion of project exports over the next five years through the funds received from the central government in the National Export Insurance Account (NEIA). “The opportunity for Indian exporters remains significant given the fact that the project exporters have already developed substantial competitiveness in several sectors and the financing options provided by Exim Bank are well recognised,” he said.

---||Lucknow||At IFFI, celebrities hail Uttar Pradesh as film shooting hub||LUCKNOW: Giving a boost to efforts for setting up of Film City in the state, famous Bollywood personalities like Karan Johar, Akshay Kumar, Boney Kapoor and Ravi Kishan have hailed Uttar Pradesh as a favourable destination for film shooting in the country. The recognition for the state came during the 52nd International Film Festival of India underway in Goa. Production houses making films in Tamil, Telugu and other regional languages are also opting for UP. During the opening ceremony of IFFI, filmmaker and director Karan Johar said, “Be it Lucknow, Varanasi or Kanpur, shooting in Uttar Pradesh automatically leads you to stories.” Film producer Boney Kapoor said, “I would like to see all my films shot in the Hindi heartland because there is no other place which has so much variety.” Member of parliament and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said, “Apart from Hindi and Bhojpuri, UP is also witnessing shooting of films in Tamil, Telugu and other regional languages of the country.” Actor Akshay Kumar, whose ‘Jolly LLB 2’ was shot in the state, said, “It’s always a pleasure working in Uttar Pradesh.” Deputy director, UP Film Bandhu, Dinesh Sehgal said: “Considering the immense scope of film shooting in UP, the Yogi Adityanath government’s film development policy focuses on two aspects – that shooting will promote cultural, mythological, historical heritage and glorious traditions within the country and abroad, and that it will generate employment for the youth.” “Under the new film policy, artists and producers from UP and other states are being provided a comfortable environment. UP was awarded the ‘Most Film Friendly State’ at the 64th National Film Awards,” he added. Film producer Kumar Mangat Pathak said, “The state has created an efficient online system to get approval for shooting.” According to the government, a single window clearance system portal (filmbandhuup.gov.in/en) has been created for online permission for shooting and for availing film subsidy. “Earlier, there was provision to give grants only to Hindi and regional languages (Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bundeli). The current government has made the provision for grants to films in Hindi, English and country’s other regional languages as well,” an official said. If five lead actors of a film are from UP, an additional subsidy (maximum amount) of Rs 25 lakh is paid. Similarly, if all artists are from UP, the maximum subsidy will be Rs 50 lakh. Films in UP’s other languages can get 50% of the total cost in subsidy while films in Hindi/English and other regional languages can get maximum 25% of the cost. If at least half the film is shot in UP, it is eligible for maximum subsidy of Rs 1 crore. Similarly, the amount is Rs 2 crore if two-third of total shooting of five films has been done in the state. Once a filmmaker has availed the subsidy amount under the film policy, there is a provision of subsidy payment for subsequent films too. Films produced in the state by national/international award winning producers/directors, which have already been subsidized once, are also entitled for subsidy under the Film Policy. Officials claimed at least 400 applications for subsidy have been received since 2017. Scripts of about 230 films have been approved and 38 films have been given about Rs 21 crore as subsidy. Films like ‘Jolly LLB’, ‘Mom’, ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’, ‘Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana’, ‘Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety’, and ‘Nil Batey Sannata’, have got subsidies. Currently, 46 films are in the final stage of receiving subsidies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/at-iffi-celebrities-hail-up-as-film-shooting-hub/articleshow/87939186.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Be patient with kids after school reopening: Doctors||NAGPUR: With schools set to reopen for Class 1 to 7 from December 1, doctors have advised that parents and teachers need to be patient with the kids during this transition where they would be coming out of their comfort zones after a gap of nearly two years. Experts said some kids may show underlying anxiety, panic or depression disorders from the sudden change is their routine but with proper monitoring and counselling these issues can be resolved. They also said that kids may also show lethargy and tiredness for which some time needs to be given to them. Doctors have also observed that a large number of kids are likely to be happy to be back in school. Dr Pritam Chandak, child and adolescent psychiatrist, said schools are not just a place of academic learning but also emotional, cognitive and social development centre. “We had to restart some day. Covid is not going anywhere so we have to modify our selves. There should be no reluctance to send kids to schools. Like we were patient with kids while switching to online schooling, now is the time to give them time to return to normalcy. Parents and teachers need to be patient with them. For so long, they didn’t have a structured routine so they may not adjust to the previous discipline all of a sudden. It took time for adults as well,” he said. Dr Chandak added, “Kids are in the comfort zone. They have this in mind that they have to stay at home, play all the time and do not study. Kids may show anxiety and stress with the sudden resumption of school. If these are at mild level, having a conversation between parents and school teachers can help. If a child’s functionality is getting affected then it needs help of a child psychiatrist or psychologist.” Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said parents, teachers and kids are all going through anxiety. “Some teachers and parents still want to push the reopening further as the news of a new strain is worrying them. Kids need to be told that this arrangement of online learning is not lifelong. Now, with the government allowing it, it is an opportunity to go back to regular schooling. Benefits must be explained to them about interaction with friends and participation in extracurricular activities can motivate them.” Dr Virani added that parents take out their frustration on kids when they do not meet expectations. “But they need to remember it is not just their kids but all are going through the same situation. If the school is reopening don’t expect the kid to be back on track from day one and follow the timetable with punctuality. Give them time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/be-patient-with-kids-after-school-reopening-doctors/articleshow/87937833.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Processes that need to be carried out to receive the certification would take one month. As the institutions have opened hostels and canteens after a long gap due to Covid-19, we have sped up the process,” an FSSAI official said.The applicants have undergone training in food safety and good practices. “During the pre-audit phase, we will check if all the 80 pointers in the checklist are met,” the official said.Once enrolled under the initiative, the campuses would undergo self-assessment on four parameters such as safe food, healthy food, sustainable food and building awareness. “Shortcoming will be pointed out. After improvements are made, the campuses would undergo a third-party audit by an FSSAI-empaneled agency and will be given a rating on a five-star scale. If a campus scores three or more stars, it would be certified as an Eat Right Campus. The certification is valid for two years,” said K Tamilselvan, designated officer of FSSAI,The process also includes steps to create an environment of safe, healthy and sustainable eating habits such as promoting local and seasonal food, limiting unhealthy food choices and mass awareness activities. As parents are cautious about the safety and quality of food available on campus, the certificate will play a crucial role in choosing the institution in the near future, Tamilselvan added.The campuses will also be brought under FSSAI’s repurposed used cooking oil initiative to collect used cooking oil and to convert it into biodiesel to prevent repeated use. They will also adhere to the No Food Waste initiative. Unused food will be sent to people in need of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/colleges-get-ready-to-improve-food-quality-students-to-eat-right/articleshow/87938640.cms||V Devanathan

Even now, authorities are harassing me in the name of inquiry. However, we will not be cowed down by such threats.”The DMK government cancelled several road projects meant for Coimbatore, Velumani said. “I expected chief minister M K Stalin to announce construction of roads across the city during his recent visit.

The ED team was also spotted at the Agriculture Market Produce Committee, which is currently headed by Khotkar, who is a two-time minister. When contacted, Khotkar confirmed the raid by ED and said that it was still underway. “It is nothing but political vendetta on the behest of BJP. I’ll speak in detail once the ED is done with its raid.” The raids have been carried out within eight days of BJP’s former MP Kirit Somaiya making allegations against Khotkar for allegedly taking over Jalna Cooperative Sugar mill, better known as Ramnagar Sugar Mill in Jalna. Somaiya’s statement was preceded by ED on November 11 carrying out raids at several premises of a builder and and industrialist in connection to the purchase of Ramnagar sugar factory, in a money laundering case connected with Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) fraud. During these raids, cash to the tune of Rs one crore and some documents were allegedly seized. An ED official said that they are investigating transactions related to several sugar mills that had defaulted loans obtained from MSCB and subsequently auctioned these mills to the office-bearers of the banks or their relatives. Somaiya had alleged that after the sugar mill came into existence in 1986-87, a total of 9,000 shares worth Rs 20,00 each were given to the farmers. The outstanding loan of MSCB bank in 2007 was Rs 11.42 crore. MSCB was forced to auction the mill and in 2012 bids were invited. He alleged that despite the ready reckoner rate of the mill’s land being Rs 70 crore, it was “undervalued” and the mill and land was given a reserve price of Rs 42 crore. It was then purchased by the industrialists. The entries made on the revenue record have been challenged and currently, the matter is being heard before Jalna additional collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ed-raids-former-sena-ministers-properties/articleshow/87937191.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The entire incident was shot by a local journalist and a revenue officer even tried to take away his mobile phone. Later, the farmer was locked inside the tehsil jail and an FIR was registered against him under various sections of the IPC. A purported video of the incident is being widely shared on social media. Hari Shankar, 36, a resident of Majhola area, had taken a bank loan of Rs 19 lakh against his agricultural land and house, which touched Rs 25 lakh due to the Covid-induced lockdown and unseasonal rains. After a recovery certificate was issued from the revenue department, on Thursday, members of a revenue team caught Hari Shankar and locked him up in the tehsil office. Later, his brother Hari Om, 34, arrived at the tehsil office with a document showing that he had paid Rs 5.50 lakh as a part of settlement but his brother was detained because he didn’t pay bribe to the revenue team. While he was shouting in public and showing his documents, a few officials caught him, took him inside and thrashed him. Tehsildar NItin Tewatia said, “No farmer was beaten in the tehsil office. A man was arrested by the revenue team over pending loan dues of Rs 25 lakh. His brother came to the tehsil office and misbehaved with officials and even tore the documents. I am not sure if he was beaten by any staff. He has been handed over to the police and booked for damaging government documents and misbehaving with a public servant.” When DM, Shailendra Kumar Singh, came to know about the incident and the viral video was brought into his notice, he directed the additional DM, finance, to probe the matter and submit a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-farmer-roughed-up-over-loan-repayment-video-goes-viral/articleshow/87937864.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||For BJP, all eyes now on Vemulawada||Hyderabad: After defeating the ruling TRS in Dubbak and Huzurabad, the BJP has set its eyes on the Vemulawada assembly constituency anticipating a bypoll. TRS sitting MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh is facing charges of being a German citizen and a case is pending in the high court about his citizenship issue. The talk in political circles is that most likely there would be a bypoll if the court judgment does not come in favour of Ramesh. While Tula Uma of BJP is getting ready for a contest in Vemulawada, political observers said the Congress too has a strong candidate in Adi Srinivas. With the constituency being a sitting seat of the ruling TRS, this segment has all the ingredients to throw up an interesting triangular contest in case of a bypoll. Tula Uma is from former minister Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender’s camp. She was among some of the top leaders from the undivided Karimnagar district to quit the TRS and join BJP in June along with Eatala. Speaking to TOI, Tula Uma said though the BJP leadership has not announced her name, she has already started meeting people. “I am seriously working to contest from Vemulawada. This is my mother’s place. Even when I was in TRS, I had asked for a ticket to contest from here,” Uma said. Political observers said this has been the strategy of the saffron party even in the byelections held to Dubbak and other constituencies. The BJP candidates had started their campaign much before any other candidate. The BJP would then announce the candidate’s name. Congress’s Adi Srinivas, who came second with 55,864 votes in the 2018 assembly polls as against 84,050 votes by winner Chennamaneni Ramesh of TRS, said the MLA has gained dubious name of being a “guest MLA” as he keeps shuttling between Germany and Vemulawada. Ramesh’s camp is confident that the court judgment in the Indian citizenship row would come his favour. Also, Vemulawada is a TRS stronghold in Rajanna Sircilla district under Karimnagar parliamentary constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-bjp-all-eyes-now-on-vemulawada/articleshow/87938654.cms||Roushan Ali

She is the wife of CPM leader KK Ragesh, who is the chief minister’s private secretary. In its letter to the VC, the committee members (including RS Sasi Kumar and M Shajar Khan) said that is interesting to note that the vice-chancellor has sought legal opinion in the matter to decide whether the time spent for FDP can be considered as teaching experience which is actually a matter that has been so clearly described in the UGC regulation. “We are afraid that the decision to get a legal opinion, plausibly from the standing counsel, is an effort to arrange one that suits the malicious intention to facilitate the appointment of Varghese as associate professor. We see that such legal opinions can be coerced, from our recent experience,” the letter said. It further said that if one really needs a legal opinion in the matter, it must have been sought from UGC, which framed the regulation, to decide whether Varghese is indeed eligible for appointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/seek-legal-opinion-from-ugc-panel/articleshow/87938662.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The suspects took advantage of the communication gap between the law enforcement agencies. Senior police officers said despite the cancellation of the doda lincence, neither the district administration nor the state excise department had alerted other law enforcement agencies, including the police, about the cancellation. As per documents obtained from the Nanded district administration, based on the letter issued by the state excise commissioner in February, district collector Vipin Kumar Itankar had permanently cancelled nine licenses belonging to the poppy-II category on March 8. A senior excise official said that poppy-II category licences are meant for commercial sale of doda, which is known as ‘poor man’s heroin’. It is produced by grinding and crushing dried poppy pods and straws. This crushed powder is then added to beverages to give a high. When contacted, LCB inspector Dwarkadas Chikhalikar confirmed that the police did not receive any letter regarding the cancellation of these licenses. A team of Narcotics Control Bureau, Mumbai, on Monday busted a drugs manufacturing unit located at Kamtha in Nanded and seized over 111 kg of poppy straws and 1.4 kg of high-quality opium, having a valuation of over Rs 2 crore. The NCB arrested three accused including the ones who earlier owned the poppy-II category licences. This was the second major action by the NCB in Nanded. Earlier, on November 15, the NCB team intercepted a 12-tyre truck coming from Andhra Pradesh to Manjram in Naigaon and seized 1,127 kg of marijuana worth several crores. These NCB actions did not go well with the state police authorities, who then carried an internal probe to find lacunas on the part of Nanded district police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-in-dark-on-poppy-ii-type-licence-cancellation/articleshow/87937210.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Coimbatore||Garment exporters observe fast against yarn price rise||Tirupur: Garment manufacturers here held a day-long hunger strike on Friday to protest against the sharp increase in yarn prices.According to industry insiders, over 80% of the manufacturers downed shutters, affecting business worth over Rs 300 crore.The unprecedented yarn price rise triggered by high cotton prices has been taking a toll on small manufacturers, said a representative of the over 117 textile bodies that took part in the hunger strike. While there is enough cotton to meet the demand, unchecked hoarding by agents has led to price escalation, said Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (Teama) president M P Muthurathinam. “This further resulted in spinning mills increasing yarn prices. The artificial price rise has been adversely impacting the garment industry of Tirupur, which has an annual turnover of Rs 27,000 crore. As much as 90% of the manufacturing units here are micro and small-scale enterprises. The dynamic cost of raw material has been affecting export orders because of the competitive cost offered by countries like China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Even worse, the country is on the verge of importing garments from Bangladesh,” he said.The protestors sought immediate ban or regulation on export of raw cotton and yarn. They urged the Cotton Corporation of India Limited to offer raw cotton to textile industries, instead of agents.Textile industries in the state require 110 lakh bales annually. “By forming a separate body like CCI in Tamil Nadu, the state government can streamline availability of cotton by procuring it from farmers. The government should also set up a welfare board for the 12 lakh employees in the sector,” the representative added.Muthurathinam requested chief minister M K Stalin to urge Lok Sabha members to stage a protest in New Delhi to press garment manufacturers’ demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garment-exporters-observe-fast-against-yarn-price-rise/articleshow/87938646.cms||---

They have invited tenders to set up the enclosure and other basic facilities near Manambolly forest range at a cost of Rs 75 lakh.S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forests and ATR field director, said they had identified a location in Manthirimattam reserve forest, which is 8km away from Manambolly rest house, to set up the enclosure. “Since the pathway to reach Manthirimattam is covered with shrubs and bushes, we have started clearing them.” He said they had sent a proposal to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to fund the project. “We expect the fund to be sanctioned soon. If everything goes well, we will complete the work by mid-December. Presently, two caretakers are appointed to closely monitor and feed the tiger cub.”Ramasubramanian said the rewilding of the tiger cub was likely to start from December. “The cub will be kept inside the enclosure for at least two years and its hunting ability will be closely monitored. A decision on whether to release the cub into the wild or send it to a zoo will be taken based on its hunting abilities.”The enclosure will consist of a 15ft high chain-link fencing and 3ft high wire mesh to prevent the entry of reptiles. The tiger cub was found in Manambolly forest range in a weak condition with a porcupine quill on its body. “It is kept in a cage near the rest house at Manambolly. It is growing well and is healthy and very active,” Ramasubramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-dept-launches-work-to-set-up-enclosure-to-rewild-tiger-cub/articleshow/87938642.cms||A Subburaj

Habib Khan, NRMU’s working president (headquarters), said for the last one year, the members have been demanding pool balancing of employees’ quarters and repair of the road to Ajni loco shed, but the demand has fallen on deaf ears of the railway administration. “During the last few months, 26 employees, including five women staff, met with accidents due to the bad condition of the road. Several vehicles have also been damaged. We cannot take it further and hence had to take a drastic step to launch a chain hunger strike,” said Khan. As reported earlier, a workshop to maintain 12,000 HP engines is coming up in Ajni for which road to the loco shed has been diverted, but it has been left in a shambles. Debashish Bhattacharya, zonal president of NRMU, said the quarters too are in a bad shape and leaking but the engineering department is taking it lightly. Though the Central Railway has cited lack of funds as the reason for not carrying out repairs, Khan alleged that maintenance of top officers’ quarters has been done regularly. There are over 750 employees working in the Ajni loco shed, who have become victims of the administration’s apathy. The NRMU leaders said on Friday that top railway officials from various department visited the spot and gave assurances to repair the road immediately, but the employees say unless the road is repaired, the hunger strike will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rly-staff-start-chain-hunger-strike-for-200m-road-repairs/articleshow/87937866.cms||---

The pumping station draws water from the Jayakwadi dam and caters to over 10, 000 houses in Paithan town. The power supply was cut on Friday, after the deadline to pay the power bills ended earlier this week. The action is all set to impact the town, which according to the 2011 census has a population of about 42, 000 people. MSEDCL’s senior official said, “The total arrears of Rs 75.80 lakh under public water works category towards Paithan municipal council is pending.” He said the municipal council also failed to pay the electricity bills of Rs 20 lakh for the past two months.  Authorities said the financial condition of MSEDCL is grim and now it is left with no option but to disconnect the connection of all the defaulters, be it private or government institutions. When contacted, Paithan municipal council authorities said they intended to clear the outstanding dues but the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) recently froze the council’s bank account, making it impossible to make any financial transactions. “We have requested MSEDCL authorities to resume the power supply and have assured them of clearing the power dues in the next two to three working days,” said a senior official from Paithan civic body. While MSEDCL authorities said they were awaiting written assurance from the civic body before the power supply is restored. “As soon as we get a written assurance about the payment of outstanding dues, we will temporarily restore power supply by Friday night,” said MSEDCL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msedcl-snaps-power-supply-to-paithan-water-pumping-stn/articleshow/87937219.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Will bring Delhi model to Nagpur, says AAP||NAGPUR: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has blown the bugle for next year’s civic polls saying the ‘Delhi mode’ will be brought to Nagpur if the party wins. Senior party leaders from the state and Delhi addressed the media on Friday saying if voted to power, AAP’s focus will be improving the civic infrastructure drastically. The party has decided to contest all the seats. Vishesh Ravi, AAP MLA from Delhi’s Karol Bagh constituency, said, “In Delhi we have the best schools, excellent health facilities, highly subsidized power and water for people. Across the world the Delhi model is being praised as something to be emulated.” Ravi says it’s possible in Nagpur too. “BJP has done nothing in the city. I have heard that civic schools are shutting down, no doctors in hospitals and a water crisis in some areas. Once we come to power everything will change,” said Ravi. While the manifesto will have many things, the priority for AAP shall be education and health. Ravi said, “A recent nationwide survey of schools, which is a benchmark, had Delhi schools in the top list. Our mohalla clinics are providing access to healthcare in neighbourhoods and in hospitals you can get the costliest of tests done for free. All this shall happen in Nagpur, if people give us a chance.” The party also plans to provide water 24/7 to citizens. Star campaigner for AAP, Arvind Kejriwal, is also expected to be in the city as the poll dates inch closer. Ranga Rachure, Maharashtra state coordinator, said the party has already started to make inroads. “In the recently conducted bypolls for local bodies across the state, we fielded around 300 candidates. Almost 150 of them won, including two in Vidarbha. This proves that the party has reached right down to the village level,” said Rachure. Vidarbha coordinator Devendra Wankhede said the party is in the process of finalizing candidates. “That process has started but the official list will be released once the delimitation process is complete,” said Wankhede. Earlier in the day, the party took out a flag march to mark their foundation day as well as the Constitution Day. Party state treasurer Jagjit Singh, sangathan mantri Pratap Goswami and other leaders like Kavita Singhal, advocate Rajesh Bhoyar, Ambarish Sawarkar, Ashok Mishra and many others participated in the flag march.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-bring-delhi-model-to-nagpur-says-aap-as-it-gears-up-for-civic-elections/articleshow/87937881.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Coimbatore||Declare Thadagam Valley as reserve forest: Farmers||Coimbatore: Farmers from the north taluk have urged the state government to take over thousands of acres land at Thadagam Valley, where indiscriminate quarrying is rampant, and declare the area as reserve forest to rejuvenate the waterbodies in the taluk.They also petitioned district collector G S Sameeran in this regard at the farmers’ grievance meeting on Friday.The farmers said while the groundwater level had improved in various parts of the district, the increase was negligible in their taluk and the same would improve only if the waterbodies at Vellakinar, Chinnavedampatti, Agrahara Samakulam, Kondaiyampalayam-Kovilpalayam and Periyanayakkanpalayam receive water. “They are bone dry despite the heavy rain that the district received in recent months,” they said.G Ranganathan, a member of Thamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, said the water from Western Ghats was not reaching the waterbodies in north taluk. “The quarries in Thadagam valley can hold more than 30TMC water. For the waterbodies to get water, the quarry pits have to be filled first.”While the canal in Chinna Thadagam was getting some water, he said the same was not flowing into the city because of the rampant red soil mining on the 10km stretch between Chinna Thadagam and Mangarai check post. “The district administration should take efforts to revive the canal.”The farmers said more than 40 of the 200 minor streams, which used to get water from Thadagam Valley, were blocked because of the indiscriminate quarrying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/declare-thadagam-valley-as-reserve-forest-farmers/articleshow/87938670.cms||---
---||Patna||Cooperate with state machinery in enforcing liquor ban: Bihar CM||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday urged everyone to cooperate with the state machinery in implementing the prohibition law as liquor is bad for health and society. He said a message should be propagated among the public that ‘if you drink poisonous liquor, you are bound to die”. Nitish said the recent deaths due to illicit liquor should be treated as a warning against consuming hooch in Bihar. Taking the pledge along with his cabinet colleagues and all top bureaucrats about not consuming alcohol in life, Nitish reiterated that liquor ban will be enforced more effectively in the state. A similar pledge was taken by all the government employees and officials present there or connected through videoconferencing to the event organized on the occasion of ‘Nasha Mukti Diwas’ at the Gyan Bhavan here. Speaking on the occasion, the CM also warned the officials against involvement in the illicit transportation of liquor, “which will not be tolerated at any cost”. The CM also asserted that total prohibition in the state would continue and there is no question of rolling back the unanimous decision taken by the state legislators. “If people die because of consumption of poisonous liquor, should we allow them to drink (licensed) liquor? What do you expect from me? I will rather say that the deaths due to poisonous liquor should be propagated so that people get a strong message that liquor is a very bad thing,” Nitish said. Referring to his recent review meeting on the enforcement of liquor ban, Nitish said, “I told officials to focus on Patna. If you control Patna, it will send a strong message across the state.” Justifying the recent police searches for liquor at marriage venues, Nitish said, “Police have been told to look into the marriage venues and other places where liquor can be served. Is it a crime to search a marriage venue? All inputs to police never come out as true. But police search places after getting inputs.” He asked the officials to keep in mind the instructions given at the recent review meeting and enforce the prohibition law in totality. “All DMs have been asked to hold a meeting on enforcement of prohibition at an interval of 15 days. The DGP, home secretary and the department secretary have been asked to hold a review meeting every alternate day,” the CM said. Nitish also reminded that the total prohibition in the state was enforced by unanimous decision of all political parties. “I am surprised that some leaders of those political parties are today raising questions over the prohibition law. Media should ask such people, is it right to drink liquor?” Nitish asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cooperate-with-state-in-enforcing-liquor-ban-nitish/articleshow/87937888.cms||Madan Kumar

City police commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam said that Thankachan has been booked under Section 354-D (Stalking) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) read with 109 (Abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence) of the IPC. According to a senior officer with city police, the probe team collected CCTV footage from the route taken by the Ford Figo car in which the victims travelled, and they were able to detect a clear spike in the speed of the car after the interaction with the accused, who came in an Audi car. “We have calculated the speed of the car using CCTV footage. There is a clear indication of speeding by the Ford Figo car after the interaction with the man in the Audi car. His presence is considered as an extra stimulus for the speeding. Also, there is a clear indication that he was pursuing them and asking them to stay back for an ‘after party’ and was repeating the same even after the women explicitly expressed disinterest. This is consistent with stalking,” said the officer. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer and Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan and their friend Mohammad Ashiq had died in the accident when they were returning from a party at a hotel in Fort Kochi on November 1. An officer said that as per their probe the victims felt that the man’s approach was with sexual intent, and this must have scared them. The driver of the car is also corroborating this, said the officer. Thankachan was summoned for questioning on Friday and his arrest was recorded by evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-arrest-syju-thankachan/articleshow/87938682.cms||---

An individual will only require to bring along a government recognised identity card. The decision to end the pre-booking condition for this age group was taken by the district administration on Friday with an aim to make vaccination more accessible to the people. The move is expected to boost the turnout, which as highlighted by TOI repeatedly, had dropped in October and November in comparison to September. Earlier, people aged between 18 and 44 years had to pre-book a slot for vaccination at government health facilities, while those in the 45-59 years age group as well as those aged 60 and above had the option to either pre-book or simply walk in with a government recognised ID for on-the-spot registration to get the jab. However, there was no condition for the special vaccination centres set up at religious places or workplaces and people of all age groups could avail of any of the two options. These centres have been witnessing more footfall than government hospitals and health care centres. “Now, every eligible person can just walk into the nearest vaccination centre to get the jab,” said district magistrate (DM) Abhishek Prakash after a meeting of health officials. The order is effective from Saturday. Officials were also instructed to run a special five-day vaccination drive from November 28 to December 2 for those who have missed their second dose. According to the health department’s estimate, nearly 4 lakh people have not taken the second dose even after the end of the 12-16 week gap period. The DM also said that a cluster approach will be adopted to achieve 100% vaccination in the district in which healthcare workers will saturate an area at a time by vaccinating all eligible residents through special camps. He also fixed vaccination targets for all the eight rural blocks in Lucknow. TOI had also highlighted that though Lucknow has achieved the milestone of administering 50 lakh doses, rural areas were lagging in the vaccination rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/18-44-yrs-beneficiaries-need-not-pre-book-vax-slot-now/articleshow/87939218.cms||---
---||Pune||High BP common among Covid dead||Mumbai: Hypertension or high blood pressure alone, or in combination with diabetes, was the commonest comorbidity found in patients who succumbed to Covid-19 in the state recently. The heavy burden of both these lifestyle diseases has often been underlined as one of the reasons why Maharashtra saw more than 1.4 lakh fatalities due to coronavirus. There have been 2,966 Covid deaths in Maharashtra between September and mid-November. Officials said more than 75% (2,224) of the deceased had some or the other comorbidity. An analysis of 632 deaths showed that hypertension alone was an underlying factor in 15%, while diabetes was a factor in 12%. Another 11% of the deceased had both diabetes and hypertension. “Hypertension followed by diabetes have been the commonest comorbidities. Even in deaths among the younger population, some had these comorbidities,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death committee. Majority of the deaths are among the unvaccinated now. “But, in cases where patients get severe Covid despite vaccination, these comorbid conditions have been present in some,” he added. Lung diseases also emerged as some of the common comorbidities. At least 5% of the patients had chronic lung disease. In 3% cases, patients had heart disease, diabetes and high BP. Hypertension clubbed with kidney disease, HIV/Aids, liver disease have also been found among other underlying conditions. The National Family Heal-th Survey-5 had found a quarter of men in the state had elevated blood pressure or are taking medicines to control it. In urban areas, 26% of men have elevated BP, while in rural, it’s 23.5%. In comparison, 23% of women had elevated levels. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Covid task force, said one in four people have hypertension in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-bp-common-among-covid-dead/articleshow/87939221.cms||---

Haridwar police had registered a case in the multi-crore scam against Max Corporate Services, and the two firms it had outsourced some of the tests to -- Nalwa Laboratories and Delhi-based Dr Lalchandani Labs -- on June 17 under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection), 420 (cheating), 468 ( forgery for cheating), 471 (using forged documents), and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, along with Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Section 53 of the Disaster Management Act. Subsequent investigation by the SIT constituted in the matter found evidence against Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Laboratories. Prior to this, a detailed investigation by the health department had found that nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-testing-scam-hc-turns-down-bail-plea-of-mallika-and-sharat-pant/articleshow/87937889.cms||---

The officer said the local political and religious leaders, along with non-government organisations, are helping the civic body step up the drive in Malegaon.  The average vaccination rate of 1,200 shots per day has now gone up to over 3,000 per day, which is following the conducive atmosphere created after the awareness was stepped up. There is a sharp rise in daily average vaccination during the past fortnight and this is helping in increasing the vaccination count, Thakre said. The major problem of vaccination was in Malegaon East. In Malegaon West, the beneficiaries came forward. “There was vaccination hesitancy in Malegaon East. People were not ready to take the vaccine and there were five to 15 people taking vaccines per day in each of the 15 vaccination centres, that were arranged,” she said.  The number of centres have been increased from 20 to 52||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-picks-up-pace-in-malegaon/articleshow/87954670.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Game, on Saturday, told TOI that the administrations of these five districts have been instructed to immediately start random rapid antigen tests (RATs) at religious places like the Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik, the Sai temple in Shirdi and the Shani Shingnapur temple, which is 70 km from Shirdi, among other places. Game said, “Certain religious places in these five districts are registering significant footfall of pilgrims and with the identification of a new Covid-19 variant, there is a need to step up the surveillance, even though the Covid situation is stable at present.” Game has also asked the district administrations to coordinate with the Railways to start screening of the passengers alighting at various stations, especially the busy ones like the Nashik Road station, Bhusawal, Jalgaon etc. “We have three airports — at Shirdi, Nashik and Jalgaon — in the region. The administration must coordinate with the airport authorities concerned to start thermal screening of air travellers arriving, particularly from abroad via flights from Mumbai, Delhi etc.” said Game. “I would appeal to people to maintain the Covid appropriate behaviour, including wearing masks and avoiding overcrowding, since these could lead to a fresh spike in cases,” he added. Game said the district and health administrations are making all efforts to improve the vaccine coverage further. “Our health workers are making untiring efforts to vaccinate the beneficiaries as fast as possible. In some districts, even vehicles are being provided to bring the beneficiaries to the vaccination centres or the health workers are travelling to villages to inoculate the beneficiaries,” Game said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rats-at-religious-places-in-5-dists-of-nashik-division/articleshow/87954677.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The CBI team headed by DSP TP Ananthakrishnan questioned the accused Valiya Madhu and Shibu in the presence of the district jail superintendent for over one-and-half hours. The two girls aged 12 and 9 years were found hanging in their thatched house at Attappallam in Walayar in January and February, 2017. The district Pocso court had acquitted all the four accused for want of evidence and due to the failure of prosecution to prove the case. The government approached the high court to cancel the district court judgment. The high court cancelled the district court order and the accused were jailed again. The state government later handed over the case to CBI on the demand of their mother. The girl’s parents are daily wage earners and they leave the house early in the morning and return late after work. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cbi-quizzes-accused-in-jail/articleshow/87938713.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The lawyers met in Kolhapur to discuss action plan for resuming the agitation for their 40-year-long pending demand of a circuit bench in Kolhapur. Girish Khadke, president of Kolhapur District Bar Association, said, “The agitations had stopped from the last two years due to Covid. Now, we want the CM to discuss the issue with chief justice of Bombay high court by December 31 and get the circuit bench approved. If he fails to take the initiative, then we will relaunch our agitation and this time it will be intense.” The forum demanding the circuit bench also decided to get political leadership from the six districts on board.

---||Pune||Gates blocking Savitribai Phule Pune University main building draw opposition||PUNE: Students, alumni and the citizens who visit the picturesque surroundings of Savitribai Phule Pune University’s main building to study, practise their art, exercise or just relax, are aghast that the stately main building has been barricaded from all sides to make it inaccessible to them. Members of the alumni said the university was a state public university and must be accessible to all, especially its own students as they are the first stakeholders of any public educational institute and the strict rules and the gates installed will only destroy the beauty of the structure. However, vice-chancellor of the university Nitin Karmalkar said that the gates are being put up to protect the grade A heritage structure against vandalism, but the general public and students will be given access every day between 5am and 8am and 5pm and 8pm as it has been done post relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions. For now, the university has barricaded the front portion of the main building by building gates with security personnel on both sides. Visitors are not allowed to walk in front of the main building. A couple who tried to get past the gate on Friday evening was stopped by the security guards at the entrance who said they cannot enter and only staff members were allowed to use the area. The plans to build gates and secure the premises was part of the renovation programme which ended a few years ago, Karmalkar added. Before the pandemic, students could be seen in the passageways behind the main building in the evenings, studying alone or in groups. A group of students from the biochemistry department who were lounging on the lawns said that since their arrival, they have not been allowed anywhere near the main building. “There are security men everywhere who tell us to leave if we try to sit in the passageway,” a second-year student said. For almost 30 years, Yashwant Potnis, his wife Sushila and a group of retired friends have been coming to the university every evening. The group would all converge around 6pm, claim a corner of the lawns and the atmosphere would soon be filled with talks, laughter and celebrations. Kantilal Khinvsera, a retired businessman, who visits the university, said that installing gates will isolate the area. Khinvsera further added that barricading the area will alos isolate the people from the university premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gates-blocking-sppu-main-building-draw-opposition/articleshow/87938696.cms||Ardhra Nair

We have requested the government to issue us guidelines on the same, and are yet to receive them. The new guidelines will be studied and followed,” said chief convener of the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan that is to be held at Nashik between December 3 and 5. “Thermal scanners will be used to check each person’s body temperature, and only those with no Covid symptoms will be allowed to enter the venue,” said Dr Prashant Bhutada, the head of the sammelan’s health committee. The committee has also decided to check the vaccination certificates of each visitor and keep masks handy. The gathering and seating arrangements will be as per Covid norms. The committee has also decided to put red marks on the hands of people detected with symptoms, which will restrict their entry on all three days. “Such people will first undergo rapid antigen tests, and if the test is negative, an RT-PCR test will follow. If negative again, the person will be allowed entry with a ‘green’ mark on the hand. However, if the person tests positive, he/she will be marked in ‘red’ and treatment will be advised,” Dr Bhutada said. The committee has tied up with eight private hospitals with 80 beds reserved for any person at the literary event needing medical help. “We have 37 allopathy, ayurveda and homeopathy consultants. Eighty nurses, three emergency medical booths, and eight ambulances will be available so that treatment and hospital admission is possible in the first 20 minutes — considered the ‘golden hour’,” Dr Bhutada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marathi-lit-fest-may-stop-unvaccinated-visitors-too/articleshow/87954700.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Meerut||After claiming to have brought Jats & Muslims together, RLD now eyes Dalit votes||Muzaffarnagar: To reverse the rout in two general elections and one assembly polls (UP), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), now being led by Jayant Chaudhary (after his father Ajit Singh's death), is leaving no stone unturned to reclaim the lost ground. After working dedicatedly on bhai-chara committees to bring back Jat and Muslim votes, the Party is now trying to gain the trust of Dalits. The party has been visiting Dalit homes in West UP districts. According to spokesperson Abhishek Chaudhary, "Propaganda is being spread that RLD, which is a farmer-based party, is preferring Muslims to others. But this is not true, we are working equally among Dalits too." According to sources, Muzaffarnagar has more than 2.50 lakh Dalit voters in all six assembly constituencies. The party's workers have begun visiting their homes and trying to convince them by assuring them that they will be given positions in the party and also in the government, if the party comes into power. According to sources from the RLD, the party considers that every Lok Sabha constituency in west UP has nearly 4 lakh dalit voters. Speaking to TOI, RLD's SC/ST cell head Prashant Kanojia said, "The idea of connecting personally with Dalit families may not work instantly, but I am sure this effort will change things for better. Undoubtedly, RLD was considered to be a one-community (Jats) party earlier, but now, a new generation of the Jat community is striving to bring all communities together under one roof." Denying any possibility of alliance with Chandrashekhar Azad, Kanojia further said, "We conducted 62 "Nyaay yatras" in various parts of west UP and achieved good results. We are now roping in the Dalit community by organising "Bahujan Uday Abhiyaan" and visiting their homes. On Sunday, a Dalit panchayat is going to be organised in Jansath area of Muzaffarnagar, in which members of the SC/ST communities will take part and express their views about the party."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-claiming-to-have-brought-jats-muslims-together-rld-now-eyes-dalit-votes/articleshow/87937920.cms||Mohd Dilshad

On October 28, Jasvinder wrote a letter to district administration, pleading not to give his land to Diwedi, who is considered close to MLA and minister Swami Yatishwaranand but his request went unheard. Sources said large-scale illegal mining was being undertaken along Ravasan river. Taking note of the illegality, a letter from a forest department officer also surfaced in which he mentioned that Diwedi was involved in illegal mining but neither the DM nor the DFO, Haridwar, took any action. At a press conference, Aam Aadmi Party leader Naresh Sharma alleged that administration did not take action as Diwedi was close to minister Swami Yatishwarand, adding that if no action was taken, he will move court. Jasvinder told TOI, “The piece of land I own is along the Ravasan river in Laldhang region and close to Rajaji Tiger Reserve. It was given to Diwedi by administration under river training policy in 2018 for 17 days but his permission was cancelled after which he moved the court and got permission for carrying out work in seven days. That was the time when he was caught undertaking illegal mining by then DFO, Akash Verma, and imposed Rs 16 lakh penalty. But now the government has again given him permission for mining without my consent. I wrote a letter again but no action. Even the police threatened me.” Logging officer, Haridwar, Sher Singh, also wrote a letter on November 1 to the DFO and DM about illegal mining, saying around 500 trucks with minerals passed daily from the forest route while only a few have e-passes. Those are mostly overloaded. On the matter, DM, Haridwar, Vinay Shankar Pandey, told TOI, “I did not receive any letter from the farmer. However, I got a letter from the logging officer on Thursday but we took action three days ago against illegal mining and seized vehicles. Alok Diwedi got permission legally and we are assessing the land and raw materials for further action. Sher Singh did not take any action against illegal mining and he is the prime accused and I will write a letter against him to the higher authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmer-battles-to-get-land-back-from-bjp-leader-charged-with-illegal-mining/articleshow/87937916.cms||MS Nawaz

This was for the works related to drinking water supply. “Though drinking water is essential for people, even BMBC roads are being dug up for water pipe works. Those who dig up the roads have the responsibility to restore it to its original state. If KWA is digging up roads for drinking water projects, the agency has the responsibility to restore it as well,” he said, adding that the order issued by the state government in 2017 had made this clear. The minister also said that not all roads in the state were under PWD’s care. “Of the over 1L km of roads in state, only 33,000km come under PWD. Among the roads which were cited in Ernakulam, only one road came under PWD,” Riyas said, adding that the department has decided to take a stringent stand in the matter. Riyas said that the issue has been brought to the attention of the chief minister. He added that he had also talked to water supply and irrigation minister Roshy Augustine. “We requested a high-level meeting to discuss the matter and hope it will be held soon,” he said. The minister said the department will explore use of modern technologies for carrying out road works during rains as the state was witnessing prolonged wet spells. Riyas added that the state government has given approval for having a running contract system to carry out repair works of roads even after the end of defect liability period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/riyas-blames-kwa-for-bad-condition-of-roads/articleshow/87938720.cms||---

The man siphoned off the amount from her bank account by sending her multiple Quick Response (QR) codes in December 2020. The woman, a private firm employee, filed a complaint with the cyber police station on Thursday. In December 2020, the woman had put up an advertisement on a social media site stating her intent to sell her used mattresses. “On December 22, a man contacted her saying he was with the Indian Army and was keen on purchasing the mattresses,” said a police officer investigating the case. He gained the woman’s confidence and assured her he would pay online. He also told her that he would send a QR code, which she needed to scan and the amount will be transferred to her bank account. “When the woman scanned it, instead of money getting credited to her bank account, some amount was deducted from her account. The man said it may have happened due to some error and sent her one more QR code. Again an amount was deducted from her bank account,” the officer said. He said the complainant then got suspicious and told him to cancel the deal and return her the money. “On the pretext of returning the money, the man sent her more QR codes and siphoned off a total of Rs 5.43 lakh from her account,” the officer said. A case has been registered under sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC, and also under sections of the Information and Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-army-man-dupes-woman-of-rs-5-43-lakh/articleshow/87938718.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai schools plan staggered opening: Classes 5-7, then 1-4||MUMBAI: City schools plan to bring only secondary students to offline classes before opening the gates for their primary counterparts. The state on Thursday had approved the proposal to reopen all classes from 1 to 7 from December 1. Classes 8 to 12 have been operating in the hybrid mode since October and attendance has begun picking up post Diwali. The state government resolution on reopening all classes is awaited. The BMC will thereafter take a call on reopening primary and secondary classes. Schools are gearing to accommodate classes 5 to 7 along with classes 8 to 10. Most schools will operate in two batches of three to four hours each. “Our higher secondary students come in at 7am and leave at10.30 am. We will bring Class 5-7 students at 10.45am. A call on primary students will be taken after the senior students settle down in their classrooms,” said the principal of a Chembur school. With one student per seat, each class has been divided in three to four classrooms in several schools. “Initially we plan to have fewer Class 5 to 7 students in school as most classrooms are taken over by standards 8 to 10,” said the principal of a Goregaon school. The failure of hybrid learning for those online is bringing more students to offline classes. “Accommodating students by adhering to Covid-19 protocols is now becoming a challenge,” a principal said. Education officers have asked schools to submit their plans for reopening all classes. Schools want a staggered reopening with classes 5 to 7, followed by primary students in a few weeks. Schools will get about three weeks before they shut for Christmas holidays. While classes 5 to 7 can be in school with existing precautions, such as wearing masks, temperature checks at the entrance, sanitization and social distancing, for classes 1-4 additional measures may be adopted by the state. “The transition from online to offline has been smooth for classes 8 to 10 and should work for all classes,” said a principal. Classrooms that have been lying vacant since last year are being taken up for cleaning. Some schools said they will have to call students on alternate days due to the sheer number of children per class. Most state schools have 60 to 80 students per class. Parents of Class 5-7 students are being telephoned to seek consent. School heads said that more Class 5-7 students are in their native towns compared with their Class 8-10 counterparts. “Children who are in their native towns want to attend physical school but have genuine problems with finances,” said a teacher. With more classes opening up, teachers said their schedule will be extended. Schools are rushing with the syllabus of Class 10 students who have to appear for their preliminary exams in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-schools-plan-staggered-opening-classes-5-7-then-1-4/articleshow/87939257.cms||Sandhya Nair

The PCMC was to resume daily water supply in the municipal limits from November. PCMC water supply department officials said the delayed upgradation of the pipeline work due to Covid partly affected the implementation of 24x7 water works. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “The plan of lifting 100MLD water from Andra dam has got delayed due to some technical issues. The water will now be available from February only.” Patil said they were going to identify areas for the 24x7 supply and daily water supply in the coming week and by December, respectively. “Areas having households with no water storage availability will be given preference in resuming the daily and 24x7 water supply in the coming days,” he said. In May this year, the PCMC had started 24x7 water supply on a pilot project basis in sector 25 of Nigdi Pradhikaran. MNS corporator of ward 13, Sachin Chikhale, who attended the water review meeting on Thursday, said the administration’s lethargic work resulted in the delay of daily water supply. “If they fail to resume it by February, the administration will have to face severe consequences,” he said. The civic body had stopped the daily water supply back in 2019 that the alternate day water supply was giving them enough force and equitable water supply opportunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-misses-deadline-for-daily-water-supply/articleshow/87939247.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Delhi||Delhi: Cops nab kingpin of interstate drug cartel||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested the kingpin of an interstate drug cartel who carried a reward of Rs one lakh for his arrest. The suspect has been identified as Mohammad Kashim Ali who was allegedly responsible for the flow of heroin consignments from Manipur to Guwahati, Siliguri and Malda and other parts of the country, cops said. The accused had been sending heroin consignments to western UP areas and Delhi-NCR by hiding them in secret cavities of vehicles specifically designed for illegal trafficking of heroin. The accused was arrested from Churachandpur district in Manipur located near Myanmar border after cops received a tip-off about his whereabouts. The accused was produced before the court for remand. After obtaining a transit remand, he was transported to Delhi for legal proceedings. Ali had been recruited in Manipur police as constable. In a family feud over land, he got arrested in a murder case, due to which he has been under suspension leading to financial crisis in the family. So, he took to drug trafficking. He came in contact with a key supplier in Myanmar and started transporting drugs for him. He also employed two couriers for a hefty amount of Rs one lakh per trip. Being in the police department, he knew how to avoid detection at check posts. In another operation, cops have recovered 10kg of heroin from Dwarka. It’s valued at over Rs 50 crore. An African national has been arrested and is being interrogated about the whereabouts of other members of his syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-nab-kingpin-of-interstate-drug-cartel/articleshow/87938727.cms||---
---||Delhi||SC seeks Centre reply on Rakesh Asthana’s appointment||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday entertained an appeal by an NGO challenging a Delhi High Court verdict validating the Centre's decision to appoint Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the Commissioner of Delhi Police while granting him inter-cadre deputation and one year’s extension of service. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna issued notices to the Centre and Asthana and sought their responses on or before December 13, the next date of hearing. This is a unique case given the fact that the writ petition filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which had challenged Asthana’s appointment, is still pending with the apex court even as the SC had permitted CPIL's counsel Prashant Bhushan to argue a similar matter, filed by PIL petitioner Sadre Alam, pending before the Delhi HC. Interestingly, CPIL's writ petition is still pending and the same NGO has now filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) to appeal against the HC verdict. Interestingly, the bench issued notice on both the writ petition as well as the SLP, both filed by CPIL through its general secretary having office at lawyers’ chambers in SC. This means, the court would exercise its writ jurisdiction as well as Article 136 powers while dealing with the same petitioner's single point grievance that Asthana's appointment is illegal. The petitioner had faulted both the inter-cadre deputation as well as extension of service while faulting the selection process for Asthana's appointment as Delhi Police chief. On October 12, the Delhi HC had dismissed Sadre Alam’s petition, which Bhushan claimed was a word-to-word copy of CPIL's writ petition pending in SC, against Asthana's appointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-seeks-centre-reply-on-asthanas-appointment/articleshow/87938724.cms||---

The victim had filed a complaint with the cyber police station, but after a preliminary probe, the case was registered with the Kondhwa police on Thursday. An officer with the Kondhwa police told TOI that on August 28, the complainant received a call from an unknown person, who asked him to update the KYC of his SIM card else his phone number will be blocked. “The man then told the complainant to download an app on his cell phone,” the officer said. He said the fraudster then sent the victim a link and told him to transfer Rs 13.90 to him. “After that, the man got the access of the complainant’s bank details and siphoned off Rs 1.97 lakh,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-citizen-loses-rs-1-9l-in-kyc-fraud/articleshow/87938721.cms||---

However, parents of children at high risk—those with special needs having other underlying medical conditions—may decide on sending their wards to school only after full vaccination, the task force clarified. There are 1,600 special needs schools in Maharashtra, including grant and non-grant, with nearly 65,000 boarders and day scholars. “Teachers may face challenges because students may have difficulty understanding and following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Schools are advised to take extra precautions while overseeing their care,” said Dr Pramod Jog, member of the state paediatric Covid task force. Omprakash Deshmukh, commissioner for persons with disabilities in Maharashtra, said, “We have sent a proposal to the government and sought orders on reopening of educational institutes. Our social justice department has sent the file to the public health department and a decision is expected from Mantralaya.” He said they hold online classes for the children. Mangal Wankhade, principal of a school for visually impaired girls in Alandi, said, “We are awaiting government orders to reopen.” Sadhana Godbole of Prasanna Autism Centre, said they won’t open now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-parents-may-send-spl-needs-kids-with-med-issues-to-school-after-both-jabs-says-task-force/articleshow/87939267.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Chilwal has filed an application in the high court, seeking a stay on his arrest. The petitioner said he was not involved in the incident and is being falsely implicated by some people due to political reasons. During the hearing, Khurshid's advocates told the court that Chilwal is the main accused in the case. While many people have been arrested by the police in this case, the key accused is roaming scot-free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/key-accused-in-khurshids-house-vandalism-seeks-stay/articleshow/87937923.cms||---

Those with a better understanding of law have pointed out that using the ‘goodwill’ of the Indian Army for electoral gains is a punishable offence. The controversy began after the Roorkee unit of the saffron party got several walls in the town painted with a slogan saying -- Sena ke samman ko, layein kamal nishan ko (for the honour of the Army, vote for the BJP). Reacting to the slogan, Ram Kishan Singh, a senior advocate in the local district court, said, “Exploiting the goodwill of the Army, the Supreme Court, or any such non-political institution for an election campaign is punishable under law. We will write to the Indian Army chief in this connection and ensure appropriate action against those behind this.” Meanwhile, Jaipal Singh Chauhan, BJP’s district president, has said there is nothing wrong with using the word ‘sena’ (Army) in the election slogan. “Non-BJP governments have a callous approach towards national security and strengthening of the Army. Through the slogan, we are calling upon people to vote for the BJP as our party takes such issues of national significance with the seriousness they deserve. There’s nothing wrong with the slogan,” added Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-invokes-army-pride-for-election-campaign-in-roorkee-draws-flak/articleshow/87937925.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Lucknow||Be your city’s brand ambassador, promote vocal for local: Governor||Lucknow: Governor and Chancellor of state universities, Anandiben Patel, asked the students graduating from Lucknow University to be the brand ambassadors of their respective cities by being ‘vocal for local’. Addressing the 64th convocation ceremony of the university on Friday, the governor asked the students to promote local industries, products, skills and craft of their respective districts and take it to global platforms. “Consumption of local products can give financial push to such industries,” she added. Talking about the initiatives taken by the state government to create employment opportunities for the youth, the governor said, “On November 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for Noida International Airport, which would provide employment to over 1 lakh people. Youth, especially students, will have more employment opportunities in future.” “Before Diwali, the PM gifted Aarogya Bharat Yojana to the country which would help meet the health needs of the people. This initiative will also generate employment for medical and paramedical students,” she added. Praising the government’s efforts to stop female foeticide and spread awareness about family planning, she cited the National Family Health Survey report that reflects that women population has registered an increase in the state. “For the first time since the NFHS began in 1992, the population of women exceeded men in 2021. According to the report, there are 1,020 women per 1,000 men,” she added. She also appealed to students to say ‘no’ to cash transactions and opt for digital payments. She also asked students to take the oath to save the environment by conserving water and not using plastic at all. Vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai said, “LU has become India’s first university to adopt the New Education Policy (NEP). Looking into three important aspects of education – globalized, interconnected and diversified – the university has also passed new DLitt., PG, UG and PhD ordinances in accordance with the NEP.” He added that 34,811 degrees would be sent to the students through registered post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/be-your-citys-brand-ambassador-promote-vocal-for-local-governor/articleshow/87939278.cms||---

Sub-inspector Atul Kshirsagar of the Shivajinagar police told TOI that the complainant’s acquaintance had introduced him to the woman in September last year. “The acquaintance had told the complainant that the woman was the customs officer and would give him the gold bars at cheaper rate,” Kshirsagar said. “The complainant gave her Rs 71.60lakh and also transferred Rs 12.40 lakh online to a bank account,” Kshirsagar said.  “After waiting for about a year, he filed a complaint.

At the same time, it is painful that the court has not intervened in the petition challenging the government’s liquor policy that is aimed at making people addicted to liquor,” he said. He said that he had filed a writ petition challenging the liquor rules before the court in June 2017 itself, but the court did not take a decision in the matter. The government had filed its counter affidavit in August 2017 itself. Even though the case was posted before the bench headed by the chief justice several times, it was not considered and was postponed 47 times, he said. He said the court’s approach in a subject that adversely affects the life of citizens is extremely disappointing. Meanwhile, the government is going ahead with opening more avenues for the public to consume alcohol, he said. When the LDF government came to power in 2016, there were only 29 liquor shops in the state which has now increased to 859. This is in addition to the beer and wine parlours, Consumerfed and Bevco outlets and clubs, Sudheeran said. People depend on the judiciary for correcting the wrong policies and measures taken by the government. If there is no opportunity to take up the case at the appropriate time in that body, where else can the citizens go, Sudheeran asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-twisted-hc-order-to-open-more-liquor-outlets/articleshow/87938736.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPI mouthpiece slams Kerala cops over recent incidents||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state police force has come in for severe criticism from the LDF ally CPI. Through an editorial written in the party’s mouthpiece, the CPI has flayed the functioning of the police force, referring to a series of recent incidents. While pointing out the incidents from the Monson case to the suicide of Mofiya Parveen in Aluva, the CPI mouthpiece has said there is a lack of trust in the police force when it acts against the interest of society. “Several past incidents have led to a loss of trust in the police force in the state,” it said. The editorial said that it was most unfortunate that those who are to take care of society are not doing it, and it has badly affected the image of the Left government. It was also most unfortunate to note that Mofiya Parveen’s suicide note had mentioned the circle inspector’s name. It cannot be seen as an isolated incident. The same officer had messed up a case earlier also and top police officers were unaware of it. Strangely, the complaint of this law student was not taken seriously by police officials. The editorial also slammed that despite an inquiry report demanding suspension of this officer in the earlier case, nothing happened. This created a bad impression before the democratic society. The editorial further said that it was the duty of a responsible government to handle such situations when police are becoming a bane for society. CPI leader C Divakaran flayed the police force for Mofiya’s suicide. He said when Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was the home minister, he had introduced the Janamitiri Police scheme to create a friendly bonding between police and the people. All such initiatives have lost momentum, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpi-mouthpiece-slams-state-cops-over-recent-incidents/articleshow/87939698.cms||---

---||Pune||2 months after gangrape case, station autorickshaw booth finds few takers||PUNE: The Pune railway station’s metered autorickshaw booth, which was put back in service in September after a brief pause owing to the gangrape of a minor, is not even getting 30 to 35 passengers daily despite 50,000 passengers arriving in almost 200 trains every day. The lower footfall is primarily because of the city traffic police’s inability to remove other autorickshaw drivers, who ply their vehicles without meter, from the booth periphery. “The low footfall at the booth comes at a time when the number of passengers at the station has increased significantly. The reason behind the service not clicking among the commuters is the presence of a large number of autorickshaw drivers, who don’t go by the meter and take away all the passengers. The police had assured that such autorickshaw drivers would be taken to task but that has not happened,” a representative at the booth, told TOI. The booth, which allows passengers to book autorickshaws at metered rates, was restarted on September 17 by the Pune traffic police after the gangrape of a minor by 14 people, including many autorickshaw drivers between August 31 and September 1. The girl had been picked up late in the evening from the Pune station. The representative said they might have to shut down the 24-hour service if there are no takers. “We will have to shut down the service after sunset if such low footfall continues. Our location is a problem as the booth is located far from the main entrance and it is not properly visible to the people exiting the station. But we were promised better promotion of the booth and more facilities, which never happened. Autorickshaw drivers at our booth get into arguments with other drivers to get passengers,” the representative said. The booth is located near the reservation office of the station. Before any ride, details of the passenger and the autorickshaw driver are taken for security purposes. After speaking with a few passengers it was observed that many didn’t have information about the existence of such a booth. “Why can’t the railways announce or at least put up some notice boards with the information about the booth? As soon as we exit the station, hordes of autorickshaw drivers flock around us and ask for irrational fares. Last week, they asked me Rs 500 for a trip to Kondhwa when by meter the fare is not even Rs 200,” said Satish Gate, who travelled to Pune recently. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Rahul Shrirame said he had a meeting on the issue on Thursday. “Fresh instructions have been given to the Railway Protection Force and the local Bund Garden police station to start another drive to remove the autos, which are not running on meter, from the station premises. We will also start proper promotion of the facility so that passengers are aware. It is a fact that at present there are very few takers for the service,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-months-after-gangrape-case-station-autorickshaw-booth-finds-few-takers/articleshow/87938747.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Meerut||Court summons top Central, state officials over relief to Dalit victims of '17 communal clash||Meerut: Over four years after violent Dalit-Thakur clashes at Shabbirpur in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur district, the special SC/ST court has issued summons to the secretary, Union ministry of social justice and empowerment; secretary, National SC/ST Commission; chief secretary and DGP of UP, the director and chief secretary of the social welfare department, the district magistrate and the senior superintendent (SSP) of Saharanpur for not providing adequate compensation Dalit victims and the kin of the dead. The Saharanpur MP, Haji Fazlur Rehman of the BSP, has also been summoned. This came after the petitioners -- victims of the caste violence -- alleged that these authorities violated the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2016, which provides for a range of compensations to Dalit victims of caste violence. These compensations, in the form of jobs, funds, rations, homes, etc, have not been provided to 56 victims of the Shabbirpur violence, the petitioners had said. On May 5, 2017, clashes broke out between Thakurs and Dalits that left one person dead and scores injured in Shabbirpur. Later, 56 houses belonging to Dalits were torched. The violence erupted after Dalits objected to the playing of loud music during the Maharana Pratap jayanti yatra taken out by Thakurs. Petitioner Dal Singh said, "As per the 2016 SC/ST Act, each Dalit who suffered during the of Shabbirpur violence would be entitled to Rs 8.25 lakh compensation. But they were given only Rs 3 lakh. They are also entitled to Rs 5,000 monthly pension, for which a committee was set up by the district administration and budget for the same was sought from the state government, but the approval is still pending. The Act also provides for free education of children of the victims up to the graduation level, apart from providing farmland, employment, etc. But even after four years of the clash, we are waiting for all these. It is a gross violation of the Act?" The victims' lawyer, Raj Kumar, said, "The Dalit victims have acknowledged that they received a compensation of Rs 3 lakh each from the district social welfare department. Sections under which the FIR was then filed and the charge sheet by police also had sections 395 (dacoity) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC apart from other sections, including relevant ones of the SC/ST Act. These are more than enough for them to qualify for all compensation provided by the Act. Violation of this Act is a serious offence and, hence, summons were issued."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/court-summons-top-central-state-officials-over-relief-to-dalit-victims-of-17-communal-clash/articleshow/87937954.cms||Sandeep Rai

"We can't say we have won, as over 700 of our brothers died during this movement," Tikait said. “Mere withdrawal of the three contentious agriculture laws is not sufficient, the government must bring a law on MSP so that farmers get fair remuneration for their crops,” he said while addressing a gathering at PN Sharma Park in Baraut tehsil of Baghpat district in Uttar Pradesh. “Terms such as ‘terrorists, Khalistanis, Pakistanis and andolanjeevis’ were used to insinuate the protesters, but farmers have forgiven all these. They have a big heart,” he added. He said whatever decision the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) takes on November 27 meeting will be accepted by all farmers and the unions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farm-protest-to-continue-till-all-demands-are-met-bku-president/articleshow/87937983.cms||---

The meritorious students, who stepped in for the convocation ceremony as carefree selfie-clicking brigade, left as responsible graduates, even suggesting steps their alma mater should take to be counted among leading universities of the country. Most of them rooted for digital push and better infrastructure for the university so that it could impart education as per the New Education Policy (NEP) - 2020. Winner of Dr Chakravarti Gold Medal for Service, Dev Dhar Dubey said, “Online lectures and presentations should be hassle-free and this will be possible only if the varsity has a number of smart classes. Both students and teachers in various departments struggle for good internet connectivity. Wi-Fi campuses, hi-tech computers will not only help in smoothly conducting online academic activities but will also help attain NEP goals.” “NEP focuses on developing a skill set in every student hence varsity should organize various workshops for writing, digital skills, mental mathematics and others. Smart boards should also be made available in every department to make education more interactive, easy to understand, and interesting,” said Chancellors’ Gold Medal winner Swati Singh. “New learning software, more e-content, making online all student-related official paperwork to save time should also be ensured,” said Vice-Chancellor’s Gold Medal winner Meetendra Srivastava. Meanwhile, the bronze medal winners of the university shared that the government should support LU with funds to revamp its 100 years old infrastructure. “Lucknow University has best of teachers and if they are given adequate infrastructure supports like smart classrooms, hi-tech laboratories, Wi-Fi, theatres and hall for extracurricular, they can help not a few but 100% LU students to achieve their dreams,” said bronze medal winner Iqra Rizwan Warsi. Other bronze winners, Mohd Aiyub Ahmad, Kuldeep Kumar Patel and Abhinav Kumar Verma, said, “LU old campus has adequate sports facilities but the second campus needs more sports infrastructure to nurture more state and national level players.” The three girls who bagged the Chancellors’ bronze medal, Shraddha Pandey, Priyamvada Shukla and Disha Mishra, said that university hostels should have a research room, library and internet connectivity so that students can prepare for competitive examination and do research work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medal-winners-root-for-digital-push-for-varsity/articleshow/87939312.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||In Maharashtra Covid deaths, high BP is most prevalent comorbidity||MUMBAI: Hypertension or high blood pressure alone, or in combination with diabetes, was the commonest comorbidity found in patients who succumbed to Covid-19 in the state recently. The heavy burden of both these lifestyle diseases has often been underlined as one of the reasons why Maharashtra saw more than 1.4 lakh fatalities due to coronavirus. There have been 2,966 Covid deaths in Maharashtra between September and mid-November. Officials said more than 75% (2,224) of the deceased had some or the other comorbidity. An analysis of 632 deaths showed that hypertension alone was an underlying factor in 15%, while diabetes was a factor in 12%. Another 11% of the deceased had both diabetes and hypertension. “Hypertension followed by diabetes have been the commonest comorbidities. Even in deaths among the younger population, some had these comorbidities,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death committee. Majority of the deaths are among the unvaccinated now. “But, in cases where patients get severe Covid despite vaccination, these comorbid conditions have been present in some,” he added. Lung diseases also emerged as some of the common comorbidities. At least 5% of the patients had chronic lung disease. In 3% cases, patients had heart disease, diabetes and high BP. Hypertension clubbed with kidney disease, HIV/Aids, liver disease have also been found among other underlying conditions. The National Family Health Survey-5 had found that a quarter of men in the state had elevated blood pressure or are taking medicines to control it. In urban areas, 26% of men have elevated BP, while in rural, it’s 23.5%. In comparison, 23% of women had elevated levels. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Covid task force, said that one in four people have hypertension in Maharashtra. “That alone makes a person vulnerable to suffer from stroke, cardiac problems, among other complications,” he said. Covid itself has been known to play havoc with sugar levels. “On top of that if the person’s levels are not under control, it can create complications,” said an intensivist from a BMC hospital. The doctor said he has seen blood sugar levels rising to staggering 700-800 (normal range being 140 mg/dL). Dr Sadhana Tayade, director of health services, said the state has intensified diagnosis of non-communicable diseases like hypertension. “During the pandemic, their diagnosis had dropped by 60-70%. We have restarted the programmes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-state-covid-deaths-high-bp-is-most-prevalent-comorbidity/articleshow/87939311.cms||---

Former senate member Atul Bagul, said that the government permitted reopening of classes from standards VIII to XII at 50% capacity in October. These children were below 18 years and not eligible for vaccination. “ Yet the government has set strange rules for the senior college students of full vaccination to attend the classes,” he added. Many students studying in the first year have still not completed 18 years so they are not even eligible for vaccination, said Bagul. Those studying in second and third years have taken just one dose and their second dose is due so even if they are willing they are unable to attend the classes. It is very difficult to do blended teaching as many classrooms are facing network issues and the live classes are not streamed properly on the online platforms. Also, practical classes are being missed by students for many months. Senior college teacher Devendra Bhonde, said that the state government is not uniform in its rules. “ This way, the government is saying that school children are not at risk and senior college students are, so the vaccine has been made compulsory to attend the classes. We want all students to attend classes ,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/both-doses-mandate-to-attend-college-raises-queries/articleshow/87938760.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The Kolhapur traffic department has appealed to the vehicle owners to pay the dues at the earliest either at the traffic office or pay online on the e-challan website. For the last two years, the dues of the fine have increased to Rs 10.91 crore. The fines for over 4 lakh traffic violations are due. The traffic department has observed that the violators do not pay the fine even after several appeals are made. “The violators have a deadline of December 11. They will get summons from the court to pay the fine amount. If they continue to evade paying the fine, then we will take action as per the motor vehicle act. We will launch a special drive to act against the violators. We have, however, experienced that many violators pay the fine after the court summons are issued," said Sneha Giri, the city traffic police inspector.  Most of the fine is for jumping signals or illegal parking. Also, some of the motorists were fined during Covid lockdown In the last two years, two lakh violators paid a fine of Rs 5.32 crore. Most of the violators with the dues are from Kolhapur city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/traffic-dept-to-approach-court-for-fine-recovery/articleshow/87937328.cms||---

It is displayed opposite Bakers Point, a popular junction for traffic going towards Undri and Mohammadwadi. “We did this to catch the attention of the PMC. Residents from across ward 26 keep demanding for repairs but only quick and temporary work is done. These roads cause a legitimate threat to the safety of the residents and commuters passing through these spots,” said Rohan Gaikwad, MNS prabhag president in the NIBM-Mohammadwadi area. A resident of the area said, “Every photo in the exhibition is a before and after shot, as the roads go back to the way they were after just a few days or weeks of repair works. Instead of wasting taxpayer money on such quick-fixes, it is about time the civic authorities figured out a sustainable solution.” The exhibition features damaged stretches near Clover Hills, DMart, Hills & Dales, parts of Kausarbaug, Pargenagar, Salunke Vihar Road, and the slopes near Cloud 9 and Palace Orchid. Avinash Kamthe, the junior engineer of the PMC’s road department, said, “Some of the damage on the roads are due to the laying of a new water pipeline. Those repairs will be done by the water department. We are awaiting permission from the forest department for lowering of slopes and widening of roads.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/photo-exhibition-organized-on-damaged-roads-in-nibm-mohammadwadi-area/articleshow/87938761.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The schools have planned meetings with parents and show their preparedness for reopening and then announce the dates. Many schools will plan the in-person classes phase-wise with standards V to VII initially, followed by the primary section in the second phase. Principal of C P Goenka International School, Rashmi Gupta, said that they are awaiting an official notification from the state government regarding the reopening of schools. “We will ask for parents’ consent and provide hybrid classes. A few want to send their children and others want to wait till they are vaccinated,” she added. Gupta said the school had started offline classes for standard VIII onwards and Covid protocols and hybrid models were in place which will continue. Aruna Gulunjkar, principal of PDEA English Medium School in Kharadi, said that they had an in-person parent-teachers meeting on Friday where parents were interested in sending their children to school. “Almost 70% of the parents attended the meeting. The campus sanitization work is going on. All parents before attending the school had a campus visit. They were happy when they saw the cleaning work. They appreciated the efforts of the school management and agreed to send their wards to school,” she added. There are over 1.3 crore students studying in classes 1 to VII in Maharashtra whereas 5.12 lakh teachers are teaching in this section. There had been a growing chorus from school teachers, educators and activists for reopening of primary schools to compensate for the learning loss incurred during the past 18 months of online teaching. Principal of the Orbis School, Nalini Samuel, said that since they were a centre for the CBSE Std X and XII board exams they will not hold any physical classes in school in December. Parents of some schools said they were concerned and would wait for their children to be vaccinated. Principal of Podar International School in Ambegaon, Anagha Gholap, said their school is prepared and has a meticulous process for all safety measures. “We are planning a few bridge courses to enable students to tackle learning gaps and get acquainted with physical school once again. We are planning to reopen for all classes from Std I onwards,” she added. Orchids The International School in Kharadi was also planning to reopen. With students’ safety and security always a prime concern, schools are taking up precautionary measures ahead of the reopening. Principal Unnati Raut said there will be different dates for standards I to IV with students of Std III and IV coming in first followed by the rest. Principal of the Sanskriti School in Bhukum, Damini Joshi, said that they have been conducting hybrid classes for students from stds VIII to XII. “We are excited to welcome back our younger children. To begin with, we will hold a meeting with PTA representatives and show them our preparedness. We will seek consent from parents who wish to send their children for physical classes. Depending on the outcome of the exercise with the parents, we will start conducting hybrid classes for our younger children as well,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/primary-classes-to-begin-in-phases-with-parents-consent-hybrid-mode/articleshow/87938751.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Thakkar was arrested after his name cropped up during the police investigations in the case in April. “Thakkar was granted bail earlier by a lower court. But he had hidden some facts from the court. Thakkar had approached the sessions court that had rejected his bail but he didn’t reveal it in the lower court. He also hid the fact that section 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act was removed from the complaint,” said advocate Anil Desai, district government pleader. “The lower court cancelled its bail after the facts were brought to its notice. Thakkar had applied for a stay on the bail cancellation but that too was rejected,” Desai added. Thakkar, who worked at a Covid centre of a private hospital, was named by another accused Krunal Patel during the investigations. Thakkar was accused of sourcing the remdesivir from the Covid centre and selling it to Krunal. Krunal then sold the remdesivir injections to the needy people for a high price. The cops had arrested two doctors and two male nurses in the case and six teams were also formed to investigate the complaint in detail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/court-cancels-bail-of-doctor-accused-of-remdesivir-black-marketing/articleshow/87938241.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Work on setting up the check posts at Karepalya and Budipadaga in the Punajanur division started last week. It will be manned by forest department staff round the clock. The check posts will have beds, a small kitchen and a toilet for the staff. The forest department has converted the container home to check posts, built like a bus using iron, steel and wood for a routine beat system that is weather friendly. It is also air-conditioned. The department has provided electricity to the Karepalya container check post and ensured that solar-generated power supply for the Budipadaga check post. The department said these check posts are the first of their kind in the state. Officials told TOI that the department had spent Rs 5 lakh to build each container home check post, utilising the corporate social responsibility funds provided by the Bengaluru-based Vistara Finance Company. Speaking to TOI, deputy conservator of forests, B R Hills Tiger reserve, Santosh Kumar said that the department needs around Rs 15-20 lakh to build a permanent building structure for check posts. As the department is facing a funds crunch because of the pandemic, the department introduced this kind of check post, which also saves the time required to build a permanent structure. Moreover, it can be shifted to any location if there is a need in the reserve to manage department activities to check wildlife crimes and other illegal activities. Currently, at least two department officials can stay in each check post, ensuring all safety for the staff from wild animal attacks, said the officer. The forest department must strictly deploy its staff at these check-posts round the clock. It must provide all facilities for the staff, said Punajanur Doreswamy, a wildlife activist in Chamarajanagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mobile-container-check-posts-soon-in-biligiri-tiger-reserve/articleshow/87937749.cms||---

The accused carried out the theft during the busy Diwali season when business was at its peak. Sources said that the cops arrested 19-year-old Umang Juvarda after receiving a tip-off that he was selling stolen electronic items in the market. Police recovered stolen items worth Rs 3.20 lakh including ten mobile phones, one hard disk and a smartwatch from the accused. Police said that Juvarda was working at the dispatch godown of Flipkart. Around 150 delivery boys are working at the e-commerce company’s three dispatch godowns in Rajkot. The accused was working at the Vavdi dispatch centre for the last one and half months. The delivery boys pick up the parcels and deliver them on the assigned route. Three to four delivery boys are assigned the same route, cops said. Juvarda used to steal mobile and other electronics items from the stacks of parcels. As more than one person was assigned on the same route, it became who carried out the theft, especially during the Diwali season. Juvarda also used to get bills of the parcel which helped in selling the stolen goods easily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/e-comm-deliveryman-held-for-theft-in-rajkot/articleshow/87938543.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||‘Adequate samples for genomic sequence essential’||PUNE: States registering low number of tests should ensure “intelligent testing” strategies and send samples of those returning from foreign countries as well as of people suffering from reinfection and breakthrough infections for genomic sequencing in the wake of the likely emergence of a new Covid variant, said the director of National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujeet Singh. He said on Friday the states had been told to be vigilant and ramp up testing though the country had not reported any cases of the new variant, having a large number of mutations in the spike protein region of the virus. “As of now, there is a dip in both daily new cases and active cases across the country. Cases are (mainly) being reported only from Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (fewer cases from the rest of states). Still, the states need to continue with testing and check for trends of ARI/SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) or any respiratory cases and conduct tests focused on these areas. A low level of cases does not mean fewer tests,” he said. Dr Singh, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said all states should send adequate samples, representative of geographical areas of sentinel sites and the focus should now be on cases reported from international travel, breakthrough infections and re-infections. “States have been directed to send more samples for genomic sequencing,” he said. Currently, 37 sites of INSACOG (a multi-laboratory, multi-agency, Pan-India network to monitor genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2) are carrying out genomic sequencing. Of them, 10 are central INSACOG labs. “We have enough facilities, but not enough samples are being sent. The states have to ensure that adequate representation of samples is sent, depending on the population and active cases,” he said. Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang told TOI that at this moment it was known that B1.1529 had a constellation of mutations in the spike protein and that was worrying. “It has been found in Africa and Hong Kong, indicating that it may be widespread. But until we know more about the clinical findings in infected individuals, and particularly how it behaves in vaccinated individuals, we shall not be able to assess the threat this new variant might pose,” she said. Kang said besides tracking travellers from the affected regions, states should keep a watch on any cluster of cases and keep sequencing all such samples. “For new variants, we need to wait and evaluate, and for this, testing, sequencing, careful data collection and linkage across clinical, vaccination and sequence data is a must.” She said currently all vaccines were effective on the existing Delta variants, but just a bit less than that against Alpha and ancestral variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/adequate-samples-for-genomic-sequence-essential/articleshow/87938772.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Dirt poor: Delhi air among worst four||NEW DELHI: The air quality slipped into the “severe” category again on Friday after staying in the “very poor” range over the past week. The weather conditions hint at no major improvements over the next two days. Calm winds, low daytime temperature and variable wind directions led to accumulation of local pollutants, which worsened the air quality. With an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 406, Delhi was among only four cities — Faridabad, Muzaffarnagar and Siwan — that were in the “severe” category. Track the pollution level in your cityWeather analysts said the air quality began worsening overnight as low wind speed and a drop in mercury didn’t allow the required ventilation of local pollutants. As there were only 274 instances of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, which contributed to 8% of the city’s overall PM2.5, local pollution sources were to blame for the bad air, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). With low visibility during the afternoon, Delhi also experienced a second episode of smog-related opacity. “Airport wind data showed calm winds till the evening. Some light wind from the east was observed at a speed of 5-7kmph. Visibility at Safdarjung airport was 300-500m in shallow to moderate fog/smog till 10am. It improved marginally to 800-1,000m and remained the same till evening. After the November 11-13 smog, this was the second time such poor visibility conditions were reported at the airport,” said RK Jenamani, senior weather scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). The minimum temperature on Friday was 11 degrees Celsius against 9.7 degrees a day earlier. “A feeble western disturbance had approached the western Himalayas, leading to a drop in wind speeds and variation in direction. Due to this, ventilation was very low. Low temperature makes the air heavy, so pollutants are held better. All such conditions worsen the air quality. There could be some improvement on November 29,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. Central Pollution Control Board data showed that PM2.5 and PM10 started to spike from Friday midnight and kept increasing till evening. The PM2.5 levels reached 244.9 microgames per cubic metres at 5pm. According to SAFAR, AQI might improve slightly, but would remain in the upper end of “very poor” category despite local surface winds likely to increase slightly for the next two days, which would increase dispersion of pollutants. From November 29, a significant improvement in AQI was expected due to high wind speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dirt-poor-delhi-air-among-worst-four/articleshow/87938833.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Maharashtra added 852 cases and 34 deaths compared with 50 on Thursday, taking the total cases to 66.3 lakh and deaths to 1,40,891. There was a dip of 1,234 cases in the cumulative tally due to reconciliation as duplicate entries were deleted. While cases in Mumbai increased from 174 on Thursday to 230 on Friday, the weekly rolling infection rate dropped another decimal point to 0.02%. The growth rate in the city, which has registered over 7.6 lakh cases and 16,322 deaths since March 2020, was 0.06% in September. A senior BMC official said the daily positivity rate for antigen tests is close to zero while the RT-PCR positivity rate is around 1%. As per the BMC’s update, the daily positivity rate on Friday was 0.66%, with 34,690 tests conducted. The number of sealed buildings is 15, with the number of people under home quarantine (37,110) back to August levels before restrictions on train travel were eased.  State government officials said districts have been asked to ensure testing in accordance with World Health Organisation norms of 140 tests/million so that any surge in cases doesn’t go undetected. Active cases in the state and the city dropped further to 8,106 in the state, of which 2,343 were in Mumbai. “Most of the new cases are being treated at home,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-cases-deaths-dip-citys-wkly-rolling-infection-rate-falls/articleshow/87939327.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Task force advises precautions for students with special needs||PUNE: Special needs schools should reopen with full precautions in place, the state's paediatric Covid-19 task force said on Friday. However, parents of high-risk children may decide about sending their wards to school only after full vaccination, the members added. There are 1,600 special needs schools in Maharashtra, including grant and non-grant schools, with nearly 65,000 boarders and day scholars. “The teachers may face challenges because students may have difficulty understanding and following Covid appropriate behaviour. Schools are advised to take extra precautions while overseeing their care,” senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, member of the state's paediatric Covid task force, said. Omprakash Deshmukh, commissioner for persons with disabilities in Maharashtra, said, “We have sent a proposal to the government and sought orders on reopening of educational institutes. Our social justice department has sent the file to the public health department and a decision is expected from Mantralaya.” He said they were conducting online education for all these children just like the school education department. Schools working in the field are awaiting government orders to reopen. Mangal Wankhade, principal of a school for visually impaired children for girls in Alandi, said, “We are awaiting government orders to reopen the residential school which runs classes I to VIII. There are 64 girls from various places who stay here and attend the special school. We awaiting instructions from the social welfare department. However, the remaining 29 students are in Stds IX and X attend regular school which has already begun,” Wankhade said. Sadhana Godbole, who runs the 21-year-old Prasanna Autism Centre, said they have decided not to open the school and only focus on therapies for now. “We used to have a school structure. But instead of regular classes, we had levels. It is very hard for these students to keep wearing masks at all times or listen to all the instructions. We sought views from the parents a week ago. But, we insisted on the students being dropped and picked up from school. Since most parents are working, only 10 said it was possible,” she added. Chandrakant Bhosale, retired principal of the Poona School and Home for Blind, also said it will be hard for children with special needs to maintain social distance, or avoid close contact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-advises-precautions-for-students-with-special-needs/articleshow/87938787.cms||Umesh Isalkar

She said there is no clarity on the findings in the report and the government should make this report public. She has also decided to launch the next leg of her strike seeking action against those who were involved in the “illegal adoption” of her child. This protest will begin on World Human Rights Day on December 10 and will continue till those responsible for separating her from her child are brought to book. This includes her father, Jayachandran, Kerala state council for child welfare general secretary Shiju Khan and child welfare committee chairperson N Sunanda. Anupama said she has sought the copy of the department-level inquiry report prepared by T V Anupama, the director of women and child development department. She has given a letter to health minister Veena George seeking the copy of this report. “Initially, it was said that the report had vindicated my charges and that there was proof against Shiju Khan for violating rules to fast-track the adoption,” she said. However, now there are reports that the department-level probe report has exonerated Khan and Sunanda from all the charges. “There are claims that I had voluntarily signed on a notarized document that allowed the child to be taken away from me. I have clarified this many times. The notarized document says that I had visited the office of the notary and given my signature. But the reality was that the notary had come to my house to get my signature. It is a forged document which has been presented before the authorities now,” Anupama said. The government should publish the report. It is not a secret document. People have to know. All fake reports will stop once the official document is published, she said. She said she had spoken in detail to the director of women and child development department about the torment she had suffered at home. “I expected that they would recommend some action under the Domestic Violence Act,” Anupama said. She said she has lost faith that the government would initiate disciplinary action against Khan and Sunanda. “The minister had said that she was yet to see the report. However, the CPM district secretary, Anavoor Nagappan is already claiming that the CWC and KSCCW had done nothing wrong,” Anupama said. She also expressed concern over the silence of the chief minister in this issue. Anupama said she would approach the Union government if the state government refuses to take action against the accused. She has also complained to CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechuri and also to the state police complaints authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anupama-seeks-legal-action-against-officials-to-launch-stir/articleshow/87938770.cms||---

Shockingly, it is the third time that the accused has been arrested by the police is connection with sexual abuse cases against school students. He had been acquitted in the first case. The arrested has been identified as Vallikunnu native P Ashraf, 53, who allegedly assaulting a boy student inside the school. The accused was first arrested in 2012 while he was working in a school near Parappanangadi under IPC section 377 but he was acquitted by the court. According to Childline authorities, he later got transferred to a school under Karipur police station limits and was arrested under Pocso again in 2019. He was currently under bail in connection with the case when he has been arrested again for same offence in his current school. Former state child rights commission member Adv J Sandhya said that it was a serious matter that a teacher accused of child sexual abuse has allegedly repeated the same offence after being back in another school. “The state government should look into the matter very seriously. A policy decision should be taken immediately to ensure that teachers who have been chargesheeted in Pocso cases should not be allowed to be in positions where they can closely interact with children. They should be moved to office jobs under education department,” she added.

In a related development, chief judicial magistrate RJ Tambe cancelled the non-bailable warrant issued against Singh in this case on October 26. Singh came to the Thane nagar police station at around 10.45 am and left at around 7 pm after recording his statement with the SIT. The FIR in the case was registered based on a complaint by Ketan Tanna (54), a bookie. Tanna alleged that when Singh was Thane police commissioner between January 2018 and February 2019, the accused extorted Rs 1.25 crore from him by summoning him to the office of the anti-extortion cell and threatening to frame him in serious criminal cases. The accused also extorted over Rs 3 crore from his friend and alleged bookie Sonu Jalan in the same way, he alleged. Singh had gone on leave six months ago and had subsequently absconded before landing in Mumbai on Thursday. He gave his statement to the Kandivili crime branch on Thursday in connection with another extortion case. Policemen were deployed at the periphery of the police station as the tehsil office and other government offices have a common entry to the complex. Since May, Singh had not reported to work after he was shunted out in March from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in the wake of his allegations of corruption against ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh. It was around 3 pm that Singh went to the Thane court and through his legal team moved an application to cancel the non-bailable warrant issued against him by the chief judicial magistrate R J Tambe on October 26. The court cancelled his non-bailable warrant on certain conditions, which include Rs 15,000 as surety, among other conditions. After that, he came back to Thane nagar police station at around 4 pm and was there till 7 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/param-bir-records-statement-at-thana-court-cancels-nbw/articleshow/87940507.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 37 lakh get 1st shot in 11 days, two-fold rise in daily count||PUNE: District collectors’ involvement, promotional activities and special campaigns have led to significant improvement in daily vaccination count in Maharashtra in the second-half of November. About 37 lakh (17%) of 2.23 crore unvaccinated people (till November 14) were motivated and convinced to get their first dose in the next 11 days — from November 15 to November 26. The daily average of Covid shots administered in the state has also gone up to 8 lakh doses per day from the average of three to four lakh in the first-half of November. “We have administered more than one crore doses in November, which initially looked very difficult to achieve, following a big slump in the uptake owing to festivities and the second wave abating,” said state immunisation officer Sachin Desai. Desai said, “We have vaccinated 37 lakh people in the last 11 days, who had not come forward to take the first shot with the help of district collectors, promotional activities and campaigns like Har Ghar Dastak, which is a big achievement. We aim to vaccinate the remaining 20% of people within a month.” Of the remaining 1.86 crore unvaccinated population in Maharashtra, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Solapur, Nanded and Ahmednagar districts collectively have 42% (unvaccinated) population. “From offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students to motivate the unvaccinated, we have started going the extra mile to woo citizens to take the Covid shot. We are using creative methods like organising street plays and providing doorstep counselling to win citizens over in favour of vaccination in addition to deploying routine educational tools like posters, hoardings and mass media tools,” Desai said. In Chandrapur, the civic body is offering expensive electronic luxury and home appliances under a lucky draw to ensure that the 39,000 unvaccinated citizens come forward to get the first shot. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite said, “An LED TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine and 10 mixer grinders would be awarded to citizens through the lucky draw initiative. This move is certainly improving the vaccination numbers in Chandrapur.” Health activists stressed scaling up efforts to educate people about taking both the doses. “People are currently more focused on reclaiming income sources. They need to be not only counselled but also provided doorstep vaccination,” said health activist Sanjay Dabhade. The state has till now (up to November 26) administered 11,07,87,972 doses, fully vaccinating 3.8 crore people and giving at least one shot to 7.27 crore of its eligible population. The state has a total of 9.14 crore above 18 population, eligible to get the Covid shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/37l-get-1st-shot-in-11-days-two-fold-rise-in-daily-count/articleshow/87938800.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Thane||91% of those who participated in Thane sero survey had Covid antibodies||THANE: More than 90% of Thane’s residents who participated in the first-ever sero survey had antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, said a Thane Municipal Corporation report on Friday. Of the 1,571 samples analysed, 1,425 had the antibodies. Mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “Although the sero positivity is 90.6%, we will continue our surveillance through testing and tracing as the virus is still mutating.” Apart from the BMC, Thane is the first civic corporation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to have conducted a sero survey. Mumbai has conducted five sero surveys so far, with the last conducted three months ago which showing that 86% of those surveyed had antibodies. The TMC collected samples from each of the nine wards as well as from buildings and slum pockets in October. Around 22% of those surveyed were minors in the 6-18 age group. “This was done to assess their susceptibility in case of a third wave,” said a TMC official. Residents from dense localities such as Uthalsar and Lokmanya Savarkar Nagar showed higher levels of antibodies compared to those living in tony areas of Majiwada-Manpada that have comparatively lower population density. A gender-based analysis showed that more females (92%) had antibodies as compared to their male counterparts (90%). A similar trend was noted in Delhi and Mumbai’s third sero survey where 85% males and 88% females were found to be sero positive. Antibody levels in those vaccinated with even a single dose was higher (94%) than those who hadn’t taken one (90%). Municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said vaccination coverage during the survey period was 63.95% (one dose) and 36.5% (both the doses). Around 5.2% showed negative sero prevalence due to decay in antibodies, said Dr Sharma. An age-wise analysis showed that maximum sero positivity was observed in the 30-45 age group, which is also the most productive in terms of jobs. The least levels were observed in the 6-17 age group. Slum areas registered lower sero prevalence perhaps due to vaccine hesitancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/91-of-those-who-participated-in-thane-sero-survey-had-antibodies/articleshow/87939339.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Prafulla Pawar, registrar of the university has directed the departments that if there are less than 50% of the total strength of students and if the course is not economically viable, the department must not run it. The circular further says that the decision was taken in the management council meeting and the head of the departments must take action. The university allows departments to run various certificate, diploma and degree courses on a self-financing basis. “It is expected that the fees obtained from students will sustain the course. However, it has been seen that there are many courses with very little response, right from the application stage itself which means the enrolment will be even poorer. We have yet to get a compiled list of such courses,” a senior official from the management council said. To avoid profuse under-utilisation of resources, the management council has sought the closure of such courses. “The departments must also realise that if the response is so poor, it means either the course is not relevant to the students or the course is not in demand any more,” said another management council member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/varsity-to-scrap-courses-with-less-than-50-pupils/articleshow/87938802.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 7 poaching suspect tribals allege torture||CHANDRAPUR: Durgapur police in the district have on Friday registered an offence against foresters attached to Chandrapur range for alleged inhuman torture of tribals, detained on charges of poaching, from Chicholi village. Seven tribals were allegedly beaten black and blue on soles of their foot with baton and were also given electric shocks during the torture on two consecutive days, claims a complaint by the tribals to the police. Forest officials, however, maintain that while investigating a poaching case, a team had taken the suspects to the village for recovery of evidence, when the members were mobbed. A tribal organization Ulgulan is up in arms against the alleged atrocities meted to the villagers and has submitted a memorandum to collector and superintendent of police seeking dismissal of those involved in the torture. According to the complainant tribals, a team of around nine foresters had picked up Aakash Chandekar, Ishwar Ramteke, Hanuman Asutkar and Sandeep Asutkar on Wednesday afternoon from Chicholi village, located on the fringe of Tadoba buffer, on the suspicion of being involved in poaching of spotted deer with the help of electrified wire in their farm. The foursome were taken to range office and then to Rambagh nursery. They were brutally thrashed with plastic baton and were given electric shocks with the help of battery at both the places, claims the complaint. The complaint also alleged that during interrogation, suspect Chandekar was made to strip and the foresters even threatened him to give shock to his private parts with a live wire. The accused were allowed to return home in the same evening, only to be summoned next day (Thursday morning) and again subjected to similar inhuman torture, reads the complaint, adding three more suspects — Sandeep Nehare, Mangesh Asutkar and Rakesh Sao — were also brought to Rambagh and were beaten and given electric shocks. The tribals have named forest guards Gulab Yadav and Vijay Bhimanwar and their colleagues as the culprits. Tables turned against the foresters after they released Ishwar Ramteke, Hanuman Asutkar and Sandeep Asutkar on Thursday. In the evening, a forest team took the remaining accused to the village for recovery of evidence. However, by then the trio released earlier had reached the village and narrated the torture to the villagers. As the forest team entered the village, a mob gheraoed it and started questioning the members about the torture. There are also reports of manhandling of foresters by the irked villagers. After the foresters trapped in the village called for help, RFO Chandrapur, Rahul Karekare, informed Durgapur police and rushed to the place with a posse of cops. By that time, tribal leader Raju Zode too had also reached the village. Durgapur PSO Swapnil Dhule pacified the angry mob and carried out medical examination of the tribals alleged to have been beaten up by the foresters. Based on the medical examination, offence under sections 323, 324 and 34 of IPC has been registered against forester Yadav and Bhimanwar, and their unidentified colleagues on Friday. Chief conservator of forest, Chandrapur, NR Pravin, claimed the villagers turned upon foresters who had taken the suspects to the village for recovery of evidence. Angry mob manhandled a couple of forest guards, he claimed. The mob surrounded the forest team and prevented them from discharging their duty. It was only after RFO Karekar reached there with a police team, the forest team could be rescued, he said. He also ratified that cops have registered offence against the foresters for torture, and maintained he is going to seek report about entire matter from RFO Chandrapur. He also ruled out forest department filing any counter-complaint against the villagers. Meanwhile, Zode termed the torture of tribals as horrible and inhuman and through a memorandum submitted to the collector and SP demanded dismissal of those involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/7-poaching-suspect-tribals-allege-torture/articleshow/87938291.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Trichy||Students can now report sexual crimes through WhatsApp in Karur||Karur: Amidst growing number of incidences of sexual crimes against children coming to light, the district administration launched the initiative ‘Nimirndhu Nil, Thunindhu Sol’ to dispel fear among school girls to report sexual assault, here on Friday. Students were also explained how to seek assistance from the district administration on WhatsApp by just sending a ‘Hi’ message to 8903331098.As part of the scheme, a questionnaire seeking personal details including name, class, school, address, parents’ mobile number and information on sexual abuse on them or their friends in school or near their houses was given to the students. The questionnaire also has a question if they faced any abuse through social media and mobile phones besides asking them if they need any counselling to clear their confusions.Unlike previous attempts to sensitize minor girls about sexual crimes, perpetrators and existing laws to protect them, the new scheme took a novel approach with the district administration led by collector Dr T Prabhushankar meeting school children and striking a conversation with them.The district administration has enumerated 26,085 children from classes 9 to 12 in 201 schools in the district. Instead of making it as a school education driven programme, as the children may not open up, the district administration chose 20 officers from different government departments to head each one team. Each team will cover five schools daily for the next two days.“We wanted to reach out to girls and instil courage in them. We targeted the most vulnerable population among them,” collector Prabhushankar told TOI. It may be pointed out that a Class 12 girl from a school in Karur committed suicide alleging sexual harassment on November 19. She did not reveal the identity of the perpetrator of the crime.The teams will distribute a handbook with the messages in Tamil elaborately discussing recent incidents of child sexual abuse in a school in Coimbatore, good and bad touches, perpetrators, ways to report the incidences, bring the abusers before the law and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.“The objective of the scheme is to ensure safety of girls. If they share any information, the secrecy will be maintained. In case of sexual offences, action will be taken,” said the collector, adding that their teams covered 64 schools reaching out to more than 10,000 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/students-can-now-report-sexual-crimes-through-whatsapp-in-karur/articleshow/87939340.cms||---

The two then decided to end their lives and consumed poison in a 'suicide pact' on Thursday evening. The girl was declared dead when she was taken to a local hospital while the boy succumbed a few hours later. Police said that they consumed poison near the fire station in Saharanpur and passers-by who saw them writhing in pain raised an alarm. Piyush Dixit, SHO of Qutubsher police station, said, "It is still unclear how the two belonging to villages Sarwasana and Nansob - which are several kilometres apart - met each other. They were neither in the same school nor had any common friend as informed by the girl’s parents who took her body without letting us conduct a post-mortem.” The young couple, who had been seeing each other for a year, belonged to poor families, police said. “We couldn't talk to the boy in detail as the doctors had advised us not to question him. He just managed to inform us that the two were in love and their families were not accepting their union,” the SHO said, adding that no one has been booked so far as the two families are yet to lodge an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/teenage-couple-from-different-faiths-consumes-poison-dies-after-family-refuses-union/articleshow/87938019.cms||Ishita Mishra

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought a response from the SEC on the public interest litigation filed by B Ramkumar Adityan, an advocate from Tuticorin district. The petitioner stated that during the rural local body elections conducted in 2019 and in the recent rural local body elections in nine districts, the SEC, instead of uploading the nomination and affidavit of all the candidates, had only uploaded an abstract about the candidates. He stated that the abstract does not have details such as criminal cases, educational qualification, assets of the candidates. Voters have the right to know the full particulars of the candidates who would be representing them. Such a right to get information about the candidate is a natural right flowing from the concept of democracy and is an integral part of the Constitution. He stated that despite ECI directions, the SEC was not following the system where the candidates should declare criminal cases registered against them. He stated that the directions of the ECI should be complied with by the SEC in all local body elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-implement-eci-guidelines-on-criminal-cases/articleshow/87938806.cms||---

He said educational institutions and firms should not cover up complaints and incidents of sexual offences against children and women employees. Authorities should act promptly and appropriately, he said. The government would set up four more special courts for Pocso cases in addition to the 16 now, he said. “I will protect you not only as a chief minister, but also as a father,” said Stalin, sending across a clear message to mark the international day for elimination of violence against women. He urged the victims not to take any extreme step like ending their lives. Instead, they should fight to bring the perpetrators before the law of the land, he said. Noting that the government was giving utmost importance to the protection of children and women, he said it would take action against culprits irrespective of their position, social standing and influence. The state child policy 2021 was launched with a view to putting an end to crimes against women and children, he said. Only very few incidents are getting reported and majority of them are being covered up. “We cannot stop this until we see women as fellow human beings and treat them as equals,” he said. The CM said he would do everything possible to bring the perpetrators before the court of law to punish them. Administrations of educational institutions and firms should not cover up any such incident to safeguard the reputation of the institutions, he said. He also advised parents and family members of the victims to stop thinking that society would speak ill about the victims. Such thinking will deny justice to the victims and putting them through psychological problems, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cm-vows-to-protect-girls-like-a-father/articleshow/87938810.cms||---

Party general secretary and prominent Brahmin face Satish Chandra Mishra will now start touring all the 86 reserved seats aiming to swing the crucial votes in BSP’s favour. “Mishra ji is expected to start touring these constituencies in the coming days. Mayawati had recently held a meeting of the presidents of all the 86 reserved constituencies and chalked out a strategy for them. She said that SC Mishra and his team will be given the responsibility of reaching out to the upper castes, especially Brahmins, in these seats. This round of campaigning is as per this plan,” said a party insider. BSP’s performance in reserved seats, other than in 2007 when it won 206 seats and came to power with full majority, has been below average because of the vote split. The party’s best performance on reserved seats was in 1999 when it won five out of 17 reserved seats, and then repeated the feat in 2007. “This time, we are focusing on both segments in these constituencies to win maximum of them,” said a party worker. While details of the campaign are still being worked out, Mishra’s wife Kalpana has also started holding meetings of women while a Yuva Sammelan has been planned at Balamau on November 28. Giving prominence to OBCs in the party, Mayawati has appointed Manvendra Azad Maurya as the state general secretary. Maurya, who till recently was heading the Azad Bharat Party (Democratic), had recently merged his party with BSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-plans-special-campaign-to-clinch-max-reserved-seats/articleshow/87939348.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The entire work is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. The members of the committee discussed various issues pertaining to the development of the airport and providing various amenities to passengers. Dr M A Aleem, a member of the committee appealed to include Trichy International Airport as one of the embarkation boarding point for Haj pilgrims from Tamil Nadu.The embarkation point for Haj 2022 has been reduced to 10 from 21 by including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Srinagar. No choice has been given to pilgrims for selecting the nearest economical embarkation point for the people in Tamil Nadu. For Haj pilgrims of Tamil Nadu, Kochi will be the embarkation point. It is difficult to travel to Kochi for their Haj flight from Tamil Nadu. So, at least Chennai should be retained as the boarding point for the Haj 2022 pilgrimage, he added.He also stated that the Trichy- Pudukottai- Ramanathapuram national highway 210 is passing too close to the airport runway, which is highly risky in many ways. So, the height of that road level should be reduced or a bypass road or an underpass should be established at an earliest, Aleem said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-airport-expansion-work-to-be-completed-by-end-of-2022-mp/articleshow/87939343.cms||---

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Farmers pay tribute to protesters who died||THANJAVUR/MADURAI: Unmindful of the Prime Minister’s assurance to revoke the three contentious farm laws, farmers held protests across the delta as well as southern districts seeking repeal of the laws in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. They also sought withdrawal of the proposed electricity (amendment) bill, saying it would lead to privatisation of the power sector. The protests were held to mark one year of the farmer protests against the three farm acts and seeking legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP). Farmers from Thanjavur paid tributes to their mates who lost their lives in Delhi during the protests in the last one year. Farmers affiliated to Pazhavaru Ayakattar Association led by president Eraharam Swaminathan and Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, secretary of Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, gathered on an agricultural field in Thanjavur and lit candles recalling the sacrifice of the deceased. Vimalnathan appealed to the Union government to provide jobs to family members of the deceased farmers and a solatium of Rs 50 lakh to each family. Protests were also held in Madurai, Sivaganga, Dindigul and Theni. As part of the demonstration in Thanjavur, the farmers tied black flags on motor pump in agriculture fields opposing the draft Electricity Amendment Bill calling it anti-people. They claimed that the bill would pave the way for privatization of power production and distribution. Bills will have to be paid in advance to get services in such a situation, they added. A group of farmers led by S Vimalnathan will travel to Delhi to thank the farmers’ leaders in Delhi for making the Centre withdraw the three agricultural laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-pay-tribute-to-protesters-who-died/articleshow/87939347.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: One washed away in Trichy, fields submerged||TRICHY: One person was washed away in Thuraiyur while paddy fields were submerged after the tank at Keerambur village breached following the incessant rain that lashed Trichy district since early morning on Friday. Rainwater flooded the streets and houses in the village as the rainwater overflowed from the tank. District collector S Sivarasu and Thuraiyur MLA S Stalin Kumar inspected the situation in Big Bazaar Street, North Street, and residential areas. Rainwater also inundated paddy fields in Varadharajapuram. The collector instructed the authorities to set right the bunds of the tank and also drain floodwater from the streets. Mudslides occurred at several spots on the road leading to Pachamalai Hills near Thuraiyur disrupting vehicular traffic on the stretch. Forest officials speeded up the process of clearing the path using an earthmover. A resident of Gounder Street in Krishnapuram in Thuraiyur was washed away in the current on Keezharu canal. Fire and rescue services searched for him; but they failed to trace him till evening. Residential areas in Trichy city were inundated while several low-lying areas including Krishnaveni Nagar and Dobby Colony, which come under the 39th ward in the city corporation, witnessed waterlogging. Elsewhere in the central region, steady rainfall was experienced since early morning on Friday leaving several residential areas waterlogged and samba paddy fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, and Mayiladuthurai district submerged.

The way for BJP candidate Amrish Patel for the Dhule-cum-Nandurbar Local Authorities’ constituency was cleared after the official Congress nominee, Gaurav Vani, and three other independents withdrew their nominations on Friday, the last day for withdrawal of the nomination. Vani said he withdrew his nomination after such instructions from the party high command. He was supposed to contest on behalf of MVA coalition. “My feedback is that Congress and BJP has come to an understanding under which BJP has withdrawn its candidate against Satej Patil in Kolhapur seat and Congress has done in Dhule-cum-Nandurbar seat,” added Vani. Patel, a prominent political leader of the region, hails from Shirpur in Dhule. He joined BJP in 2019. He is the sitting MLC of that constituency and his present terms ends on January 1 next year. Minister of state for home and Kolhapur's guardian minister Satej Patil won the legislative council election for Kolhapur local bodies after BJP candidate Amal Mahadik withdrew his nomination. His win is being considered “historic” as the seat has never before been won unopposed. “We had the numbers on our side. The BJP withdrew because of some understanding at the state level,” said Satej. After withdrawing the candidature, Mahadik said he has done so upon the directions of state party president Chandrakant Patil. A few days ago, Chandrakant Patil had hinted that his party will think of electing candidates at five legislative council seats unopposed if Congress puts up the right proposal. Two seats in Mumbai have also been elected unopposed. The nominees of the BJP and the Shiv Sena have been elected unopposed for these two Mumbai seats. This apart, election will be held for the Akola-Washim-Buldhana local bodies seat between the BJP and the Shiv Sena and the Nagpur local bodies seat. State Congress chief Nana Patole told the media in Nagpur on Friday expressed confidence that the party nominee Ravindra Bhoyar will win the Nagpur local bodies seat. He is pitted against BJP leader and former minister Chandrashekar Bawankule. “There was no proposal from the BJP's side for the Nagpur seat. The Congress will definitely win the seat,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mlc-polls-cong-bjp-pull-out-unopposed-winners-in-4-seats/articleshow/87937331.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A city-based businessman Milind Kande and his family had planned a trip to Uttarakhand earlier this month, but changed it at the last moment. “We had planned a week-long trip from November 7. Our tour agent informed us about the sudden heavy rain and we then decided to change the destination to Rajasthan. It cost us extra money, but prior intimation from our agent, after we had asked for an alert in case of weather problem, helped,” Kande said. “A group of my clients was recently in Ranthambore and had plans to go on a tiger safari. However, heavy rains hit suddenly and they cancelled the plan and I had to work out the cancellation,” Nilesh Bhansali, the owner of a travel company and the director of Travel Agents Association of Pune, said. He added that with the weather patterns suddenly changing, every client now wanted to know the weather forecast during their travel time. “Just like making sure about the travel regulations, they want to know about the weather. We have to rely mainly on the internet to provide information to them. The workload on us due to this has increased,” he added. A representative of a travel agency said that weather patterns could only be predicted. Santosh Gupta, the owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays said weather queries had increased. “Two of my clients, who are set to go to Uttarakhand and Amritsar in December, have been asking me for regular weather updates. I have requested them to keep a check on it via Google and news channels. We cannot give a specific update to them and it is solely based on luck,” he said. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, told TOI that giving a forecast five to seven days in advance resulted in better accuracy. “If the forecast in given 3 days before a date, it is almost accurate and if given a day in advance, it is fully accurate. However, travellers book tickets well in advance. Giving an accurate forecast for very advance dates requires weathermen to depend on long range forecasts,” Kashyapi said. Travellers said agencies needed to be in constant touch with the IMD. “They can devise a system and be in touch with them for regular updates,” Sanjeev Kamble, a working professional, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travellers-tracking-weather-too-while-planning-trips/articleshow/87938817.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mayawati picks Uma Shankar Singh as party leader in House||LUCKNOW: A day after Mubarakpur MLA Shah Alam resigned as leader of legislative party and quit the party, BSP chief Mayawati replaced him with two-term MLA from Rasra, Uma Shankar Singh. Singh, who belongs to Ballia district, was disqualified during his first term by Governor Ram Naik for alleged violation of the Representation of the People Act after he was accused of taking tenders for road construction ever after being elected MLA. He successfully challenged the order in the Supreme Court and was eventually reinstated. On Saturday, BSP also boycotted Constitution Day celebrations across the country, which were organised either by the Centre or any of the state governments. The party chief said that neither the Centre nor state governments had any right to celebrate the day as they were clearly not following the Constitution in letter or spirit. “It has been years since the Constitution was drafted but even today, the provisions made in it by Dr BR Ambedkar for the weak and neglected sections of society, like reservation in education and government jobs etc, are still not benefitting those they were meant for,” Mayawati said, adding that people from such sections should be wary of all parties like the Samajwadi Party which in Parliament tore the bill on SC/ST reservation and then conspired to not let it pass. “Such parties can never actually do anything for the development or upliftment of such classes. The reservation quota for SC/ST and OBCs is lying unused in most departments because of which those who are being deprived of its benefits have been forced to protest. No arrangement has been made to provide reservation for them in private jobs and no government is willing to make a law on this,” she said. The former UP chief minister also said that laws meant to ensure progress and security of people of the various faiths who live in India were also not being implemented properly. Not just that, she said, poverty and inflation were also rising, the brunt of which was being borne by the poor and middle class people. “On Constitution Day, a year of the farmers’ protest was also completed. Recently, the Centre repealed the three contentious farm laws though this should have been done much earlier. The government should now accept the other demands of the farmers as well. The central and state governments should assess seriously whether they are genuinely following the constitution in letter and spirit. Our party believes that they are not,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-picks-uma-as-party-leader-in-house/articleshow/87939349.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V sought the government’s views on a petition filed by her mother through advocate R Gopan. The girl was an inmate of a children’s home at Neyyattinkara and was a first year VHSC student in an aided school nearby. The accused, who is a juvenile and brother of another inmate of the children’s home, began threatening the girl along with his relatives after being released on bail, the petition said. Though the management of a children’s home at Mavelikkara agreed to accommodate the girl, they asked her to obtain admission at a nearby school. The principal of the nearby government higher secondary school, upon knowing that the girl is a survivor in a Pocso case, denied admission by giving the lame excuse that there is no vacancy, the petitioner has alleged. A representation was filed before the director of vocational higher secondary education as well as to the secretary of general education department but no action has been taken by them yet, the girl’s mother has alleged.

---||Goa||Goa: Farmers expect losses from delayed cashew flowering||POINGUINIM: Feni distillers and cashew farmers across the state are sensing possible loss to their business because of unseasonal rains. They say that there could be reduced revenue from auction of the cashew orchards. “We are in the winter season. However due to the formation of low pressure in the Arabian Sea we get unseasonal rains which has an impact on cashew production,” said Dinesh Desai who is in this business since many years. He feels that the feni distillers and cashew farmers will suffer considerable loss as the production will decrease. Desai told TOI, “By this time the cashew trees should have bloomed with flowers. In a very few places flowering has just begun but now it all depends on how the climate plays its role. On the whole it will surely be a loss.” Agriculturist, Jayprakash Poinginker said, “By this time the winter should have set in but it is still raining and so the future of cashew production appears bleak. The weather too played havoc last year but at least then it was no loss no profit.” Zonal agriculture officer, Kirtiraj Naik Gaunkar said farmers will be affected due to weather changes resulting in unseasonal rain and that is not good for cashew as well the mango crop. He said that it could be a big loss for farmers and feni distillers. Excise inspector at Canacona, Chandranath Desai said that feni distillers will face a loss and the government too could see a drop in revenue collection as many distillers may hesitate to have regular auctions, seeing that the production could dip by 50-60%. Cashew, mango flowering will be delayed due to weather: Agri director Director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso said that with the current weather there will be a delay in flowering of cashews and mangoes as this is the period for both plants to flower. However he said that both the fruits will flower but will be delayed beyond the regular time which may affect production. He added that this was the third year of unseasonal rain and considering the loss in the crop yield, the department will ensure that farmers get some compensation through the Shetkari Adhar Nidhi scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/farmers-expect-losses-from-delayed-cashew-flowering/articleshow/87938957.cms||Albert Fernandes

Residents staged protests in many parts of the city like Packianathapuram and Sellur after their areas were flooded. The rain that began around 2pm on Thursday continued as intermittent showers throughout the night turning many roads slushy. The city’s already stretched garbage problem worsened further with waste from overflowing bins mixing with the mud making it difficult for pedestrians to walk on many inner roads. While Vandiyur and Madakulam tanks filled up, water from a tank near Koodal Nagar railway junction overflowed into the residential area. Kallandiri recorded the highest rainfall of 102 mm, Idayapatti 77 mm, Mettupatti 80 mm, Pulipatti 73 mm while Tallakulam, Viraganur and Madurai north had less than 50 mm. Rain in the catchments resulted in inflow to major dams going up drastically. Vaigai dam’s water level went up to 69.65 feet against its maximum level of 71 feet. Hence, PWD discharged 7,232 cusecs from on Friday. Out of this, 6,713 cusecs is being directly discharged into the river bed. People living along the banks of the river in the five southern districts have been asked to move to safer places.

---||India||Course on Indian knowledge system in engineering colleges soon||NEW DELHI: Engineering institutes will soon introduce an elective credit course on Indian knowledge system with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) commissioning a textbook to be prepared by a member of the faculty of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. The education ministry is also operationalising a portal where scientifically verified contents on the Indian knowledge system will be made available. The validation and content development for the portal has been entrusted to faculties from Indian Institutes of Technology at Kharagpur and Indore. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairperson, AICTE, said once the textbook is made available around December, institutions can use it to offer the Indian knowledge system as an elective subject for its engineering programmes. “It has been there for universities and colleges who wanted to offer, but as a non-credit course. We will make it gradually an elective credit-course. Textbooks are not available. So, we are writing a book on the Indian knowledge system through an IIM Bangalore faculty, professor B Mahadevan,” he said. As per a senior official at the ministry of education, once the credit transfer system among higher education institutions becomes fully functional along with the facility of the academic bank of credits, “other institutions, if they wish, can offer this as an elective in non-engineering programmes as well.” “When we are allowing psychology and economics, why not the Indian knowledge system as a credit course? The book is getting ready and is likely to be released by next month,” said Sahasrabudhe. The portal on the Indian knowledge system is in a nascent stage and when ready the contents will be ready made material for institutions. The AICTE head said: “We are also initiating a process to validate the claims on the Indian knowledge system and put them on a portal.”The ideas will be investigated to see if they can be taken forward in present times, if they can further research and can lead to creation of things useful to mankind."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/course-on-indian-knowledge-system-in-engineering-colleges-soon/articleshow/87940534.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

Geographically said to be the largest in SCB, Ward No. VIII (Bolarum) has over 60% space covered with spic-and-span defence installations. But the civilian areas, plagued by congested roads, bad drains and erratic water supply, are now crying out for a status upgrade. A merger with GHMC is top on the list for most.  It is home to the magnificent Rashtrapati Nilayam, official retreat of the President, country’s first citizen. But for citizens in the ward, a home across its border in the rapidly growing civic ward of Alwal is a better deal any day. For three decades, the ‘Welfare Association for Residents of Saraswatinagar (popularly known as WARS) Colony in this ward has been fighting a losing battle over drainage problem. “This issue has been represented several times to SCB CEO and Union defence ministry, but it is still pending,” said WARS assistant secretary Sai Baba.While locals do not tire of referring to the rich past of the area, it is the uncertain future which haunts their present. The CSI Holy Trinity Church was built here in 1847 by Queen Victoria with her personal fund and this was later visited by Queen Elizabeth-II in 1983. While once upon a time double-decker buses plied the streets, the historic charm has lost its sheen for many locals struggling to navigate congested roads. “Till today nothing has been done either by LMA or ministry of defence (MoD) on road closures,” said former ward member J Lokanatham. He, however, said that most roads have been repaired and a new community hall, said to be the largest G+1 hall in the SCB, was coming up. But for locals stuck with old buildings in civil bazars, the path to a new one is arduous. “I got clearance from SCB CEO to mutate properties in civil bazar areas, but officials wanted documentary evidence. We do not have these documents as they were built in British-era and cannot preserve them over more than six decades,” said K Prashant, a resident of Risala Bazar. Lokanatham added: “I got permission for mutation to build G+2 structures after repeated requests. But it is going at a snail’s pace. I support merger of civil areas with GHMC for better administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rich-past-but-this-ward-in-scb-seeks-a-better-future/articleshow/87938829.cms||Sunil Mungara

The three-member commission will now prepare a report on the death of four Disha rape and murder case accused in the alleged encounter at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. On the final day of the hearing, the commission asked the state counsel why police did not immediately arrest the accused despite lorry owner identifying them on the night of November 28, 2019. While examining evidence related to identification and arrest of the four accused — Md Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and C Chennakeshavalu — the commission spent considerable time on the evidence of lorry owner P Srinivas Reddy to ascertain if there was any illegality in arrests as alleged by relatives. Reddy stated he was called to RGI Airport PS at 9.30pm on November 28, confirmed the truck was his, identified Arif and others, and his statement was recorded between 11pm and 12am. Subsequently, Reddy said he alone arrived at Arif’s house around 4 am, took him to Gudigandla to show the houses of other three, dropped him back at Jaklair and returned to Hyderabad at around 7 am. Subsequently, he met Shadnahar CI and as per his request showed him Arif’s house in Jaklair and the accused were apprehended subsequently in the afternoon, and later arrested by ACP V Surender at 5 pm in Shadnagar PS. Panel also raised doubts over Reddy’s claim that he was an illiterate. The state counsel maintained that police followed all procedures at the time of arrest and the arrest memo has signatures of the accused and family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-concludes-hearing-police-fate-hangs-on-report/articleshow/87938836.cms||Mahesh Buddi

She said that people had become more aware of their duties towards the country. Speaking at the inauguration of the newly constructed income tax building in Lucknow, where CM Yogi Adityanath was also present, she said the state government has set several examples of good governance, the result of which is before everyone. Yogi said UP’s revenue has almost doubled in the past 4.5 years. He said PM Narendra Modi had initiated several programmes towards simplification of the taxation process, because of which people were finding it easy to pay taxes. He said that the increased revenue was being used for all round development of the state. The government was using the funds for various development works and there was a positive change in the lives of people because of this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-has-set-an-example-of-good-governance-nirmala/articleshow/87939356.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was detained by traffic police at Sovabazar crossing when he was cycling back to his Sinthee home on Thursday night. The bicyclist was booked by Jorabagan Traffic Guard cops after a breathalyzer test. He was later handed over to Burtolla Police for necessary medical check-up. The detention comes barely a day after Kolkata Traffic Police announced it will subject cyclists to breathalyzer tests, a step that has not been probably taken anywhere in the country so far. “It was around 10.30pm on Thursday when we came across this cyclist. He was initially bewildered by our action and kept asking why he was being taken to the police station. But we explained to him that rules will remain the same for anyone using the road. The Burtolla police drew up a petty case against him. In all, we checked 11 bicyclists across the Jorabagan Guard jurisdiction. All others appeared to be clean,” explained an officer from Jorabagan Traffic Guard. Across other guards, around 50 bicyclists were made to take the breathalyzer test. “There are certain corridors used by cyclists, especially those cycling out of central Kolkata late in the night. We have identified those and similar checks will continue,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Three fatal accidents and 10 non-fatal accidents involving bicyclists in last 24 days have led Kolkata Traffic Police to implement this test even on non-mechanized two-wheeler riders. “Carry the breathalyzer test for the cyclists too. Anyone found having consumed alcohol above the limit (30mg/100 ml) should be immediately handed over to local police so that they can prosecute such cyclists under IPC 290 or some other petty case. While Section 185 of the MV Act is not applicable in these cases, that doesn’t mean cyclists have a free pass to drink and cycle on roads and cause traffic nuisance,” the order stated. The decision was taken after several rounds of consultation at the highest level of Lalbazar following analysis of CCTV footage that conclusively proved (and now shared by Kolkata Police) that several cyclists do not follow rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/39-yr-old-citys-1st-cyclist-to-be-booked-for-drink-riding/articleshow/87938051.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Canadian health authority, Health Canada, has recognised the indigenous two-dose, inactivated virus vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. Come November 30 this year, all those who have taken two jabs of Covaxin can travel to Canada starting November 30. The only condition is that the second Covaxin shot should have been taken at least 14 days prior to entry into Canada. “Beginning Nov 30, the #GOC will expand its list of #Covid19 vaccines accepted for entry to Canada to include Sinopharm, Sinovac and COVAXIN. Travellers must have received a full vaccine series at least 14 days before entry to Canada,” Health Canada and PHAC (Public Health Agency of Canada) tweeted. The move comes as a major respite for travellers from India who had been waiting to travel to Canada without having to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in that North American country. Canada had earlier recognised vaccines such as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna, AstraZeneca including Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute of India, and Johnson & Johnson’s single dose vaccine. With this, most major countries, including Australia, US and UK, have recognised Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/canada-too-recognises-covaxin-for-travel/articleshow/87938822.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

About 37 lakh (17%) of 2.23 crore unvaccinated people (till November 14) were motivated to get their first dose from November 15 to November 26. The daily average of Covid shots administered in the state has also gone up to eight lakh doses per day from three to four lakh in the first-half of November. “We have administered more than one crore doses in November, which initially looked very difficult to achieve, following a big slump in the uptake owing to festivities and the second wave abating,” said state immunisation officer Sachin Desai. Desai said, “We have vaccinated 37 lakh people in the last 11 days, who had not come forward to take the first shot with the help of district collectors, promotional activities and campaigns like Har Ghar Dastak, which is a big achievement. We aim to vaccinate the remaining 20% of people within a month.” Of the remaining 1.86 crore unvaccinated population in Maharashtra, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Solapur, Nanded and Ahmednagar districts collectively have 42% (unvaccinated) population. Desai said that the officials are offering attractive prizes through a lucky draw to mobilising students to motivate the unvaccinated. Maharashtra has till now (up to November 26) administered 11,07,87,972 doses, fully vaccinating 3.8 crore people and given at least one shot to 7.27 crore of its eligible population. The state has a total of 9.14 crore people who are eligible to get the Covid shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-states-daily-vaccination-count-sees-two-fold-rise/articleshow/87939360.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The governor looks into every recommendation of the commission and seeks an explanatory memorandum as to the action taken which is to be placed before the legislature. After formation of Telangana, not a single report of TVC has been tabled on the floor of the house,” Forum for Good Governance secretary M Padmanabha Reddy said. TVC was set up in March 2015 to deal with prevention of corruption and maintenance of integrity in public service. FGG had submitted several representations to the chief secretary and also to the governor, but no action had been taken, Reddy recalled. Reddy said: “Dozens of contempt cases pending against senior officers in the high court is a sad reflection of the working of administration.” The Forum for Good Governance secretary asked the govenor to direct the CS to inquire as to why the reports of TVC and TSFC have not been placed in the assembly in the last six years. He urged the governor to take steps to ensure tabling of all the reports on the floor of the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vigilance-panel-reports-not-tabled-in-house-for-6-yrs/articleshow/87938050.cms||---

According to police, violations include jumping red lights, violating a stop sign, use of handheld devices like mobile phones while driving and overtaking in a wrong manner. Maximum cases where cops have recommended temporary suspension of licences — usually up to three months — pertain to signal violations. Cops clarified those jumping signals will see immediate suspension of licence on recommendation from the ACPs concerned . “We have asked our officers to be very strict. Motorists need to learn what all are considered violations under Section 184 of MV Act (dangerous driving),” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha.

The private firm recently submitted proposals to the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation (NMSCDCL) which is implementing the project. The ozonation plant will be able to treat 26 lakh litres of water an hour. One proposal states that it will cost Rs 7.5 crore if all the equipment is set up by the agency and second proposal is that if the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen plant is used at Ramkund, it will cost Rs 5.5 crore. Around 17 PSA medical oxygen plants have been set up considering the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic. Chief executive officer of NMSCDCL Sumant More said they would soon be holding a meeting with NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav and take a call on the issue. The Ramkund is an important religious site as lakhs of sadhus and devotees take a holy dip there during Kumbh Mela.

---||Kolkata||185 spurious mustard oil cans seized in Burrabazar||KOLKATA: The enforcement branch has raided the premises of three edible oil traders in the Posta region after receiving complaints that they were blending rice bran oil with deadly dyes and chemicals and repacking them as mustard oil and selling them at Rs 160 per litre, almost Rs 30-Rs 60 less than the market rate. The government has banned blending of mustard oil since July earlier this year. The EB have seized huge stocks of adulterated mustard oil from three godowns in Burrabazar. The adulteration was being carried out at special anti-chambers set up inside the godown, suspect investigators. “We have collected the samples and sent them for testing. The accused wanted to cash in on the mustard oil price rise and were making a nice profit by using sub-standard products,” said Bidisha Kalita, DC (EB). According to police, it was around two days back that officers from the enforcement branch carried out a special drive against blended mustard oil based on inputs from various sources. “Samples from each accused were collected after we came to know that they were selling adulterated oil at anywhere between Rs 160-Rs 165 per litre, which is not possible at present market rates if it was pure. We even found underground chambers at each godown. We suspect that mustard oil was adulterated by the accused by mixing essence, colour and low-rate-low-quality rice bran oil. This is subject to the chemical report that we are waiting for. We believe this oil was sold in bulk in the open market,” said an officer. “Officers from our food & edible oil section reached godowns at Strand Road where search and seizure were made at three shops and office-cum-godowns. We detained one Bikram Goel (45). As many as 105 tins filled with loose mustard oil (each tin 15 kgs) and 32 empty tins were seized from him. We also detained one Bidyut Nandi (42) and seized 35 tins filled with loose mustard oil and 15 empty tins. Manik Porel(55) was the third person to be detained. We detained 45 tins filled with loose mustard oil and 12 empty tins from Porel,” said Kalita. The development comes at a time when the central government announced in October that it will push for more domestic rice bran oil production to counter the inflation in edible oil prices across the country. The country is witnessing record-high inflation in food prices, including in edible oils, pulses, meat and eggs, in addition to skyrocketing fuel prices. According to multiple studies in Kolkata, the commonly found adulterants from the chemical analysis of edible oil were found to be argemone oil, mineral oil, karanja oil and cyanide. The level of adulteration was found to be higher in unpackaged samples of mustard and soybean oil and absent in coconut oil. Studies have also stated that adulteration was commonly practised in non-branded foods. “Increase in consumer awareness would enable careful selection of ingredients, thereby further aiding in maintenance of good health,” a study titled ‘Adulteration in commonly used cooking oils of Kolkata: Evaluation of consumer perception and detection of adulterants’ and published at the International Journal of Health Sciences & Research has recently stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/185-spurious-mustard-oil-cans-seized-in-burrabazar/articleshow/87938067.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Farm fire share in Delhi’s PM2.5 varied from 8% to 30%||NEW DELHI: The stubble burning contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels varied from 8% to 30% during the harvest season in two distinct scenarios, asserts an analysis by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The study took two contrasting scenarios of a five-day period each when the impact of farm fires on Delhi’s air quality was high and low. The impact depended on meteorological reasons, such as wind speed and direction, which carried smoke from the neighbouring states into Delhi. In both scenarios, the contribution of local sources varied between 52% and 69%, other sources between 18% and 23%, while stubble burning was from 8% to 30%. However, the analysis added that “to blame stubble burning entirely for Delhi’s air quality or not blaming it at all would be wrong”. There were three major components — stubble burning, local sources and other external sources — that were considered to study the city’s pollution woes. “The analysis tends to show that it will be wrong to blame a single source entirely for the extreme pollution events as they are largely dependent on the weather. Stubble burning cannot be blamed entirely as there are other factors and sources too. Similarly, it would be wrong to say that stubble burning does no major harm as it does take pollution levels to extreme ends,” said Gufran Beig, founder project director, SAFAR. Beig pointed out that between October 30 and November 3, when the fire count was 12,565, the contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 levels in the city was only 8%. However, between November 9 and 13 with a fire count of 19,920, the stubble burning share spiked to 30%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fire-share-in-citys-pm2-5-varied-from-8-to-30/articleshow/87938853.cms||Kushagra Dixit

He was hit by the woman’s husband and several others recently. He was suspended after the incident. The incident happened on November 18. However, the sub-inspector was suspended on Friday by Wanaparthy SP Apurva Rao after an inquiry was conducted. The couple were caught red-handed by the husband who had laid out a trap. As the sub-inspector allegedly frequented the man’s home whenever he was away, he told his unsuspecting wife that he was going to Hyderabad and left. After some time, his suspicion came true and he saw the sub-inspector walk in. The husband, who was waiting with a group, thrashed both the sub-inspector and the woman.

---||Agra||Five children, including 3 girls, go missing every 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh: RTI||AGRA: In response to an RTI query, data provided by 50 districts of Uttar Pradesh has revealed that at least five children, including three girls, up to 18 years of age, went missing every day in the state last year. According to the data, which pertains to the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, a total of 1,763 children went missing in UP. Over 66% (1,166) were girls. Out of these, over 92% (1,070) girls were in the age group of 12 to 18 years. Twenty-five districts didn’t provide any details even after two months of delay. These districts, according to child rights activist Naresh Paras who had filed the RTI query, include Lucknow, Varanasi, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Gorakhpur and Bareilly. “The actual number of missing children will be much higher if data of all the districts is compiled,” Paras said. With 113 cases of missing children, Meerut district tops the list, the data revealed. Ghaziabad came next with 92 missing children followed by Sitapur (90), Mainpuri (86) and Kanpur city (80). In Agra district, 23 children, including 11 girls, disappeared in the period pertaining to the query. The RTI query also revealed that out of 1,763 missing children last year, 1,461 were traced and recovered by police. However, 302 children, including 200 girls, still remain missing. Urging state authorities to take such cases more seriously, Paras said, “The fact that on an average, five children are going missing every day in UP, most of whom are girls, is quite serious. Cases of missing children should be reviewed in the presence of complainants and investigators at the police headquarters in every district on a monthly basis." The situation is alarming in neighbouring states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as well, Paras added. As per the Supreme Court's directive, in case of a missing child, police are required to register an FIR under IPC section 363 (kidnapping) within 24 hours of the complaint. In case the missing child is not found within four months, the case is required to be referred to the anti-human trafficking unit of police present in each district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5-children-including-3-girls-go-missing-every-24-hours-in-up-rti/articleshow/87938069.cms||Deepak Lavania

In a gesture to celebrate the institute’s team spirit, Cyrus Poonawala, head of the Serum Institute, deputed Shaligram to accept the prestigious award. A team of 40 scientists and seniors from the institute were present during the programme at the Chavan auditorium in south Mumbai on Thursday. The state-level award is given on the death anniversary of Maharashtra’s first CM Yashwantrao Chavan for outstanding contribution in various fields. Recalling the trauma as Covid rampaged through the world, Shaligram said there was considerable uncertainty in the Serum Institute about how to tackle the menace. “However, Poonawala instilled confidence in us and placed his trust in the team. We closed ranks, overcame our initial inhibitions and got down to manufacturing the life-saving vaccine.” So far, the Serum Institute of India has supplied over 127 crore vaccine to 97 countries, including India, he added. Presiding over the function on Chavan’s 37th death anniversary, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar said Poonawala deserved more than a Padma Shri for his role as facilitator in the medical sector. “I have been decorated with the Padma Vibhushan, while Poonawala has been honoured with a Padma Shri. But I must say he deserved more than a Padma Shri. He has more achievements recorded in his copy book than me,” he said. Describing Poonawala as his college friend, Pawar added: “Back in the 1960s, the Poonawala family owned a small furniture business in Pune. We both were just about OK in studies... However, Cyrus made a name for himself because of his entrepreneurial skills, vision and ability to take business risks.” Since 1966, the institute has made life-saving biologicals in India at affordable prices. The country has become self-sufficient in tetanus anti-toxin, antisnake venom serum, DTP and MMR vaccines, said the citation presented along with a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh. Nuclear physicist Dr Anil Kakodkar complimented the Serum Institute for helping India and other nations overcome the dreaded disease in a short span of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pawar-salutes-serum-head-at-awards-event/articleshow/87939378.cms||Ambarish Mishra

The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed the roadway that passes through Nashik district for which, the land will be acquired or directly purchased from the farmers under an agreement based on the value decided by the district authorities of the valuation committee. The MLA accompanied by a group of farmers met the collector and raised objections against the October 6 Government Resolution (GR) that capped the amount of compensation for land in the rural areas to twice the land value only. Ahire said, “The state government has issued a GR saying that compensation amount given to the land-owners will be twice the value of the land. This is lower than the amount offered to the farmers when the land was acquired for Nagpur Mumbai Samruddhi Mahamarg.” For the Samruddhi Expressway, the farmers were given the basic compensation that was four times the value of the land. If the same was acquired, the farmers had the right to challenge the compensation. At the same time, the farmers were offered five times the value if they sold their land through private negotiations to the government and it could not be challenged in court. “The basic compensation was four times for the land in rural areas and two times for the land in urban areas. As per the new norm, the same will now only be two times in both the rural and urban areas,” Ahire added. The MLA said that the farmers from four talukas – Nashik, Dindori, Sinnar and Surgana accompanied her to the collector’s meeting where they raised the issue. Nilesh Shringi, the deputy collector said that the government resolution was announced on October 6 and the primary notification has been announced November 16. “As per the notification, the farmers can raise objections to the proposal in 21 days. We have received 80 applications so far. We have also received the delegation of the MLA Ahire on Friday and all the demands will be presented to the state government for further action,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-legislator-ahire-seeks-better-land-value-for-project-hit-farmers/articleshow/87937369.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Lucknow||PM to visit Gorakhpur to open AIIMS, fertilizer unit||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s political backyard of Gorakhpur will be the next stopover for PM Narendra Modi, who has been on a whirlwind tour of the state to inaugurate or lay foundation of key infrastructural projects in the run-up to UP polls early next year. The PM has already clocked 7 visits in just 36 days. He is expected to reach Gorakhpur in the first week of December to formally inaugurate the newly constructed AIIMS and a fertilizer factory — two key projects for which he laid the foundation, months before the 2017 assembly elections (July 22, 2016). His visit to Gorakhpur, the political nerve centre of east UP, assumes significance even as BJP steps up the electoral spadework to take on an assertive opposition in the Purvanchal region comprising around 160 assembly seats. While AIIMS is being dubbed as a flagship project to elevate the medical infrastructure of east UP, the fertilizer factory could potentially position the BJP dispensation to escalate its outreach to farmers, particularly after PM’s decision to repeal farm laws which were at the centre of a raging stir for over a year. In fact, sources said, Modi may choose the Purvanchal turf to drive a message home in west UP, where many farmers have been up in arms against the three farm laws. AIIMS-Gorakhpur happens to be one of the four such tertiary medical institutes after the ones in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Vidarbha, which were taken up soon after BJP formed the government at the Centre in 2014 and allocated an initial budget of Rs 500 crore for the purpose. The out-patient department (OPD) for the institution started in February, 2019, and the first batch of 50 MBBS students gained admission later that year. Sources said, the PM will inaugurate the OPD of 750 beds, which will be gradually raised. Preparations are also in full swing for inauguration of the fertilizer factory, which will be operated by Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Limited (HURL). Sources said, secretary (fertilizer) Rajesh Kumar Chaturvedi has visited the site and held several rounds of meetings with officials over past couple of days. The factory is proposed to produce 3,850 metric tonnes of neem-coated urea per day. In the first phase, the factory will cater to five states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In the second phase, fertilizers will be sent through railways to states that come within 1400km radius. Officials said, work on the factory was delayed in the wake of pandemic, followed by heavy rains and consequent flooding. The factory was established on April 20 1968 by then PM Indira Gandhi. From then it ran uninterrupted till 1990. After the death of an employee, Meghnath Singh in an accident on June 10 1990, the factory shut down. After closure, the matter went to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

In a major breakthrough, the police succeeded in nabbing the Patna based kingpin Nilesh alias PK along with his associate Ritesh near the Ring Road Flyover in Sarnath area on November 18. PK, a native of Chhapra district, settled in Patna after the retirement of his father from the industry department in 1990. He did his graduation through correspondence course from Patna University. He used to introduce himself as a doctor to win the confidence of others. His gang had been active in different states of the country for the last 5-6 years. He used to charge Rs 30 to 49 lakhs from an aspirant of NEET. With the help of Ritesh, who is his brother-in-law and clerk in culture and youth affairs department at the secretariat of Bihar government in Patna, he used to get the exam papers of different competitive examinations of the service commissions of UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar. Ritesh is married to PK’s sister Dr Priya, who completed her MBBS from IGIGIMS, Patna in 2019, is posted at a PHC in Chhapra. Her involvement in this gang has also come to light during investigation. Soon on the basis of the interrogation of Nilesh, the police also arrested two members of another Varanasi based gang Kanhaiyalal Singh, the kingpin, and his associate Kranti Kaushal near Singhpur bypass on November 22. This gang had been operating for the last 6-7 years, and its network was spread in different cities of UP and the national capital. The police recovered original marksheets of five women aspirants, certificates and fake Aadhar cards and admit cards of different examinations from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-arrests-case-police-raids-in-patna/articleshow/87938855.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Viral cricket fan returns to Green Park with a message||(With Pics) Kanpur: A young man whose hilarious video of chewing ‘gutkha’ while talking on mobile on the first day of the India-New Zealand Test at Green Park stadium in Kanpur created a rage on social media, reached the stadium again on Friday. However, this time there was a placard in his hands with the message: “Gutkha Khana Galat Baat Hai (It is wrong to eat gutkha).” The cricket fan, who became a sensation overnight on social media with the video, identified himself as Shobhit Pandey, a resident of Maheswari Mohal. He said that he arrived at the Green Park Stadium with his sister for the first day of the India vs NZ Test match. Shobhit also clarified to the reporters at the stadium that he was not eating ‘gutkha’ while watching the match, but had ‘meethi supari’ (sweet betel nut) in his mouth, which he had taken from his sister. In the picture and video, a young woman is also seen sitting next to the young man. It was being said about this girl that she is his girlfriend. However, Shobhit clarified that the girl is his sister. The hilarious incident was caught on camera on Thursday, the first day of the Test match. It later went viral and became a rage on social media. Reacting to the viral video, thousands of netizens shared comments and memes on Twitter. In the video, Shobhit could be seen speaking to someone on the mobile phone while chewing. The girl sitting next to him looked at him and waved and said that they were on camera. Shobhit further elaborated that it was after the completion of 70 overs, while Shreyas Iyer was on the crease after scoring 54 and Jadeja 26, when the camera turned towards them. He had received a call from his friend, who too is an avid cricket lover, who was inquiring about his whereabouts. He told him that he was sitting near Gate No 11, while the person on the phone was at Gate No 8. The first 10 seconds of video of this young man was shared on Twitter with the caption, ‘You will see these things only in Kanpur Stadium’. Former Indian cricketer Wasim Jaffer shared a meme of ‘Phir Hera Pheri’ on the social media app. One has put a photo of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan chewing paan and tagged it - “Kanpuriye”. Another said, if this ‘bhai’ (brother) had become happier, then the person in the front seat would have certainly taken a ‘gutkha’ bath. Pandey said he was shocked and could not believe that such a small thing would become viral in a few minutes on social media. He said he was pained with the lewd comments he saw about his sister, sitting by his side. “Everybody knows Kanpur is famous for ‘supari’ (betel nut) related products and ‘paan masala’, and there was nothing strange in it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/viral-cricket-fan-returns-to-green-park-with-a-message/articleshow/87938866.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

State advocate said the Aadhaar produced by families of J Shiva, J Naveen and C Chennakeshavulu indicated they were majors at the time of the incident and even in the medical reports and potency certificates furnished before the magistrate has their ages as 19-21 years. “The issue of juvenility was first raised during the recording of statements by NHRC. It was never raised before the IO or magistrate,” state counsel E Uma Maheswara Rao said, while also arguing the school records used to claim juvenile status were not credible as they have too many corrections. Observing whether illiterate villagers were capable of corrections in birth registers, the panel chairman asked: “Is it your case that someone is mischievously acting to show that they were minors?” The counsel responded: “Somebody or other is interested in projecting them as juveniles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-quizzes-state-on-juvenile-claims/articleshow/87938863.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Lucknow||Battle 2022: Gandhi bastion under saffron siege||Lucknow: Even as rebel Congress MLA Aditi Singh defected to BJP, political spotlight focussed sharply on the Congress bastion Rae Bareli which has been under the siege of the saffron outfit in the run-up to the UP elections. The development, in fact, has positioned the BJP to tighten its grip on five out of the six assembly seats in Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Unchahar is the only seat which is represented by SP's Manoj Pandey who defeated BJP's Utkrisht Maurya, son of UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya, by a slender margin of around 2,000 votes in 2017 UP polls. In 2017, Congress had won two seats and BJP three out of six assembly seats of the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency. Now both are in the saffron camp. Before Aditi, who represents Rae Bareli Sadar, Rakesh Singh, Congress MLA from Harchandpur seat in the district, has been supporting the BJP openly since 2018 when his elder brother Dinesh Pratap Singh switched over to the ruling party. Dinesh also contested against Sonia in 2019 Lok Sabha elections but lost by a margin of over 1.67 lakh votes. BJP’s Rae Bareli president Ram Dev Pal told TOI that the party has already rolled out its poll machinery of around 10,000 workers in the district. This includes 2385 booth level presidents. “The district unit has been working for the past five years. We will not let any stone unturned,” he said, while speaking to TOI on Thursday. Daughter of local strong man and former Congress MLA, late Akhilesh Singh, Aditi had won the Rae Bareli seat convincingly, cornering around 63% of the total votes polled in 2017 elections. Her win was largely attributed to the influence of Akhilesh Singh who died in August 2019 after a prolonged illness. Experts said that Aditi will now face the challenge of keeping up the legacy of her father who has been winning the seat since 1993. The three seats which were won by BJP in 2017 included the reserved seat of Bachhrawan where BJP's Ram Naresh Rawat defeated Congress's Sahab Sharan by a margin of around 22,000 votes. Likewise, the Salon reserved seat was also won by BJP's Dal Bahadur Kori who defeated Congress's Suresh Chaudhary by 16,000 votes. Kori died in May earlier this year after getting infected with Corona. Salon, significantly, comes under Amethi parliamentary seat which was won by BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani defeating former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi by a margin of 55,000 votes in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This recently paved the way for Irani to get nominated as chairperson of District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) of Rae Bareli as well. As per norms, the MP of the parliamentary seat happens to be the chairperson of the committee which was conceptualised by the Union rural development ministry in 2016 to keep a vigil on implementation of the various Central schemes through inter-departmental coordination. Irani is also chairperson of DISHA committee in Amethi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/battle-2022-gandhi-bastion-under-saffron-siege/articleshow/87939387.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||‘This govt faced challenges like no other in past’||Margao: BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar on Friday said that the Pramod Sawant-led BJP government faced challenges like no other government had to do in the past, but the support received from the central government coupled with the people-centric delivery mechanism of the state government helped it gain the confidence of the people. “The government faced huge challenges of the pandemic and the Tauktae cyclone over the last two-and-a-half years. The state government could overcome the problems owing to the support received from the central government,” Sawaikar said while addressing a gathering of party workers at a function held at BJP’s South Goa office at Margao. A group of 25 people from the tribal community, led by Michael Dias, known to be staunch supporters of Goa Forward Party for the last two elections, were welcomed into the party fold on the occasion. Stating that the delivery mechanism of the state government has been designed keeping in focus the welfare of the common man, Sawaikar said that this has enabled the government to win the support of the people. “This then inspires confidence of the people in the state’s leadership, and helps the government win over the minds and hearts of the people,” he said. Former Fatorda MLA Damodar Naik, who was also at the function, said that while other parties have used the ST community with an eye on the vote bank, BJP acknowledges and recognises the contribution of its workers. “The tribal community leaders have now realised that BJP has a vision that goes much beyond votes, elections and power,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-govt-faced-challenges-like-no-other-in-past/articleshow/87938965.cms||---

Saharanpur MP, Haji Fazlur Rehman of BSP, has also been summoned. This came after the petitioners, survivors of the caste violence, alleged that the authorities violated the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2016, which provides for a range of compensations to Dalits of caste violence. These compensations, in the form of jobs, funds, rations, homes, etc, have not been provided to 56 survivors of the Shabbirpur violence, the petitioners had said. On May 5, 2017, clashes broke out between Thakurs and Dalits that left one person dead and scores injured in Shabbirpur. Later, 56 houses belonging to Dalits were torched. The violence erupted after Dalits objected to the playing of loud music during the Maharana Pratap jayanti yatra taken out by Thakurs. Petitioner Dal Singh said, “As per the 2016 SC/ST Act, each Dalit who suffered during the of Shabbirpur violence would be entitled to Rs 8.25 lakh compensation. But they were given only Rs 3 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc/st-court-summons-up-central-officials-over-2017-clashes/articleshow/87940565.cms||Sandeep Rai

He has also been arrested. The 21-year-old woman was returning home in Mathura from Agra after appearing for a police recruitment exam on Tuesday evening along with the accused, Tejveer Rawat, who had befriended her on Facebook three months ago. Rawat had allegedly raped her on the back seat while the car was being driven by his relative, Digambar Singh. On Friday, the rape survivor gave a statement before a magistrate, alleging that Digambar came on the back seat and also tried to rape her but fled after she resisted and raised an alarm. Sanjay Tyagi, SHO of Kosi Kalan police station, said IPC section 376 D (gang rape) has been added along with section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit and offence) in the FIR. Rawat was arrested on Wednesday. He is posted in Ladakh and had come to his hometown, Palwal, Haryana, to attend a wedding. Condemning the assault, former chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted— “the insensitive BJP government should tell when the culprit of this crime will be encountered? Law and order in UP has become a victim of gang rape”. The woman had lost her father in a road accident a few days ago and her mother along with her brother had gone to their native village near Kanpur to perform the last rites.

---||Delhi||Seeking to move to DU college of his choice, student in no man’s land||NEW DELHI: Rejected by colleges like Hindu, Shri Ram College of Commerce and Hansraj, a hapless Delhi University aspirant had moved Delhi high court. The colleges said Krish Raj Chaudhary had studied subjects during his International Baccalaureate course that were not equivalent to the ones accepted by the university. There was some relief for him on Thursday, when the court directed DU to consider the petitioner’s application in the second special admission drive on the basis of subjects in which equivalence was uncontested. The Jaipur native studied business management, physics, mathematics, English language and literature, Hindi and chemistry under the IB curriculum. The OBC student, who is also eligible for a seat under the children of war widows quota, scored 97.25% and got a seat at Hansraj College for BCom (H) in the second cutoff list. Chaudhary submitted an equivalence certificate for business management with business studies offered by CBSE. But when the fourth cutoff list was published and Chaudhary found himself eligible for admission at Hindu College, he withdrew his application at Hansraj, paying the Rs 1,000 cancellation fee. To his shock, Hindu College rejected his admission, stating that business management was not equivalent to the courses offered by CBSE. “There were no responses to the grievance complaints he filed with different authorities,” said Mohit Mudgal, the counsel for Chaudhary. “In the fifth list, Chaudhary found himself eligible for admission at SRCC. The admission was approved and the student even paid the required fees. But two days later, the college sent him an email saying his candidature was being cancelled on the ground that IB’s business management had no equivalence in CBSE course. But it is actually a course recognised by the Council of Boards on School Education as well as by the evaluation division of Association of Indian Universities.” The matter was a bit more than that because Chaudhary, eligible for admission under the children of war widows quota, was given admission at Dyal Singh College for the BA Programme course. However, because it was not the subject of his choice, he paid another Rs 1,000 as cancellation fee and withdrew his papers. Then, following communication with officials at SRCC, he was informed that he could apply for admission in the first special drive to fill the vacancies without including this business management scores. But, said Mudgal, “SRCC suddenly raised a query on the Hindi equivalence. The student submitted an equivalence letter from the principal of the school. So as not to lose his seat, Chaudhary also reapplied to Hansraj College because he was eligible there and had been admitted earlier to.” Chaudhary’s family and legal counsel knocked on several doors to address the anomaly but claimed they got no response at all. When the second special cutoff drive came, by virtue of being a child of a war widow, Chaudhary was granted a seat for BA Programme (accounting and finance + economics) with a best of four aggregate of 98.25%. Pinki Sharma, dean of admissions, DU, said, “The university has done equivalence for various subjects in consultation with the departments. The list was sent to the colleges.” She, however, appeared to be not fully aware of Chaudhary’s case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seeking-to-move-to-du-college-of-his-choice-student-in-no-mans-land/articleshow/87938886.cms||Shradha Chettri

The accused was arrested after the 32-year-old woman residing at Mulloor approached the Vizhinjam police with a complaint. The police have arrested husband Sajan, 39, invoking relevant sections under IPC as well as Juvenile Justice Act. He is a fisherman by profession.

She stated that she had agreed to donate her kidney for a lucrative sum after the family was approached by an agent. She even underwent some tests in this regard at a prominent hospital in Kochi a few weeks ago ahead of the surgery. However, she had a change of heart when the news regarding the activities of racket in Vizhinjam coastal town came out a few days ago. She informed the matter to Kottappuram ward member Paniyadima who discouraged her from proceeding with the deal. Sajan was enraged at her change of heart, which provoked him to commit the alleged atrocity. The couple has three sons. The youngest is still an infant and he was the only one who was not beaten up by the accused, the police said. The police have also launched a probe to find out the agent who approached the family for organ donation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vizhinjam-cops-probe-organ-racket-complaint/articleshow/87938101.cms||---

The sounds of ‘dhol’ reminded the spectators and veterans of the old day’s when the stadium used to hold only a test match and groups of fans used to bring ‘dholak’, ‘tasha’, ‘manjeera’ along with them to cheer the Indian cricket team, encourage them to perform, even during the dull moments. Ghulam Mohiuddin, a veteran cricketer and member of Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) said, “The drumbeats has reminded me of old days when my friends and I used these tactics to make the stadium alive and try to disrupt the game of the batsman of rival team.” Another spectator, Harbhajan Singh, said, “We are reliving the memories of our time,” adding that generally the musical instruments were brought in students gallery (boys and girls) and public stands. “One group used to start and three to four groups in the student gallery (male) countered it. Soon it converted into competition, coupled with dance performances. Girls gallery responded to it and they also used to beat their musical instruments, along with claps. However, their dance was limited to decency,” he said. AP Bhanu, former cricketer, sharing his experiences said the student gallery was the biggest stand and its capacity was around 10,000. Season tickets costed Rs 5 only. Though its name was student gallery, spectators belonged to all age groups, including old age cricket lovers. Besides dance and music, quarreling between groups was a common factor and daily fights broke two to three places in the stand. Girish Kapoor, another veteran cricketer, who later assisted referees in international matches, said that many at times spectators sitting on the front stairs became over-enthusiastic, losing control which often led to fights. At present, the student stand in the stadium doesn’t exist. Director’s pavilion and VIP pavilion have been raised there and only memories remain there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/atmosphere-builds-up-with-dhol-bugles-at-green-park-reminding-spectators-and-veterans-of-old-days/articleshow/87938870.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

The opposition’s unusual request came on Wednesday after no offence was registered against a BJP worker who entered into a row with a cattle party. The cattle party was in the Wadi area when a group led by a BJP worker approached it. After a heated argument, a motorcycle was also parked in front of the cattle party convoy to ensure that it did not move ahead. The cattle party, however, stood firm and continued with its drive. Mayor Keyur Rokadiya later assured that the drive against stray cattle would continue and nobody should obstruct the drive. However, the VMC did not file any offence against the persons obstructing the work of the cattle party. The Congress on Thursday moved a proposal in the general board meeting of the VMC seeking that nobody should be booked in connection with the cattle menace. The party did so to take a dig at the ruling BJP over its failure to take action against its own party members. The resolution, as expected, was not passed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dont-file-cases-cong-takes-dig-at-ruling-bjp/articleshow/87938246.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He said, “Kodava language has its origin from pre-Dravidian times and is being influenced recently by Kannada and other languages, which might have effects on its origin and culture”. Supreme Court advocate Brijesh Kalappa opined Kodava community has a unique culture, and he supported the fight in obtaining the ST tag for the community. Budakattu Kuruba Sangharsh Samiti president Lakavalli Manjunath alleged that the ethnographic survey of the Kodava community has not been properly done by the authorities concerned. Nachappa presented seven resolutions in the convention. The demand for ST tag for Kodavas, declaration of geo-political status to Kodagu, preservation of the sacrosanct rights towards the gun, inclusion of Kodava Thakk in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution, inclusion of Kodava culture in the cultural heritage list of UNESCO and establishment of a genocide memorial at Devatparamb site were the resolutions.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Time to tell BJP enough is enough, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Attacking the governments at the Centre and in UP for ‘trampling provisions of the Indian Constitution’, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said it was time to tell ruling BJP that enough is enough. Speaking at Samvidhan Divas and Samvidhan Bachao Mahapanchayat organised at Kashiram Smriti Upvan, Akhilesh declared support of his party to those who believe in the ideology of BR Ambedkar – the architect of Indian Constitution. “Ambedkarwadi aage aaye hain samvidhan ko bachane ke liye, hum Samajwadi aap ka poora samarthan aur sahyog karenge is sangharsh mein (Followers of Ambedkar have joined hands to save the constitution. We Samajwadis will support you),” he said and added that the “Indian Constitution is the spirit of Indian democracy but the BJP is out to destroy both.” “Today, there is a government which announces demonetisation during an address to the nation. Then during another address to the nation the three black farm laws were withdrawn. Does our Constitution allow us to deal with such important issues in the manner in which they have been handled through rashtra ke naam sandesh (address to the nation)?” he questioned. He said the death of farmers and a journalist in Lakhimpur was a blatant example of displaying scant regard for the Constitution and the law of the land. “UP saw the most brutal display of disrespect to the government when the son of the Union minister of state for home crushed to death farmers and a journalist under his car,” he said. Akhilesh cited photographs in the media to point out how protesting women and the men were dragged by their hair, cane charged and booked by police for demanding jobs and staging protest which was their constitutional right. “Today their right to protest is being crushed, tomorrow it will be the rest,” he said. SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar gave a new slogan against the ruling BJP. “Jab tak BJP ki bidai nahin, tab tak koi dhilai nahi (Leave nothing to chance till BJP is ousted),” he said. Former BJP MLA and MP Savitri Bai Phule, who organised the Samvidhan Bachao Mahapanchayat and is the president of Kanshiram Bahujan Samaj Party, said the government was not concerned about Dalits who were the worst hit in the BJP government. BSP founder late Kashiram’s sister Swarn Kaur said it was time to support parties which care for the poor. Chief of Bharatiya Bauddh Mahasabha Bhimrao Yashwantrao Ambedkar, constitution expert Suvachan Ramji and advocate Prakash Maurya were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/time-to-tell-bjp-enough-is-enough/articleshow/87939404.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

But after 2022, all opposition leaders will do the same,” said Maurya while addressing a rally in Aligarh on Friday.He claimed that none of the opposition leaders had ever visited Ayodhya for darshan or taken a holy dip in Kumbh before 2014. “They never talked about the Hindu community. Rather they participated in Iftar parties,” he said, adding that to appease the minorities, these parties had always ignored the Hindus. Targeting the former chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, Maurya said that he had equated Sardar Patel with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who divided the country. “Even Jinnah can’t save Akhilesh now,” he said. Listing the achievements of the Yogi government, Maurya said with the opening of the defence corridor in Aligarh, the district has got an opportunity to turn into a major hub for production of high-tech defence equipment. He said, “Missiles manufactured in Aligarh will be used in Islamabad if Pakistan PM Imran Khan does not shut his terror factories.” The deputy CM announced the rechristening of “Ramghat Marg” as “Ramghat Kalyan Marg”, as Babuji (Kalyan Singh) was Lord Ram devotee. He also laid foundation stones of a slew of projects worth Rs 274 crore. Incidentally, a day earlier, Mughal Road in Agra city was renamed as 'Maharaja Agrasen Road’. Agra Mayor Naveen Jain told mediapersons that the road has been renamed on the demand of followers of Maharaja Agrasen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/oppn-too-will-chant-jai-shri-ram-after-bjp-retains-power-in-state-maurya/articleshow/87938110.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Events held in Delhi were organised by the government. He questioned the reason behind BJP and RSS staying away from celebrating Samvidhan Diwas. “I was in Parliament for 20 years, but November 26 was never celebrated in the Parliament. In UP, for the first time such an event has been organised by Sawitri Bai Phule. After this event was announced, the government also announced that it will celebrate Samvidhan Diwas. Two events are being held, one at Central Hall and the other at Vigyan Bhawan,” he said, adding that people should not be under any illusion and there may come a situation when after the 2024 elections, one will have to see if we have the same Constitution Prakash narrated an incident that happened during the time when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM and a committee was constituted to review the Constitution. But even before the committee could submit its review report, a journalist friend handed him a draft of the new Constitution itself. “I told Atalji but he did not believe me. I said I will table a copy of it before the Parliament officially the next day,” Prakash said. He went on to claim that the BJP or the RSS did not organise any event to celebrate Samvidhan Diwas as a party and it was the government which organised these events, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-rss-didnt-celebrate-samvidhan-diwas-ambedkar-kin/articleshow/87939407.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||Priyanka meets family of Phaphamau murder victims||Prayagraj: Congress general secretary and UP in-charge, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday evening met the family of Phoolchand Pasi, a Dalit man, who along with his wife and two minor children was brutally murdered in Gohari Mohaganj village under the limits of Phaphamau police station in trans-Ganga area here on Thursday. Priyanka spent about 45 minutes in the village and offered condolences to the family. The family told Priyanka that local police had shielded the goons and there was none to hear their grievances. After interacting with the bereaved family, Priyanka told the reporters that “the incident was yet another example of the deplorable law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh”. “There has been an increase in the number of cases of atrocities on Dalits across the state but everyone is acting as a mute spectator,” she added. She also mentioned the incidents of Agra and Hathras, saying “what is the meaning of celebrating the Constitution Day (Samvidhan Diwas)?” “The poor and the weaker sections of society are being victimized under this government, and today is Constitution Day. In this fight for justice, I and my party will stand by the family and support them in whichever way we can,” she said. She also alleged that local police and district administration were not helping the family people though they had approached the police administration several times. “Why the local police and administration not take preventive measures and action if the family members of the victims approached them in 2019, 2020 and September 2021,” she asked, adding, “Why the local police administration not set up a police outpost here earlier which they have now done.” She alleged that she had noticed that there was no justice for Dalits in the state. “There is also no justice for the farmers, minorities and women,” she said, adding, “Justice is available to only those who are in power or those who accompany them as well as big industrialists.” She also alleged that efforts were being made to destroy the Constitution. “I would be raising my voice for those who have been denied justice. I would be visiting places and standing with the people who have not got justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/priyanka-meets-family-of-phaphamau-murder-victims/articleshow/87938880.cms||---

The Race Course police identified the accused as K Mohana Gandhi, a resident of Ramanathapuram. “Gandhi was not on good terms with his elder sister’s husband Vimalraj, a cop attached to the city armed reserve force. He called up the police control room on Thursday 9.15pm, stating he had planted a bomb at the police quarters on Balasundaram Road, where Vimalraj was residing.” Immediately, a team of Race Course police and bomb detection and disposal squad arrived on the spot and searched the police quarters. “A sniffer dog was also pressed into service. However, they did not find anything and realized it was a hoax call,” a police officer said. Preliminary inquiry revealed that it was Gandhi who made the call. “When woman head constable Baby contacted Gandhi from the city police control room, he threatened her with dire consequences and abused her verbally,” the officer said. Based on Baby’s complaint, Race Course police inspector Sujatha registered a case against Gandhi on Friday morning under Sections 294(b) and 506 (i) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him. He was later produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in Udumalpet sub-jail under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hoax-bomb-call-lands-man-in-jail/articleshow/87938878.cms||---

In a hard-hitting article in party organ Murasoli on Friday, DMK said citing a report that there were 45 BJP MPs were family members of party leaders. “In Karnataka, when Yeddiyurappa was the chief minister, his elder son was an MP and younger son was state BJP general secretary. The current chief minister Baswaraj Bommai was also son of former chief minister S R Bommai,” the article said. Taking a dig at Nadda, DMK asked if the BJP president would remove Basavaraj Bommai from the post of chief minister to do away with dynastic politics and protect democracy. Murasoli article further listed out names of Anurag Thakur, Dushyant Singh, Poonam Mahajan and a host of other functionaries who were sons or daughters of senior leaders. “Union minister Rajnath Singh’s son Pankaj Singh is an MLA in Uttar Pradesh.

---||Kolkata||Flyers look forward to eased int’l travel as bars are lifted||Kolkata: An increase in frequency of flights to Dubai, Bangkok and Dhaka; resumption of flights to Abu Dhabi, Kathmandu and Paro; improved connectivity in flights to Europe and the US and a slash in international fares that have gone through the roof: these are among the offers that flyers from Kolkata can look forward to following the aviation ministry’s decision to allow scheduled international flights from December 15. Scheduled international flights were suspended on March 22, 2020. The only international flights that have been operating to and from India are those under air bubble agreements signed between India and 31 countries. But these flights had severe capacity constraints as frequency was less than that before Covid times. Also, these flights did not allow passengers to undertake onward travel. Though some capacity restriction has been announced on flights to countries that have been categorised as “risky”, like the UK and Bangladesh, Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi expects several carriers that are currently operating bubble flights to increase frequency from January and a few others, which had stayed away, to again link Kolkata. “We now have three-four international flights a day. That number should go up to 10-12 in January and then, steadily improve as the situation normalizes across the globe. It will be great to see the international wing of the terminal abuzz again,” he said. The travel trade community feels Emirates, FlyDubai and Qatar to be among the first airlines to increase frequency from three times-a-week to Dubai and two times-a-week to Doha at present to a daily service some time in January. Travel agents also expect IndiGo to hike its frequency to Dubai and reintroduce flights to Bangkok, and Air India to increase frequency to Bangkok and reintroduce flights to Dubai. Both Dubai and Bangkok are high-demand sectors from Kolkata that were constrained due to the limitations on flight. “There are indications of SpiceJet restarting flights to Bangkok,” said an industry source. Etihad is expected to return to Kolkata and connect the city to Abu Dhabi. The big difference though will be in the long-haul routes, such as Europe and the US, where economy fares have touched business class rates. “As scheduled operations resume, frequencies will increase and airlines can carry onward traffic, like before. This will bring down fares drastically,” said travel agent Anil Punjabi. Though Dhaka figures on the list of countries with Covid risk, and therefore, has a limitation on flights to operate at 75% capacity, travel agents feel that will not prevent several carriers from adding frequencies or resuming operations. Kathmandu and Paro, two other airports in south Asia that had flight connections from Kolkata, could also get reconnected. However, Singapore Airlines, which is scheduled to start daily flights to the city state from November 29, may be in jeopardy as the 75% capacity limitation could affect the flight’s viability. Ditto with the once-a-week Air India flight to London that operates on Sundays. “Since safety is paramount, there will be such restrictions along the way as international travel opens up,” an aviation industry official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyers-look-forward-to-eased-intl-travel-as-bars-are-lifted/articleshow/87938907.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Lucknow||Cracking down on corruption, SIT disposed of 114 cases since 2017||Lucknow: Following its policy of zero tolerance towards cases of corruption and financial irregularities, the UP police’s special investigation team (SIT) has successfully disposed of at least 114 cases since 2017. According to officials, this has been the best performance by the unit since its inception in 2007. A senior officer at the DGP headquarters said SIT investigated serious economic offences and other corrupt practices committed by public servants. Such cases are referred to the SIT by UP’s home department. Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said the government referred 30 cases to SIT for probe in 2017, 14 in 2018, 49 in 2019, 40 in 2020 and 36 till November this year. Another home official said the Sonbhadra carnage case, in which 11 members of the Gond tribe were killed in violence over a piece of land in Umba village was probed by the SIT. “It was a complex case involving a 40-year-old land dispute,” he said. He said another case of revenue loss due to irregularities in the sale of liquor from a factory in Tapri (Saharanpur) was probed by SIT. In this case, 11 accused have been arrested for evasion of excise duty to the tune of Rs 35 crore. Cases where irregularities have been proved include those related to Jauhar University in Rampur, lapses in 137 construction works by UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, and recruitments made by UP Cooperative Service Board and UP Subordinate Services Selection Commission. Irregularities in recruitment for 1,300 posts in UP Jal Nigam and irregularities in Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya were also investigated by SIT. Some important cases which are still under investigation are related to fake degrees in Agra University, illegal recoveries by officers of UP transport department, irregularities in 28 colleges in Gonda, lapses in scholarship payment by social welfare department, and Haj House construction, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cracking-down-on-corruption-sit-disposed-of-114-cases-since-2017/articleshow/87939423.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh told me not to do collection, I succumbed, says Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: Dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze told the Justice K U Chandiwal commission on Friday that the last three lines in former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s letter to the CM were correct and that he had advised him that irrespective of his apprehensions, he must not fall prey to any pressure and indulge in any illegal act of collection of money for anyone. When former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino asked Waze if it was correct that he had listened to the advice of Singh and had not succumbed to pressure, Waze replied that he had “already succumbed.” Also, on Thursday, a day after Justice Chandiwal’s warning, the commission was informed that Param Bir Singh will be present before it on November 29. Justice Chandiwal had on Thursday told Singh’s counsel Anukul Seth that the bailable warrant issued against the former Mumbai CP was still in force, and if he did not remain present before the commission, a directive would be given to ensure his presence. Seth informed the commission that Singh will remain present on November 29. In a related development, the Chandiwal commission issued a production warrant against Anil Deshmukh asking him to be present on November 30. Meanwhile, Waze replied to questions on Singh, including his reinstatement by a committee led by Singh, the fact that he has known him since 1996, has worked with him, and how his relations with him were as a subordinate. Asked if he was a cyber expert, Waze said he may be called a cyber expert, but he does not consider himself to be one. Waze said that he was reporting to the ACP (detection) and that he is an ideally upright officer who never indulged in illegal activities but was in certain unfortunate circumstances forced to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-cp-told-me-not-to-do-collection-i-succumbed/articleshow/87939418.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj Magh Mela 2022: Only fully vaccinated devotees to be allowed||PRAYAGRAJ: Although the number of Covid-19 cases has substantially come down in the state and across the country, the state government is not taking any chance when it comes to organising the Magh Mela 2022. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in a meeting held at Lucknow on Thursday with the officials of Prayagraj district administration, made it clear that only those who have been fully vaccinated should be allowed inside the Magh Mela area. “In the meeting, the chief minister made it very clear that only those devotees, who have taken both the doses of coronavirus vaccine would be allowed to enter the Magh Mela area. Besides, we have been told to follow all the protocols that were followed last year and not to take things lightly and monitor the Mela area so that protocols are followed," said SDM Prayagraj Mela Pradikaran, Sant Kumar Srivastava. "As per CM’s directives, all the norms like social distancing, wearing of masks etc., would be strictly adhered to," he added. The Mela Pradikaran was told to limit the expansion of the Mela area by taking all possible precautions given that the pandemic is not over yet. “Like Magh Mela 2021, we have been asked to maintain and enforce all the norms to check the spread of Covid-19 infection and that's the reason why only those who are fully vaccinated can enter Mela area. In case any devotee has taken the first dose of the vaccine, the second dose would be administered in the Mela area itself”, said the official. Besides, random Reserve transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen test would be conducted in all the sectors of the Magh Mela, he added. Every Kalpwasi or seer, who would be camping in the Mela area, will have to present proof of having received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Moreover, the Kalpwasi would be requested to minimise the number of visitors in their camps. Authorities have been instructed that no one without a face mask should be allowed in the Mela area. In Thursday’s meeting with the chief minister, the Prayagraj administration led by the district magistrate, Prayagraj, Sanjay Kumar Khatri gave a detailed presentation regarding organising Magh Mela 2022. According to sources, the district administration had prepared a proposal requiring funds worth around Rs. 67 crores. However, the state government has sanctioned around Rs 59 crores so far. “The instructions given by the chief minister in the meeting, for holding a safe Magh Mela while keeping the tradition intact, would be followed by us," said Srivastava. In Magh Mela 2021, the state government had made an RT-PCR report (taken not more than 72 hours before entering the Mela area) mandatory for every Kalpwasi and seer which is an effective deterrent in checking the spread of the pandemic, authorities said. In 2022, the Kalpwas would commence on January 17 (Paush Purnima) and would conclude on February 16 (Maghi Purnima). This would minimise the number of days of stay at the Magh Mela area by the devotees because almost everyone arrives on Makar Sankranti itself as Paush Purnima falls on January 17. This year Paush Purnima was on January 28 and Maghi Purnima on February 27, thus the stay was far over one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/magh-mela-2022-only-fully-vaccinated-devotees-to-be-allowed/articleshow/87938889.cms||---

The government cannot evade its responsibility, leaving the textile industry to suffer. The government policies have also contributed to the current crisis.” He said the Cotton Corporation of India should take the responsibility to stabilize the cotton price and supply to the spinning mills at a fair price. PMK founder S Ramadoss said it was the duty of the central and state governments to protect the interests of the workers of the garment industry by addressing the yarn price rise issue. As an interim measure, he said, the Centre should ban cotton and yarn exports, which would arrest the shortage and ensure availability to domestic players. As a permanent solution, he said, the government should encourage cotton cultivation by providing incentives. “The TN government should form a state cotton corporation to procure cotton grown here and spin yarn.” AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran tweeted expressing solidarity with Tirupur garment manufacturers and urged the Centre to bring down the prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/to-stabilise-cotton-prices-leaders-now-seek-centres-intervention/articleshow/87938879.cms||---

The case pertains to former pink police officer of Attingal police station M R Rajitha, accusing the girl and her father of stealing her mobile phone from the official vehicle. The phone was later found from Rajitha's bag kept inside the vehicle. In the order, Commission chairperson K V Manoj Kumar observed that the disciplinary action taken by the police department, which involves transferring the officer to another wing and sending her for training, was insufficient considering the mental trauma experienced by the young girl. Commission chairper said that a uniformed officer trying to portray a minor girl as a thief in public and attempting to take the little girl into police custody was something that could not be taken lightly and it warranted proper legal action under appropriate sections under Juvenile Justice Act. The Commission chairperson also held that the damage to the image of the police department and the mental trauma of the little girl caused by the accused pink police officer Rajitha's actions could not be mended so easily. It was in August this year that the 8-year-old girl and her father faced public harassment at the hands of pink police officer Rajitha. The father and daughter duo was waiting beside the national highway at Moonnumukku near Attingal here to watch the passing of giant machinery to Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in the city when the officer falsely accused them of phone theft. Currently, a defamation case filed by the girl's father against the pink police officer is under consideration of the state High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/register-case-against-pink-police-officer/articleshow/87938132.cms||---

While the lamp was officially lit by party chief Lalu Prasad, his name was there at the top followed by the name of leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Among others whose names were inscribed on the stone as the dignitaries present were the party’s state treasurer Sunil Kumar Singh, state secretary general Alok Mehta and state president Jagdanand Singh. However, names of RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari and national secretary general Abdul Bari Siddiqui were missing from the stone even though they were present at the event. Apart from Tiwari and Siddiqui, several other senior leaders who have carried out duties in the party in senior posts in the past were also present at the function, but their names were missing. For instance, Uday Narayan Choudhary’s name was not there. Choudhary is the former state president of RJD. An RJD leader said there was anger among workers and supporters of different leaders. “RJD is trying to project itself as a party of A to Z, but people who managed to get their names on the stone do not represent A to Z. Laluji had always worked for the social justice and gave voice and representation to such people in politics who never dreamt of it. EBCs, Dalits and minorities have been our vote bank, but they are now unhappy with the party,” said an RJD leader. However, party’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said since the programme had been organised by the state unit of the RJD, names of president, secretary general and treasurer were there. “Shivanand Tiwariji and Siddiquiji are our patrons and we have huge respect for them,” Gagan said, adding another signboard had also been put up near the lamp with the names of those who had carried out the duty as state president and Siddiqui’s and Ramai Ram’s names were there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/murmur-in-rjd-as-some-senior-leaders-ignored/articleshow/87918085.cms||Sheezan Nezami

He was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the third edition of Orange City Literature Festival (OCLF), a project by SGR Knowledge Foundation, at Chitnavis Centre, Civil Lines, on Friday. Sinha graced the ceremony as the chief guest along with music director Ismail Darbar who was the guest of honour. Author Radhakrishnan Pillai, chairman of Raisoni Group and OCLF Sunil Raisoni and executive members of the organizing committee Rajan Welukar and Varsha Manohar were present. The guests launched Pillai’s 20th book titled ‘The art of winning - The Chanakya way’. Shweta Shelgaonkar conducted the programme. Addressing the gathering of avid readers and literature enthusiasts, Sinha said, “We have an extensive variety of books, including fiction, classics, literature, etc which hold the mirror of the society. What we have read ages ago leaves an indelible imprint in our minds. It is commendable that even in this era of fake news and ‘godi media’, people can discover literature that touches their hearts and moulds their minds.” Mesmerized by Sinha from an early age, Darbar revealed how he was inspired by the actor. He said, “Films have been my studies since childhood. I set my target of becoming a music director and attaining a certain level of stardom after watching Sinha in films. After winning a national award for my first film ‘Hum dil de chuke sanam’, I realized I was one step closer.” He added, “I decided to make a career in the realm of cinema but I encourage my children to focus on studies and reading so that they can present themselves in front of society and speak. The only powerful factor in life that does not disgrace you is your studies.” In his welcome remark, Welukar said, “In the last 5,000 years, it has been observed that literature is a medium through which communities and the world evolve. There is no other entity that holds such power. Thus, OCLF was instituted three years ago to echo such an environment. The increasing participation each year is a testament to the success of this festival.” Delivering the presidential address, Raisoni said, “From the first to the third edition of OCLF, we have witnessed many transformations. We initiated the concept but the value that it creates is because of every person associated with the festival. It gives immense happiness and satisfaction when your initiative gets recognized. OCLF is a property that our team is trying to groom for the city and it is open for all.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED searches Shiv Sena leader Arjun Khotkar; it’s political vendetta, he says||MUMBAI/AURANGABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday searched the premises of Shiv Sena leader and former minister Arjun Khotkar at Jalna and Aurangabad in connection with the purchase of Ramnagar sugar mill, in a money-laundering case related with the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank fraud. The ED team was also spotted at the Agriculture Market Produce Committee, which is currently led by Khotkar, a two-time minister, including during the 2014-19 BJP-Sena government. The searches continued till late night. When contacted, Khotkar confirmed the ED raid and said it was still under way. “It is nothing but a political vendetta on the behest of BJP and Union railway minister Raosaheb Danve. I’ll speak in detail, once the ED is done with its raid,” he said. The ED is investigating many sugar mills that had defaulted loans availed from state district cooperative banks or MSC Bank and subsequently auctioned to the office-bearer of the banks or their close relatives at less than the market rate. Earlier this month, the agency had searched the premises of Aurangabad-based industrialist Padmakar Muley, Khotkar’s partner in the Ramnagar sugar mill. Muley is related to a senior IPS officer serving in Mumbai. It is alleged that the sugar mill had defaulted the MSC Bank loan after the bank auctioned it to cover its loss, and it was auctioned at less than the reserve price to favour the purchaser. Builder Jugal Kishor Tapadiya, along with Khotkar, had bought the mill in 2012. Khotkar has nominal shares. Later, Tapadiya sold his shares to Muley. Recently, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had alleged that Ramnagar sugar mill came into existence in 1986-87, and 9,000 shares worth Rs 20,000 each were given to farmers. The outstanding loan of the bank in 2007 was Rs 11.4 crore, and it was forced to auction the mill in 2012. It is alleged that though the Ready Reckoner rate of the mill land was Rs 70 crore, it was undervalued for auction. Tapadiya won the bid for Rs 42.3 crore, but he took nearly Rs 37.8 crore advance for sale from Arjun Sugar Industries and deposited the amount in MSCB on December 3, 2012. Arjun Industries allegedly got a loan of Rs 32 crore from AjeetSeeds, while Tapadiya sold the mill to Arjun Industries for Rs 27.6 crore. The 100 acres of land, worth Rs 940 crore, that the state had given on lease has been usurped by Khotkar, alleged Somaiya. The entries made on the revenue record have been challenged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ed-searches-shiv-sena-leader-its-political-vendetta-he-says/articleshow/87939433.cms||Vijay V Singh

The FIR in the case registered based on a complaint by bookie Ketan Tanna states that in addition the to extorting Rs 1.25 crore from him, the accused also extorted over Rs 3 crore from his friend and alleged bookie Sonu Jalan in the same way. Param Bir Singh at the Thane nagar police station on FridayPolicemen were deployed at the periphery of the Thane nagar police station as the tehsil office and other government offices have a common entry to the complex. Since May, Singh had not reported to work after he was shunted out in March from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in the wake of his allegations of corruption against former home minister Anil Deshmukh in a letter he sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Subsequently, criminal cases were registered against him in Thane and Mumbai. A police source said Singh appeared calm and confident with the SIT that has been formed to probe the case registered against him and 28 others, including former cop Pradeep Sharma, DCP Deepak Deoraj, inspector Rajkumar Kothmire and alleged ‘collection agent’ Vikas Dabhade. It was around 3 pm that Singh went to the Thane court and through his legal team moved an application in Thane court to cancel the non-bailable warrant issued against him by the chief judicial magistrate R J Tambe on October 26. The court cancelled his non-bailable warrant on certain conditions, which include Rs 15,000 as surety, among other conditions. After that, he came back to Thane Nagar police station at around 4 pm and was there till 7 pm. Advocate Rajendra Mokashi, counsel for Param Bir Singh said, “Singh could not present himself in the court due to health reasons, but hereafter he shall remain present whenever summoned. The court, while cancelling his non-bailable warrant, told him to remain present whenever his presence is required for further investigations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-singh-goes-to-court-then-returns-to-cop-station-to-record-statement/articleshow/87939467.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh renames Mughal Road in Agra after Maharaja Agrasen||AGRA: The UP government has renamed the well-known Mughal Road in Agra. It will now be called Maharaja Agrasen Road. The city's mayor, Naveen Jain, justified the rechristening of Mughal Road and said that "the demand came from residents of Kamla Nagar, a majority of whom are followers of Maharaja Agrasen". Legend has it that Agrasen was the king of Agroha, a city of traders in ancient times. He was a descendant of Kush, the son of Lord Ram. Earlier, the name of Sultanganj Ki Pulia was changed to Vikal Chowk, after the late Satyaprakash Vikal, a BJP leader and the five-time MLA from Agra East, these days called Agra North. This came even as the state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya announced on Friday that Ramghat Marg in Aligarh will now be known as Ramghat Kalyan Marg in memory of former Rajasthan governor and former UP CM Kalyan Singh. Maurya described Singh as a "devout devotee of Lord Ram". He added that the state government has announced plans to rename important roads in several districts in the name of 'Babu ji' Kalyan Singh. Addressing a public meeting in Aligarh, Maurya said "opposition leaders including Akhilesh Yadav, Priyanka Gandhi, her brother Rahul and (Asaduddin) Owaisi will chant slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat mata ki jai' after we come to power again in UP in 2022”. Maurya said that with the opening of the defence corridor in Aligarh, the district has got an opportunity to develop into a major hub for production of high-tech and precision defence equipment. “Missiles manufactured in Aligarh will be used in Islamabad if Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan encourages terror factories,” he said.

---||India||Won’t tweet till judge decides: Malik||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Friday submitted before Bombay high court that he was willing to have the November 22 order of a single judge set aside and to not make any public posts or tweets against Dnyandev Wankhede or his son, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and family even beyond December 9, till the single-judge bench decides the interim application against him. His counsel Karl Tamboly made this plea in a bid to work out the appeal filed by Wankhede for an interim order to restrain Malik, members of NCP of which he is spokesperson and any others acting under him from making any false or defamatory posts and public statements against the Wankhede family. Wankhede’s senior counsel Birendra Saraf and Divakar Rai sought time to think over the suggestion made by Malik, and the HC bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav posted the matter on Monday. On Thursday, when Wankhede’s appeal was taken up, the HC had recorded a statement from Malik as his undertaking that no public tweets would be made against Wankhede family till December 9, when the appeal would be heard next. Saraf had argued that the single judge had found the minister’s tweets to be “actuated by malice or personal animosity” but had only said his future tweets should be after reasonable verification, though what should have followed was a restraint on him. Justice Kathawalla at the hearing also orally said, “He is a minister, does it befit him to do all this.” The NCB officer’s father had on November 5 moved the HC with a suit against Malik for his allegedly defamatory tweets and public comments and filed an interim application for orders to restrain him from doing so. On November 22, Justice Madhav Jamdar, while deciding a plea for urgent orders to restrain Malik said in a 50-page order that the minister’s tweets, posts and press conferences were actuated by malice and personal animosity against Wankhede. Justice Jamdar also said that Malik “cannot be said to have acted after reasonable verification of facts”, however “at this stage” it cannot be said that allegations by Malik are totally false. The single judge said at this stage, he cannot accept Wankhede’s plea for a “blanket” order to restrain Malik, but to balance the fundamental rights on both sides and directed him to tweet only after reasonable verification. Justice Jamdar directed Malik to file a reply to the interim application filed by Wankhede and posted the matter for hearing on December 20. Wankhede, meanwhile, filed an appeal before the division bench, saying Justice Jamdar ought to have restrained Malik after giving a finding of malice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wont-tweet-till-judge-decides-malik/articleshow/87940581.cms||---

However, the junctions leading to HD Kote and Bannur Road along ORR remain bottlenecks, much to the frustration of regular commuters, for whom negotiating the dense traffic at these spots is a recurrent nightmare. Gridlock at these junctions is largely the consequence of the presence of commercial establishments at the very edge, resulting in haphazardly parked vehicles, which disrupt smooth flow of traffic. Although Mysuru city traffic police designated the Hunsur Road junction along ORR a zero-tolerance zone in the tragic aftermath of an accident between a two-wheeler and a tipper that claimed the life of a the two-wheeler rider, similar measures have not been adopted at other potentially hazardous spots on ORR. Deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic) MS Geetha said that there were, in all, 26 black spots across Mysuru city. “We have installed traffic signal poles at all these spots, which are being either automatically or manually operated. The number of vehicles in Mysuru city is increasing each day, but we are managing the situation, and monitoring traffic closely to prevent accidents. There are no plans as of now to declare the HD Kote and Bannur Road junctions along ORR zero-tolerance zones,” Geetha told TOI. A junction or stretch of a road is deemed a ‘black spot’ if five accidents, fatal and otherwise, are reported within a 500m-radius of the place in three years. Senior advocate BS Chandrakantha Rao expressed concern over the marked increase in vehicular movement on ORR in the past few years. “Installing signal poles will not prevent accidents, given that many youngsters using the road ignore the rules. Police must deploy personnel at these junctions to deter motorists from violating traffic rules. This will ensure that motorists are fined on the spot. They must place barricades in such a manner that it forces motorists to drive slowly, in addition to which closed circuit television cameras must be installed to keep an eye on traffic movement,” Rao added. However, it is only a sense of heightened awareness among commuters that would prove most effective in bringing down the number of accidents, Rao added. “Police must strive to create awareness about traffic rules among students at schools and colleges. Police must deploy more cops at junctions to prevent mishaps,” the advocate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/black-spots-on-mysuru-outer-ring-road-remain-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/87938025.cms||---

---||Goa||Transport dept to begin strict checks on digital fare meters next week in Goa||PANAJI: Taxi operators in Goa who have failed to install digital fare meters in their vehicles will soon face the music of the directorate of transport. Starting next week, vehicles plying in the state without the device will be challaned and a penalty will be imposed. The government had earlier set a deadline of October 31 for the series-wise fitments of digital meters, following which the pending taxi operators were given until this month to get the installation complete. “Now that the deadline is over, action against violators will begin,” director of transport, Rajan Satardekar told TOI. Though a previous government order instructed the cancellation of taxi permits on failure to install the meters, the order was repealed by transport minister Mauvin Godinho. Taxi operators were then granted 100% subsidy on the installation of the device following which there was a slight surge in bookings. Now, to ensure that taxis follow the mandated rule, there will be checks on highways and state roads by the police. “We will stop taxis without meters from plying and challan them. We have not started issuing orders for cancellation of the taxi permits, but technically they are to be treated as cancelled since they are in violation for not installing the meters by the deadline. Simultaneously, fitment of pending vehicles is ongoing. However, the vehicles without fitment must not legally ply,” Satardekar said. He further said that the act of challaning the violating taxi vehicles will serve as paper-proof of their disobedience. “There is an immediate cash pinch because the violator is forced to pay an amount. We will intensify this move from next week onwards,” he added. There are roughly around 20,000 taxis registered in the state, of which about 16,000 are operational. As on November 20, only 4,109 vehicles have been fitted with the meters, and 2,631 bookings are awaiting installation. At the last hearing, the high court of Bombay at Goa grilled the Goa government on its poor implementation of the scheme after the directorate of transport submitted a status report on the installation of meters in taxis, which stated that only 65-75 digital fare meters are being installed daily and more than 2,000 vehicles are yet to be installed with meters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/transport-dept-to-begin-strict-checks-on-digital-fare-meters-next-week/articleshow/87938964.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Kolkata||Some take boards from foreign shores, many others return||Kolkata: A handful of ICSE students are set to take their Class X board exams from as far as Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia, from Monday. They are Armenian youngsters, who study at Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy, a 137-year-old school meant for the community on Free School Street, affiliated to CISCE. These students had gone back to their country 20 months ago, when their school—a residential institute—shut the campus for the Covid pandemic. With educational institutes in Kolkata remaining shut till recently and the various restrictions as well as risks involved in travel right now, the council has allowed the students to appear for their boards from a university in Yerevan, with which the school has made some arrangements. An Armenian girl at La Martiniere for Girls, is also writing her ISC papers from her country. Six boys in Armenia will write their papers from Gevorgian Theological Seminary at Vagharshapat near Yerevan. It is a university and professors there will help conduct the tests. “We have made the arrangements with permission from the council. We are in touch with our boys, the centre there and the council here. We hope all will be fine and the boys can appear for the exam,” said Debanjali Chowdhury, principal of Armenian College. Principal of La Martiniere for Girls Rupkatha Sarkar is also in touch with her lone foreign student, who is writing her ISC exams from Armenia. But not all foreign candidates are staying back in their countries. Several students from Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal have returned to their boarding schools in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong to take their ISC and ICSE exams. An Indian student at South City International School, who had been stuck in Mombasa, Kenya. Her parents had requested the school to help her write her ICSE exams from there, said principal John Bagul. “The council permitted the school to arrange for a centre for her in the Indian embassy if possible. But the parents brought her back this week,” he said. A few hundred students from Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh have returned to their institutes in the Hills, such as St Joseph’s North Point, St Paul’s, Himali Boarding School and Rockvale Academy, for their boards. They had also initially requested their schools to arrange for centres in their countries, but their parents eventually sent them back. “All our foreign students are back on campus. We have made Covid-appropriate arrangements because they will live on the campus for the duration of the board exam. We are delighted to have them back,” said Father Leo, principal at St Joseph’s School, North Point. St Paul’s School principal Reverend Joy Halder said, “We do not have any Thai student this time. All our foreign students from Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh are back,” he said. Robi Subba, principal at Himali Boarding School, said, “Had Thai students been here, they might have asked us to arrange for centres in their home countries but the pandemic saw an exodus of Thai students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-take-boards-from-foreign-shores-many-others-return/articleshow/87938944.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||AAP govt will continue to back farmers: Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Addressing a special session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the farmers’ protest against the three agri laws was fought just like India’s freedom struggle and their victory was a victory of democracy. Kejriwal said the farmers would decide how long they wanted to continue their protest and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government would keep supporting them. Delhi assembly on Friday passed a resolution tabled by AAP MLA and cabinet minister Gopal Rai demanding that the three farm laws be repealed, compensation for families of the farmers who died during the protests, withdrawal of “false” cases against them and a legal guarantee of minimum support price for crops. “Exactly one year ago, the protest started after the Centre passed the three laws. They did not bother to ask or consult the farmers even once about this decision. This ended up wreaking havoc across the country because of their arrogance. Because they have a majority in Lok Sabha and lead Rajya Sabha, they have been blinded by this sense of arrogance that they can get away with tyranny,” said Kejriwal. Congratulating the farmers, Kejriwal said the movement saw participation of people from across the society directly or indirectly. “The farmers fought through tough summers, rains and even Covid-19 and dengue. It’s because of such determination that their demands were met. In my understanding, this is possibly the longest active movement in the history of humanity. The protests were also the most peaceful and patient that I have ever come across,” he added. “Those in power left no opportunity to slander and hurl abuses at the annadaatas. They tried to wreck their spirit. What happened in Lakhimpur is absolutely ghastly and brutal. They are so shameless that they would not have arrested the culprits had the Supreme Court not intervened,” said the CM. Mentioning that the farmers were also called anti-national, Kejriwal asked, “Are the farmers of this country who put in their blood, sweat and tears to feed us anti-nationals? What do we make of those who were trying to crush the movement by putting tags like anti-national, terrorists, Khalistani, Chinese and Pakistani agents on them?” Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the farmers had set an example for the next generation on how they could get their point across by peaceful agitation. “The central government allocated a budget of Rs 100 crore to end the farmers’ movement. Tributes were paid in Rajya Sabha for a plane crash in Jakarta, but not for the 700 farmers who died fighting for their rights,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-govt-will-continue-to-back-farmers-cm/articleshow/87938912.cms||---

---||Navi-mumbai||Two teens booked for their college mate’s suicide in Navi Mumbai||NAVI MUMBAI: The Nhava Sheva police have registered an FIR against two 16-year-olds following their college mate’s suicide in Ulwe earlier this month. Before his death, the victim also aged 16 had sent an Instagram message stating that he was driven to the drastic step after the two accused assaulted him and then threatened to attack him again if he showed up at college. The assault was also witnessed by some college students, whose statements were recorded by the police. The duo had allegedly attacked him for telling a girl from the college that one of the accused was a ‘charsi’ (addict). On November 12, around 3.50pm, the victim’s father returned from office, saw the teen’s shoes outside the house and assumed he was asleep in the bedroom. When his son did not emerge from the bedroom by 5pm, he went inside and found him hanging from the ceiling. The police were summoned, and the victim was taken to the Panvel sub-district hospital, where he was declared dead. The police registered an accidental death case.  Two days later, the victim’s brother spoke to a college friend who revealed that the victim had sent an Instagram message after returning from college that day. In the message, the victim wrote that he was driven to suicide because he had been assaulted by two boys near his college and they had threatened to thrash him again if he went back to the campus in Seawoods. The victim had named the boys in his message. His friend shared a screenshot of the message, which was submitted to the police by the father while lodging a police complaint on November 15. Madhukar Bhate, Inspector of Nhava Sheva police, said, “Based on the evidence submitted by the deceased boy’s father, we have registered an FIR against the two accused college boys. They have been booked under section 306 (abetment of suicide), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.” “As the accused are minors, we have not arrested them. But they will be produced before the court, when we file a chargesheet,” added the Nhava Sheva inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-2-teens-booked-for-their-college-mates-suicide/articleshow/87939484.cms||George Mendonca
---||Delhi||Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni added to pilgrimage scheme||New Delhi: Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni have been added to the existing list of 13 yatra routes under the Delhi government’s Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojna. The government said on Friday that devotees would be provided berths in AC-III-tier trains for the Velankanni trip, while for Kartarpur Sahib, deluxe 2x2 AC buses would be arranged. The first batch of pilgrims for Kartarpur Sahib will depart on January 5, 2022 and the first train for Velankanni on January 7. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot reviewed the preparations for the resumption of Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojna and the Ayodhya trip on December 3. Officials of the revenue and IT departments, Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation, Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti and Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation were present at the meeting. After recently announcing the addition of Ayodhya in the scheme for Delhi’s senior citizens, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced inclusion of Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan and Velankanni in Tamil Nadu. The government said the 15,000 applicants of 2019 who couldn’t avail the facility due to the Covid pandemic last year would receive text messages informing them about the option of amending their applications for choosing Ayodhya and also uploading fully vaccinated certificates on the e-district portal. The government will provide doctors and paramedical staff to accompany the devotees. Any Delhi resident who has completed 60 years can apply under the scheme on the e-district portal, irrespective of their financial status. An attendant above the age of 21 years can also accompany each senior citizen pilgrim who can avail this scheme only once during his/her lifetime. The beneficiary is provided travel in AC-III tier or AC 2X2 buses, subject to the availability. The travellers will also be provided free AC accommodation wherever available, the government said. The scheme was launched by the chief minister on July 12, 2019, under which a total of 1,100 residents per assembly constituency can avail themselves of the facility in a year, subject to the cap of total 77,000 yatris annually. Since its launch, 35,080 beneficiaries have travelled under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kartarpur-sahib-and-velankanni-added-to-pilgrimage-scheme/articleshow/87938937.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It’s the crushing season and hordes of labourers from the Marathwada region have descended upon the district to supplement the local workforce in cutting cane. And that has got the health authorities worried as several among the migrants are not vaccinated against Covid. Since the last few days, teams of doctors, nurses and ASHA (accredited social health activist) workers have been visiting sugarcane fields across villages in the district to get the cutters vaccinated. In fact, Kolhapur is the only sugarcane-growing district in the state where the cutters are getting their jabs. Over one lakh migrants, comprising cane-cutters, their children and elderly family members, arrive in the district during the season and stay here for over four months. They usually live in one place for 4-6 days before moving to another village. Prajakta Jadhav, medical officer with the Hupari primary health centre, mvoed along with her team from village to village to vaccinate the cutters. Jadhav says these cutters and their families come in contact with local residents, especially farmers and vendors from whom they get their rations. Many of the men visit the local country liquor shops after their demanding 12-15 hours’ work in the fields. Jadhav says, “During the early morning hours, the women cutters prepare their meals and attend to the children before travelling with their husbands to the fields. They return home mostly after dusk. Our health staff sometimes visit their shelters to vaccinate the women but the men are usually intoxicated by then. Therefore, we try to get them vaccinated in the fields itself. Their ‘mukadams’ (labour contractors) help us locate them.” Health staff have found that most cutters, especially the women, have not even taken the first Covid vaccine dose. The cutters, both men and women, shy away from the jab as they fear getting fever or weakness which will keep them out of work till they recuperate, thereby losing daily wages. Santosh Balshiram, a cutter from Arvi village in Beed district, said, “I did not fall ill after taking my second dose but my wife had pain in her shoulders for two days after her jab and couldn’t work. However, the contractor paid her wages for only one of those two days.” The officials have now told the sugarcane mills to direct the contractors not to deduct wages. “Some of those taking the first jab developed minor adverse effects for which we provided painkillers. We have told the mukadams not to cut wages,” said district health officer Yogesh Sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-vaccinators-ready-jabs-for-migrant-cane-cutters-in-the-fields/articleshow/87937475.cms||---

Ambergris is a solid waxy substance that originates in the intestines of a sperm whale and is used for making medicines and to stabilise the scent of perfumes. The cost of the seized Ambergris is between Rs 5 to 6 crore. Based on a tip-off, the police picked up Yogesh Joshi, the accused, from Aarey. He is a shop owner from Beed and does not have a crime record in Mumbai. Cops are trying to find out where he sourced the ambergris from. “We are also in the process of identifying his associates.

---||India||Assam, Mizoram to form panels to resolve border dispute||GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga, at a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Friday, decided to form committees to resolve the decades-old border dispute between the two states while maintaining peace. Sarma and Zoramthanga met in person over dinner at the Assam Bhawan in the national capital on Thursday for the first time after the border flare-up on July 26 resulted in the death of six Assam Police personnel in firing by Mizoram Police at Lailapur on Assam side of the border. “Both chief ministers met Amit Shah in his residence and it was decided that both the states will constitute committees for resolving the border disputes through discussions. If necessary, the committees will also have members from the Opposition. To work for resolving the dispute, we will also have CM-level meetings whenever necessary,” Sarma said after the meeting. Sarma later tweeted, “Heartening to share that I along with HCM Mizoram Sri @ZoramthangaCM met Hon HM Sri @AmitShah this evening in New Delhi. We reaffirmed our resolve to maintain peace and tranquility at our borders.” Sarma said border skirmishes are mostly due to local causes. “These incidents are not fuelled by either Mizoram or the Assam government but locally generated like someone building a road. In the last six months, the two governments held discussions and resolved the issues peacefully whenever such situations arose,” he added. Both the leaders, along with Assam border affairs minister Atul Borah, met on Thursday, which was the first face-to-face meeting since the July incident. Zoramthanga, after Thursday’s dinner meeting, said, “I was invited by Himanta Biswa Sarma for dinner. Since we are good friends, more like brothers, we had a very good time. We tried to deepen our friendship.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-mizoram-to-form-panels-to-resolve-border-dispute/articleshow/87940589.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Goa||Goa: BJP eyes political fortune in Navelim||MARGAO: Since securing the Davorlim zilla panchayat (ZP) seat — a part of the Navelim assembly constituency — at the ZP elections held last year, BJP has been fancying its chances of winning the Navelim seat in the 2022 polls. With Luizinho Faleiro quitting as Congress MLA to join Trinamool Congress (TMC) and thus vacating the political space in Navelim, the altered political situation has bolstered the ambitions of the saffron party to breach the Congress citadel. With Faleiro having represented Navelim constituency for close to 30 years, political observers say that the former chief minister has cultivated a large loyal voter base. It is on the strength of these assured votes that Faleiro had managed to stage a comeback to local politics in 2017, after almost a decade of isolation following his defeat in the 2007 assembly polls. Faleiro won the seat polling over 8,000 votes, more than half of which are believed to be his “personal loyalty votes”. Political observers say that the behaviour of this large chunk of votes, in the event Faleiro decides not to contest from Navelim, will be crucial in determining the outcome of the 2022 polls. While Faleiro has maintained that he will take a “right decision in the interest of the people of Navelim”, political observers decipher the statement to mean that he may prop up a candidate of his choice on the TMC ticket. Besides, sources say, that with nearly a quarter of the total electorate from Navelim belonging to the Muslim community, concentrated largely in Rumdamol, Davorlim, and Ravanfond areas, political parties are working out strategies to woo these voters. BJP, party sources said, is also toying with the idea of fielding a Muslim face from Navelim with an eye on these minority votes. As it’s likely to be a multi-cornered fight in Navelim, the outcome will be determined largely on the strength of a candidates’ personal appeal in addition to his/her party’s traditional votes. Satyavijay Naik, who contested as its candidate for the Navelim ZP polls, its Davorlim ZP member Ulhas Tuyekar, its Navelim mandal vice-president, Paresh Dessai, besides party spokesperson Urfan Mulla, are strong claimants of the ticket. While NCP Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao is seeking a NCP ticket for his daughter Valanka from Navelim — NCP-Congress alliance talks are learnt to have got stuck over this demand — political observers don’t rule out Valanka contesting on a TMC ticket or as an independent if the alliance deal doesn’t work out on Alemao’s terms. Alemao had trounced Faleiro in Navelim in the 2007 polls contesting on the Save Goa Front party, and has a significant voter base in this constituency. He has now given a deadline of November 29 for the NCP leadership to decide on the alliance, failing which he would be free to take his own decision. Avertano Furtado, who had contested against Faleiro in the 2017 polls, is now in the Congress camp and its probable candidate, while AAP functionary Pratima Coutinho, who had contested as a Congress candidate in the Navelim ZP bypolls held earlier this year, is being projected as the AAP candidate for 2022 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-eyes-political-fortune-in-navelim/articleshow/87938946.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||Jaipur||Parents happy as students can’t be forced for offline classes||Jaipur: Guidelines of the government preventing private schools from forcing parents to send their children for offline classes have come as a relief to the parents. It has been a long time that parents have been fighting to get this option looking at the rising number of Covid cases in schools. Earlier, guidelines were silent on this aspect and education officials had said that it is between schools and parents to give online education or offline. Abhishek Jain, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh, said, “There is a need to change as the majority of the schools went offline mode with 100% capacity. This increased risk of students being infected. Our fears came true with students being found positive. It is a relief to us parents that finally the government has accepted our demands for that.” Total of 29 students in Jaipur have been found positive of Coronavirus. More than 80% of schools have made it compulsory to send students for offline classes. It was said to be very difficult for students in the primary section to maintain social distancing in school. School authorities said that not every school has the facilities to provide online and offline education simultaneously. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said, “We welcomed the state government’s decision and will abide by this. If parents are not willing to send their children to school, no one will force them. We are trying to improve our infrastructure to provide better online classes to the students.” Lower-income schools are finding it difficult to adjust as neither they have facility nor the students have proper gadgets for online classes. However, looking at the rising number of cases, it is difficult to organise complete offline classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parents-happy-as-students-cant-be-forced-for-offline-classes/articleshow/87938951.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Citizens still unaware of EWS quota’||Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said that it has been a year since he has made the benefit of economically weaker section (EWS) reservations available in Goa. However, those eligible for it are still unaware of the benefit they can get through reservation in jobs as well as in education institutions. “It has been one year since I approved the EWS scheme, but the person who is eligible for it himself does not know. If we do not inform the person then who will? They are eligible for 10% reservation in the case of jobs as well as educational institutes,” said Sawant. He also said that nearly 50% of the works of citizens stuck due to inter-departmental issues have been resolved in the state since the launch of the Sarkar Tumchya Daari programme. Sawant was in Shiroda to attend the programme on Friday. “At least the issues of 50% citizens have been resolved under the Sarkar Tumchya Daari programme. The work was possibly stuck because of inter-departmental issues. Every field functionary sees what the issue is and even if it cannot be resolved on the spot, they make sure they get it resolved the next day by calling the citizen to their office. Within the next 8-10 days, the work of the remaining 50% people will be done,” said the chief minister. “The government has 210 schemes to offer, not just Griha Aadhar, DDSSY, DSY and Laadli Laxmi. We are here to give to the people, not to just give assurances,” Sawant said, hitting out at the opposition. There are some who are calling Sarkar Tumchya Daari an election gimmick, said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-still-unaware-of-ews-quota/articleshow/87938952.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||2 weeks after pollution forced them shut, schools open to low turnout||Gurgaon: Both private and government schools opened for physical classes on Friday since they had closed gates on November 13 over rising pollution levels in the city. The first day, however, saw only a few students, with low attendance recorded across schools. “The first day saw a mixed response from parents and students. While a few schools, especially the senior section ones, saw a healthy turnout, the attendance in others was a little disappointing. We hope that the strength of students in the schools improve in the coming days,” said an education department official. With the air quality hovering in the 'very poor' and 'severe' categories, the schools had remained closed for nearly two weeks. Initially, physical classes were suspended only for a week, but the administration last week extended the suspension until further notice. However, a late evening order issued by deputy commissioner Yash Garg on Thursday lifted the suspension and allowed educational institutions to start calling students back to school. Several private schools and their associations welcomed the move, but it has received a subdued response from students and parents. On Friday, only a few students turned up at the schools, with most choosing to continue with online classes. Schools across the city recorded 30-50% attendance. “The attendance was poor. Only a handful of kids came for the classes, with most of them choosing not to come. It is primarily because the order came late in the evening. Although we circulated messages in the Whatsapp groups, many parents and students might not have seen them or have chosen to take a day or two before restarting school,” said Asha Miglani, the principal of Model Sanskriti School. The order took parents and schools by surprise. While many parents were not aware of the new order until Friday morning, others preferred to check on the air quality over the weekend before sending their kids back to schools. Some parents were not in town and had gone for trips, assuming that schools might not reopen before Monday. “We were anticipating that schools may open around November 26. So, we had informed the parents. But today, we saw only 30% students attending school. Parents are taking it slow before responding to the order. Also, due to the wedding season, perhaps, a few are out of town for the weekend,” said Rashmi Malik, the Salwan Public School principal. Meanwhile, some schools chose not to reopen on Friday and would open from Monday instead. “We received the order late in the evening. At such short notice, informing all the parents, bus drivers, and the other staff would have been too hasty. So, we have decided to gear up during the weekend and resume classes from Monday,” said Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-weeks-after-pollution-forced-them-shut-schools-open-to-low-turnout/articleshow/87939580.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The PM will pay tributes at the martyr’s memorial at Azad Maidan in Panaji and will inaugurate several new projects, Sawant said, following a meeting with officials of all state department to discuss the PM’s visit. “To mark the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation, we have invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi on behalf of Goa government and the people of Goa. This year, for the Liberation Day programme, we want him to come to Goa and inaugurate different Central and state-funded projects. We also want his presence for the programme on Atmanirbhar Bharat Swayampurna Goem,” said Sawant. At present, the PM’s visit is planned only as a day-long event, he said. “It has been tentatively fixed that the Prime Minister will be present for the programme on December 19. To mark the 60th year of Liberation, the PM will definitely come to Goa and will address the people of Goa,” said Sawant. The final schedule of his visit will only be announced after it is confirmed by the PMO, he said. “The first meeting on his meeting was held today and the heads of all departments were present. All officials have shared their ideas and different options for the day’s programme will be prepared and sent to the PM’s office for approval. The main programme we have planned is inauguration of the superspecialty hospital and the renovated Aguada jail project, done with central government funds,” said Sawant. He said discussion is presently on about whether the main event should be held at the Campal Grounds or at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium. “The Prime Minister will also visit the memorial at Azad Maidan to pay his tribute to martyrs of Goa’s freedom movement. We want him to hand over the cheques for new approved projects of Rs 50 lakh to panchayats and Rs 1 crore to municipalities. We want him to felicitate sarpanch, panch, swayampurna mitras and beneficiaries,” said Sawant. The event will also see remembrance of freedom fighters in the presence of their families, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pmo-has-tentatively-confirmed-modis-goa-visit-on-dec-19-sawant/articleshow/87938959.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CNG costs Rs 61.5 per kg from today, third hike in 2 months||MUMBAI: The price of compressed natural gas (CNG) will be hiked by Rs 3.96 per kg, including taxes, from Saturday while the rate of piped cooking gas will go up by Rs 2.57 per unit. The revised price of CNG, including all taxes, in Mumbai metropolitan region from Saturday morning will be Rs 61.50 per kg while piped gas rates will escalate to Rs 36.50 per unit. This is the third hike in CNG rates in the past two months. Also, this year, its rate in Mumbai metropolitan region has gone up by around Rs 14 in 10 months. A CNG car owner said that she had switched to the green fuel two years back as it was cheaper than petrol and diesel, but the Rs 14 hike this year has hit her expense on transportation. As for kaali-peeli taxis, Mumbai Taximen’s union leader A L Quadros said that due to the huge hikes in 2021, many drivers want to switch to electric cabs in future. Mumbai Rickshawmen’s union leader Thampy Kurien said that the fare hikes given earlier this year were based on CNG price being below Rs 50 per kg, but now it has gone over Rs 60 per kg --reducing drivers’ earnings. Many aggregator cabs too had switched from diesel to CNG to save costs, but now the hikes have reduced the drivers’ profits and they are likely to demand increase in fares, sources said. A spokesperson of Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) said even after price revision, CNG offers attractive savings of about 62% and 35% as compared to petrol and diesel respectively at current price levels in Mumbai. The comparative price of petrol is Rs 109.98 a litre and diesel is retailing at Rs 94.14 a litre. “Also, domestic piped gas offers 27% saving compared to current price of domestic LPG cylinder whose cost is nearly Rs 900 per cylinder in Mumbai. Piped gas is safe, reliable and environmentally friendly,” she added. Asked why prices were hiked, the official said: “In order tso meet the shortfall in domestic gas allocation, MGL is sourcing additional natural gas from the international market. Since there is a substantial increase in natural gas prices internationally, we are constrained to increase prices of CNG and piped gas in Mumbai.” In the past, there were two slabs for piped gas customers in housing societies, and now this has been discontinued. There will be just a single slab/price for all domestic consumers. Given the rising number of CNG vehicles, MGL plans to increase its CNG outlets from 272 to 372 in the coming months, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cng-costs-rs-61-5/kg-from-today-third-hike-in-2-mths/articleshow/87939585.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Travels & Travails: Farmers Look Back, Ahead||New Delhi: Mohini Kaur has been at the Singhu border for the past one year. The 61-year-old widow lived in a makeshift home at Singhu constructed by a do-gooder at a cost of Rs 13,000. The chill of winter, the sweltering heat of June and the pelting rain of August and the tear gas shells did not deter her or her fellow protesters from relenting on their demand for the repeal of three central farm laws. Friday marked a year of the protest at the Delhi borders and the mood at Singhu was that of a mini carnival. Kaur is now being assisted by 22-year-old Harjit, who has become a surrogate son for the her that she has lost. Harjit told TOI, “I will take aunty back home with me. After finishing my studies, I came to the protest site and have been with aunty for the last two months.” As usual, there were orations from the dais. Several speakers talked about their struggles of the past year. Their resilience was appreciated by singer Babbu Maan and actress Gul Panag, both of whom were there at Singhu on Friday to observe the anniversary of the farmers’ agitation. But there was some levity too and music blared from the tractors and people made merry. There were more than the unusual number of people at the protest site, with farmers from across the country, and some NRIs, arriving for the anniversary. Nichattar Singh, 86, is popular at Singhu and his home is known to all. Chortling heartily, he said, “86 and not out. I may complete a century but won’t go home until our demands are met. We have suffered a lot, but we have been able to persevere, thanks to the love and support we got from people in India and abroad. We came here for two days of protests, but the roads have become our home.” Among the protesters was a Class III student, Agam Singh, who has come all the way from Ambala to Singh. The youngster arrived with his father and grandfather, both farmers, and said “I am enjoying being here, with the langar, the tractor and trolley. I came here earlier too but since Friday marked a year of protests, it was special.” Juice seller Jagroop Singh also reached the capital from Amritsar. “The entire air is so full of energy. I was only able to come here on Thursday because I have to earn my livelihood too,” said Jagroop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/travels-travails-farmers-look-back-ahead/articleshow/87938961.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Nagpur||To boost student-forest bond, Nagpur zilla parishad to have ‘Van Adhapaks’||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Zilla Parishad will introduce the ‘Van Adhyapak’ (forest teachers) scheme in all its 1,500 schools in the district. Till now the scheme was is in force in schools in Ramtek and Parsheoni tehsils surrounding the Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR). On November 23, 2021, chief executive officer (CEO) Yogesh has issued directions to education officers, block development officers (BDOs) and block education officers (BEOs) on implementing the scheme in all the schools. “The basic idea is to strengthen the positive relationship between forest staff and students. We have 1,500 Zilla Parishad schools in the district. To fight against climate change, sensitizing young minds about forest and wildlife conservation is the need of the hour,” Kumbhejkar told TOI. “Some Van Adyapaks have already been trained by Pench. These forest teachers will train the others. It’s just a beginning and we will make modifications in the scheme whenever the need arises,” added Kumbhejkar. He was one of the chief guests when the scheme was formally launched in Pench on September 5, Teacher’s Day. Chief conservator of forests (CCF) Ravikiran Govekar, now posted as joint secretary at Mantralaya, was the first to initiate the scheme in 2016-2017, at Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) but it was not implemented on a full scale. “The approaches for the conservation of wildlife and nature have been shifting from stringent protection to co-management and co-creation. A change in the mindset of citizens at a very early age will have a long-lasting impact,” said Govekar. “Stronger relationship building of uniformed forest staff and students can help in better conservation of forest and wildlife-bearing areas. We have been trying to institutionalize this over the years and the Zilla Parishad initiative will give a boost to this. We are trying to get similar support from the additional commissioner, tribal development, in the Nagpur region for tribal schools too. If it works well, this can be extended to a larger area in the state in the future,” added Govekar. “The essence of the scheme is that the uniformed frontline staff, right from forest guards to higher ranked officers, will regularly visit the nearby schools and educate students on the importance of wildlife, forest, the environment and its conservation,” says Atul Deokar, assistant conservator of forest (ACF). “Unlike celebrating certain days on an ad-hoc basis, this is a continuous activity carried out by trained forest staff/teachers. The motto of the scheme is ‘Van Rakshak-Van Shikshak’, the future ambassadors of conservation,” says Prabhunath Shukla, deputy director, Pench. Kumbhejkar said apart from the forest staff, some green teachers from schools willing to join this programme are also being involved and trained to make it more inclusive, broad-based and sustainable. “The scheme will also be implemented in the Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR),” said divisional forest officer (DFO) Rahul Gavai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/to-boost-student-forest-bond-nagpur-zp-to-have-van-adhapaks/articleshow/87936866.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

DoE has said that action will be initiated against schools violating the directives. On Thursday, offline classes began for Class VII and VIII students across the state after the government gave its approval. Classes for students of Class IX to XII were already on. “All the heads of government/government aided/primary/secondary/higher secondary and special schools in the state were informed to reopen schools from Class VII to Class XII (physical classes). All heads are hereby strictly directed not to reopen any other standard other than mentioned in the circulars, without permission of the DoE. Action will be initiated for non-compliance of this circular,” director Bhushan Savaikar has said in the circular issued on November 26. The state Covid task force and expert committee had told the state government earlier this month that it was safe to have physical classes for all students from nursery onwards. However, the government decided that only students from Class VII onwards will attend school in physical format.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-commence-physical-classes-below-class-vii/articleshow/87938962.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||UP Gate springs to life as thousands gather, vow to continue their protest||GHAZIABAD: The protest site at UP Gate sprang back to life on Friday, galvanised by the arrival of several thousand farmers to mark the milestone day their agitation at Delhi’s borders turned a year old. The sights – clapping, cheering and chorus of slogans – the energy and decibel levels were reminiscent of the mood in early February after Rakesh Tikait’s emotional call for support, but with a crucial difference. At that time, the crowds poured in to demand a repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws. On Friday, they came despite the PM announcing the repeal. From the protest stage, the message that Tikait and other speakers sent out was an unambiguous “andolan jari hai, jari rahega (our protest continues and will go on)” Setting the direction that the agitation will now take, with a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) as the focal point, Tikait said, “We have achieved a major victory (in the PM agreeing to repeal the farm laws), but it is only half a victory. A law on MSP was also our demand since the beginning, and till government accepts it, the protest will go on.” He added, “In this one year of this agitation, over 700 protesters have died (the number put out by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is leading the agitation). We will not let their sacrifice go in vain. In our list of demands, we also want compensation for their families.” Tikait, who has led the protest at UP Gate (Ghazipur border) since November 26 last year, also warned protesters of a smear campaign against them. “Attempts will now be made to spread propaganda on social media to discredit our protest by saying farmers continue to block the roads and cause inconvenience to the common man even though the central government has agreed to repeal the laws. We will have to remain watchful of this,” said Tikait, who was present along with brother Naresh, who has helped sustain the protests from his western UP base. Naresh heads Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) while Rakesh has emerged as its face during the course of the agitation. Crowds at UP Gate – where the presence of protesters has been quite thin, barely 200 most of the time, for months – are expected to remain high till Monday with Tikait announcing that farmers would go ahead with the planned tractor rally to Parliament. “The tractor rally will happen. From UP Gate, 30 tractors and 500 farmers will head to Parliament on Monday,” said Tikait. With the border heavily barricaded, entry into Delhi from there is, however, not possible. Asked about that later, Tikait replied with a cryptic “dekhenge (we’ll see)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/up-gate-springs-to-life-as-thousands-gather-vow-to-continue-their-protest/articleshow/87938967.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: PMC bank clients protest 10-year wait for their money||MUMBAI: Around 300 depositors of the erstwhile Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank held a morcha before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Bandra-Kurla Complex on Friday to protest against a resolution plan that will release their deposits piecemeal over 10 years. Under the plan, depositors with more than Rs 15 lakh in PMC Bank will have to wait for at least 5 years before they start receiving interest. “A vast number of account holders are senior citizens who fear time is not on their side for a long drawn resolution. My own father-inlaw passed away waiting for his money, and my mother-inlaw in her 70s is anxious too,” said Airoli resident Ashish Dutta. Advocate Harmeet Singh Dassan said, “Bank directors, who are the culprits, will also be paid back their deposits whereas their amounts should be frozen till the investigation is concluded. The valuation of all assets of borrowers would be done by the new bank USFB. This means that if a property worth Rs 100 is valued at Rs 15, then there will be no recourse available to anyone.Moreover, creditors are also being paid their principal amount in full despite knowing that there has been a fraud.” On November 23, RBI announced the draft details of PMC's amalgamation with the newly formed Unity Small Finance Bank (USFB). RBI imposed several restrictions on deposits beyond Rs 5 lakh. Customers can access additional amounts up to Rs 50,000 at the end of two years, up to Rs 1 lakh in the third year, Rs 3 lakh after four years and Rs 5.5 lakh after five years. They will receive nothing for the next four years, only getting the rest of their money after 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pmc-bank-clients-protest-10-yr-wait-for-their-money/articleshow/87939594.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Goa||After buses, Goa to have electric boat to ferry passengers||PANAJI: Months after embracing the technology of electric vehicles by adding 30 public buses to the state’s roads, Goa is all set to welcome an electric vehicle on its river route as well. Next month onwards, the Ribandar to Chorao ferry route may see Goa’s first electric boat, which will run on 100% clean energy. Battery-powered, the e-boat will run without fuel and will also have solar panels installed upon it, which will help power the battery. The captain of ports (CoP) and the river navigation department (RND) will launch the vessel by the third week of December. “The vessel is for the carriage of passengers only, and has a capacity to carry 60 pedestrians,” sources from the CoP said. The e-boat’s battery will be primarily charged at the charging stations that are being erected on either side of the river route. However, the solar panels will also act as an energy source to charge the battery. In addition to this, the vessel will also have back-up generators on board to be used in the monsoon in case there is a battery shortage. “We have been planning this project for the past two years ever since the Kerala government launched the first electric-solar ferry. This will therefore be the very first electric boat in Goa for the public,” an RND official told TOI. Aquarius Shipyard is building the vessel at a cost of Rs 4 crore and is expected to be delivered to the CoP very soon. After the delivery, the CoP and RND will take a call on whether or not to charge passengers for the ferry service. For now, the tentative plan is to operate the vessel on the Ribandar to Chorao ferry route, free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-buses-goa-to-have-electric-boat-to-ferry-passengers/articleshow/87938966.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Delhi||Not losing sight of our final goal: Farmers at Tikri||NEW DELHI: Satnam Kamboj, a farmer from Haryana’s Sirsa, arrived at Tikri border on Friday to mark one year of the protest against the three farm laws enacted by the central government. The 66-year-old farmer was last at the protest site around two months ago, but between then and now, there is a vast difference, said Kamboj. “The year-long protest has resulted in a half-victory. We want to win the battle fully, our aim now being to get legislation guaranteeing minimum support price for our produce,” said a serious Kamboj. On Friday, the atmosphere at Tikri border was energetic as farmers celebrated the one-year anniversary of protest that culminated in the central government announcing last week the repeal of the three contentious farm laws. The jubilations on Friday began with a special langar and distribution of sweet rice in the morning and ended with Punjabi singers performing in the evening. Thousands of men and women had arrived at Tikri in tractor trolleys from Punjab and Haryana and many more from Delhi too reached the border to express their support to the farmers. Many of those who had camped at the protest site for a year said the fight was difficult. They faced false accusations, chilling cold, heavy rain and scorching heat, but never lost hope. Sukhdev Singh, 78, of Bathinda’s Mandikalan village said he would continue his vigil at Tikri until all the farmers’ demands were met. “Despite the hardships, what motivated us to sit here was our precarious condition that could worsen if the three black laws were enforced,” said the septuagenarian. Resham Singh, 45, who too has stayed put at Tikri for the past year, recalled the sombre mood when he arrived here on November 26 last year. “The morale is high now, we have won half the battle with our resilience,” he said. The difficulties of the farmers in the past year was perhaps marginalised by the colour and crowd at the protest site on Friday. Sudesh Goyat, a fixture at the Tikri border for a year, said, “I sat on a hunger strike here with 11 women five times in the past year, each strike of five days.” She said they lost and gained many things during the protest. “Hundreds of protestors were martyred and many children lost their fathers. However, the protest helped in strengthening our unity as people from different backgrounds and states slept and ate under one tent,” said Goyat. Delhi resident advocate Amarveer Singh Bhullar was at Tikri on Friday. “After our country’s independence, a non-violent movement on such a big scale hadn’t been organised. But the farmers were defamed,” Bhullar claimed. Another Delhi resident, 19-year-old Harshpreet of Tilak Nagar, said, “I am here with my entire family to express gratitude to farmers and to celebrate their victory.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-losing-sight-of-our-final-goal-farmers-at-tikri/articleshow/87938982.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Olencio Simoes, joint secretary, Goencho Ekvott stated that RVNL officials are trespassing in private properties of the villagers without informing the owners, nor informing the local panchayat of Velsao-Pale-Isorssim.  He said that RVNL authorities illegally started demarcating land for double tracking without land acquisition and began installing barbed wire fencing, thereby blocking right of access to the houses and properties. Founder of Goencho Ekvott, Orville Dourado Rodrigues warned the government that if such illegal development is forced against the wishes of the people of Velsao and the state, then Goencho Ekvott will be forced to mobilise thousands of people to come on the streets.  Olencio stated that the land acquisition was opposed since 2008, and the land owners are now against the same land acquisition being carried out for doubling of railway track planned under the ministry of railways (South Western Railway Construction Organisation).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/velsao-residents-oppose-survey-by-railway-officials/articleshow/87938972.cms||---

Santha of Kodikunnil is the one who has been reunited with her family. Santha had gone missing from home on July 20, 2011, about two years after her only daughter died falling from a train. According to her family, the tragedy affected her mental health. Earlier, she was abandoned by her husband Vijayan. Around six years ago, she was spotted at a railway station in Kolkata by a soldier hailing from Kodikunnil. But he could not make contact with her as he was in a moving train. She was offered shelter by an NGO Asiya Mission in Odisha in February last year. Later, they handed her over to Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation. They provided her proper treatment. A few months ago, she remembered the name of her village which paved the way for her journey home. They then contacted the local police and found out her address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/missing-woman-reunites-with-family-after-a-decade/articleshow/87918276.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar mines minister’s OSD owns Rs 3.7 crore assets, 30 gold biscuits: SVU||PATNA: The Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) on Friday unearthed assets worth more than Rs 3.7 crore disproportionate to the known sources of income of Mrityunjay Kumar, the officer on special duty (OSD) of state mines and geology department minister Janak Ram. The SVU raids at his premises in Patna, Araria and Katihar yielded 30 gold biscuits having approximate value of Rs26.7 lakh, Rs33 lakh in cash, jewellery worth around Rs45 lakh, Rs25 lakh in bank accounts, immovable assets worth several crores, including a 3,000 square feet plot of land behind Loyla School in posh Patliputra Colony at Patna and hefty investments in life insurance and other schemes. SVU sources said the market value of his Patliputra plot is estimated to be worth at least Rs2 crore, but its deed value has been shown only Rs32 lakh. The raids were also conducted against Mrityunjay’s alleged girlfriend Ratna Chatterjee, who had been dismissed from service as a child development project officer after her arrest while accepting a bribe in 2011. The SVU sources said Mrityunjay’s wife Arti died in 2013 during the pendency of a divorce case in a court. The raids were conducted at Mrityunjay’s flat in Patna, his paternal house in Araria and the two houses belonging to the OSD and Ratna in Katihar. The SVU had registered an FIR on Thursday against the duo and procured a search warrant from court before conducting the raids. The SVU sources said the raid at Ratna’s Katihar house yielded gold biscuits weighing approximately 600gm, jewellery, document of a flat on Power House Road at Jyoti Nagar with deed value of Rs33 lakh along with a shop in Planet Mall, both in Siliguri, West Bengal, a plot of land in Katihar with Rs3 lakh deed value and pornographic materials. A separate FIR has been lodged in Katihar for the objectionable recoveries. The SVU also seized documents from Ratna’s house showing three life insurance policies worth rupees several crores against which Rs1.2 lakh monthly premium was being paid. The SVU sleuths also recovered bank passbooks from Ratna’s house which showed approximately Rs15 lakh in the accounts. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said the officer and his female friend were found together in the Patna flat from where passbooks of three banks accounts with more than Rs10 lakh deposits, Rs3 lakh in cash and six cellphones were seized. “Ratna had thrown her iPhone out of the flat from the fifth floor during the raid. But police personnel surrounding the premises recovered it. Data from all six cellphones were successfully extracted by a technical team after unlocking them,” he said. He said Ratna is just a mask and Mrityunjay was using her to invest his ill-gotten money. Khan said Ratna was dismissed from service after her arrest while accepting bribe on September 20, 2019. “Bank accounts of Mrityunjay, his brother Dhananjay and Ranta show that heft money had been transacted between them deliberately,” he said. Khan said there is also an element of money laundering in the case as money had been transferred from a few accounts to the trio’s bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mines-mins-osd-owns-assets-worth-rs3-7cr-30-gold-biscuits/articleshow/87937922.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Chandigarh||Haryana industrialists will need NOC for groundwater use||CHANDIGARH: Given the dipping groundwater level in Haryana, the chairperson, Haryana Water Resources Authority (HWRA), Keshni Anand Arora on Friday directed all industrial units of the state to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) for extraction of groundwater by November 30. She said the authority is working on a comprehensive plan to address the problem, and all industrial units should apply for permission to extract groundwater. Presiding over the HWRA workshop, Arora asked the representatives of industrial units connected through video conferencing to ensure maximum utilization of waste water from their industrial units. She informed that earlier the NOC for groundwater extraction was issued by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), but now it will be given by the HWRA.  As per a study report by CGWB, Haryana has only 10.15 billion cubic metres (BCM) of groundwater. The study had pointed out the worst conditions of water level in seven districts of the state including Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Mahendergarh, Fatehabad, Kaithal, and Sirsa. Kaithal has 227% “over extraction” of water, followed by 220% in Gurugram, 197% in Sirsa, 187% in Palwal, 161% in Fatehabad, 125% in Faridabad and 106% in Mahendergarh. According to the report, out of the 128 blocks of the state, only 26 were found to be safe when it came to groundwater availability. Also, 78 were found to have been overexploited, 21 were semi-critical and three were found to be critical. Arora said a workshop will be organized to redress the problems faced by the industrialists in obtaining the NOC for extraction of groundwater, to explain the process properly and give instructions related to the process of extracting groundwater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-industrialists-will-need-noc-for-groundwater-use/articleshow/87938993.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Nawab Malik offers ‘not to post or tweet’ till Bombay high court single-judge bench decides||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Friday submitted before Bombay high court that he was willing to have the November 22 order of a single judge set aside and to not make any public posts or tweets against Dnyandev Wankhede or his son, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and family even beyond December 9, till the single-judge bench decides the interim application against him. His counsel Karl Tamboly made this plea in a bid to work out the appeal filed by Wankhede for an interim order to restrain Malik, members of NCP of which he is spokesperson and any others acting under him from making any false or defamatory posts and public statements against the Wankhede family. Wankhede’s senior counsel Birendra Saraf and Divakar Rai sought time to think over the suggestion made by Malik, and the HC bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav posted the matter on Monday. On Thursday, when Wankhede’s appeal was taken up, the HC had recorded a statement from Malik as his undertaking that no public tweets would be made against Wankhede family till December 9, when the appeal would be heard next. Saraf had argued that the single judge had found the minister’s tweets to be “actuated by malice or personal animosity” but had only said his future tweets should be after reasonable verification, though what should have followed was a restraint on him. Justice Kathawalla at the hearing also orally said, “He is a minister, does it befit him to do all this.” The NCB officer’s father had on November 5 moved the HC with a suit against Malik for his allegedly defamatory tweets and public comments and filed an interim application for orders to restrain him from doing so. On November 22, Justice Madhav Jamdar, while deciding a plea for urgent orders to restrain Malik said in a 50-page order that the minister’s tweets, posts and press conferences were actuated by malice and personal animosity against Wankhede. Justice Jamdar also said that Malik “cannot be said to have acted after reasonable verification of facts”, however “at this stage” it cannot be said that allegations by Malik are totally false. The single judge said at this stage, he cannot accept Wankhede’s plea for a “blanket” order to restrain Malik, but to balance the fundamental rights on both sides and directed him to tweet only after reasonable verification. Justice Jamdar directed Malik to file a reply to the interim application filed by Wankhede and posted the matter for hearing on December 20. Wankhede, meanwhile, filed an appeal before the division bench, saying Justice Jamdar ought to have restrained Malik after giving a finding of malice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-offers-not-to-post-or-tweet-till-hc-single-judge-bench-decides/articleshow/87939624.cms||---
---||World||France-UK acrimony over Channel crossings deepens further||PARIS/LONDON: French President Emmanuel Macron told Britain on Friday it needed to “get serious” or remain locked out of discussions over how to curb the flow of migrants escaping war and poverty across the Channel. France cancelled an invitation to British home secretary Priti Patel to attend a meeting on the issue in Calais, underlining how fraught its ties with Britain have become, with post-Brexit trading rules and fishing rights also at stake. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the British PM was taking the issue “extremely seriously” and said he hoped France would reconsider its decision to cancel Patel’s invite. The row erupted after the death of 27 migrants trying to cross the seaway between the two countries, the worst tragedy on record in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. “I’m surprised when things are not done seriously. We don’t communicate between leaders via tweets or published letters, we are not whistle-blowers. Come on,” Macron said. He was responding to a letter from Johnson in which the British PM told “Dear Emmanuel” what he reckoned should be done to stop migrants from making the journey. Johnson urged France in his letter to agree on joint patrols on its shores and consent to taking back migrants who make it to UK. Infuriated by the letter, France cancelled an invitation to Patel to attend a meeting on Sunday to discuss with EU ministers how to tackle immigration. Johnson does not regret his letter or tweeting it, his spokesman said, adding that he wrote it “in the spirit of partnership”. Ties between the allies are already strained, including by a recent submarines deal with Australia which replaced one UK had with France. “We’re fed up with (London’s) double-talk,” French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said, adding interior minister Gerald Darmanin “told his counterpart she was no longer welcome”. Sunday’s meeting will go ahead, without Patel but with ministers from Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium and European Commission officials. “We’ll then see how to move forward efficiently with the British, if they decide to get serious,” Macron said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/france-uk-acrimony-over-channel-crossings-deepens-further/articleshow/87940606.cms||---

A team of officials from the women and children protection department with the help of the local police rescued 71 minors, aged between two and 16 years, from Dr Ketan Soni’s orphanage centre in Kalyan and shifted them to juvenile centres in Bhiwandi, Dombivli and Ulhasnagar on Friday. The Bazarpeth police have booked Dr Soni and his associates under different sections of the Children Protection Act. The team found that minors were kept at the centre in unhygienic conditions and children were not being given proper food or clothes. The orphanage, housed in a two-storey building has just only two bathrooms for 71 children. The team also found that the children had developed skin diseases, and a few of them looked weak apparently because of improper diet. The police said the primary investigation revealed that Dr Soni, along with his associates, has been running the Nandadeep Foundation since 2018. Through this NGO, he was running a centre for orphans at Tilak Chowck area in Kalyan. The incident came to light after a couple from Dombivli – Priya Ahire and Santosh Ahire – told a local social worker that Dr Soni was not returning their 15-day-old baby. The parents had allegedly sold the child to Dr Soni for Rs 1 lakh. The social worker alerted Ramkrishna Reddy, district child protection officer, and Pallavi Jadhav, child protection officer. The officials later filed an FIR against the couple and Dr Soni at Ramnagar police station. Jadhav told TOI, “While investigating a case of a child sold by his parents to Dr Soni, we came to know that he had kept the baby at his orphanage. Further investigation revealed that Dr Soni had not obtained any permission from the child and women protection department and was running the orphanage illegally. He had taken permission from the charity commissioner only for running an NGO.” The officials found that Dr Soni would keep the underprivileged children in the orphanage without follwoing the due process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-71-minors-rescued-from-docs-illegal-orphanage/articleshow/87939636.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 30 top forest officials shifted over Corbett Tiger Reserve ‘irregularities’||DEHRADUN: A month after a team of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) found illegal constructions in the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) and said it was made possible “either due to laxity of authorities or their connivance with miscreants”, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered the transfer of the head of forest force (HoFF) Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden JS Suhag and chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Anup Malik. The mass transfers saw 27 other senior forest officers being moved. While a vigilance inquiry into the matter is underway, sources said the transfers were made to ensure “no one influenced the ongoing probe”. On Friday, CM Dhami told TOI, “A serious note has been taken of the matter. We will act strongly against anyone found guilty of wrongdoings. Any kind of illegal activity will not be tolerated in the state.” Vinod Kumar Singhal is now the HoFF and Parag Madhukar Dhakate the new chief wildlife warden. Bhartari has been given charge of chairman of the state biodiversity board while Suhag and Malik are awaiting fresh postings. Kishan Chand, deputy chief conservator of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve, where a number of illegal structures were reported, was transferred to the HoFF office in Dehradun. TOI had recently written about the visit by the NTCA probe team to Corbett in late September following allegations of tree felling and illegal constructions in sensitive areas of reserve, including in core tiger breeding zones. In its report submitted on October 22, the NTCA panel mentioned construction of two independent buildings at Morghatti and Pakhro forest rest house campuses in the reserve. “Documents available with the field director, CTR, and DFO Kalagarh showed no prior approval had been obtained for any of these constructions. As a result, provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Indian Forest Act, 1927, had been violated,” the report said. It added, “The entire ongoing construction activities in one of the highest density tiger habitats of the world without any sanctions and by violating the various statutory provisions and court orders is an excellent example of both administrative and managerial failure. Appropriate actions are required against all the forest officers responsible for such grave violations.” The Uttarakhand high court taking suo motu cognizance of a TOI report on October 23 had sought a response from the state government on steps being taken to address the issue. It also sent notices to the Centre and the state government, making 11 parties respondents in the matter. Some of the 11 parties were DM and SSP Nainital, Uttarakhand State Wildlife Advisory Board and principal chief conservator of forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/illegalities-in-corbett-head-of-forest-force-30-others-moved-cm-for-tough-action/articleshow/87937551.cms||Kautilya Singh

The four seats where the much anticipated contest between Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and BJP fizzled out are Mumbai’s two seats and Kolhapur and Dhule-Nandurbar seats. Friday was the last day for withdrawal of nominations. The Mumbai unit of the BJP held a victory rally outside the city collector’s office as its candidate Rajhans Singh was elected unopposed to the Legislative Council. The Shiv Sena’s Sunil Shinde too was elected unopposed. Six MLC seats reserved for local self-government bodies fell vacant as members retired. Two of these are for the BMC. Each candidate requires a quota of 77 seats. While the BJP has 83 corporators, the Sena has 99 ensuring an easy victory for their respective candidates. Minister of state for Home and Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil too has been elected unopposed from Kolhapur as his rival BJP’s Amal Mahadik withdrew his nomination. The way for BJP candidate Amrish Patel for the Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies constituency was cleared after Congress nominee Gaurav Vani and three other independents withdrew their nominations. Vani said he withdrew his nomination after getting instructions from the party high command. He was supposed to contest on behalf of the MVA coalition. However, on the Nagpur local bodies seat, BJP’s Chandrashekhar Bawankule faces a keen contest against Congress’ Ravindra Bhoyar who was a former BJP corporator. He quit the party as he was denied the MLC ticket. Similarly, election will be held on December 10 for the Akola-Washim-Buldhana local bodies seat between the BJP and the Shiv Sena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-four-elected-unopposed-amid-pullouts-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87939638.cms||---

---||Nagpur||In Nehru college, Bhoyar passes litmus test, gets go-ahead for polls||NAGPUR: Thousands of passersby who crossed the busy junction in front Kamala Nehru Mahavidyalaya in Sakkardara on Friday could have never guessed that Maharashtra’s biggest political drama of the day was being played out behind those mighty walls. Whether BJP’s candidate for MLC polls, Chandrashekhar Bawankule, gets elected unopposed or will he have to face Congress’ Dr Ravindra Bhoyar, was the topic of the brainstorming session inside the institute’s boardroom. For a couple of hours on Friday, it had turned into a war room as Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole mulled over the future of his party’s candidate. With BJP and Congress having reached a settlement on two other constituencies in Maharashtra, it was expected that Nagpur too will go the same way with BJP’s Chandrashekhar Bawankule winning unopposed. Initial reports suggested that Congress candidate Bhoyar’s political career now seemed headed for a crash landing. He quit the BJP and burned all bridges, so a denial of an MLC ticket from Congress would have put him on the road to political oblivion. As the 3pm deadline to withdraw the candidature drew near, the tension inside the boardroom grew. Cabinet ministers Sunil Kedar, Nitin Raut, MLA Vikas Thakre and former MoS Rajendra Mulak analyzed every option and the risk attached, thus giving Patole many things to think about. Some leaders felt it was wrong to even discuss this as withdrawing candidates would seem like a step down. After a long drawn discussion, Patole directed Congress substitute candidate Prafull Gudhadhe-Patil to go and withdraw his candidature, but asked Bhoyar to stay back. Bhoyar’s political career went from the peak to the dumps, and back to the peak within a few hours on Friday. A senior Congress leader present inside the boardroom said, “The first issue was reaching some settlement with the BJP, but that did not happen.” Patole told mediapersons that BJP did not send any proposal for Nagpur, so there was nothing to consider. Though no one would confirm officially, sources told TOI that the second issue was about raising enough funds for Bhoyar, as he does not have deep pockets. The party’s substitute candidate, Guddadhe-Patil, too passed on the chance to become a candidate because he was not keen on bankrolling the campaign. Some leaders felt that such things should not even be discussed as both Congress and BJP had raised the battle pitch too high, and withdrawal may send the wrong signal for the civic polls. Ultimately, Patole took the long view. A source said, “A spirited fight, and maybe even a victory in the MLC polls, will change the entire game for the civic polls next year. Patole’s aggressive stance has rejuvenated the party, so no point in slowing down in the Sangh’s backyard now. Funds will be raised collectively by the party.” As he came out of the boardroom, a relieved Bhoyar said, “On December 14, when votes are counted, you will be surprised by the margin by which Congress wins.” In politics, they say, all options are always open. The most convenient one is exercise. On Friday, keeping Bhoyar on the ballot suited the party’s civic polls plans more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-nehru-college-bhoyar-passes-litmus-test-gets-go-ahead-for-polls/articleshow/87937595.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Chandigarh||Nine years later, TMC forays into Haryana again||Chandigarh: Nine years after its first foray, Trinamool Congress (TMC) has made yet another attempt to make inroads into Haryana. Former Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Ashok Tanwar formally joined TMC along with his supporters in the presence of West Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee. Tanwar has reportedly been given a free hand to mobilise support for the party in Haryana in specific. Sources said Tanwar is likely to get a major role in the Hindi speaking states of the country, especially Haryana and Western UP. “I always worked loyally for the party irrespective of any rank or position. We just demanded an adequate respect for those who have sincerely worked for party. Didi and I have grown in politics through NSUI. Didi too had gone through the similar situations as I had faced while in Congress. I am thankful to her that she recognised my services and dedication towards the society and allowed me to work with her,’’ said Tanwar. Tanwar also said he joined TMC as he would have been the last person to support Congress or Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Now, we can raise voice against these two parties and can offer the best alternative to the people of Haryana,” he added. In 2012, Mamta-led TMC had made an attempt to enter north India, especially Haryana. Former Rajya Sabha MP and businessman turned politician K D Singh had been made incharge of the region to promote TMC in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pardesh and Chandigarh. After brief actives in Haryana for few months, Singh had gone silent and the activities tapered down. Until now, there was no sign of presence of any leadership of members of TMC in Haryana. “Tanwar is an experienced, full-time politician. While K D Singh had been a businessman-turned-politician. Certainly, Tanwar has an upper hand on the account of organisational experience as well as manpower management. Let us wait and watch,” said a senior Congress leader who had once joined TMC as senior leader for Haryana. After he quit from Congress, Tanwar had kept his teams busy by launching the Apna Bharat Morcha in the state. Morcha was launched to raise the issue of public interest. He has teams in almost all the blocks of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nine-years-later-tmc-forays-into-haryana-again/articleshow/87939014.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chandigarh||NHM staff to go against Cong if demands unmet||Chandigarh: With their back against the wall and the term of chief minister Charanjeet Singh Channi-led Congress government inching towards completion, the employees of National Health Mission (NHM), Punjab, have decided to campaign against the incumbent party in upcoming assembly elections if their demands are not fulfilled. NRHM Employees’ Association, Punjab (NEAP) has been fighting for the rights of over 12,000 staffers for the last 10 years. Little hope from the current government has made them anxious. The employees so far have failed to get their demands fulfilled, even after several rounds of meetings and numerous communications with the state government. From April this year alone, the association has written more than 70 letters to the government and after getting no favourable response, employees across the state went on strike from October 28. With little time left at hand, the employees have started getting aggressive and staging protests against the chief minister, deputy chief minister O P Soni, who is also the health minister, and other cabinet ministers. Agitated female employees climbed atop seven-storey food laboratory building in Kharar on November 6 and five-storey building of the director health services (DHS), in Sector 34 on November 15. Some of them even attempted to scale the parapet of the Sector 34 building to jump. The member of the association had laid seize to the CM’s residence in Chandigarh on November 24, while in Sangrur they stopped the inaugural programme of Soni on November 25. NEAP state president Dr Inderjeet Singh Rana confirmed the association has decided to go against the ruling party if demands were not met. “We will make a formal announcement regarding the same on November 30,” he said. Soni said the government was going to fulfil all their genuine demands. He, however, said that there was a process in place which needs to be followed. The employees have been fighting for the regularisation of contractual employees. They are demanding their inclusion in the recently framed ‘The Punjab Protection and Regularization of Contractual Employees’ Bill, 2021’. Those employees who are not covered under the Bill, for the time being, should be given salaries at par with regular employees on the pattern of the Haryana overnment. Since NHM employees have been playing an important role in the fight against Covid-19, their absence from work has adversely impacted the vaccination drive, testing and contact tracing in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nhm-staff-to-go-against-cong-if-demands-unmet/articleshow/87939016.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Mumbai||No work, no pay, Maharashtra government tells ST staff||MUMBAI: More than 80,000 Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) workers refused to heed the two-day ultimatum given by government to resume duties by Friday. While this crippled the road lifeline of the state, the government has warned of withdrawing its decision on ‘huge salary hikes’ if the strike continued indefinitely. The MSRTC management warned that if drivers, conductors and other staff do not return to depots by the weekend, they may lose their one month’s (November) salary. As many as 11,589 workers have heeded the call of transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab and joined duties, so the bus corporation could restart operations at 37 depots across the state. The remaining 213 depots continue to be shut, inconveniencing lakhs of commuters. On Friday night, more employees were suspended, taking the total to 3,215, while 1,226 daily wage workers were dismissed. Close to 81,000 workers are still protesting and are unwilling to accept the huge salary hikes (upto 41% hike on basic) announced by Parab this week. They are firm on their demand of MSRTC being merged with the state government. “A Supreme Court order says ‘No work, no pay’. Employees should return to work and not force the government to take coercive steps against them,” Parab said. He met union representatives on Friday and made it clear to them that while their demands will be considered, indiscipline by workers will not be tolerated. “We have been told that after the pay hike some anomaly in the grade system has been created, All these issues will be sorted out, but first employees should return to work,” said Parab. The unions have demanded the Seventh Pay Commission for employees and the agreement with state government should be for 10 years, instead of four years. He said nearly 500 daily wage workers have been terminated on Friday for not showing up. “Despite taking the financial burden of the salary hike, if the employees will continue with the strike, why should the government take the burden,”said Parab. Several students were inconvenienced due to unavailability of buses when many schools are reopening across the state. “Even if there is threat of suspension or dismissal, we will not join duties till we are declared as state government employees,” said a driver from Mumbai. He refused to comment on hardships of commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-work-no-pay-but-80k-st-staff-defy-ultimatum/articleshow/87939654.cms||Somit Sen

All samples of the international travellers who test positive must be sent for genome sequencing, mentioned the notification. City international airport officials said they will comply with the new rules and there are adequate measures for screening of incoming passengers. The notification holds special significance in the light of upcoming VGGIS, said officials. The national guideline by the ministry of health & family welfare mentioned that it is mandatory for all international arrivals to file a selfdeclaration form and upload negative RT-PCR test report. If the travellers coming from countries at risk are fully vaccinated, they will have to monitor health for 14 days after arrival. If they are not fully vaccinated, they will have to undergo RT-PCR or other Covid test upon arrival and remain quarantined for seven days. They will undergo re-test on eighth day and if negative, monitoring will continue for next seven days. The variant is considered to be the most mutated version of the virus and may also infect those who had earlier been infected by other variants, said experts. India so far has not reported any case of the new variant. Meanwhile, Gujarat in the past 24 hours added 27 new Covid cases. The new positive cases included 9 from Ahmedabad city, 5 from Vadodara city, 4 from Rajkot city, 3 from Surat city, 2 from Bhavnagar city and Navsari, and 1 each from Gandhinagar city and Rajkot district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/scan-fliers-from-eu-9-countries/articleshow/87938294.cms||---
---||Ranchi||JMM blames BJP for J’khand’s poor MPI ranking||Ranchi: Ruling JMM on Friday blamed the BJP government at the Centre and the state’s previous government led by BJP’s Raghubar Das for the poor ranking in Niti Aayog’s first Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report. The MPI had ranked Jharkhand as the second poorest state just above Bihar. The state BJP leadership has, however, termed JMM’s reaction to the report as “playing politics” with the plight of the state’s poor. Expressing concern over the report that said 44% of children in the state are stunted and malnourished, JMM central general secretary Bhattacharya said poverty is an outcome of long term policies of the government. “Poverty does not set in or go away in a couple of years. It is the result of the misgovernance of BJP during its previous 15 years regime out of the 21-year-old history of a separate Jharkhand,” he said. Bhattacharya also blamed the anti-farmer and anti-labour policies of the Centre for wreaking havoc in the less industrialised states. “The government at the Centre works for the corporates as a result of which, the states with fewer industries are suffering the most,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP asked JMM to refrain from playing politics over the plight of the poor. The party’s state spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo, said, “It is not the time to engage in a blame game. As a responsible opposition in the state, we are ready to extend all-around support to the government to minimize poverty but for that, the government should come up with relevant schemes and projects. Policy paralysis and politicking is not going to yield any result.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-blames-bjp-for-jkhands-poor-mpi-ranking/articleshow/87938383.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

As per the constitution of JMM, the general assembly of the central committee will have to be convened every fourth year in which all the units are constituted afresh after holding a detailed discussion of the party’s performance, political resolution, accounts and other details. JMM general secretary Vinod Pandey issued an office order in this regard on Friday, saying all committees from panchayat to state levels in Bihar and West Bengal are being dissolved with immediate effect and the president of the Bengal state unit has been authorized to officiate till the formation of the new committees. The party has, however, clarified that all units in Odisha would continue to function normally. Earlier on Thursday, the party issued an order dissolving the state committee of Jharkhand and all district units up to the panchayat level, except the West Singhbhum district committee and the convening committees of Dumka and Dhanbad. The party’s central president Shibu Soren and central working president Hemant Soren have been authorized to take decisions during the general assembly of the central committee. Party sources said that the reconstitution of the organization is a formality and it has nothing to do with the 2024 election as the 13th convention of the party would be held ahead of the 2024 general election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-dissolves-state-committees-in-jkhand-bihar-bengal/articleshow/87938401.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Maoists blow up police station awaiting inauguration in Gumla||Gumla: Maoists blew up a newly constructed police station building, which was awaiting inauguration, near Behratoli village under Kurumgarh police station on Thursday night, the last day of their three-day bandh in four states. The demolished building is located 70 km away from the district headquarters and left behind a poster claiming responsibility for the blast. The poster said the rebels blew up the police station “in revenge” for arresting their politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kishan da, his wife Sheela Marandi and four other aides. The bandh was also called in Jharkhand, Bihar, north Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh for the arrests. SP Ehtesham Waquarib accompanied by DSP (operations) Manish Kumar, Chainpur SDPO Cyril Kumar Marandi and Kurumgarh OC Rupesh Kumar rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. Sources said the two-storey building was constructed at an estimated cost of a little over Rs 1 crore and the damage assessment will be done by a team of engineers. However, the building is unlikely to be utilised as the blast took place on the ground floor and have weakened the foundation. Locals said around 150 to 200 armed Maoists came to the police station building at about 11.00 pm on Thursday. They first woke up all seven labourers who were sleeping in the building, which is located in a forest and hilly area on the bank of the south Koel river. A police officer said, “There could not be more than 50 Maoists even if squads from the neighbouring districts and Budhapahar were here. They usually force villagers to accompany them when they plan to execute any big event. Hence, the villagers must have mistaken all of them as Maoists.” According to the labourers, who were engaged for lying tiles and painting work, the Maoists planted three to four powerful IEDs in front and sides of the building and triggered them at 12.15 am. They then retreated towards forests. Around 30 labourers, including masons from Ramgarh and Ranchi, were engaged in the construction of the police station and most of them were staying at the nearby Jirmi village, some half a kilometre away. After hearing the news, they have reportedly left the area. The Chainpur SDPO said,” The new police station building has been badly damaged by the blast. Maoist Chhotu Kherwar might have led the squad which demolished the building. He seemed to have replaced Budheshwar Oraon, who was killed in an encounter with the police some months ago. Other Maoists who are most likely part of the group are Sudarshan Bhuiyan, Ranthu and Lazim. Ravindra Gaunjhu, a zonal commander active mostly in Lohardaga district, could also be involved in executing the blast."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-blow-up-police-station-awaiting-inauguration-in-gumla/articleshow/87938428.cms||K A Gupta
