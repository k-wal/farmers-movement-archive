This was the first major political public event in Lucknow that Akhilesh had participated in ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. Till now be it the inaugural flag off of Akhilesh’s Kranti Rath Yatra from Ganga Ghat in Kanpur or joint rally with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party in Mau all major political events of the SP have been held outside the state capital. Speaking as the chief guest at a rally organised by a lesser known Janvadi Party Socialist in Lucknow at Ramabai Rally Sthal, Akhilesh pointed out that the Lucknow airport situated near the venue of the rally was till recently a government enterprise. But now it has been sold off. “At a time when we have gathered here to decide our strategy to wipe off BJP (in the 2022 polls), BJP leaders have gathered near Delhi to lay the foundation stone of an airport,” he said. The former UP CM went on to say: “Ye kaise Bharatiya Janata Party ke log hain, ek taraf to hawai adda bench rahe hain… Doosri taraf hawai adda bana rahe hain … kaun bharosa karega in par” (What kind of people are there in the Bharatiya Janata Party. On the one hand they are selling off airports … on the other they are making one. Who is going to trust such people). Akhilesh then listed names of airports which were incurring losses. “Some of these airports are incurring such heavy losses that one cannot even imagine,” he said questioning the ruling BJP about the promise it made to ensure an economic state where even the poor who wear “hawai chappal” (rubber slippers) will be able to afford a “hawai yatra” (flight ticket) but they are selling off aeroplanes and airports instead. “How many of you who wear hawai chappals have managed to afford an air ticket to travel,” he asked the crowd. Accusing the ruling BJP of selling off airports and other government establishments, Akhilesh said such a practice will hit people hard who are entitled to reservation in jobs as government departments in the private sector will be beyond the ambit of reservation in appointments. He then took on the government for its anti-farmer policies and for misleading the farmers with the promise of doubling their income. “The rising cost of DAP, diesel and petrol, seeds fertilizers has hit the farmer the hardest. Government failure to procure their produce at minimum support price has made the situation worse for farmers. They have been the worst hit by this BJP government,” he said. Earlier addressing the gathering, founder and national president of Janvadi Socialist Party Sanjay Sigh Chauhan lambasted the ruling BJP for the “use and throw” approach towards smaller parties. “In 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, 90 per cent voters from our community voted in favour of BJP but not a single member of our samaj (community) got a ticket from the party. However, in 2019, Samajwadi Party had only 37 tickets, still Akhilesh Yadav fielded a member of our community. BJP wants us to be a Lallua voter,” he said. He thanked Akhilesh for his support to the party and urged his partymen to vote in favour of SP candidates in their respective constituencies. Janvadi Socialist Party was founded by Sanjay Singh Chauhan in April 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-yadav-accuses-govt-of-selling-off-airports/articleshow/87918018.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Guwahati||Assam Congress tries to fortify base amid Mukul Sangma's exit||GUWAHATI: The exit of the former chief minister of Meghalaya, Mukul Sangma, along with 11 of Congress’s 17 MLAs in the hill state to the TMC, is being seen as another jolt for the party which has just not been able to check the exodus of its leaders to other parties. The exit of Mukul and his team makes the TMC the principal opposition in Meghalaya and this has come as a shock to the Congress which is in the process of revamping its committees in three Bengali-dominated Barak Valley districts in Assam, where it faces a serious threat from Mamata Banerjee’s party. Assam Congress president Bhupen Borah on Thursday said the new leadership will be given charge of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts soon. Though the senior party leader from the Barak Valley and the former All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev joined the TMC some time back, Congress insiders said Mukul deserting the Congress with 11 legislators has shattered the party. “In the Barak Valley, we are going to reconstitute three district committees. Ahead of the upcoming municipal elections, a major reshuffle will take place,” said Borah. He admitted that the Sushmita Dev factor is also one the reasons behind the reshuffle decision. “Our district presidents in the Barak Valley have been in their present positions for a long time. While one of them has crossed 80 years of age, one is ill. Another does not want to continue in the post. Considering all the issues (including the Sushmita factor) a reshuffle is inevitable,” Borah added. Sushmita told TOI that after Congress faced another humiliating defeat in the recent byelections, talks between the TMC leadership and Assam Congress leaders have become more intense. “We are coming to Assam, be rest assured. We waited for the right time and right situation in Meghalaya,” she said. The TMC, she said, is carefully strategising as the state is divided into upper, lower, middle Assam and the Barak Valley. “Abhishek Banerjee and Prashant Kishor are holding talks with Assam Congress leaders,” she said. In the last Assam Congress Legislature Party (ACLP) meeting this week, all Congress MLAs expressed their desire to continue serving the Congress. But the manner in which leaders are changing sides, the Congress has little faith in its leaders. Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain joined the BJP, while Sushmita joined TMC. “Going by their statements in the ACLP meeting, we don't believe that any of the Congress MLAs or MPs, who were special invitees, would join any other party. But if they decide to desert the Congress, they will. They would not need my permission to do so,” said Borah. Despite 17 district committees, the TMC failed to make any impression in the 2021 Assam election where it mainly focused on minority-inhabited areas in lower Assam and the Barak Valley. When Sushmita Dev joined the TMC, it was seen as a big gain for the party not only in Assam but also in Tripura, which goes to the polls in 2023. Sushmita’s father Santosh Mohan was elected from the Tripura West constituency to the Lok Sabha twice and the family still has sufficient relevance in Tripura politics. TMC is expected to benefit from this connection. But Mukul Sangma joining the TMC has been a major setback as he was the chairperson of the Northeast Congress Coordination Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-congress-tries-to-fortify-base-amid-mukul-sangmas-exit/articleshow/87918382.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Mumbai||Honour and respect for women are marks of civilized society: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Over seven years after two gang-rapes in the defunct, abandoned and overgrown Shakti Mills premises at Mahalaxmi in south Mumbai, Bombay high court set aside a 2014 death sentence verdict for three convicts common to both crimes and commuted the punishment to life sentence. The HC upheld their conviction for gang rape and other offences and said the sentence shall mean ‘rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life,’’ said the HC, with no entitlement to any remission including parole and furlough leaves from prison. “Women are the backbone of every nation and therefore, they deserve their due respect and honour. Honour and Respect for women are the marks of a civilized Society,’’ said a bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and PK Chavan. The bench said the crime was grave and the convicts “don’t deserve to assimilate in society.” The death sentence to the trio was given in April 2014 in the case of a 22-year-old photo journalist who had registered an FIR on August 23, 2013, immediately the next day after the crime. There were five persons accused including a minor. A 19-year-old telephone operator too, had later registered an FIR alleging being gang-raped at the same mill compound but on July 31, 2013. There were three accused common to both cases. A death sentence given by a trial court, to become effective, needs to first be confirmed by the high court. “The statute has not prescribed mandatory death penalty. Although the offence is barbaric and heinous, it cannot be said at the threshold that the accused deserve only death penalty and nothing less than that,’’ said the HC. It spared the noose for three young men, one 18 when booked, all from underprivileged sections of society--Vijay Jadhav (18), Mohammad Qasim Shaikh (20) and Mohammed Salim Ansari (27). Their court appointed counsel Yug Chaudhry cited several irregularities in the trial court proceedings in awarding them death sentence under section 376E IPC, saying the charge was not invoked as per law. But Special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi had argued that the law permits death sentence for second conviction and the “sequence and time of the offence is immaterial.’’ The HC said, “there is no doubt that the incident as narrated by the survivor on 22nd August, 2013 had occurred in the backdrop and in the manner in which it was narrated. The courage of the survivor needs to be appreciated. That she had put at stake her reputation, her identity and the embarrassment to herself and her family and all concerned and the risk of having to face social obloquy, when she set the law into motion.’’ The HC noted that one accused telling a co-accused that “a prey has come’’ and calling each other to accost the prey is sufficient proof of their conspiracy and establishes that it was not their first time. Two accused even told the survivor that she was not their first case. On March 20, 2014, the Sessions Judge first held three common accused guilty for the gangrape of the telephone operator and about 30 minutes later pronounced a guilty verdict in the case of the photojournalist too. During trial prosecution had examined 45 witnesses to bring home the guilt while the defence examined five witnesses including mothers of two accused to rebut the charge. The trial court had decided both cases with seven months and 13 days from the date of incident, bringing “speedy justice’’ the HC said. The state had made a plea to invoke section 376E of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) a new provision for death sentence to repeat offender in rape cases, half an hour after the first conviction.  The HC bench however held it was not a case of a previous conviction, “since both the Sessions Cases were being tried simultaneously and the conviction in both was on the same day without giving an opportunity to the accused to place before the court the mitigating circumstances.’’ The HC said in “In a case like the present one, the Court cannot ignore the fact that this incident had shocked the conscience of the society and there was public outcry.’’ But the court can’t punish based on the public outcry alone, it is a Court’s bounden duty to consider the case “dispassionately’’ and cannot ignore legal procedures.  Every case of rape is a heinous offence. The damage done to the victim far outweighs the public conscience. A rape victim does not suffer just physical injury, but what is affected is her mental health and stability in life. Rape tantamounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of woman. It is a violation of human rights.’’ The accused did not appeal the death penalty. The HC said, “Death puts an end to the whole concept of repentance, any sufferings and mental agony.’’ On Thursday in a separate judgment, Bombay HC dismissed an appeal by a convict and upheld conviction and life sentence of Mohd Ashfaq Shaikh, 25 year old, for the July 31, 2013 gang-rape of the telephone operator at Shakti Mills compound. The bench of Justices Jadhav and Chavan held that prosecution had proved its case against him. Even otherwise, the HC said the "sole testimony of the prosecutrix (telephone operator) itself is sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused, however, it finds support from her boyfriend and her mother. The prosecution has collected all the incriminating articles from the spot as well as the call detail records.'' The Judgment authored by Justice Jadhav began by quoting Lucretia Mott (1793-1880) one of the founders of organised women's rights movement in the US who said, "The world has never yet seen a truly great and virtuous nation because in the degradation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at their source.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/honour-and-respect-for-women-are-marks-of-civilized-society-bombay-hc/articleshow/87918431.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Will revisit EWS reservation criteria, Centre tells Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: After facing a barrage of questions from the Supreme Court over fixing an annual income limit of Rs 8 lakh for determining economically weaker sections (EWS), the Centre on Thursday agreed to "revisit" the criteria for the "economically backward among forwards" to get reservation benefits in government jobs and educational institutions. Appearing before a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said he had been instructed to make a statement before the bench that the government has decided to revisit the criteria, adding that a committee will be set up to examine the issue and sought four weeks time to take a final decision. An immediate fallout of the decision to re-examine the criteria for determination of EWS is that counselling process for PG admissions would have to be deferred - at least for the month-long period sought by the Centre - till a decision on EWS eligibility is taken. "The Solicitor General states that a period of four weeks would be required for this exercise and pending its conclusion, the date for counseling shall stand postponed in view of the assurance which was tendered at an earlier stage of these proceedings. In view of the above position, the hearing of the proceedings shall be listed on January 6, 2022," the bench said. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by MBBS doctors challenging Centre's decision to implement 27% reservation for OBCs and 10% reservation for EWS in admission in PG courses in medical colleges in All India Quota. Though the litigation pertains to admission in PG medical courses, admission process in all government-run institutions and recruitment of government jobs will be affected. When the matter was being argued in court in October, the apex court expressed displeasure over the Centre not adequately explaining the basis for fixing an income limit of Rs 8 lakh for granting reservation to EWS and directed it to file an affidavit to disclose whether any exercise was done and what was the rationale behind the decision. The court had also questioned the uniform income criteria adopted for the entire country and suggested cost of living or per capita income be considered. The Centre has referred to the Sinho commission recommendations for fixing the income limit and argued that it would not be easy or practicable to consider differentiated criteria given disparities in urban and rural settings. The court asked how Rs 8 lakh could be fixed for both EWS and OBC categories to be eligible for reservation. It had said there was a social and educational backwardness attached with the OBC category and it was presumed that their backwardness comes to an end with economic advancement. It had said the EWS category was different with no social and educational backwardness as a constitutional criteria and fixing the same income limit for both categories looked unreasonable. As the admission process for PG courses will get delayed, senior advocate Arvind Datar contended that the government should implement its decision to enforce OBC and EWS reservation in the all-India quota from the next academic year or the government should take a decision on EWS criteria within two weeks. Advocate Vivek Singh, appearing for a batch of MBBS doctors, also submitted that the court should in the meantime decide the issue of validity of OBC reservation in AIQ. The bench said four weeks was a reasonable time as the decision should not be taken in a haphazard manner and it must be done scientifically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-revisit-ews-reservation-criteria-centre-tells-sc/articleshow/87918570.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

While the PM, who laid the foundation stone for the Noida International Airport, lashed out at previous governments for keeping UP in darkness and deprivation, chief minister Yogi Adityanath raked up “ganna (sugarcane)”, “danga (riots)” and “Jinnah” in his speech to target Samajwadi Party and his main election rival Akhilesh Yadav. Modi, in his speech, reminded the large turnout that the airport was envisioned first by a BJP government – when Rajnath Singh was CM – two decades back but successive governments in Delhi and Lucknow had scuttled the project. Western UP is a crucial battlefield for BJP given its run-in with farmers of the region over the three central farm laws that the PM last week agreed to repeal after a year of sit-in protests by farmers at Delhi’s borders. “Seventy years after independence, UP has started getting things that it always rightfully deserved. (An) earlier UP government (SP) wrote a letter (to the Centre) that the Noida airport project should be shelved. We could have announced the airport in 2017 but did not do so without making necessary preparations for it, including financial closure. Otherwise, it too would have ended like so many stuck projects with bloated costs that are a legacy of previous governments,” Modi said. Accusing previous governments of keeping Uttar Pradesh in deprivation and darkness, the PM said some political parties have always kept their self-interest paramount. “The thinking of these people is self-interest, their own development and that of their family,” Modi said. The PM attributed speedy infrastructure development in UP through a network of expressways, metro and dedicated freight corridors to the “double engine” government of BJP in Delhi and Lucknow. “Previous governments used to keep UP in the dark by making false promises and denying the state its due. Today UP is making an impression on the global stage,” he said. “Hamaare UP mein (bahut kaam) ho raha hai. (A lot of development is happening in UP now.) UP now means uttam suvidha (best facilities),” Modi added. “Today, the country has to decide whether it wants to give new wings to the sweetness of sugarcane here or allow the followers of Jinnah to commit the mischief of triggering riots,” Adityanath said, referring to the 2013 communal riots in western UP while simultaneously taking a swipe at Akhilesh for a recent remark in which the SP leader mentioned Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the same breath as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel while talking about freedom struggle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-and-yogi-toast-infrastructure-roast-opposition-at-noida-airport-launch/articleshow/87918703.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The new variant is reported to have a significantly high number of mutations, and thus has serious public health implications for the country, the health ministry said, especially at a time when visa restrictions have been relaxed and international travel is opening up. The Centre has also asked states and UTs to closely track and test the contacts of international travellers from these countries. Botswana has so far reported three cases, South Africa six and Hong Kong one case. “lt is therefore imperative that all international travellers travelling from and transiting through these countries, (they are part of the “at risk” country category of international travellers coming to lndia) and also including all other “at risk” countries indicated in the revised guidelines for international arrivals issued by this ministry dated 11.11.2021, are subjected to rigorous screening and testing, as per health ministry guidelines,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to all states on Thursday. Bhushan urged states to ensure that samples of travellers turning positive are sent to INSACOG genome sequencing laboratories promptly as per the ministry guidelines.

---||World||Judge denies Seminole Tribe's stay on gambling expansion||HOLLYWOOD: A federal district judge rejected a stay requested by the Seminole Tribe of Florida late Wednesday after an earlier ruling blocked the tribe's deal with the state to expand gambling and online sports betting statewide.  Attorneys for the Seminoles argued the tribe would lose significant revenue from online sports betting, saying some of the money would be used to fund tribe programs. But US District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich rejected the request, saying the tribe hadn't shown that it would be irreparably harmed if a stay were not granted.  However, the Sun Sentinel reported Thursday that the Hard Rock Sportsbook app was still operating and accepting bets. The app began accepting bets November 1.  In a ruling late Monday, US. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich found that the multibillion dollar agreement between the state and tribe allowing online betting violated a federal rule that requires a person to be physically on tribal land when wagering. The lawsuit, filed by non-Indian casino owners in Florida, challenged the approval of the agreement by the US Department of the Interior, which oversees tribal gambling operations.  The state and tribe had argued that because the computer servers processing the bets would be on tribal lands, bettors could wager from their phone or kiosks at race tracks and non-Indian casinos anywhere in the state and meet the federal standard.  But Judge Friedrich called that "fiction" in her earlier ruling.  The agreement made Florida- for a time - the latest state to legalise sports gambling since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling. It lifted a federal ban on such wagering outside Nevada and a few other states. Today, about half the states and the District of Columbia have legalised betting on sports in some form.  The judge, who was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit Court in 2017 by former president Donald Trump, also noted that a 2018 state constitutional amendment passed overwhelmingly by voters requires any expansion of gambling outside of tribal lands be approved by voters.  The judge's decision also blocks the tribe from adding roulette and craps to its Florida casinos - which may have allowed non-Indian casinos to do the same.  Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis had worked out the compact with the tribe earlier this year and the GOP-controlled legislature approved it soon after, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-denies-seminole-tribes-stay-on-gambling-expansion/articleshow/87919007.cms||---

Compared to Delhi, in other states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which had a lower percentage of households with internet connectivity, close to 40% of such children could access education. The survey, “Access to Services During Covid-19 in Digital India” was done by LIRNEasia and Indian Council for Research on International Economics Relations (ICRIER). LIRNEasia is an Asia Pacific ICT policy and regulation think tank while ICRIER is an autonomous economic policy think tank. The nationally representative sample consisted of 7,000 households, including 350 villages and wards. Although a national survey, it had a special focus on Delhi, Assam, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. It was conducted between March and August 2020. Boys, those in Class IX and above, and kids in households with more educated parents had a distinct advantage. In Tamil Nadu, more children had access to remote education because since August 26, 2019, Kalvi TV, an educational channel, has been running in the state. Across the country, 62% households have internet connectivity as against 84% in Delhi. In the age-group of 15+ who had used the internet, Delhi ranks higher than others. Overall, 47% of this group had access to the internet with 72% in Delhi, 53% in Tamil Nadu, 55% in Maharashtra and 37% in Assam.The overall 20% of school-going children across the country who had access to education, 75% received information and assignments on smartphones and just 55% attended live online classes. “The lesson from the survey is basically that to improve learning outcomes, digital technology has to be routinely used and made a part of the schooling system,” said Galpaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/just-25-kids-in-delhi-schools-had-access-to-online-education-survey/articleshow/87919108.cms||Shradha Chettri

The court upheld their conviction for gangrape and other offences and said the sentence shall mean “rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life” with no remission, including parole and furlough. The HC dismissed an appeal by another convict and upheld his life term. "Women are the backbone of every nation and therefore, they deserve their due respect and honour. Honour and respect for women are the marks of a civilised society,’’ said a bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and P K Chavan, adding that the crime was grave and the convicts “don’t deserve to assimilate in society”. “The statute has not prescribed mandatory death penalty. Although the offence is barbaric and heinous, it cannot be said… the accused deserve only death penalty,” said the HC, adding they “deserve imprisonment for life to repent the offence committed by them as death puts an end to the concept of repentance”. Vijay Jadhav, 19 at the time of the crime, Mohammad Qasim Shaikh, 20, and Mohammed Salim Ansari, 27, had been sent to death row in April 2014 by the trial court in a case of gangrape of a photojournalist, then 22, on August 22, 2013. Besides the three, one person was sentenced to life and a minor accused was found guilty by the juvenile justice board. The accused did not appeal the death penalty. The three had got the death sentence as they were also convicted in another gangrape of a 19-year-old telephone operator on July 31, 2013, on the same premises at Mahalaxmi. Their court-appointed counsel Yug Chaudhry cited several irregularities in the trial court proceedings in awarding them death sentence under section 376E of the IPC, a stringent law for repeat offenders, saying the charge was not invoked as per law. But special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi argued that the law permits death sentence for second conviction and the “sequence and time of the offence is immaterial”. On March 20, 2014, the sessions judge had first held the three common accused guilty for the gangrape of the telephone operator and about 30 minutes later, pronounced a guilty verdict in the case of the photojournalist too. In this gap, the state had made a plea to invoke section 376E. The court, therefore, handed the death sentence.

Singh, accompanied by his lawyer, arrived at the crime branch office around 11am and left at 6pm, after almost eight hours of questioning. He was questioned by deputy commissioner of police (detection-1) Neelotpal, who recorded Singh’s detailed statement while his lawyer sat outside the office. Officials said that they recorded his statement in connection with the extortion case registered by businessman Bimal Agarwal at Goregaon police station. Absconding top cop Param Bir Singh resurfacesSingh, who had not reported to work since May after his transfer in March from the post of Mumbai police commissioner and his subsequent allegations of corruption against then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, told the media that he arrived in Mumbai on Thursday morning from his hometown Chandigarh and straightaway informed senior police officials that he would be visiting the crime branch’s Kandivli unit to record his statement. “I will join the investigations as directed by the court,” Singh said. There were also reports that Singh, who arrived in his official police sedan car, went straight to his official residence at Nilima building at Malabar Hill after recording his statement. He had told news channels on Wednesday that he was in Chandigarh and would appear in Mumbai soon. Senior police officials said that Singh appeared calm and cooperated in the investigations. “We have recorded his statement and told him that the police will be calling him again as and when required,” said an official. The official added that this is the only case the Mumbai police is probing, the other cases of extortion against the former Mumbai CP are being probed by the state CID and the Kopri police. The ACB too is conducting two open inquiries against Singh. Sources said that the state CID and ACB are likely to summon Singh in the coming week. The case in which Singh’s statement was recorded pertains to businessman Bimal Agarwal’s complaint that (now-dismissed) API Sachin Waze had, at Singh’s behest, extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on his two restaurants and bars in Goregaon. Agarwal had stated that Waze had forcibly also extorted two high-end mobile phones worth nearly Rs 3 lakh from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/param-bir-singh-turns-up-at-mumbai-crime-branch/articleshow/87919234.cms||---

More moisture from atmospheric rivers - huge plumes of moisture extending over the Pacific and into the Northwest - is expected to bring up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain in some areas hit by the recent flooding, forecasters said.  Officials from the National Weather Service predict periods of moderate to heavy rain through Wednesday, as the first in a series of systems move across the region.  The state is assessing millions of dollars in damage from the last atmospheric rivers.  In northwest Washington's Whatcom County, officials say damage costs could reach as high as $50 million.  Whatcom County officials said that the damage for recent flooding was estimated at $15 million to $20 million for houses, "tens of millions of dollars" for public infrastructure and up to $20 million for area business centres, the Bellingham Herald reported on Tuesday.  Rain drenched the county for three days and the Nooksack River surged over its banks November 14, inundating the communities of Everson, Nooksack and Sumas.  During that time the United States-Canada border closed in the small city of Sumas, three bridges in Bellingham were closed and landslides blocked Interstate 5 south of Bellingham.  Jon Hutchings, director of the Whatcom County Public Works Department, said it's been 30-plus years since flooding of this scale hit the area.  Meanwhile, damage assessments have continued in 13 other western Washington counties that governor Jay Inslee declared as disaster areas with the hope of getting federal aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/more-atmospheric-rivers-once-again-threat-washington-with-flooding/articleshow/87919271.cms||---

Congress, which had 17 MLAs before the exodus, said it was mulling legal action even as Sangma sounded the bugle for TMC’s “expansion” in other states of the northeast as it seeks to become what he termed “a pan-India political alternative”. “We are in touch with our lawyers. We will do something soon… We were all prepared,” said Meghalaya Congress chief Vincent H Pala. Lok Sabha member Pala's appointment as the PCC chief was speculated to be the trigger for Sangma's first move towards TMC. The AICC accused Trinamool of working to strengthen BJP. "This is happening like a conspiracy. People in the party, especially our party president (Sonia Gandhi) and Rahul Gandhi, are looking into it. They will take a decision," news agency ANI quoted Congress veteran and Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge as saying. Those who jumped ship were four legislators from the Khasi-Jaintia Hills and eight from the Garo Hills. Besides Sangma, who won from two constituencies of the Garo Hills in the 2018 polls, the defecting MLAs are Charles Pyngrope, Himalaya Shangpliang, George B Lyngdoh, Shitlang Pale, Dikkanchi D Shira, Miani D Shira, Zenith Sangma, Marthon J Sangma, Jimmy D Sangma, Winnerson D Sangma and Lazarus M Sangma. "Today is a momentous occasion for Meghalaya, setting a new trend for the future," Sangma announced at a presser in Shillong, flanked by the 11 MLAs. The former CM said a meeting with TMC strategist Prashant Kishor convinced him to join the party, but not before making.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/congress-mulls-legal-action-as-12-mlas-join-tmc-make-it-main-opposition-in-meghalaya/articleshow/87919280.cms||Manosh Das

Officials feared that farmers would actually be hit and cited Niti Aayog’s working paper on farm reforms to argue that liberalised markets were more favourable to growth than government support and interventions in the market over a period of time. Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand noted in the paper that segments like horticulture, milk and fishery (where market intervention by the government is either nil or very little) showed 4-10% annual growth whereas the growth rate in cereals, where MSP and other interventions are quite high, remained at 1.1% after 2011-12. Besides, there is a peaking of benefits with cereals. Chand cited the example of Maharashtra, where an experiment of legal intervention for ensuring MSP in 2018 failed, forcing the state government to abandon the initiative. “Economic theory as well experience indicates that the price level that is not supported by demand and supply cannot be sustained through legal means,” said Chand, an agriculture economist. He, however, kept the floor open for suggestions, saying if according legal or mandatory status ensured MSP to farmers, it would be the easiest way for any government to help farmers get desired prices. This could be done by state governments without central intervention, he said and cited the example of Kerala, where the state government last year announced minimum prices for 16 fruits and vegetables. The paper, quoted extensively by officials in the ministry, also cited the example of sugarcane — where the support price (fair and remunerative price) is the statutory minimum price — and pointed out the accumulation of thousands of crores in arrears as private sugar mills could not find FRP for sugarcane matching with sugar prices. Referring to practical difficulties in getting the private sector on board for buying at legally guaranteed MSP, officials said the higher procurement cost would mean increase in prices of foodgrains, leading to inflation, which would eventually affect the poor. “It will also impact India’s farm exports, accounting for 11% of the total exports of commodities, if the MSP is higher than the prevailing rates at international markets,” said officials. They also said that since the government would have to procure all marketable surplus in the absence of private participation, it would lead to a huge burden on the exchequer. Officials have not backed their claims with specific data but farmers said the government would not be spending more than an “additional amount” of Rs 1 lakh crore annually if it decided to buy the entire marketable surplus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-farmers-dig-in-on-msp-govt-experts-point-out-cons/articleshow/87919319.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Centre may ban all Hurriyat factions for financing terror||NEW DELHI: The Central government may soon ban Hurriyat Conference as an “unlawful organisation’ under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), citing the alleged involvement of its constituents and leaders in terror financing in Jammu & Kashmir as a primary ground. Sources in the security agencies told TOI that the home ministry will take a final call in the coming days on proscribing all factions of Hurriyat Conference – including the moderate Hurriyat and Tehreek-e-Hurriyat once led by late hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani – under Section 3(1) of UAPA. While J&K government and NIA had earlier submitted inputs and data to the home ministry to build a case for listing Hurriyat as an ‘unlawful organisation’, a source said some additional inputs and data were sought by the ministry of home affairs. Sources said the clarifications and additional inputs have now been submitted and a decision to ban the Hurriyat Conference, including all factions and fronts, is expected soon. With many terror cases slapped against Hurriyat leadership in the recent years, including by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and many senior members in jail, the Hurriyat Conference’s presence and activities in the Valley have seen a massive dip, particularly in the last couple of years. “However, a ban on Hurriyat Conference will help put a total stop to its terror financing plans and activities, particularly collection of funds from the people at community events and their further distribution, under alleged instructions from Pakistan’s ISI, to subversive elements for carrying out terror acts in J&K. With the UAPA ban – an unavoidable eventuality for any outfit involved in terror financing – the terror funding routes purportedly employed by the Hurriyat conference -- can be plugged. One of the key routes – now part of an NIA investigation – was ‘sale’ of medical seats in Pakistan’s colleges from its quota, and channelling the funds so collected to foment trouble in the Valle,” said an officer. “Hurriyat and all its factions will have to dismantle their offices and infrastructure, once the ban is imposed. Also, all the boycott calls and protest calendars, once a mainstay of Tehreek e Hurriyat that has faded into oblivion post-abrogation of Article 370, will become illegal,” the officer added. A decision to ban an organisation is notified in the official gazette, complete with all the grounds. It must be upheld later by a review committee provided for under UAPA. Of late, J&K government has initiated several tough measures aimed at “dismantling the entire terror infrastructure”, which include sacking government servants and denying government benefits to those found to be overground workers or terror sympathisers. The Centre had earlier banned the JKLF and Jamaat e Islami, which were constituents of Hurriyat Conference at one point of time, under UAPA. The Hurriyat conference was founded in 1993 with several political, social and religious parties with differing ideologies but united by a separatist agenda, as its constituents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-may-ban-all-hurriyat-factions-for-financing-terror/articleshow/87919405.cms||Bharti Jain

A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath said only those who were experts in Physics and also well-conversed in both Hindi and English could decide whether there was any discrepancy in the question paper. Some of the medical aspirants who chose the Hindi medium in the MBBS entrance examination alleged that there was an error in question number 2 of the Physics section. They alleged that in the Hindi version of the question, the words “amplitude of current” had been omitted and candidates who attempted the question based on the Hindi translation arrived at a different answer. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for NTA, said the best way to deal with the issue was to take the help of experts and agreed to set up a panel. The bench posted the case for November 30. “During the course of the hearing, Tushar Mehta, solicitor general, has submitted that in order to allay the apprehensions of students who appeared for NEET (UG) 2021 with Hindi as the medium, the solutions to both the Hindi and English versions of Question No 2 of Section-A in Physics Paper (Code ) shall be evaluated again by a committee consisting of three experts. After this process is done, it has been submitted that an affidavit would be filed setting out the result of the evaluation of the solutions,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/experts-to-study-if-neet-question-in-hindi-got-lost-in-translation/articleshow/87919470.cms||---

Dalit-converts are treated as backward community (BC) members and not as SCs, as per law. In Tamil Nadu, weddings involving a forward caste member with SC/ST, or a wedding between a BC member and an SC/ST are treated as inter-caste weddings entailing priority in government jobs. Justice S M Subramaniam, reiterating that merely because of conversion and his consequent categorisation as a BC member, a Dalit cannot claim his marriage to another Dalit as an inter-caste marriage, said: “The petitioner admittedly belongs to Christian Adi-Dravidar community and by virtue of conversion to Christianity he was issued with the Backward Class certificate. However, by birth, the petitioner belongs to 'Adi-Dravidar' community and change of religion will not change the community. The classification of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes, Most Backward Classes, Backward Classes and Other castes will not change the caste.” It was the case of S Paul Raj that he belonged to Christian Adi-Dravida possessing a Backward Class certificate. He married G Amutha, who belongs to Hindu Arunthathiyar community. Post-marriage, Paul Raj claimed that it was an inter-caste marriage since he was now a BC member and not a Dalit. A BC member’s marriage with an SC member shall be treated as an inter-caste marriage, with all attendant benefits, he claimed. He relied on a December 2, 1976 government order which says: "Where one of the spouses belongs to SC/ST, then inter-caste marriage certificate has to be issued in favour of the petitioner”. He moved the high court after the Salem district officials rejected his contention, pointing out that he himself hailed from a Dalit community and that his conversion will not undo his caste status. Upholding the finding, Justice Subramaniam said: “In the event of a converted person claiming inter-caste marriage certificate, it would pave way for the citizen to abuse the benefit granted under the inter-caste marriage quota. The repercussion will be large and, therefore, the inter-caste marriage certificate has to be issued only if any one of the spouses belongs to the Scheduled Caste and other spouse belongs to the other caste, but not otherwise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/religious-conversion-does-not-change-caste-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/87919572.cms||Sureshkumar

Appearing for the SIT, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar that Jafri’s original complaint in 2006 was about 30-40 pages levelling allegations about every ruling party politician, bureaucracy and police being involved in the larger conspiracy, which meant that the state had turned against its people. Rohatgi said over the years, allegations have become wilder and bulkier, with the 2018 petition seeking fresh probe into the allegations now running into hundreds of pages. “The complainant is driven by Setalvad and her NGO to make such wild allegations. Nonetheless, the SIT assiduously investigated each and every allegation, made recommendations for prosecution of many who had earlier been left out, but found their allegations about a larger conspiracy founded on the statements of three tainted police officers — R B Sreekumar, Rahul Sharma and Sanjiv Bhat,” he said. Reading out the details of the investigations into the allegations, Rohatgi said an allegation was levelled that arms and ammunitions were manufactured illegally by several persons much prior to the riots and extra-judicial confessions to this effect were recorded in a sting operation carried out by journalist Ashish Khetan and aired by the web portal Tehelka. “This means these people knew that Sabarmati Express would be set afire at Godhra on February 27, that there would be an angry reaction by people and that when the mob starts retaliating against a particular community, these arms and ammunition manufacturers would supply it to them. This is the sum and substance of the wider conspiracy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teesta-driving-jafri-to-make-wild-claims-sit-on-gujarat-riots/articleshow/87919623.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Both TMC and CPM declared the elections a farce and demanded a repoll, pointing to violence that left 32 people injured across the state. The younger brother of BJP MLA Ashis Kumar Saha and a 75-year-old man on his way to a polling booth were among those allegedly assaulted by workers of the saffron party in Agartala. CPM state secretary Jitendra Chowdhury accused the police of looking the other way as votes were rigged and voters were prevented from entering booths. TMC state convener Subal Bhowmik alleged that the police remained inert despite being tipped about the troublemakers. He said BJP cadres “came from outside” to intimidate voters. “The government machinery has defied the Supreme Court’s directive to deploy enough forces to ensure free and fair voting. We shall move the Supreme Court, demanding fresh elections under the court’s watch,” he said. Contesting allegations of rigging and violence, BJP cited a “higher” turnout of voters than in previous civic polls as proof of “spontaneous” participation. Party spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said, “In some places, TMC and CPM jointly plotted to defame BJP and the government”. A total of 44 people were arrested for violence and over 150 TMC and CPM cadres detained. CPM members had assembled in front of West Agartala police station for a protest while TMC workers organised a sit-in in front of East Agartala police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/widespread-violence-mars-civic-polls-in-tripura-oppn-accuses-bjp-of-rigging/articleshow/87919721.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Without naming China or Pakistan, who were represented by Premier Li Keqiang and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi respectively at the meeting, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said such initiatives must also conform to the most basic principle of international law — respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Jaishankar was addressing virtually the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting in Kazakhstan. “India believes that greater connectivity is an economic force-multiplier which has acquired greater salience in the post-Covid era. However, any serious connectivity initiative must be consultative, transparent and participatory,” said Jaishankar, even as he reaffirmed India’s commitment to cooperate, plan, invest and build physical and digital connectivity in the SCO region. In an apparent reference to Pakistan’s efforts to raise the Kashmir issue at SCO, he said it was unfortunate to note there had been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. “This violates the well-established principles and norms of SCO Charter. Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” he said. “India considers the SCO as an important regional group to promote cooperation in various fields based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-presence-of-premier-li-keqiang-shah-mahmood-qureshi-mea-jaishankar-slams-bri-at-sco/articleshow/87919786.cms||---
---||India||More women than men in India, says NFHS, but sex ratio at birth a worry||The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data for 2019-21 indicates that India has more females than males with its overall sex ratio having risen to 1,020 after seeing a dip from 1,000 in 2005-06 to 991 in 2015-16. The sex ratio at birth (SRB), however, was still worryingly low at 929, indicating continued sex selection at birth, despite an improvement from the previous survey. The increase in overall sex ratio is a combination of increased life expectancy of women and improvement in the sex ratio at birth or the number of female births for every 1,000 male births. India’s poor sex ratio at birth has been a source of national shame and concern as it indicates a general preference for a male child and also that lakhs of female foetuses are being killed. The NFHS-5 sex ratio data seems to be at variance with that of the census. For instance, according to the 2001 census, India’s overall sex ratio was 933, but NFHS-3 conducted in 2005-06 pegged it at 1,000. Again, the 2011 census found the sex ratio to be 940, but according to NFHS-4 (20015-16) it was 991. Being a sample survey, NFHS data could be less accurate and only the next census would reveal whether there actually are more females than males in India, though both sources show a steady improvement in overall sex ratio. Sex ratio at birth of just 929 for the five years preceding the latest survey is still well below the mark of 952 that the WHO estimates as the natural sex ratio at birth. The practice of sex selection at birth continues to be prevalent in most parts of India with the practice spreading to even parts that traditionally had better sex ratio such as tribal states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, some of the states with the worst sex ratio at birth, such as Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, showed significant improvement. SRB of 929 is a definite improvement over 914 in 2005-06 and 919 in 2015-16, but several bigger states, including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bihar and Maharashtra, saw a worsening the ratio since the last survey. These were offset by significant improvement in SRB in a much higher number of large states, including Karnataka, Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, UP, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In most states, the sex ratio at birth is lower in urban areas where there is greater access to sex selection technologies. The latest survey also shows a narrowing of the gap between the two as urban areas have shown higher improvement than rural areas. Despite the fall in SRB in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Odisha, the overall sex ratio in these states improved, most likely because of a rise in female life expectancy in these states. Huge improvement in India’s overall sex ratio indicates that along with improvement in SRB in many of the large states, female life expectancy too is likely to have improved across all states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/more-women-than-men-in-india-says-nfhs-but-sex-ratio-at-birth-a-worry/articleshow/87919818.cms||---

Ramkirat Goud, then in his twenties, had bludgeoned the child’s head with a rock after raping her and left the body to rot in a mud pond. Maggots were crawling on it when it was found four days later. The HC also directed the state to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh under the victim compensation scheme to the father within 30 days. The “crime smacks of degradation of a girl child, depravity and perversity” and its “barbaric and inhuman manner’’ made it the rarest of rare case, fit for sending the convict to the gallows, said the court. It is a abhorrent crime that would send a “chill down the spine” of every parent of a girl child. The HC confirmed the death sentence awarded in 2019 by the Mumbai special trial judge under the Pocso Act. It said the timing of the crime that was gauged from the maggots on the body matched with unexplained injuries on the accused. It said the accused “has not shown any remorse’’ and the only mitigating circumstance cited is “economic stringency of his family”. “It is the safety of a girl child which is of paramount importance to a society,’’ said the bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-high-court-confirms-death-for-man-in-rape-murder-of-3-year-old-kid/articleshow/87919860.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||World||Americans mark 'closer-to-normal' Thanksgiving; Biden says, 'we're back'||NEW DELHI: “After two years, we're back. America is back. There's nothing we're unable to overcome,” President Joe Biden told an NBC broadcaster over the phone as he watched the broadcast of Macy's Thanksgiving parade in New York City, with his family from Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Thursday. After mostly keeping to homes last year, the Americans marked a "closer-to-normal" Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, just four days after an SUV plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee of Wisconsin state, killing six people, including an eight-year-old. The president, who is in Nantucket for the holiday weekend, wished Americans a happy and closer-to-normal Thanksgiving on Thursday, the second celebrated in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic. "As we give thanks for what we have, we also keep in our hearts those who have been lost and those who have lost so much," the president said in a video greeting recorded with first lady Jill Biden at the White House before their trip to Nantucket. On Nantucket, the Bidens visited the Coast Guard station at Brant Point to meet with US servicemembers from around the world virtually, besides the personnel at the station. "I'm thankful for these guys," the president said when asked what he was thankful for, referring to the Coast Guard members standing ramrod straight in front of him on the grounds. Earlier, Bidens travelled by motorcade to the Coast Guard station amid cheers and waves by well-wishers. From Nantucket, the Bidens also called in to the nearly century-old Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, briefly bantering with NBC broadcaster Al Roker. 'Festive and full of life'Shut out last year in the wake of the Covid-19, the holiday tradition of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade returned in full on Thursday, marking its 95th year, albeit with precautions. With vaccinations and booster shots, spectators again lined the route as some 8,000 participants joined the parade that included hundreds of clowns, dozens of balloons and floats and, of course, Santa Claus, as the marching bands from across the country played. Parade employees and volunteers had to be vaccinated against the Covid-19 and wear masks. ``It really made Thanksgiving feel very festive and full of life,'' Sierra Guardiola, a 23-year-old interior design firm assistant, said after watching the spectacle in a turkey-shaped hat. “It's like the whole spirit of New York has come and gathered so we can be together,” said Sebastian Pompey-Schoelkopf, a school kid. Last Thanksgiving, with no vaccines available and the virus beginning a winter surge in New York, the parade was confined to one block and sometimes pre-taped. Most performers were local to cut down on travel, and the giant balloons were tethered to vehicles instead of being handled by volunteers. No spectators were allowed. With the Wisconsin memory afresh, mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday there was no credible, specific threat to the Thanksgiving parade, but security was extensive. It involved thousands of police officers, heavy-weapons teams, radiation and chemical sensors and over 300 extra cameras as well as sand-filled garbage trucks and concrete barriers blocking cars from the parade route and bomb-detecting dogs. Entertainers and celebrities included Carrie Underwood, Jon Batiste, Nelly, Kelly Rowland, Miss America Camille Schrier and the band Foreigner among many others. Several Broadway musical casts and the Radio City Rockettes also performed. Football, feasts and more...Not just parades, Americans also flocked to packed football stadiums, travelled and gathered more freely for family feasts on Thursday to celebrate the Thanksgiving Day traditions. News agency Reuters quoted an American Automobile Association data, according to which an estimated 53.4 million people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving, up 13% from 2020. Air traffic rebounded strongly, with the US officers screening 2.31 million people at travel checkpoints on Wednesday, representing 88% of the volume screened on the same day in 2019. It was the highest checkpoint volume since the pandemic low of 87,534 on April 13, 2020, Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Lisa Farbstein wrote on Twitter. BREAKING NEWS: @TSA officers screened 2,311,978 people nationwide yesterday, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, mak… https://t.co/G4tASMyBWC— Lisa Farbstein, TSA Spokesperson (@TSA_Northeast) 1637843296000Fans also packed Ford Field stadium in Detroit for the first of three National Football League games on Thursday, as compared to last year when there were none in the stands. Midnight after Thanksgiving also marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season. But this year, retailers started promoting online holiday "deals" as early as September. A brief historyThe annual national holiday in the United States and Canada is mostly the celebration of good harvest and other blessings. It is believed that the holiday dates back to the early 17th century, when pilgrims from Europe and Native Americans gathered to share the autumn bounty — a celebration of goodwill, before a genocide. According to Britannica, Thanksgiving is modelled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English pilgrims/colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. Plymouth’s Thanksgiving began with a few colonists going out “fowling”. However, around 90 Wampanoag people made a surprise appearance at the English settlement’s gate, unnerving the 50-odd colonists. The two groups, however, socialised without any incident over the next few days. Nowadays, the long holiday weekend is synonymous with families scattered across the country coming together for holiday meals, mainly of turkey and deserts, colourful parades and start of the festive (read shopping) season. Also an occasion to count one's blessings, Thanksgiving even prompts an outpouring of donations to the poor and hungry.

The 16-year-old girl had completed 25 weeks and 3 days of gestation as on November 17, 2021, exceeding the 24-week ceiling fixed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971. Justice NS Sanjay Gowda of the court's Dharwad bench said in an order passed last week: "The petitioner is just 16 years of age and her capability to deliver a child and foster it in the social milieu that she exists will have to be kept in mind while considering her request for terminating the pregnancy… Her parents are not possessed of means. The consequences of continuing the pregnancy would be severe and detrimental to a dignified life as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution." The teenager was allegedly raped on February 8, 2021. Belagavi police had registered a case under IPC and Pocso Act against a father-son duo. With the medical practitioner and district hospital expressing helplessness due to the 24-week cap on abortion, the girl approached the high court, contending she "cannot be forced to carry the burden of a crime and deliver a baby conceived against will". Considering her plea, the court had directed constitution of a medical board that said it would be a case of high-risk pregnancy for both girl and foetus since the petitioner was a teenager. Also, the board said the pregnancy, if allowed to continue, could possibly affect the girl's mental health. Considering these aspects, Justice Sanjay Gowda has said the fate of the child may be "perilous and detrimental to its own interest", while ordering immediate abortion at the district hospital. The judge has noted that the right of a woman to exercise her reproductive choice is a dimension of "personal liberty" under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and she has a sacrosanct right to have her bodily integrity protected. The act of forcing a woman to bear with "an unwanted intrusion on her body" and endure its consequences would transgress her inviolable fundamental right of "personal liberty" guaranteed in the Constitution, the judge has said. "In cases of rape inflicted on minor girls, though there are certain statutory limitations prescribed under the 1971 Act, they would essentially be applicable only to medical practitioners. In such cases, the requirement to terminate the pregnancy medically would have to be considered and examined in an altogether different light by the constitutional courts," the judge has said.

---||India||‘Legislature business, not Rs 100 crore, discussed at Deshmukh meet’||MUMBAI: In a denial that any discussion on mobilisation of Rs 100 crore had taken place, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze said before the Justice K U Chandiwal commission on Thursday that there was discussion exclusively on the business before the state legislature at a meeting convened on February 21 by the then home minister Anil Deshmukh, which he attended. In his letter sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir had stated that the home minister had asked Waze to accumulate Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in the city. Singh had stated that in and around mid-February and thereafter, the then home minister Deshmukh had called Waze to his official residence. At that time, one or two staff members of the home minister, including his private secretary Sanjeev Palande, were also present. During cross-examination by Shekhar Jagtap, counsel for Palande, Waze said the then home minister had convened a meeting on February 21 at his official residence. Waze said the meeting pertained to preparations for legislative assembly questions and immediately after the meeting, he left the minister’s residence. On November 22, Singh’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud had told the commission that the March 20 letter was hearsay, based on the information given by Singh’s subordinates and colleagues. Following Singh’s letter, Anil Deshmukh had quit the cabinet, and the state government set up a one-man commission led by Justice K U Chandiwal to probe the charges levelled by the former Mumbai CP. The commission is likely to issue a production warrant against Anil Deshmukh for his presence before the panel during the course of inquiry. Deshmukh’s lawyer will cross-examine Waze on Friday. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said on Thursday that from the depositions before the Justice K U Chandiwal commission, it appeared that former Param Bir Singh’s letter was politically motivated and was an attempt to destabilize the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “Singh had written a very damaging letter, following which the NCP leadership sacked Anil Deshmukh. Now, his counsel tells the commission that the letter was hearsay, based on information given by his subordinates. I am surprised how a senior IPS officer can write a letter to the chief minister without verification,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/legislature-business-not-rs-100-crore-discussed-at-deshmukh-meet/articleshow/87919916.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The probe was ordered nearly two weeks after the Karnataka Contractors' Association wrote to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) alleging they are being harassed by politicians and officials seeking a higher kickback. After a cabinet meeting here, the CM said he asked chief secretary P Ravi Kumar to inquire into the allegations and submit a report but hasn't set any deadline. "Based on the findings, if anybody is found guilty, we'll take action against them," he said. "I don't know why they (contractors) have written to the PMO. They have neither given any evidence nor mentioned any specific incident. Despite that, I have ordered an inquiry in order to bring out the truth," the CM said. According to sources, the PMO reportedly sought an explanation from the state government about the complaint and the inquiry is a fallout of it. The CM has asked the chief secretary to consider all details of the complaint by contractors and scrutinise all tenders floated after the BJP government came to power. "I've also ordered a special scrutiny of tenders awarded during my tenure," he said. He also instructed the CS to issue a government order to set up two committees headed by retired judges to scrutinise tender documents — estimates and conditions — before floating tenders for all government works. Govt mulling e-billing: CMThe cabinet last month had decided this to bring in transparency in the tendering process. The CM said the government is also mulling bringing in a system to raise bills of contractors electronically to avoid allegations of favouritism and reduce delay. Government sources said the government ordered the probe keeping in view the upcoming winter session in Belagavi where the opposition Congress is preparing to put the government on the mat on this issue. The contractors' association has planned a massive protest in Bengaluru in December if dues are not cleared. In its letter to the PMO, the association had said that bills worth Rs 17,000 crore, including Rs 4500 crore from the Public Works Department and Rs 6,000 crore in water resources departments, are pending. BBMP also owes them Rs 3,000 crore. "How can quality work be executed by paying up such a large share of the tender as bribes?'' the association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-orders-probe-into-40-kickback-claims/articleshow/87919926.cms||---

The number of those who secured more than 700 marks out of 720 in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (UG) this year was nearly four times more than that of 2020. As many as 11 students from Karnataka scored above 700 in 2021. As per the data shared by National Testing Agency, no student could get over 700 in 2019. In 2020, three students managed to make the cut. In the top 50,000 ranks, there are 2,291 students from Karnataka, an increase of 279. In the first one lakh students, 5,364 are from Karnataka. The number was only 4,775 in 2020. In the bracket of 650-699 marks, Karnataka has 212 students this year, as against 143 last year and 32 in 2019. In all, there are 629 students who scored above 99 percentile from Karnataka. The number of students in the 600-649 bracket remains more or less the same with only nine more entering it. In the 550-599 group, 42 more students secured the marks, taking the total to 1,328. The trend in Karnataka is in sync with the national performance, where there is an 83% increase in the total number of candidates scoring more than 700. TOI had reported that state-wise candidates from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh continued their dominance in the exam. Experts say the numbers are overwhelming. “There are two reasons why students are scoring well in NEET,” said Sridhar G, founder, Deeksha. “When NEET started, the physics and chemistry papers were on a par with JEE papers. But after the pandemic, the papers were made simple and faithful to NCERT,” he said. “Additionally, with board exams getting cancelled students could focus completely on NEET. The delay in conducting the test also gave them more time to prepare,” he added. Sridhar said this has also contributed to improvement in the relative performance of Karnataka students in comparison with other states. “This is because in Karnataka most students who take NEET are first-timers. Unlike states like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh or Tamil Nadu, repeating is not a culture here, as the engineering options are very good. Repeaters have the advantage of not focusing on board exams, which the freshers also got this time. This provided a level-playing field to both,” he said. Mahesh Yadav, south India head of Allen career institute, said students have also adjusted well to the online mode. “Last year, they were not as comfortable with online classes as they were this year. They have been in regular touch with teachers now. With classes going online, students also saved time they spent on travel,” he said. However, whether the cutoff for UG medical/dental admissions will rise will depend on the seat matrix, which is yet to be announced in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/ktaka-students-among-10000-neet-toppers-double-in-2-years/articleshow/87922114.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Bengaluru||Astronaut training facility in Bengaluru may be opened in December||BENGALURU: Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which has finalised the syllabus for astronaut training in India for the Gaganyaan programme, will soon be making operational a basic or ad hoc astronaut training facility off Old Airport Road in Bengaluru. While this centre — hosting at least three types of simulators and other training facilities — is expected to be launched as early as December, a larger, more sophisticated astronaut training facility will eventually come up in Challakere, some 200km from Bengaluru, for future human space programmes. Isro chairman K Sivan said: “...We are looking at next month for the inauguration. This will be an ad hoc facility being designed specifically for Gaganyaan.” As reported by TOI earlier, Isro, which had been planning a human spaceflight programme since at least 2010, had considered multiple areas for the proposed training facility. Initially, the proximity to its own headquarters and Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) on Old Airport Road was considered significantly important. Given the extent of land required, the agency was looking at an area near one of its guesthouses in Devanahalli which would be close enough to Bengaluru, while also exploring places near IAM within the city. The Devanahalli plot, a scientist said, was being considered even immediately after PM Modi announced the mission. Eventually, Isro decided to create a full-fledged astronaut training centre in Challakere. This will come up a few years later and is meant for future missions as it could not be developed within the timeline set for Gaganyaan. Syllabus finalisedIsro Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) director S Unnikrishnan Nair told TOI: “The plot belongs to URSAC and is near IAM and ISITE (Isro Satellite Integration and Testing Establishment). This is where Gaganyaan astronauts will train. The facility will host different kinds of simulators and also have space for theory classes.” He said the syllabus for astronaut training has been finalised and the faculty panel has members from institutions like IAM, IISc and IIT, former astronauts like Rakesh Sharma and some former Isro directors/deputy directors. “It is a vast syllabus focusing on areas like crew module, orbital module, redundancies, where various items will be in the module, orbital distance, technical and theoretical systems et al,” Nair said. For practical training, he said Isro was working on commissioning three types of simulators, including the final one that will be the crew module simulator with internal settings, ECLS (environment control and life support) systems and so on. “The first kind are virtual reality simulators being procured commercially. Here the crew will have various displays to learn from and these will be put up on a desktop. From vehicle parameters to mission and support parameters, everything will be on the desktop. The second one will simulate various interactions with the machine and so on. And then the real crew module simulator with all the internal settings will come up. The last one will be built gradually,” Nair explained. He said no decision was made on what would happen to this facility once the full-fledged one comes up. Sivan said: “That is still some time away. Right now, we’re focused on training for Gaganyaan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/astronaut-training-facility-in-bluru-may-be-opened-in-dec/articleshow/87919932.cms||---

Cloudy weather with moderate to heavy rain and squally wind may be seen in many places of southern India till November 29, Indian Meteorological Department said. A cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Bay of Bengal, off south Sri Lanka coast, at lower tropospheric levels and strong north-easterly winds are prevailing over Tamil Nadu coast and south coastal Andhra Pradesh at lower levels. Under its influence, light to moderate widespread rain is very likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh, south-interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during the next four days. Bengaluru too is likely to witness heavy rain during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gear-up-for-a-wet-and-windy-weekend/articleshow/87919934.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Train travel from Bengaluru to Chennai, Hyderabad likely to get shorter||BENGALURU: Train travel from Bengaluru to Chennai and Hyderabad is likely to get faster as the railways is planning to increase the speed on the routes to 160kmph. This means travel time between Bengaluru and Hyderabad (632km) is expected to come down to 5-7 hours from the current 10-12 hours. Similarly, travel time to Chennai (362km) may reduce to 3-4 hours from 5-6 hours. The railways is planning to prepare a detailed project report to up the speed on these two routes. “The idea is to upgrade these corridors to semi-high speed corridors (160 kmph),” said Aneesh Hegde, chief public relations officer, SWR. The DPR will determine the techno-economic feasibility of enhancing the speed to 160kmph and provide technical inputs needed for achieving it on each route. Sources said the actual speed will be lower even if the tracks are upgraded to 160kmph as no train will continuously run at the top speed. A railway official said it would be too early to determine the average speed of trains after enhancing the speed (up to 160kmph). He added: “The railway board has already issued various policies for achieving the speed of 160kmph. The DPR will assess the available infrastructure as against the policy and identify the work to be carried out in order to make it possible to attain 160kmph in all aspects of train operations.” The zones through which the routes pass will have to prepare the report in two months, says a letter from the railway board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/train-travel-to-chennai-hyd-likely-to-get-shorter/articleshow/87919936.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||NCRB: At least 2 die each day after falling into open pits and manholes||Bengaluru: Open pits and manholes have killed at least two people in India every day since 2015. A staggering 5,393 such deaths have been recorded, including 841 in 2020, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).While deaths caused by open pits and manholes are “absolutely preventable”, the NCRB classifies them under “accidental” deaths. Lawyers and urban planners assert that these deaths are “preventable” and recommend that the government consider them as “deaths caused ‘due to negligence’ if not ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’”, and not merely record them as accidental fall.“There’s a concept called absolute liability. Maintenance of manholes, sewers and roads are all statutory duties of the state’s authorities, which is why we pay tax and we have governments and bureaucracy. When someone dies because of an open manhole or gets electrocuted because of an unattended live wire, the authorities are answerable. All these deaths are preventable,” said advocate Clifton Rozario.Between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020, only 3% of people involved in such preventable falls actually survived with injuries — 5,568 people fell into either a manhole or a pit, and only 175 survived, while 5,393 had a fatal fall. Around 14% died after falling into manholes. The remaining 4,622 fell into pits and died.“Not only are the authorities liable to compensate the families of victims monetarily but they are also criminally liable,” Rozario said, adding that such deaths, are deaths caused by negligence or dereliction of duty.MG Devasahayam — former IAS officer with extensive experience in urban development department, and presently working on urban issues in Tamil Nadu — said: “Given that this is clearly a governance issue, it is important to fix accountability. Therefore, it becomes necessary that we first classify these deaths appropriately. As long as we call them accidental falls, there is going to be no change in the scenario on ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ncrb-at-least-2-die-each-day-after-falling-into-open-pits-and-manholes/articleshow/87919937.cms||---

A brief event to celebrate its long existence and to educate residents of their area’s historical past, will be held at Singapura Varadarajaswamy temple on Singapura Day. The area, which is now part of bustling Bengaluru and was recently in the news following Singapura Lake overflowing, was inhabited since the early 16th century. “There were two stone inscriptions discovered in 1905 and one as latest as 2018 in the area which talk about Singapura, a fortified town where people lived during the Vijayanagara period. The writings in old Kannada on stone describe the Tiruvengalanatha temple which is the present day Varadarajaswamy temple on a hillock of Singapura,” said historian Udaya Kumar PL. Kumar said the inscriptions referred to a chieftain, Singappanayakka, after whom the area took its name and also on its wetlands, the people who lived, their religious practices and mainly the donations to the hillock temple by wealthy residents. A magazine titled Bengaluru Itihaasa Vaibhava with a feature on Singapura will be launched at the temple on Friday evening. The project is being funded by the Mythic Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/day-to-celebrate-singapuras-497-years/articleshow/87919940.cms||Petlee Peter

The judge also ordered notice to Cubbon Park police and Adarsh R Iyer, the complainant. The officers have challenged the November 23, 2021 order passed by the VIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, referring Iyer’s complaint against them to the station house officer, Cubbon Park police station, for investigation under section 156(3) of CrPC. The magistrate had ordered registering of an FIR for alleged offence under section 166A of IPC (public servant disobeying direction under law) vis-a-vis the officers’ failure to take action on the sex-for-job complaint submitted by Dinesh Kallahalli.Appearing for the officers, advocate P Prasanna Kumar told the court that the FIR in connection with the same case was registered after the woman came forward and filed a complaint through her lawyer. The investigation has been completed and the final report could not be filed because of the interim order granted by the division bench in a PIL wherein the case is being monitored. He also added the complainant is a third party and an activist, who should have told the magistrate about the developments in the case as they are widely published on every date of hearing. The court was also told that Dinesh Kallahalli had withdrawn his complaint. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said the complainant may have not been aware of all these proceedings and in these circumstances, investigation against the petitioners appears to be not proper. The officers have claimed that the magistrate has mechanically passed the order without even mentioning whether the allegations would satisfy the ingredients of cognizable offence against them .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hcs-interim-stay-on-case-against-top-cop-2-officers/articleshow/87919942.cms||---

The victims have approached Whitefield CEN Crime police station with complaints against the suspects, Srikant and Ramachandra. Police said they collected money on a monthly or daily basis from middle-class families who intended to purchase gold. They promised jewellery without making charges and wastage charges at the end of the scheme. But recently, the duo closed their shop in Marathahalli and went missing. Two cases were registered against them on November 18 and a third case on November 20. Vijay Bhaskar SV, 50, of Yemalur said two years ago, Ramachandra asked him to invest in a scheme run by Srikanth. According to the scheme, the members should pay Rs 100 or Rs 3,000 per month for two years and they could purchase gold at the end of scheme period. Ramachandra also assured Bhaskar that there would be a lucky draw and the winner would get a bike as first prize and gold as other prizes. “I paid Rs 100 daily and based on my suggestion, 10 of my friends and relatives also became members. Each of us have paid at least Rs 60,000 till now. Our scheme period ended in September and they asked us to collect the gold chain on November 15. But the shop remained closed. They vacated the shop on November 12 and switched off their mobile phones,” Bhaskar alleged. Chandrashekhar N, 72, who runs a juice centre in B Narayanapura, alleged that he had paid Rs 1.2 lakh in 24 instalments of Rs 5,000 each, while his four friends had also paid similar amounts. Siddegowda, 37, who runs a bakery at Annasandrapalya, alleged that he paid the duo Rs 400 daily for two years. Besides them, over a hundred investors later filed complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/jeweller-aide-on-the-run-after-duping-over-100-in-gold-scheme-plaints-filed/articleshow/87919943.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The two convicts are Ghayur Ahmad Jamali and Aftab Alam alias Farook from Bihar. Police appealed against the seven-year imprisonment in the Karnataka high court, which allowed the appeal. The HC then referred the matter back to the NIA special court for fresh consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stadium-blast-2-convicts-now-get-life-term/articleshow/87919945.cms||---

On November 17, N Aravind, 50, of Yeshwantpur, filed a complaint on that Hamsalekha had defamed the late Pejawar Mutt seer Vishwesha Teertha Swami and hurt religious sentiments during a speech in Mysuru on November 13. Police registered a case and served two notices asking the music director to appear before them. According to the FIR, Hamsalekha, whose real name is G Gangaraju, has been booked under IPC sections 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) and 295A (deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). As Hamsalekha arrived with his advocate, groups opposing and supporting him exchanged arguments outside the police station. The shouting match hit a crescendo when actor Chetan joined the group supporting Hamsalekha. Police had to place barricades to keep the groups apart. “Hamsalekha said he did not pass any comments to hurt anyone. We have asked him to cooperate with the probe,” a police source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/groups-trade-words-as-music-director-appears-before-cops/articleshow/87919946.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Mechanic stealing cars on test drive held||BENGALURU: A 32-year-old car mechanic has landed in police custody for allegedly stealing four-wheelers from owners on the pretext of taking them for test drive. The accused is Srinivas N, a resident of Chikkasanne in Devanahalli. Police records show that Srinivas, who is from Doddaballapur, was arrested twice on similar charges. In 2018, Rajagopal Nagar police recovered 11 used cars stolen by Srinivas after taking them for test drive. In February this year, Doddaballapur police arrested him and recovered nine cars. According to cops, gambling and alcohol addiction pushed Srinivas, a school dropout, to adopt illegal ways in life. As a car mechanic, he came to know about people looking to sell their cars through his contacts. Now, Mahalakshmipuram police have recovered seven cars worth Rs 35 lakh from him. On November 8, businessman Anil Kumar, 31, lodged a complaint saying a man, identified as Srinivas from Doddaballapur, had driven away with his Toyota Etios Liva, purchased in 2018. Kumar said Srinivas had called him and said he was a used car dealer interested in buying the car. Disappearing actWhen Kumar asked Srinivas how he knew he wanted to sell the car, the latter is said to have dropped a common friend’s name. The two men met near Mahalakshmi Metro station and Srinivas drove away the vehicle for a test drive. Kumar approached police when Srinivas failed to return and his mobile phone was switched off. Old records showed a similar case being reported in Rajagopal Nagar police limits, which is close to Mahalakshmipuram station, in 2018. When police showed him Srinivas’s picture, Kumar identified him. “We arrested Srinivas and recovered seven cars, including that of Kumar. Srinivas had sold the cars to persons in Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru districts, the rural parts of Doddaballapur, and Bengaluru,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mechanic-stealing-cars-on-test-drive-held/articleshow/87919949.cms||---

Saroja of Doddabidarakallu filed a complaint with Varthur police earlier this week against Lenin Mathew and Mini Joshi.

They assaulted us when we asked them to return our money and documents,” Saroja said in her complaint.

It’s 7-Eleven's first tech hub outside the US. The chain also tied up with Future Retail to set up its first store in Mumbai this year. 7-Eleven is a convenience store for food, snacks, hot and cold beverages, gas and even offers ATM services. The $58-billion retail chain has over 60,000 stores. It popular menu items include the Slurpee drink, the Big Gulp and the Big Bite. Jennifer Goschke, VP and country leader, global solution centre - India at 7-Eleven, said the teams in India are an extension of the core tech team based in Dallas. "We have onboarded 100 employees and plan to double it in the next year. India and the US centres will complement each other. Bengaluru is a great place for tech talent. Over time, we are going to move some processes here including some finance and accounting. We are in the early stages of that,” she said. Goschke said she grew up going to 7-Eleven, biking to the store twice a day. The Bengaluru centre is already working on IT and information security. “Our teams are optimising processes, automating processes. We are not looking at specific roles in India, we are picking entire processes to bring over, and optimise them,” she said. 7-Eleven is moving to a cloud architecture. The plan is to leverage cloud and AI/ML experts in both the tech hubs to provide customers a seamless experience. “With millions of footfalls daily, we have to ensure customer data is secure. So security is a centrepiece of our strategy,” Goschke said. India is home to tech centres and shared services centres of hundreds of global companies. Many of these are retailers. There are US ones including Target, Saks Fifth Avenue, JCPenney and Lowe’s. There's UK-based Tesco. Continental European retailers are now treading the same path. 7-Eleven has partnered with Lalit Ahuja's ANSR, the Bengaluru-based firm that helps establish and operate these centres - called global capability centres (GCCs) - in India. “ANSR is now bringing a new GCC every month, driven by the success of its GCC-as-a-service subscription model that helps us stand up GCCs without any capital investment in 2-3 months. With a huge pipeline of companies, ANSR expects to cross 100 unique companies by the middle of next year,” Ahuja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/7-eleven-sets-up-global-tech-centre-in-bengaluru/articleshow/87919953.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Red Hat hiring will be skewed towards junior-level engineers||BENGALURU: Timothy Cramer, SVP of software engineering in Red Hat, has said in an internal memo that engineering hiring will be skewed towards junior-level engineers over senior resources. The move could potentially open several entry-level positions in India where the company employs close to 5,000 people, sources told TOI. In India, Red Hat has roles for engineers across the tech portfolio like solutions architect for cloud platform and storage, cloud native technical sales engineer, software engineer for OpenShift, and architect for middleware. Red Hat’s OpenShift is a popular platform that companies use to build and deploy applications in a hybrid cloud environment. Cramer’s memo said, "All new plan reqs should be opened at a level below senior (eg, associate software engineer or software engineer)....While this change allows us to use our budget more effectively, it also helps us balance the organisation as we have many engineers with senior titles. We recognise that this will mean we need to plan for training and mentoring, promotions, and internal mobility as well, and we are here to support you in that." The memo said all current requirements and future backfills will be down-levelled by one level by default (eg, senior software engineer to software engineer). When TOI contacted Red Hat on the matter, the company said, “Tim’s group represents one function in Red Hat that had a tremendous amount of growth this year. We are excited to see his team incorporate and leverage the almost 1,000 new hires they brought on board while we invest in the other aspects of the business. As a whole, Red Hat has added more than 2,200 new associates this year to help us meet the demand for hybrid cloud technology and to grow in areas like managed services and edge. As we continue to invest in those areas and beyond, we anticipate continuing that growth across Red Hat.” The company said the intent is to make sure that it’s nurturing the next generation of engineering talent across its key technology areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/red-hat-hiring-will-be-skewed-towards-junior-level-engineers/articleshow/87919954.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

It is a feature-rich, secure mailbox that accepts delivery via robotic, unmanned driverless, aerial drone or conventional means. It is set to disrupt all shipping verticals to include receiving or sending food, medicine, groceries, or other parcels,” BEL said in a statement. Pointing out that Dronedek must work with the reliability and redundancy of a 747 airliner with 300 people on it, Dan O'Toole, the firm’s founder and CEO said: “This new collaboration with BEL gives us the edge and credibility we have been looking for in the marketplace.”BEL CMD Anandi Ramalingam said the PSU was constantly raising the bar on its technical offerings and that it wishes to continue to be a ‘company of firsts’. “The collaboration presents BEL a new vertical in the changing landscape of worldwide, last-mile logistics, one in which we will be able to put a stake in the ground and build on,” she said.Designed to accept drone delivery, the Dronedek mailbox also accepts traditional mail delivery, and is destined to become an everyday utility service like power or water, BEL said, adding that the device is capable of keeping packages hot or cold; will alert users to package arrival; recharge drones; and even serve as an emergency alert if necessary. “An app controls when the device is opened for delivery or retrieval and also controls its emergency alarm features. Dronedek solves three of the most critical challenges of delivering packages in “the last mile” of the delivery route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bel-dronedek-ink-pact-for-smart-drone-delivery-mailboxes/articleshow/87919981.cms||---

In the day’s second match, Tamil Nadu shocked Telangana 1-0. The result means Karnataka will book their final-round berth even with a draw against Telangana on Saturday. The hosts found the going tough for most of the 90 minutes as the Andhra players led by Students Union player Tharun Kumar defended with all their might. Last match’s hat-trick hero Sudheer Kotikela and Co. went close more than once but couldn’t breach the Andhra defence. In the end, it was Kamalesh P, scorer of Karnataka’s opener in the first match, who emerged as the saviour. Latching on to a fine pass from Solaimalai N, the youngster dodged past Andhra goalkeeper Vishnuprasad and slotted the winner seconds before the fourth official added seven minutes to the clock to make up for the numerous injury stoppages. Kotikela thought he had put Karnataka ahead with a fine header in the 17th minute but the linesman’s flag was up. Changing ends, frustration crept into the Karnataka bench as the clock ticked away and the AP players resorted to time-wasting tactics. Results: Karnataka 1 (Kamalesh 90) bt Andhra Pradesh 0; Telangana 0 lost to Tamil Nadu 1 (Vijay Nagappan 48).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-ride-on-late-winner-by-kamalesh/articleshow/87919982.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Only awards function, no cash for BU medallists||Bengaluru: The Bangalore University hockey team on Thursday expressed displeasure over red tape that has delayed cash awards due to them for medal-winning performances in 2019-20.In a grand ceremony organised on November 11, BU symbolically gave away cash awards worth over Rs 6 lakh to students who brought laurels to the university at the South Zone and all-India inter-varsity meets. It's been two weeks since students posed with university officials and giant cheques at the ceremony, but the cash has not been credited to their accounts, thanks to an administrative lag.Initially, BU’s physical education department prepared individual cheques to be handed over to students. But the finance department nixed it, saying all transactions had to be done online.On Thursday, the hockey team, which had won the silver at the Khelo India University Games last year and the third place in the South Zone inter-university hockey championship, said it was baffled by the lack of urgency.“The university announced a cash award of Rs 27,000 each to 18 members of the hockey team, amounting to Rs 4.8 lakh. We ought to have got it soon after the Khelo India event in March 2020. Due to the pandemic, BU told us they were not able to conduct the function. However, Bengaluru City University (BCU) hockey players got the money almost 11 months back,” the hockey team members said. “Many of us struggled during the two lockdowns and had no money for training and other things. The money would have been of great help had we received it on time. Now, even 15 days after a big function, we are still waiting for the money,” the players added.Late evening, BU vice-chancellor KR Venugopal instructed officials to complete the process by Friday. “The officials told me they would clear the pending work by Friday and students can expect the cash to be credited to their accounts within two days,” Venugopal told TOI.“This is the first time in BU history that such a thing has happened, all because of administrative issues. The students have been running from pillar to post trying to get what is due to them. This has been very disheartening for them,” a college physical education director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-awards-function-no-cash-for-bu-medallists/articleshow/87919986.cms||Harigovind

---||Vadodara||Rape-accused CA granted bail||Vadodara: Chartered accountant Ashok Jain, who is accused of raping a law student, was granted bail by a sessions court here on Thursday. The court of additional sessions judge P T Patel allowed conditional bail to Jain against a personal bond of Rs 15,000 along with a surety of the same amount. Jain had filed a regular bail application on October 26 pleading innocence in the case. During the hearing of the bail application, the law student had filed an application before the court of principal district judge M R Mengdey to transfer the case proceedings to another court. She had made startling allegations against the court hearing the bail proceedings and the district government pleader. However, she withdrew her application later and apologized to the court and paid a fine of Rs 1,000. While seeking bail, Jain’s lawyer argued on the grounds that the complaint was a conspiracy and motivated to harm his client’s reputation. “Our major argument was against the complainant’s claim that my client knew the co-accused Raju Bhatt and he had introduced her to Bhatt. It was disapproved as the investigation papers revealed that she knew Bhatt even before she met my client,” said Jain’s lawyer Hitesh Gupta. The court also considered Gupta’s arguments that Jain was ready for all scientific tests like narco test, lie detection test and brain mapping test, but the investigating agency did not conduct any such test. The court has asked Jain to mark his presence at the police station twice a week and not leave the limits of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) until the chargesheet is filed and not leave Gujarat until the case is disposed of.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-ca-granted-bail/articleshow/87918021.cms||---
---||Patna||Another BJP MLA seeks review of prohibition law||PATNA: Ahead of the mass pledge to be taken by the state government employees on Fridayagainst consuming liquor, the controversy surrounding the prohibition law took a curious turn on Thursday with the RJD asking the BJP to withdraw its support to the government on the matter and yet another BJP MLA demanding in-depth review of the prohibition law itself. Last week, CM Nitish Kumar had made an in-depth review of the implementation of the prohibition law and identify the lapses. Consequently, police launched a massive drive against illegal sale and consumption of liquor. However, some BJP MLAs appeared unconvinced and started voicing their concerns. “Those in the BJP, or in the NDA government, who are speaking against the prohibition law or its implementation should either themselves resign or withdraw support to the government. Merely issuing statements is meaningless,” RJD leader Alok Mehta said on Thursday. Talking to mediapersons on Thursday, BJP MLA from Begusarai Kundan Kumar had demanded review of the prohibition law, maintaining that new problems have arisen and society is being pushed to the brink of destruction. “An entire generation is being destroyed by this law. As I have heard and even read in newspapers, schoolchildren are being used as courier by the bootleggers to carry liquor bottles in their school bags and make home delivery,” Kundan said. “Other kinds of problems have also arisen. Those who are in the shady business of illegal liquor procurement and supply have also started fighting elections to the panchayati raj bodies. Criminality is spreading fast and youths are getting drawn into it. Even consumption of drugs has started in villages and towns,” he added. Earlier this week, BJP MLA Hari Bhushan Thakur Bachol had gone public saying that the prohibition law should be withdrawn as the Centre has also announced to withdraw the three controversial farm laws. However, JD(U) leader Gulam Rasool Balyavi countered the BJP legislators’ remarks and said, “It is shocking that those people who had taken a pledge and took part in human chain are making such statements on prohibition.” He, however, reiterated that prohibition would continue in Bihar. “Action is being taken against the violators,” he said.

---||Patna||CM intervenes as two vice-chancellors spar||PATNA: Even as L N Mithila University vice-chancellor Surendra Pratap Singh has contradicted the charges levelled against him by Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU) vice-chancellor Md Quddus in his letter written to the chancellor and the chief minister, the latter has once again challenged the contradiction of the former. Singh’s clarification came when CM Nitish Kumar wrote to the chancellor to inquire into the allegations levelled against him by Quddus. Singh, in his clarification, claimed that all the allegations made by Quddus were far from truth and aimed at tarnishing his image just at the time when he was to be given the best vice-chancellor’s award by the chancellor at Raj Bhavan. He said when Quddus’ appointment as the VC of MMHAPU was notified by Raj Bhavan on August 19 this year, he was out of station on leave. Hence, the question of delaying his joining by him is not true. Singh was then officiating as the VC of MMHAPU. However, Quddus started working as the VC even without assuming charge of office from him, Singh said, adding he had approved the tenders for purchase of answer sheets and hiring of security guards only on the recommendation of the university’s tender committee. He welcomed any inquiry into the charges levelled by Quddus and said he would provide full cooperation to the inquiry committee, if any. On the other hand, MMHAPU vice-chancellor Quddus asserted on Thursday that the he was not outside the station on the date of notification of VC by Raj Bhavan on August 19 as the files of MMHAPU bear Singh’s signature of this date. Furthermore, two different orders on hiring of 45 and 80 security guards in the university respectively had been issued by the university on the same date, Quddus added.

While Kajal studies at Gaya College, Sunny is a Class XI student of DAV Public School (Cantonment area). Rajdev Ram, the district education officer, told this reporter on Thursday that the Niti Aayog had organised a competition among the Class X toppers of different schools on October 26. “Kajal won the competition and Sunny stood second. Now, they will be sent to Dubai in March, 2022 to attend the World Expo,” Rajdev said. The theme of the expo, which began on October 1 and will end on March 31, is ‘Connecting Minds and Creating the Future’. It is the first time in world expo history that the participants have their own pavilions. Congratulating Kajal and Sunny, Gaya district magistrate, Abhishek Singh, said, “Other students should also work hard and participate in such competitions.” Anjali, the principal of DAV Public School, praised Sunny, calling him “a very intelligent student”. “He had secured 99% marks in Class X and has a lot of potential. His name was registered for the district-level competition on October 26 where he proved his mettle again,” she added.

---||Patna||Challenges galore for new PPU VC||PATNA: The new vice-chancellor (VC) of Patliputra University (PPU), R K Singh, is likely to face tough challenges in streamlining academic and administrative works of the university. PPU has of late fallen short of expectations of both academics and students even after three years of its creation. The university had come into existence after bifurcation from the Magadh University (MU) on March 18, 2018. Welcoming the new VC, Patliputra University Teachers’ Association (PPUTA) president A K Singh Thakur said his foremost priority should be to acquire land measuring about 8.05 acres near Mithapur bus stand to build the required infrastructure of the university. The university has been functioning from hardly 4,000 square feet area at the old branch office of the MU at Kankarbagh in Patna. PPUTA general secretary Hridaya Narayan Singh said the university has not got the required number of staff from the MU despite an MoU which was signed between university officials and state government at the time of its bifurcation. M D College-Naubatpur principal Kanhaiya Prasad Sinha said faculty crunch, especially in rural colleges, will be a challenge for the new VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/challenges-galore-for-new-ppu-vc/articleshow/87918163.cms||---
---||Patna||SDG urban index: Patna 52nd among 56 ULBs||PATNA: Patna was ranked the worst five performing cities in the NITI Aayog’s first ‘Sustainable Development Goals Urban India Index and Dashboard 2020-21’, which was released on Tuesday. The city has secured 52nd rank out of 56 cities in the index with the overall score of 57.29. As per the SDG dashboard, Patna has been placed in ‘performer’ category. The cities have been placed in any of the four categories – aspirant (0-49), performer (50-64), front-runner (65-99) and achiever (100). As many as 56 urban local bodies have been assessed on 77 SDG indicators related to economic growth, industry, infrastructure, health, education, urban development, environmental issues, civic issues and governance. The index has been prepared by NITI Aayog-GIZ and BMZ under the umbrella of Indo-German Development Cooperation. Patna has performed poorly in ‘decent work and economic growth’ category with the score of 17 out of 100. Only Bengaluru has secured maximum 79 points in this category. Patna has got lowest scores in industry, innovation and infrastructure (30), affordable and clean energy (36), zero hunger (39), no poverty (45) and sustainable cities and communities (48). Deputy CM Renu Devi, however, said the state has moved ahead in the path of growth, but still has miles to go. “The state faces floods and drought almost every year. The state government is working on this. As far as economic growth is concerned, several small and medium industries have been set up in the state, which will increase the infrastructure and employment generation. More industries will come soon, which will solve poverty and employment issues,” she said. Industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said the State Investment Promotion Board (SIBP) has received several big proposals for ethanol, textiles and food processing units, but it may take time to set up these industries. “If we talk about Patna, it is not possible to set up industries in the urban area. We will get land only on the outskirts of the state capital. Under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, the state government is trying to improve infrastructure and the existing industrial units in Patliputra Industrial Area, Fatuha and Bihta are examples. We need to analyse where we are lagging behind other states in terms of infrastructure and industries,” the minister said. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, said, “There is a need to work on urban planning in the state. The proportion of the urban population is very low in the state and Patna is the only big city of Bihar. While it remains a challenging task to improve the urban amenities in Patna to make it a sustainable city in the coming years, there is also an urgent need to work on developing other urban centres with better amenities,” he said. “We need to realise that urbanization and economic development are interlinked. There is a need to work on developing more urban centres with better amenities,” he added. Patna, however, has secured perfect 100 score in ensuring sustainable consumption and production pattern and maximum score in clean water and sanitation with 82, quality education (79), gender equality (78), and peace, justice and strong institutions (66). In the other categories, Patna has got 62 in climate action, 60 in each reduced inequalities and good health and well-being. Academic N K Choudhary said it was a good sign that the city has done well in education and health categories. Former PMC commissioner Anupam Suman tweeted, “Patna ranked 52nd out of 56 cities in the SDG Urban Index released by NITI Aayog. The report states that there is no economic growth, no infrastructure, no quality education-health and no jobs in the state capital. Cities are growth engines of development, which is beyond the intellectual capacity of Lalu-Nitish (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sdg-urban-index-patna-52nd-among-56-ulbs/articleshow/87918219.cms||Faryal Rumi

The cards are issued in partnership with IDEMIA (a global cards manufacturer) and will help gradually eliminate single-use PVC plastic. This initiative has initially been rolled out for HSBC Cashback Credit Card and will be gradually extended to all card variants. This roll-out is part of a new programme launched by HSBC Group to introduce sustainable cards across all its global locations. Made from 85% recycled plastic, the new rPVC cards will help save 3.18gm of plastic waste per card in addition to helping lower overall carbon emission. According to Raghujit Narula, head-wealth and personal banking at HSBC India the foreign bank has committed to achieving net-zero in its operations by 2030. “We will look at further integration of sustainability-led aspects across our business processes. This move towards recycled plastic credit cards is just one amongst many initiatives that we are driving,” said Narula. Sustainable payment cards are part of IDEMIA’s GREENPAY portfolio. The company has helped banks in other parts of the world issue green cards. “This is a positive affirmation of our commitment to rethinking how to design, use, and reuse plastic in the payments industry while offering our customers cutting-edge solutions,” said Amit Kakatikar, SVP, Financial Institutions – India, IDEMIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hsbc-to-issue-cards-with-recycled-plastic-as-part-of-net-zero-plan/articleshow/87918908.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Saran police recovered the body of goldsmith Arun Kumar Sah (45) on Wednesday midnight from the bank of a river near Jogini Parsa village under the Bheldi police station area in the district. Arun was a resident of Zafarpur-Gavendri village under the same police station. According to Arun’s family members, he was stabbed to death by the criminals. Arun had gone to attend a marriage ceremony in Jogini Parsa village on a bike and the incident occurred when he was returning from the function. Saran SP Santosh Kumar said the police have detained some youths on suspicion. “We will interrogate the family members of the victim soon. Arun used to lend money and the murder was probably the fallout of a financial dispute,” he added. In Bhojpur district, one Vikash Kumar Thakur (19), a resident of Gaura village under Bahoranpur police outpost, was murdered near Rajpur Mor in the wee hours of Thursday. His cousin Mukesh Kumar Thakur said, “We received a call from Vikash’s cellphone around 3am. The anonymous person said Vikash has been shot at near Rajpur Mor. We rushed to the spot and found the body of Vikash,” he added. SHO of Bahoranpur OP Satyendra Kumar Satyarthi said the boy was probably murdered over a love affair. In another incident, a 45-year-old woman, Chandrawati Devi, wife of railway employee Krishna Prasad alias Vakil Ram Prasad, was shot at on Thursday morning at Bajen village under the Charpokhari police station area in Bhojpur district.

---||Ahmedabad||Only Patel sarpanch in G’nagar village for decades; HC seeks govt reply||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state election commission and Gandhinagar district collector, in response to a petition complaining that one Palaiya village has never had a sarpanch of its gram panchayat from scheduled castes (SC) or other backward classes (OBC) since 1958, and the post has always been held by Patels, who fall in the general category. A resident of Palaiya village in Dehgam taluka of Gandhinagar, Jitendrasinh Chauhan, filed the petition and his advocate Dharmesh Gurjar submitted that the election authorities have never implemented reservation rules for the post of village sarpanch. The roster for the post of sarpanch was not implemented and the opportunity to hold the post was denied members of SCs and OBCs. It was argued that the village population is 45% OBC and 10% SC. Ever since the Panchayat Act has been in force, the provision for reservation has not been applied for the election of the sarpanch. The post has always been held by a member of the dominant Patel community, who make up 15% of the population. Since there is a provision for a quota for women, one Babuben Patel was elected to the post in 2017. The roster system as envisaged in the law has never been implemented to elect a member of SCs or OBCs, the lawyer submitted. The petitioner urged the court to take strict action against the authorities for mala fide action and for neglecting the law for decades. He also sought a stay on the coming panchayat elections until the roster rules are implemented. He also urged the HC to direct election authorities to declare the Palaiya gram panchayat seat for an OBC or SC candidate for the next election. After a preliminary hearing, the bench of Justice R M Chhaya and Justice Mauna Bhatt sought a reply from the authorities by December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-patel-sarpanch-in-gnagar-village-for-decades-hc-seeks-govt-reply/articleshow/87918334.cms||---

Kumar gave the direction to the sugar mills at a high-level review meeting held here on the twin theme of cane price fixation and finding solution to the problem of waterlogging in the core sugar cane-producing districts like Samastipur, Gopalganj, East Champaran and West Champaran. The participants in the meeting also included minor irrigation department principal secretary Ravi Parmar, cane industry department secretary N Sarwan Kumar and Sugar Mills Association president C V Patodia, among others. On the cane price fixation, Patodia said the sugar mills were desirous of increasing the prices of cane required for the 2021-22 cane crushing season, but the government should also come forward to provide assistance to the sugar mills concerned, as the prices of sugar had fallen in the market. Patodia said that prices of sugar have fallen in the range of Rs 200-250 per quintal, which has put the sugar mills in a distress situation, and, therefore, the government should come forward to provide assistance. With regard to finding the solution to the problem of waterlogging in the core cane-producing districts, it was decided to prepare project reports on the drainage system. The DPRs should be prepared by the DMs concerned, and duly sent to the cane department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fix-prices-of-cane-early-says-minister/articleshow/87918230.cms||Abhay Singh

In FY21, Yes Bank recorded a market share of around 40% by volume in the UPI ecosystem and around 30% by volume in the UPI merchant acquiring business thanks to the integration with PhonePe. The integration with Amazon Pay will enable the US e-commerce giant, which is a late entrant into the payment space, to issue UPI IDs with the @yapl handle. The tie-up will further expand Yes Bank’s presence in UPI with its payment processing platform hosted on AWS. Based on a multi-bank model, this collaboration allows Yes Bank to acquire merchants through the Amazon Pay platform, adding to its existing merchant network. The private lender said it has developed a cloud-native UPI processing platform to optimally handle the high traffic of transactions observed during surge periods like festivals or annual sales. “With this collaboration, we will be able to offer our customers more control, flexibility and choice for a vast range of purchases and peer-to-peer transactions — through UPI-based payments,” said Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, Yes Bank. According to Mahendra Nerurkar, CEO and VP, Amazon Pay, the company plans to expand its digital payment network by making it more rewarding for customers. “UPI is one of the most convenient and popular ways to pay in India. With a cloud-native architecture we hope to keep raising the bar on availability, speed and customer experience using UPI through the Amazon app,” said Nerurkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-partners-amazon-pay-for-upi-chooses-aws-for-payment-processing/articleshow/87918937.cms||Mayur Shetty

However, despite all preparations, the then-Congress government at the Centre did not cooperate,” she said, adding that 10 years had passed since first SP and then BJP were in power in the state but it was now, close to the elections, that the foundation stone for the project was being laid. “These development works should have been completed by now. The fact that it is happening so close to the elections raises questions over this government’s policies and intent,” she said. Mayawati has earlier accused both SP and BJP of high-jacking projects initiated by her government to claim them as theirs: such as Noida airport and the Ganga Expressway. The former UP chief minister also spoke about the need to suitably compensate farmers whose land had been taken up for the airport project. “Even the court has expressed its displeasure over land acquisition without giving adequate compensation and providing rehabilitation. Irrespective of whose government is in power, BSP has always supported the fight against poverty, unemployment and migration,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/project-delayed-due-to-then-cong-govt-says-maya/articleshow/87919430.cms||---

The court noted that in the case, the final report was signed on June 14, 2017, and was forwarded by the ACP, but it was filed before it on September 4, 2019. It further noted that it was mentioned in the report that a supplementary chargesheet will be filed upon receiving the FSL result. Additional Sessions Judge Sunil Chaudhary said that no FSL report was available in the judicial file filed by the police so far in the matter. The court said that the case disposal within the ‘five plus zero’ policy period was not possible on account of such delay by the police and where the report was incomplete. ‘Five plus zero’ is an initiative of states to ensure that cases pending for more than five years are taken up on a priority basis and such cases are brought down to zero. “It is the expectation of the authorities to complete the trial of the criminal matter expeditiously and ‘five plus zero’ is the policy adopted by the state in respect of the court matters,” the court said in an order on November 24. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-speedy-disposal-of-cases-city-court-tells-police/articleshow/87918974.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Govt plans law for lenders to pursue defaulters abroad||MUMBAI: The government has proposed changes to the bankruptcy legislation by adopting a global model law that will enable lenders to apply the insolvency law to defaulters’ assets lying overseas. These will include the offshore personal assets of the promoter if they have issued a personal guarantee. The changes would also allow execution of orders against defaulters by overseas courts that have adopted the model law. The government has invited public comments on the proposed modifications by December 15. The comments can be sent only through a web link provided on the website of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). The model law is provided by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) — a subsidiary body of the UN. The model law lays down the basic framework for cooperation between domestic and foreign courts, and domestic and foreign insolvency professionals. It also provides a framework for the commencement of domestic insolvency proceedings when a foreign insolvency proceeding has already commenced, or vice versa. Among the bills proposed for the winter session of Parliament is an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “The proposed regulations will help align our bankruptcy process with major countries like the US and the UK who have implemented a model UNCITRAL cross-border insolvency law. With the increased globalisation of business, synchronised judicial cooperation and synergy are required to obtain optimal resolution outcome,” UV ARC director Hari Hara Mishra said. He added that this will also add to the ease of doing business in India and attracting foreign investors. The adjudicating authority for pursuing personal guarantees can be the debt recovery tribunal or the National Company Law Tribunal and their appellate authority. The pre-packaged insolvency resolution process that was recently enacted for small businesses would not be subject to the cross-border norms. The changes were proposed after the Insolvency Law Committee (ILC), constituted under the corporate affairs ministry to review the implementation of the IBC, noted the lack of a framework for cross-border insolvency. The government has decided to put in place a comprehensive framework for this purpose based on UNCITRAL model law on cross-border insolvency, which could be made a part of the IBC by inserting a separate chapter for this purpose. In January 2020, the government had constituted a cross-border insolvency rules/regulations committee to recommend subordinate legislation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-plans-law-for-lenders-to-pursue-defaulters-abroad/articleshow/87918791.cms||Mayur Shetty

The transaction has addressed Rs 1,275 crore of the IL&FS group debt and resulted in its exit from technology business. The sale will reduce the number of companies in the group by five as TTL operates through four subsidiaries. These are Land Registration Systems Incorporation (LARES), IL&FS Technologies Philippines (ITP), LIVIA India, and Bhopal e-Governance. LARES is implementing a ‘land titling and computerisation project’ for the Philippine government, while ITP provides managed services, system integration and geospatial services. LIVIA, which was providing tech support to IL&FS group companies, is currently under liquidation, and Bhopal e-Governance provides land revenue management solutions for the Madhya Pradesh government. The sale of TTL has been completed in accordance with the resolution framework, under supervision of Justice (retd) D K Jain and with an approval from the Mumbai bench of the NCLT. It will result in over 200 employees from these companies shifting to the new promoter Falcon SG, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Falcon Investments Pte Ltd, a part of Gateway Partners and Avenue Capital Group. Earlier this month, IL&FS has said that it has addressed Rs 52,200 crore of the group’s outstanding debt of Rs 99,000 crore and would achieve an aggregate resolution of Rs 61,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-sells-tech-arm-to-falcon-cuts-rs-1275cr-debt/articleshow/87918900.cms||---

The index finally closed 454 points up at 58,795. The RIL stock surged after the company announced late on Wednesday that it would hive off its gasifier business to a wholly owned arm. The sensex opened flat and dipped over 200 points but rallied through the session to an intra-day high at 58,902 and settled a bit lower from the peak. The surge in the RIL stock on Thursday also added a little over Rs 70,200 crore to its market capitalisation with the current market value at about Rs 16.6 lakh crore. This also includes the last traded value of all its partly paid shares, currently suspended from trading. Of the 454 points gained by the sensex, 418 points was contributed by RIL alone, BSE data showed. Other stocks that contributed majorly to the index’s gain for the day were Infosys, Kotak Bank and ITC. On the other hand, selling in ICICI Bank, HUL and HDFC restricted the rise in the index. The day’s gains came despite strong selling by foreign funds, end-of-the-session data on the BSE showed. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 2,301 crore. This was the fourth consecutive session of net selling by FPIs with the total for the current week at over Rs 17,100 crore, or about $2.3 billion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sharp-ril-rally-helps-sensex-gain-454-pts/articleshow/87918880.cms||---

The latest investment by Tiger Global values the company at over $3 billion. Tiger Global owns over 30% of the brokerage, where Kalaari Capital and GVK Davix Technologies are other investors. Tata Sons chaiman emeritus Ratan Tata too is a minority shareholder. The latest round of funding, which is still ongoing, is expected to cross $100 million.

His $13-billion JSW Group is the latest to announce restructuring moves after Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RIL). The pattern in India, dominated by conglomerates, mirrors the restructuring initiatives of global powerhouses like General Electric, Toshiba and Johnson & Johnson. Jindal’s new renewable power company will inherit all the assets and liabilities of the business and will unlock value for shareholders in the future. Vedanta plans to split into three companies, while RIL seeks to spin off its gasifier business into a separate entity. “It looks like everyone wants to emulate Adani Group stocks and also ride on the IPO craze,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. “Many of these promoters will come with OFS (offer for sale) at high valuations,” he added. Jindal targets to have a power generation capacity of 20 gigawatts by the end of this decade. Of this, he wants the share of green energy to be 85%, up from the current 30%. The new renewable power company, JSW Energy Neo, will house existing as well as upcoming units in solar, wind and hydrogen. Ahmedabad-based Adani Group had undertaken a restructuring exercise in 2015 to split ports, power, transmission, alternate energy and incubation initiatives into separate entities. Over the last six years, Adani created billions in value, said HDFC Securities research head (retail) Deepak Jasani. The latest restructuring moves by Indian conglomerates follows their recovery from a slump triggered by the pandemic. Separating the business from the main company will sharpen focus and can tailor capital according to requirements. It seems that investors no longer like diversified structures. Earlier, the thinking was that if one business is in a downcycle, then the other would make up for the contraction. There would be some amount of cross-subsidisation. Investors are now of the view that the value of the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Therefore, businesses need to be segregated, Institutional Investor Advisory Services founder Amit Tandon told a business news channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jsw-follows-vedanta-rilwill-rejig-group-structure/articleshow/87918895.cms||Reeba Zachariah

China, which was earlier in the third spot, has become the largest exporter of medical devices to India, overtaking US and Germany during 2020-21, despite the much-touted ‘Make in India’ policy and clamour against Chinese imports after the border skirmish. Most of the increase is attributed to imports of critical items like oximeters, diagnostic instruments, digital thermometers and chemical reagents, which were needed during the pandemic as a quick scale-up wasn’t possible, industry experts said. What makes this starker is that the overall increase in medtech imports from all nations is just about 7%. “Covid had a silver lining, for bringing into focus the medical devices industry for healthcare security of the nation, even as international supply chains initially got disrupted. The government needed to continue to protect investments in this field, rather than giving mixed signals by reducing duty on Covid-critical devices to zero temporarily, which subsequently led to a huge influx of imports, especially from China from May 2020. We are not against imports. But if these harm the domestic industry, then corrective policies by incentivising homegrown players need to be taken. The huge 75% increased influx of Chinese imports even after having a stated public procurement order that is supposedly in favour of domestic manufacturers should be of concern to policymakers seeking to make India ‘Atma Nirbhar,” said Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD) forum coordinator Rajiv Nath. Of the 151 eight-digit HS codes that cover med devices, there are 58 items where imports have jumped from more than 25% to over 42,000%, industry data shows. Typically, imports from China had risen 5-15% year-on-year in the last few years. More than 80% of medical devices are imported into India, with this year’s import bill at nearly Rs 45,000 crore. “Imports of medtech devices from China increased sharply during Covid. But except for PPE kits, masks & sanitisers, etc, there was no way to manage critical shortages. Medtech can’t be ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in a few months. We need to build technology, quality, supply chain and it will take a decade to establish it, if there is undisturbed attention and right policy,” said Vishwaprasad Alva, MD of critical care and ICU equipment manufacturer Skanray Technologies. Significantly, the nil customs duty did not benefit consumers and, with no maximum retail price (MRP) printed on devices, there was massive profiteering due to the huge mark-ups. Besides masks & PPE kits, certain devices like ventilators witnessed robust growth due to the sudden and huge demand, with companies also becoming largely self-reliant. Industry observers pointed out that domestic players also need to develop expertise in neonatal & child care, OT & surgical, ICU, radiology & scanning, and cardiac care, with support from the private sector and government. Max Ventilators founder & CEO Ashok Patel said, “Private sector procurement largely has not been supporting the ‘Make in India’ programme, with China continuing to be a major supplier. The Centre’s bulk purchases have been mainly restricted to respiratory care and oxygen delivery equipment due to the pandemic. Hence, there hasn’t been much impetus for players to build capacity/capability in other segments.” “During the pandemic, our local vendors — in a bid to reduce import dependence — developed several key components, as supply from the US and Europe was disrupted. But for imports of circuit boards, we were forced to shift to China this year from the US as distributors promised assured delivery,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chinese-med-imports-up-75-raises-concerns/articleshow/87918867.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

It has, however, risen a bit in the northern parts of the state,” C K Singh, an official at the Met centre, said. The minimum temperature was in the range of 14 to 16 degrees C in northern parts of the state and 10 to 12 degrees C in south Bihar on Thursday. A slight plunge was also observed in the maximum temperature as it was recorded in the range of 25 to 27 degrees C during the day. “While south-easterly winds are blowing in north Bihar, westerly winds are blowing in the southern parts of the state. As a result, skies will remain clear across the state and there will not be much difference in the minimum or night temperature readings. However, a marginal drop may be witnessed in the maximum or day temperature readings,” Singh said. Besides, fog was observed in Bhagalpur and Purnia where the visibility dropped to 300-400 metres on Thursday morning. The India Meteorological Department stated that shallow fog was observed at isolated pockets in east Bihar. Singh said, “Moderate intensity fog is likely to be observed at a few places in the state in the mornings. The remaining places are also likely to witness shallow fog.” ‘Avoid morning walks’: Health experts have suggested Patnaites to avoid early morning walks in order to keep winter illnesses at bay amid a dip in mercury. Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, a physician, has advised people with cardiac and blood pressure problems not to go on morning walks. “People should start wearing woollen clothes now,” he said. The minimum temperature in Patna was recorded at 10.8 degrees C on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-temperature-likely-to-hover-around-10c-in-south-bihar-till-weekend/articleshow/87917158.cms||---

This happened after the state government assured that the one-acre area of ashram is not going to be touched and development would take place in the surrounding land. After hearing the grievance of the petitioner and recording the assurance given by the state government, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri said that the petition was not required to be entertained and was disposed of with the state government’s assurance, “the petitioner’s grievances stand allayed”. The high court said that if there is any grievance to any individual for the eviction activity by the government, the person may file civil suit but this cannot be a subject matter of public interest litigation. Tushar Gandhi approached the HC expressing grievance that the redevelopment project would transgress the existing working of Gandhi Ashram, which is managed by the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust. He mentioned in his petition that the project would cause imbalance and the aesthetic value and Gandhian principles enunciated by the father of the nation would be eclipsed. He also likened the project with an amusement park and requested the court to interfere and make provisions for participation of Gandhians in the decision-making process. In response, advocate-general Kamal Trivedi submitted that such reservations were made against the projects of Statue of Unity, Kankaria Lakefront and the Sabarmati Riverfront. Indulgence by court brought everything to a grinding halt. He made a statement that the core area of the ashram, which is on a one-acre plot, would not be disturbed and it would be maintained as it is and all efforts would be made for improvement of the ashram as decided by the governing council. The project is for development of 55-acre surrounding the ashram. The court said that the government order of March 5 for redevelopment indicates that the mammoth project is to preserve the history of Gandhiji and freedom struggle, and to promote the great philosophy, values and teachings of Gandhiji. The court also said that the governing council has been constituted as representative of the trusts that manage the ashram and any apprehension in this regard can be expressed by them before the council. “The apprehension that the decision will be taken in a unilateral manner detrimental to the ashram stands allayed. In fact, we notice that the role and responsibilities of the governing council has been fixed in the order itself,” the court observed while disposing of the PIL. The petitioner also raised the issue of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s eviction drive in the slums in the vicinity of Ashram, but the high court maintained that this was not a subject matter of the petition and the affected persons can file suit before appropriate court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-hc-rejects-pil-by-gandhis-kinon-ashram-revamp/articleshow/87918469.cms||---

Many of them claim that it takes almost 50 to 55 minutes to reach the security hold area (SHA). A passenger, Mukul Singh, who was travelling to Bengaluru from Patna airport, told this reporter on Thursday that there was no one to manage the crowd as a result of which he reached the SHA in 40 minutes. “The people, who had formed a queue outside the terminal building, were moving at a snail’s pace. Only two security personnel were present there,” he said. Another flyer, Surendra Kumar, reached the SHA only five minutes before boarding his flight to Delhi. He claimed, “I had come to the airport almost 1.30 hours before the flight’s departure time.” Archana Vats, who had to fly to Mumbai, heaved a sigh of relief when her flight was delayed by 35 minutes. She said, “The moment I saw a huge crowd at the airport I became anxious. My flight was, however, delayed.” A few agitated passengers vent their frustration on social media. Tausif Nissar tweeted, “Please do something, save common man from daily congestion at airport’s departure gate (sic).” The employees of different airlines attributed the chaotic situation at the airport to the lack of manpower and the small size of the terminal building. “There is adequate space and enough manpower at bigger airports,” they said. Asked about the rush, an official of the Central Industrial Security Force replied that the passenger traffic had increased considerably after Chhath Puja as people were returning to their offices in other cities. “Other reasons for the rush are the wedding season and the resumption of international flights. The domestic flights are operating at full capacity,” he added. Some passengers reportedly missed their flights amid the commotion and blamed the airport authorities for poor crowd management. The security officials, however, pointed out, “Many passengers reach the airport only an hour before their flight’s departure time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/long-queues-chaos-at-airport-annoy-flyers/articleshow/87917257.cms||Faryal Rumi

The zoo authorities have started implementing systemic changes for over 2,000 inhabitants and dietary plan to keep them healthy. Heaters, blowers, woollen blankets and quilts have been placed in the enclosures of tiger, lion, leopard, jungle cat and other big cat families, bear, monkey lion-tailed macaque and snake to keep them warm. Patna zoo range officer Anand Kumar told this newspaper that high-voltage bulbs and pots are placed in the snake house and the aquariums are equipped with thermodynamic system to control the water temperature. “Apart from this, we give carnivorous animals extra five kilos of meat daily to maintain their body heat and some inmates are being provided with seasonal fruits, vegetables and other supplements to help them strengthen their immunity,” Kumar said, adding, while monkeys and chimpanzees get ‘chyawanprash’ as a supplement, elephants are being fed with sugar cane and jaggery. Honey, groundnuts and boiled eggs have been added in the menu of bears and birds get super worms and seasonal fruits in their meal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/zoo-installs-46-heaters-to-keep-inmates-warm/articleshow/87917302.cms||Faryal Rumi

Sharing the photos of the events, the Union ministry of parliamentary affairs described it as a “historical day” for NeVA. The Centre’s ambitious NeVA project is part of Digital India programme aimed at making the functioning of Parliament as well as the state legislatures paperless. Bihar Vidhan Parishad is the first House in the country to move in this direction. Though CM Nitish Kumar was scheduled to inaugurate the functioning of this application, his programme was cancelled due to the death of VIP MLA Musafir Paswan. Expressing his happiness after the inauguration of the functioning of this application, Singh said, “It is a proud moment for us as we are the first House in the country to go digital under the leadership of the CM. Now the members of the Vidhan Parishad will use the technology in the House.” For the use of this application in a better way, computer tablets have also been installed before the seats of all the members. Singh said the proceeding of the House would be done using this digital technology from the upcoming winter session. However, paperwork will also be there. “Training of the members as well as the officials is going on. At present both the NeVA as well as papers will be used for the proceedings in the winter session. But from the next Budget session, we will be totally paperless,” he said, adding, “The proceedings will be uploaded to this application and made available for common people.” Deputy chief minister Renu Devi described it as a proud moment for the entire country and said the other Houses would now follow Bihar. While giving a vote of thanks on the occasion, state health minister Mangal Pandey said the initiative has added to the good image of the state. Water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain and PHED minister Rampreet Paswan too appreciated the step taken by the Bihar Vidhan Parishad. MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav urged the acting chairperson to also change the sitting arrangement of the members. MLCs Ram Bachhan Roy, Rambali Singh, Prem Chandra Mishra, Kedar Nath Pandey and Rozina Nazish extended their gratitude to the acting chairperson. Several other MLCs, including Kumud Verma, Nivedita Singh, Sanjay Paswan, Sanjay Singh, Sanjay Kumar Singh, Rajendra Prasad Gupta and Madan Mohan Jha as well as Vidhan Parishad’s secretary Vinod Kumar and other officials were also present at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-legislative-council-now-first-house-in-country-to-go-paperless/articleshow/87918126.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The PWD told the court that the work was awarded on nomination basis as it had to be undertaken on an “urgent basis”. It added that since it is a prominent cultural centre, the work was given to a “specialised agency with experience and expertise in this field”. In “exceptional cases, when there is an urgency, the process of floating a tender can be dispensed with”, the PWD said while responding to a public interest litigation. The work was awarded to Techton Buildcons Pvt Ltd on May 3, 2021, at a cost of Rs 39.6 crore plus taxes. The PWD on May 10 asked the agency to appoint any of the 21 IITs as third-party consultant with all arrangements and expenses to be borne solely by the agency. IIT, Bombay, was appointed and it nominated R S Jangid of its civil engineering department as the IIT-B consultant. The agency then appointed Space Design and Development as the structural repair consultant. In addition to these experts, the Goa government has an agreement with M/s Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES), a government of India undertaking, for quality checks for various roads, bridges, buildings, water supply works, etc, in Goa where the cost of the projects is above Rs 50 lakh. The agency is a Class I-A contractor under the buildings sectors with the PWD and had satisfactorily completed similar works of structural repairs of Goa Bhavan building in Mumbai where the work of retrofitting of the ground floor and finishing, plumbing, electrical and furniture work at Goa Bhavan was awarded to the said agency, chief engineer-II PWD Shashikant Kamat submitted to the high court. He added that it is an empanelled agency with different bodies such as Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and Central Bank of India for repair/restoration works and undertook similar works of old buildings all over the country for agencies such as MHADA, BSNL, LIC, NBCC Ltd, Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd, Army Public School and undertook upgradation and renovation work of the Parliament House annexe building, New Delhi. The PIL was filed by Durgadas Kamat, who is seeking quashing and setting aside of the work order, while demanding that the government undertake a tender process for the work. Kamat had said that there were other contactors who could have taken up the work if it was tendered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-tells-hc-in-urgent-cases-like-ka-tender-can-be-dispensed-with/articleshow/87918918.cms||---

Internet glitches during a lecture, students switching cameras off, people entering the classroom to disrupt classes and children in class asking questions mid-lesson or showing their work — several such issues are proving to be too taxing for teachers. They said that after having tackled the huge challenge of mastering online teaching over the past 20 months, hybrid teaching is a fresh challenge. Classes have become slower and seamless dissemination of lectures to both sets of students is not happening. While classes X and XII are in the board-exam mode and do not need to be taught now, the focus is on classes IX and XI, which are being prepared to enter their board years and are tackling topics that are complicated and need a lot of in-depth teaching. “You cannot stay aloof, lecture and go away. You need to ensure that every child has understood. Is it possible to do that while you are trying to monitor them online and also ensuring that those in front of you are not neglected? Also, every now and then, we are getting disconnected because of internet issues,” said a senior teacher of physics at a central Kolkata school that has tried to augment its Wi-Fi connectivity, but this has not helped. Some schools have tried to bring in technical support so the teacher doesn’t have to bother about being within the range of the webcam. Sushila Birla Girls’ School and Shri Shikshayatan School are using tripods for the main camera of the teacher while microphones and other cameras are capturing the lecture and the white/black/green boards. “This is the technical help that we could give. But a teacher will always fret about whether she is able to give equal attention to both sets of students. That is a human skill and will need fine tuning,” said Sangeeta Tandon, principal of Shri Shikshayatan School. “Keeping a check on whether the lecture dissemination is happening in a hybrid mode can be challenging to start with, but since teachers know it is part of their job in the changed circumstances, they’ll tackle it,” said Sushila Birla Girls’ School principal Koeli Dey. In some schools, like South City International School, DPS Ruby Park and DPS Newtown, training sessions have been arranged for teachers on how to successfully conduct hybrid classes and how to handle lectures while shifting attention from one group to another. “No group should be left feeling neglected. That is the challenge,” said South City International School principal John Bagul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-sweat-over-offline-online-cocktail-in-new-normal-classrooms/articleshow/87918191.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The incident took place at 12.30pm when he and his acquaintances had gone to supervise the construction of a fencing wall on a plot of land. The victim told police that the assailants arrived on the spot on their motorbikes and opened fire, causing injuries to his left arm. He was rushed to the Phulwarisharif primary health centre for treatment. He was later referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital for better treatment. He claimed that he could identify three of the assailants as Jai Gupta, Om Gupta and Abhishek who escaped after he raised an alarm and some local residents assembled there. Chandrawanshi had earlier unsuccessfully contested the assembly election from Kumhrar in Patna on the symbol of the RJD. However, he later joined the JD (U) posing his faith in chief minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership. The SHO of Phulwarisharif police station, Rafiuddin, said the victim’s statement had been recorded and further investigation was underway. “Raids were on to arrest the accused,” he told this reporter over the phone. The JD (U) leader’s close associate said Chandrawanshi had earlier lodged a written complaint about his land being encroached upon by some people in Mitramandal Colony. However, no action was taken. Chandrawanshi had left his Mithapur residence for Mitramandal Colony in his car. He told police that five bullets were fired by the accused, but one of them pierced through his left arm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/land-dispute-jdu-neta-shot-at-in-patna/articleshow/87918113.cms||Ramashankar

A bench of Justice P B Bajanthri, while imposing the cost, directed the respondent SP to deposit the amount with Bihar State Legal Services Authority of the high court. The bench was hearing a writ petition filed by one Mohammad Ahtesham Khan who was dismissed from the post of police constable after conducting departmental proceedings on grounds of seeking job by impersonation. The petitioner had moved the court in November 2016. He had contended that the inquiry report and second show-cause notice were not provided to him. He has also challenged his dismissal in the high court. On November 18, the high court had directed the SP to file an affidavit informing it whether the report of the inquiry conducted against the petitioner along with second show-cause notice were served to him or not. Though a reply was filed by the SP on Thursday, it didn’t have the information sought by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-imposes-rs25k-cost-on-begusarai-sp-for-ignoring-its-order/articleshow/87918106.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Lande, who had won accolades as the city SP of Patna, is currently posted as the DIG of the anti-terrorism squad of the Mumbai police crime branch. Lande’s five-year tenure of interstate deputation is likely to come to an end in December. “He is expected to report to the Bihar police headquarters by mid-December,” a senior police officer posted at the state police headquarters said, adding he may be posted as DIG in Munger or Bhagalpur range. Lande had started his career as a police officer from Munger where he was posted as the ASP of Jamalpur. His style of working was admired by the local people, who frequented his office to lodge their complaints. Both Munger and Bhagalpur are considered to be tough for policing. Before moving on deputation in his home state Maharashtra, Lande had served as the SP of Araria, Purnia and Rohtas. People recall his intensive raids against the stone quarrying mafia operating in Rohtas district. “He was considered a no-nonsense officer who did not succumb to any political pressure. That is why he was frequently transferred while serving as the SP in Bihar,” recalled an inspector who had served as an SHO in Rohtas when Lande was posted as the SP there. Meanwhile, altogether six police officers — Vishwajeet Dayal, Vijay Kumar, Keshav Yadav, Vidyasagar, Anant Kumar Rai and Rajesh Kumar — have been promoted to the post of IPS under the state quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lande-likely-to-return-to-bihar/articleshow/87918222.cms||Ramashankar

The police said the siblings had caught their father and the woman at a house on the night of November 10 and attacked them. Police said woman fell unconscious during the assault and died. The police said the siblings then took the injured woman to their family doctor and maintained that she died of a heart attack. However, the doctor noticed that the woman had injuries on her face and was bleeding. He told them to take the woman to another medical practitioner and get an autopsy done at the government hospital. Additional superintendent of police Milind Mohite told TOI, “Instead of taking the deceased woman to the government hospital and conducting an autopsy, the siblings took her body to a crematorium and conducted the last rites.” “Police approached the doctor, who confirmed the incident. Thus, we recorded the statement of the doctor, who is now the complainant in the case,” he said. “We arrested and produced them before a court in Baramati, which remanded in police custody till November 28,” he said.

Jobs from various global markets are being outsourced to skilled talent in India, and this is not restricted to IT alone. Recruitment firms say the trend is broad-based and is also playing out in non-IT fields such as digital marketing, content, design, accounting, administrative, project management, supply chain and even manufacturing. The twin advantages for outsourcing jobs to talent here is skills as well as proficiency in English language. Global recruitment firms are said to be at an advantage given that they can leverage the expertise in sourcing jobs from across the world. Sanjay Shetty, head (search & selection) at Randstad India said, “Randstad’s other operating companies have expressed interest in how India can deploy talent for their customers in those markets. We are also receiving direct inquiries from customers themselves on these lines. There are global manufacturers who have only liaison offices in India, but they are keen on hiring senior people and deploying them on Randstad’s rolls till they firm up their plans. Till then, these executives will be on our payrolls.” Shetty said organisations across countries like Portugal, Spain, Bulgaria, Belgium and Singapore, to name a few, who do not yet have operations in India, are hiring people on Randstad’s rolls. “We are deploying this talent till these companies sort out their books of account and begin operations. As a staffing company, we are using our hire-and-deploy model till companies set up their permanent offices in India. Earlier, we used to keep only junior level talent on our payrolls, but now we are doing so for senior executives as well,” said Shetty. TeamLease Services EVP & co-founder Rituparna Chakraborty said talent acquisition professional is one of the biggest profiles being sought from India for cross-border jobs. “The biggest demand is coming from the Middle East. We are also seeing enquiries from the UK and some from Europe,” said Chakraborty. While most markets earlier followed a decentralised system, the last 18-20 months of work-from-home has turned things around. “The pandemic has altered cost structures and companies are keen on investing in India. India also has the requisite skills, the availability of which may be an issue in some other countries. Language is another big plus for Indian talent. Such organisations do not want talent to migrate out of India, rather they are keen that they continue to work from here,” said Shetty. Sekhar Garisa, CEO of Monster.com, a Quess company, said, “Hiring has become location-agnostic at a global scale. A lot of organisations outside India are looking for talent that can stay and work out of India. Salary difference between what someone makes in an overseas market and India is narrowing because of the demand-supply gap.” The difference in salary between top talent working on specific jobs in India and abroad is 30-40%. “This gap has been reducing consistently for 10-15 years. The trend has accelerated over the last 5 years,” said Shetty. Given the current trend, Shetty believes cross-border hiring could grow to account for 10% of the pie for any professional recruitment firm over the next 2-3 years. “Currently, it contributes 2-3%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/global-hires-go-beyond-it-tap-more-desi-talent/articleshow/87918737.cms||Namrata Singh

In Lucknow currently, the two will be attending a programme organised on the occasion of Constitution Day on Friday by Samajwadi Party member Savitribai Phule, an event which is also expected to be attended by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. “Mayawati is anti-Constitution and has finished the party which Kanshiram ji had funded. She has turned the party into a family enterprise and can do nothing for the poor,” said Swarn Kaur, Kanshiram’s sister. Heading the Kanshiram Foundation, Kaur says the family has no affiliation with any political party. Her nephew Lakhbir Singh said that they visited the Kanshiram Memorial in Lucknow on Thursday and were upset to see Mayawati’s statue along with Kanshiram’s. “She has hijacked the party and made it a private limited firm. In UP elections, we will support anyone who can defeat BSP. We will also campaign against BSP in Punjab, where it is contesting elections in alliance with Akali Dal thoughe we do not expect BSP to win any seats,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kanshiram-kin-will-support-anyone-who-can-defeat-mayawati/articleshow/87919442.cms||---
---||Allahabad||When would courts in state be given security, HC asks Govt||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has asked the state government as to how long would it take to provide arrangements with regard to security, biometrics and CCTV cameras in all the courts of Uttar Pradesh. A division bench comprising Justice Suneet Kumar and Justice Samit Gopal was hearing a PIL titled ‘In Re Suo Moto Relating To Security And Protection In All Court Campuses In The State Of UP’. The PIL was initiated after the incident of firing in Bijnor district court in 2019. The court granted a week’s time to the state government counsel to apprise it as to when the biometrics in the Azamgarh and Lucknow Judgeship shall be executed and made functional. On the previous date, the court had asked the state government to file a reply to the actual sanctioned and deployed security personnel in each district court of the state. Subsequently, in its September 2021 order, the court had noted that the state government had made no progress with regard to gate automation, bio-metric system and gate passes for the lawyers/litigants in lower courts of the state, on account of pending financial sanction/approval since February 20, 2020. Later, by its order dated December 20, 2019, and January 2, 2020, the high court had passed a slew of directions to ensure adequate security in court premises. Now, in the present directives passed on November 23, the court has fixed December 2, 2021as the next date of hearing in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/when-would-courts-in-state-be-given-security-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/87918983.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi on brink of 'severe' AQI again as smog cover thickens||NEW DELHI: The layer of smog thickened over Delhi on Friday as the capital’s air quality deteriorated and reached the brink of ‘severe’ air quality. The 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 400 in ‘very poor’ category at 4 pm. However, it slipped into ‘severe’ category by 6 pm, shows data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Track the pollution level in your cityWhile an AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as ‘good’, readings between 51 and 100 fall in the ‘satisfactory’ category and those between 101 and 200 are classified as ‘moderate’. ‘Poor’ air ranges from 201 to 300, ‘very poor’ from 301 to 400 and ‘severe’ from 401 to 500. Poor visibility was observed during morning hours at both Safdarjung, which is the city’s base weather station, and Palam. “At Safdarjung, absence of the winds caused shallow to moderate fog/smog with visibility at 400-1000m range from early morning till 10am. Palam reported relatively higher visibility in the range of 1,000-1,200m till 10.30am,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. As the share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was only 6%, experts said local sources of pollution became prominent as meteorological factors like calm or light winds, low temperature, high moisture and low mixing layer height hampered the process of dispersal of pollutants. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said air quality was likely to remain in the higher-end of ‘very poor’ category for the next few days. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “As the share of stubble burning has become negligible now, local sources of pollution in Delhi and NCR are becoming prominent. To prevent further worsening of the situation, action against industries using non-cleaner fuels and polluting vehicles should be strictly enforced.” The contribution of Delhi’s transport to the city’s PM2.5 is likely to be 15% on Friday at 8.30 pm, according to the decision support system developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. The share of Delhi & peripheral industries is estimated to be 7%, while emissions from Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar are likely to contribute 9% each to Delhi's PM 2.5 during the same time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-on-brink-of-severe-aqi-again-as-smog-cover-thickens/articleshow/87919441.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Delhi||Delhi: 27-year-old arrested for sexually assaulting minor girl in Defence Colony||NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl in Defence Colony. The accused, Yash, is a resident of Paharganj. A senior police officer said the accused was a serial offender and involved in around eight similar offences. However, police have remained tight-lipped on the details. Yash, an electrician, has been booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, apart from IPC sections of rape, molestation and abduction. On November 23, the girl’s parents approached police and lodged a complaint. They told the cops that the girl was playing near her house when the accused lured her on the pretext of buying her toffees. He then assaulted her at an isolated spot in a park in the locality. After the girl was not found, her parents started a search and located her near the park. They then informed police. After lodging an FIR, a team was formed by the South district police to track down the accused with the help of CCTV footage, technical surveillance and human intelligence. The accused was spotted in a footage after which police circulated his picture to gather information about him. Soon, the team was informed about the suspect coming to the locality to fix an electricity issue after which his contractor was questioned. Yash was finally nabbed from Paharganj. On interrogation, the accused revealed he had earlier been booked for assaulting minors in Saket, Mandir Marg and Paharganj.  He claimed that he developed ill feelings after seeing lone children and assaulted them. His mobile phone was seized and over 70 pornographic clips were recovered from it.  The device has been sent for forensic examination. A chargesheet would be filed in a time-bound manner and the area DCP has been asked to monitor the investigation. This year, Delhi has witnessed a rise in the number of child abuse cases registered under POCSO Act compared with last year.  Till November 11, over 1,000 cases were registered in police stations across the city against 850 cases reported last year in the same period. However, over 990 cases have been solved and 1,100 accused arrested this year. Last year, 95% of cases were solved. Police sources attributed the increase in crimes against children to the post-Covid opening up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-rape-a-serial-offender/articleshow/87918984.cms||---

Senior inspector Dilip Shinde of the Dighi police said prima facie it appeared that the duo had committed suicide. “The woman and the man had come to the lodge on a scooter on Wednesday around 3pm and booked a room. Staffers of the lodge said when they knocked on the door on Thursday morning, there was no response from inside.” He said, “The staffers then forcibly opened the door and found the man hanging to a ceiling fan with a ‘sari’ and the woman lying dead on the bed. The staffers said both the bodies were devoid of any clothes. The bodies have been sent for post mortem.” An officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said preliminary probe revealed that the man had criminal antecedents. “He was on police records. The probe further revealed that the woman was in a relationship with him for the past two years. The woman’s husband is currently in prison,” the officer said. The Dighi police have registered a case of accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-partner-found-dead-in-lodge/articleshow/87918342.cms||---

Granting relief to Ramnagesh Akubathini, magistrate Komal Sing Rajput said from remarks posted and phraseology used in its natural course, it appeared it was made in context of other posts, and may not be directly addressed to the cricketer or his family. The court said as social media accounts are interconnected, it may have been read or received by them. “This aspect for limited purpose of bail cannot be ignored. There appears to be some substance in submission of advocate for the accused,” the magistrate said. Abhijeet Desai, advocate for the accused, submitted that the alleged post was in context of responses of people, it was singly picked up and an offence was registered. Desai argued that it was not directly connected with the cricketer or his family and cannot be read in isolation of other posts. The court said most offences were bailable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/techies-post-may-not-be-directly-linked-to-cricketer-kin-court/articleshow/87920003.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||DDA Rapped For Not Demarcating Land||New Delhi: A court on Thursday pulled up Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for not demarcating land of its horticulture department situated near the Yamuna despite police sending letters repeatedly. The authority must understand that “law respects those who respect law”, the court said. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Arvind Bansal said the court could not and should not wait for indefinite period for DDA to demarcate its land, allegedly trespassed by four accused. The observations came while discharging the accused persons in the alleged criminal trespassing case. It was registered by a DDA official alleging that in August 2014, the accused broke the wall constructed to keep the property of the department near the Yamuna safe and put a tin shed, thereby removing the identification of the boundary of the land. The official also alleged that the accused persons usurped the land despite a police call by the guard on duty. The court noted that the investigating officer sent repeated letters to the director of land management at DDA and the deputy director of the horticulture department for demarcating the land situated in Khizrabad village, but to no avail. “It apparently reflects DDA is hardly interested to pursue the criminal litigation initiated by its own officers. It must be borne in mind that ‘one cannot fall asleep after setting the criminal law into motion’, and if one does, he does it at his own risk,” the judge said. The court also pulled up police for forwarding the chargesheet without proper scrutiny. A perusal of documents placed on record and statements of witnesses recorded under CrPC 161 (examination by police) revealed that the case against the accused was “groundless”, it pointed out. There was no eyewitness and the record of the PCR call allegedly made by the guard was not collected by police, the judge added. “The PCR officials who allegedly visited the spot do not find any mention in the chargesheet… No effort was made by the investigating agency to record statement of any public witness from the vicinity either regarding the status of land or the allegations of trespass or the status of possession of accused etc.” The case called for strengthening the system of “checks and balances” practised by the investigating agencies, the court said, emphasising the need for mandatory “scrutiny” of chargesheets by the prosecution department or any other legal expert attached to the office of the ACP concerned. “It is astonishing that neither the then SHO nor the ACP pointed out any deficiency in the investigation... and simply forwarded the chargesheet. It must be understood that forwarding a chargesheet is not a mechanical process and the SHO and the ACP concerned can be held accountable for default in the process,” the court said. It also called for strengthening the role of the public prosecutors. “The objections raised or deficiencies pointed out by the prosecutor(s) in the investigation at pre-filing stage must be seriously considered by ACP and SHO” and the same must be properly addressed, it noted. The investigating agency must not shy away from filing cancellation/closure reports, if a probe does not support the case of a complainant, the judge said, asking the DCP (southeast) to issue necessary instructions and hold constructive discussions with the chief public prosecutor (south and southeast). Lay down a mechanism to minimise errors at each stage and strengthen the overall system, the court underlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-rapped-for-not-demarcating-land/articleshow/87918985.cms||Usha Das
---||Lucknow||Bat fast as victory is certain, says PM Modi to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Referring to the two viral pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi walking along with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, with the former placing his hand on the CM’s shoulder, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday claimed that the PM told CM Yogi to “bat fast as the victory is certain”. “You know what the PM said in Yogiji’s ear. He said that Yogiji bat fast. Play hard. Victory is certain,” Rajnath said, while speaking to booth level presidents in Sitapur. The picture, which had taken social media by storm, was seen as Modi’s endorsement of Yogi as the key face of the party in the run up to UP polls due next year. Rajnath said that it was because of the robust law and order situation that investments were pouring in UP. Around five-and-a-half-lakh crores have come in Uttar Pradesh in the last four and a half years. Even during the Corona period, an investment of Rs 56,000 crore has come in the state, he said. Nearly a week after the PM announced his government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws, Rajnath recalled how during his tenure as UP CM he received protesting farmers, then led by BKU leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, with garlands. Rajnath was chief minster of Uttar Pradesh between 2000 and 2002. “When I was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait entered Lucknow with thousands of farmers. They were coming to the CM residence. Police told me that they would at all cost restrict the entry of the farmers. But I told the police I will welcome them with garlands. This is how BJP treats farmers; this is the attitude of BJP towards farmers. We consider them next to god,” Rajnath said. His statement gained significance three days after 40 farmers’ unions under the aegis of Samyukt Kisan Morcha announced that the stir was far from over until their various other demands, including a legal guarantee to MSP and sacking of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ over alleged involvement of his son Ashish in Lakhimpur violence, were met. The Lucknow MP also termed Naimisharanya located in Sitapur as a key Hindu religious place, visiting which completed the spiritual journey of people. He also drew a parallel between booth level workers with soldiers saying that if a booth is won, the election is won. “To strengthen the party at the booth level, I had started the work of formation of booth committees as the president of BJP,” he said. Rajnath lambasted Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel. “I want to ask SP leaders what was the use and purpose of bringing in Jinnah who was responsible for the division of the country on religious basis. No one will ever accept this. Muslim society has also opposed this statement,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bat-fast-as-victory-is-certain-pm-told-yogi/articleshow/87919443.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Unemployed man loses Rs 4.2 lakh to fraudsters offering UK job||PUNE: The Wanowrie police are searching for two men for cheating a 46-year-old man of Rs 4.19 lakh between February and June this year. Police registered a case on Wednesday after verifying the victim’s claims. According to the police, the victim, who used to work in the hospitality sector earlier, said he received an email in February about a vacancy for the post of a manager at a prominent hotel in Liverpool, UK. The victim immediately replied to the email and sent his details. He then received a message claiming that he had been selected by the hotel management. The suspects sent a letter seeking documents from the candidate and also provided a phone number. Police inspector SP Salgaonkar told TOI that the suspects asked the victim to pay fees for document processing, verification, and other charges. “The victim paid the fees on five different occasions by transferring money to the bank account number which the suspects provided to him. He collectively paid Rs4.19 lakh. The bank account is being operated from a location in Delhi,” said Salgaonkar. The police inspector said that after transferring the money, the victim, who has been unemployed since 2017, demanded the offer letter and other documents from the suspects but they began neglecting his calls. “He kept on insisting on documents when the suspects again demanded Rs85,000. The victim then decided to check the ‘employment details’, which the suspects had provided, with the officials at the UK Embassy in Delhi. He visited Delhi last month and realised it was a scam, and approached the police,” said Salgaonkar. “The bank account, as well as the phone number that was used, are registered in Delhi and police are further investigating,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unemployed-man-loses-rs-4-2l-to-fraudsters-offering-uk-job/articleshow/87918355.cms||---

The officers had returned to Dehradun-based Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy last Sunday (November 21). To prevent further transmission of the virus, the Uttarakhand health department has isolated the 11 infected officers at IGNFA’s old hostel and has turned the area into a containment zone. “After completing their training in Lucknow, the officers returned to Dehradun via Delhi where eight of them tested Covid-19 positive on Friday (November 19). Despite this, the contingent returned to Dehradun as the Delhi facility didn’t have enough space to accommodate them. Subsequently, on reaching Dehradun, three more officers tested positive for the virus,” said a senior doctor of the Uttarakhand health department. When asked how these infected officers could enter Uttarakhand, the officer said, “Currently, Covid testing is not being conducted at the state borders and visitors are not being asked to produce negative RT-PCR report. Besides, registration on the Smart City portal is also not mandatory before arrival anymore.” Meanwhile, the department has accused the infected officers of non-cooperation. “The hostel area was turned into a containment zone on Thursday after an infected officer ran away from the hostel on Wednesday. Currently, 10 infected officers are lodged at the hostel.” Incidentally, the first case of Covid-19 in Uttarakhand had surfaced at the IGNFA itself. “We hope that the pandemic which started at the academy ends here with these officers recovering from the virus,” added the doctor. Meanwhile, five contacts of a Tibet native, who was found Covid-19 positive on Wednesday, tested positive for the virus on Thursday. Subsequently, Dehradun’s Tibet Colony (at Shahastradhara road) was also turned into a containment zone. After eight new cases surfaced in Uttarakhand on Thursday, the cumulative cases of Covid-19 infections in the hill state shot up to 3,44,156.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/11-ifs-officers-from-different-parts-of-the-country-who-recently-underwent-the-mid-career-training-programme-at-lucknow-have-tested-covid-19-positive/articleshow/87917581.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Back to work in 2 days, MSRTC warns its staff||MUMBAI: The state transport body, MSRTC, issued a two-day ultimatum to workers to end their ongoing strike and resume duty by Friday, failing which they could face suspension or dismissal from work. This has come at a time when BJP leaders called off their protest at Azad Maidan on Thursday even as thousands of workers were still firm on their decision to continue the stir indefinitely across the state. A senior official from the management saids: “Those already suspended will be taken back if they join duty by Friday. Else, they could face dismissal. For others who do not join work as per the two-day ultimatum, there could be strict disciplinary action and also more suspensions.” By Thursday evening, nearly 10,000 of the 92,000-strong workforce resumed duty and various bus depots reopened partially in 11 districts, including Mumbai. Over 11,000 commuters were ferried on Thursday Transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab said that the strike did not benefit anyone and led to more losses for both workers and the organisation while inconveniencing lakhs of bus commuters. “I am informed that many workers are eager to join duty, but are reluctant. I will wait for them to resume till Friday after which we will take stern action,” he said. On Thursday, there was high drama at Azad Maidan as BJP MLAs Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot called off the protest, saying they won the “first phase of the fight” of getting salary hikes. As they were leaving the maidan with their supporters, several MSRTC workers and their unions continued to sit in protest, refusing to “toe the BJP line”. Before leaving the maidan, Khot told mediapersons that he and his party would “continue to back” MSRTC workers in their fight to demand merger of MSRTC with the state government. “It is only the BJP which has withdrawn its protest after taking credit for the pay hike announcement. The workers never asked for a pay hike,” said Shashank Rao of Sangharsh ST Kamgar union who, along with several workers, is now camping at Azad Maidan to continue the protest. A day earlier, Parab had announced one of the biggest pay packages for workers till date, with salaries for drivers and conductors proposed to be hiked up to 41%. MSRTC also promised to pay salaries before the 10th of every month, and revoke suspension of striking staff. As per court directives, the state government appointed a panel to hear grievances of 28 unions and submit a report to the chief minister who would submit his views to the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/back-to-work-in-2-days-msrtc-warns-its-staff-in-mumbai/articleshow/87919450.cms||Somit Sen

---||Dehradun||Dehradun among 10 state districts set to receive piped natural gas lines next year||Dehradun: In an effort to reduce dependency on regular gas cylinders, Dehradun and nine other districts of Uttarakhand are set to receive PNG (piped natural gas) pipeline connections for households by March 2022. To this end, the Petroleum and Natural Gas regulatory board, along with the Gas Authority of India Limited (Gail), is working towards laying down the pipeline in Dehradun, Pauri Garhwal, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, Pithoragarh, Champawat, Almora, Chamoli, Bageshwar. The network of gas pipelines, according to officials, is likely to benefit nearly 39 lakh people across the state. The Dehradun district alone is expected to have an estimated 3 lakh connections over the next eight years. “The cost of this project is upwards of Rs 1,500 crore and a majority of this amount will be spent in the first five years,” Gail CEO Raman Chadha told TOI. The official added that over 70,000 people have already registered for gas connections. Meanwhile, state-owned Gail is also working on developing CNG stations in and around Dehradun city. “The infrastructural work to provide PNG connections to nearly 20,000 households in the Dehradun district is underway. We are expecting gas supply from our branches in Haridwar, Dehradun and Rishikesh,” Chadhha further said. The first phase of the project is expected to become operational by March 2022.

---||Delhi||Cops: ‘ISIS threat’ to Gambhir traced to Pak, likely a hoax||New Delhi: Investigators probing the threat emails to BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir suspect them to be a hoax. While the IP address has been tracked to Pakistan, no apparent connection to “Islamic State” has surfaced till now, sources said. The internet protocol details record (IP-DR) analysis and details of the email address obtained by agencies reveal that the email ID was created a day before the mails were sent by a college student, Shahid Hamid. The mails were sent from a Redmi Note 8 device, which was connected to his home broadband, an analysis of data reveals. The origin of both is in Sindh province of Pakistan. The second mail, which had a video, has been downloaded from YouTube. A vlogger had uploaded it sometime ago to show the former cricketer’s house to fans and his subscribers. Intelligence sources also pointed out that the mails did not seem authentic because IS didn’t send any mail prior to an attack and had always claimed an attack after its successful completion. Commenting on a similar threat mail sent to another person, a source said IS didn’t refer to itself as Daesh, a seemingly derogatory term used for it. On Wednesday, security was tighetened outside Gambhir’s house following a complaint that he had received a threat mail from “ISIS Kashmir”. Special Cell’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Ops unit is still probing Gambhir’s case. “The complainant mentioned that they have received an email from ‘ISIS Kashmir’ on the official email of the MP around 9.32pm. The mail mentioned death threats to the MP and his family,” said an officer. “One email was received in the morning while the other in the evening.” Police have written to Google to get the IP address and other information of the system being used to send the emails, the officer said. “The second email is also sent from the same user ID,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-isis-threat-to-gambhir-traced-to-pak-likely-a-hoax/articleshow/87918989.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Mahant was in grave trauma due to fear of disgrace, says CBI||Lucknow: In its 19-page chargesheet filed in the Mahant Narendra Giri death case, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has said that accused Anand Giri, Adya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari had circulated an objectionable audio defaming the late seer and putting him under immense mental and psychological trauma due to which he ended his life. A video recorded by Mahant before his death has been treated as dying declaration by CBI, while the report of the seven-page suicide note sent for forensic and handwriting analysis is awaited. On September 20, Mahant, 62, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), was found dead at Shri Mutt Baghambari Gaddi in Prayagraj. The chargesheet states that on May 26, a truce was struck between Anand and the Mahant in Lucknow but it did not work out. Mahant became Gaddi head in 2004 and Anand became his disciple in 2005. Differences cropped up between when Anand formed ‘Ganga Sena’ and held a camp without Mahant’s permission. On January 7, 2010, Mahant named Swami Balbir Giri as his successor but on August 29, 2011, nominated Anand in a fresh will. The Mahant again changed his will on June 4, 2020, nominating Balbir as his successor saying Anand has started visiting foreign countries and raised a separate entity. Mahant also said in his will that Anand was involved in ‘anti-religious’ activities. Mahant also wrote about expelling Anand for his misdeeds. CBI probe found that Anand requested Mahant Ravindra Puri of Niranjani Akhara to play interlocutor and get his expulsion revoked. On May 23, Ravindra made a call to Mahant which was recorded by Anand. During the chat, Anand threatened the Mahant saying he is in possession of many objectionable audios and videos. On September 11, Narendra Giri asked his disciples about ‘sulphas’ and its impact on the body. On September 19, he asked another disciple to bring a nylon rope. The CBI chargesheet mentions that Mahant was seen taking the nylon rope inside the guest room and next day told his disciples that Anand was going to release edited videos showing him in objectionable position with a woman. CBI mentions that the video found in the Mahant’s phone reflected he was under grave trauma due to the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mahant-was-in-grave-trauma-due-to-fear-of-disgrace-says-cbi/articleshow/87919448.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It has been an annual ritual for years except for the past two birthdays when I couldn’t come because of Covid,” he said. The six-time Kunda MLA dismissed speculations that the meeting was a precursor to a possible alliance. “Mulayam Singh and I did not even discuss politics, what to say f a poll pact.

Despite scrapping tenders and forfeiting deposits of contractors for making bids 40% below estimates, companies had again bid around 40% below estimates for the second time. The BMC is now mulling whether the contracts be awarded at low rates and risk shoddy work. The open spaces are currently being maintained by old agencies on an ad hoc basis. The BMC had in August scrapped tenders worth Rs 50 crore after contractors bid over 40% below estimated costs and allegedly attempted to create a cartel. The BMC had also forfeited contractors’ deposits of around Rs 50 lakh for bidding below estimates.“We floated fresh tenders with revised estimated costs. The estimates were reduced by 20% but even then, contractors bid close to 40% below the second time also. We are currently giving extension to the previous contractors for 2-3 months at a time,” said a senior civic official. Asked if the BMC was going to scrap the tenders for the second time, additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide said, “It is in process.” The BJP alleged that the BMC had failed to break the cartel of contractors. “Contractors seem to be more powerful than the BMC. The BMC is now giving out short term quotation contracts to the same companies at over 50% below the estimated costs. The BMC must conduct an inquiry against officials who prepared bogus estimates,” said BJP Corporator Vinod Mishra. “Companies who bid below 40% for the second time must be blacklisted,” Mishra said.

Unlike soldiers who receive a pension on retirement, the old dogs are left in animal care centres. But Rosy is just a blip on the horizon. TimesViewPets are not toys that can be abandoned at our pleasure. Owning a pet is a matter of responsibility. The report lays bare the callousness of many pet owners. Animal rights organisations must work in tandem with authorities to find ways to deal with such negligent behaviour.The first-ever State of Pet Homelessness Index report, released on Thursday, estimates there are 80 million homeless cats and dogs in India living in shelters or on the streets. “Rosy might have saved countless lives during her service, but as there no longer was a place for her in the police department, she was left in our centre in her old age. She was lucky because we managed to find a new home for her,” said Ambika Shukla, director, SGACC. “Every day, we come across five-six cases of pets abandonment.” India scored a measly 2.4 on a 10-point scale on the Pet Homelessness Index. The low rating underlines the need for a more coordinated effort to address the challenge of pet homelessness in the country. The main reasons why India rated so low are the relatively low companion animal sterilisation and vaccination, high percentage of canine diseases, including rabies, the relatively high cost of owning a pet and the absence of strong enforcement of laws on animal welfare and against cruelty to animals, especially at the local government level. The report revealed a high relinquishment levels, with 50% of current and previous pet owners stating they had relinquished a pet in the past against a global average of 28%. The index, released by Mars Petcare India in partnership with an advisory board of leading animal welfare experts, also said that 82% of homeless dogs in India were considered street dogs. More than half the population, 53%, feel that street dogs are dangerous, 65% fear a dog bite and 82% believe that street dogs should be removed and put in shelters. Ganesh Ramani, managing director, Mars Petcare India, said, “Until now, there was no way to measure and track the scale animal homelessness across the world and in India. The index is a call to action and we welcome partnerships with the government, NGOs and individuals who want to ensure all companion animals are wanted and cared for.” Times View: Pets are not toys that can be abandoned at our pleasure.

An official note on the matter issued by additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, said that the Covid-19 variant B.1.1529 (commonly being referred to as Botswana variant) is reported to have significantly high number of mutations and thus has a serious public health implication for the country in view of the recently relaxed visa restrictions and opening up of international travel. Citing recommendations from the Union health ministry, ACS Prasad dubbed the variant as a major threat to public health in the state and advised screening of all international travellers for the pandemic virus. In addition to this, he directed the district health officials to undertake regular genome sequencing of the samples collected from the foreign retur nees. Meanwhile, health officials urged people of the state to adhere to the Covid-19 prevention protocol and get vaccinated at the earliest.

---||Mumbai||Anaemia levels of children under-5 in Mumbai, Maharashtra on the rise||MUMBAI: A whopping 67% of India's under-five children or almost seven out of every 10 children have anemia, a condition in which the blood doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells, according to the National Family Health Survey-5. In Mumbai, the financial capital, the numbers are worse: with 72.8% of children living in the island city having anemia as compared to 65.6% in the suburbs. Anemia is an indicator of inadequate iron in the body and could lead to symptoms such as breathlessness, irregular heartbeat or malnutrition. It can be easily treated with improved diet and iron supplements, but the country has been struggling to check it despite having a national control programme. Experts say factors such as maternal age, education and economic status have a role to play. “In 2015, 52.9% of children in the richest households were anemic, whereas 63.2% of children in the poorest household were anemic,’’ according to a study by Harvard University published in the 'Nature' journal in November 2019. “Childhood anemia remains one of the most salient nutritional disorders facing mothers and children in India despite a massive increase in private and public humanitarian efforts to promote child health in response to anemia rates reported in earlier demographic and health surveys. The 2005-06 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in India revealed that at least 80% of children between 12 and 23 months were anemic in India. And in children aged <5 years, 69.5% were anemic,'' said the study. In most states, incidence of anemia has increased. In Maharashtra, it rose drastically from 53.8% in NHFS-4 in 2015 to 68.9% in NFHS-5 (2019-2021). The condition is higher among rural Maharashtra's children (70.7%) as compared to urban (66.3%). In the same period, it increased from 50.7% to 71.1% in Punjab, from 59.7% to 69/2% in Delhi and from 50.7 to 57.4% in Tamil Nadu. Senior pediatrician Dr Vijay Yewale said while number of affected children in Maharashtra and Mumbai may seem high, most possibly have borderline anemia. “It is the result of improper feeding habits. The poor breastfeed their baby for many years, resulting in children getting inadequate nutrients. Breastfeeding among the affluent class is not long enough while the middeclasses replace breast milk with animal milk which has poor bioavailability of nutrients,'' said Dr Yewale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/anaemia-levels-of-children-under-5-in-mumbai-maharashtra-on-the-rise/articleshow/87919004.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Lucknow||‘JD-L open to alliance, with a respectable seat-sharing formula’||Former minister and Independent MLA, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya called on Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav at his residence. The 15-minute meeting left rumour mills rolling about the Kunda MLA possibly reaching out to the Samajwadi Party ahead of the crucial 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. In an exclusive interview to Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui, Raja Bhaiyya described his meeting with SP founder as a part of a relationship which was beyond politics. In response to a question, he said Jansatta Dal Loktantrik — the party he floated — was not averse to politics of alliance, but with a respectable seat-sharing formula. Excerpts of the interview: You called on Mulayam Singh Yadav earlier in the day. How will you describe this meeting? Even among politicians, some relationships are beyond politics. I visit Netaji (as Mulayam Singh Yadav is fondly referred to) on his birthday every year and seek his blessings. Be it my birthday, Holi or Diwali, he calls me up and wishes me. It is mutual. This has been the practice for years now. This time on his birthday I was not around, so I visited him today. You were a member of the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet during the SP regime till you went ahead and supported the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls after which the SP chief said you were no longer with him? What is the current status of your relationship with him? I have ‘normal’ relations with him now. The only issue was that I was not comfortable with SP joining hands with the Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls for reasons which are common knowledge. That was the only decision of the SP chief that I did not agree with. Today almost all senior SP leaders including the SP president agree that the decision of alliance with BSP was wrong. In the Rajya Sabha elections held in March 2018, you voted for the BJP candidate. I wouldn’t have voted for the BSP candidate. I said I was with Akhilesh Yadav but it was assumed that I would vote for BSP candidate as well who was supported by the SP. You were seen siding with the BJP and have been all praises for chief minister Yogi Adityanath? People who want to see me standing with the BJP conveniently overlook the fact that we fought the 2019 Lok Sabha polls against BJP from Pratapgarh and Kaushambi. In Kunda and Babaganj assembly segments of Kaushambi our candidate got maximum votes while BJP stood second and SP-BSP combine finished third. About me meeting Yogi Adityanath, I am a sitting MLA and required to meet the CM for issues related to my constituency. You have always contested assembly polls as an Independent candidate. This is the first time that you will take part in state elections under the banner of Jansatta Dal Loktantrik. What are your party’s views about alliance politics? Jansatta Dal Loktantrik (JD-L) was founded on November 30, 2018 to mark 25 years of my serving as MLA for six terms. This will be the first assembly election that we will contest under the banner of our party. The JD-L is open to the politics of alliance and provides a respectable seat-sharing formula in the light of the fact that we have had at least 3 sitting MLAs in every assembly for over two decades now. What makes JD-L’s politics different from other small or new parties is that we already have three sitting MLAs who have a pretty long experience of electoral politics and winning elections unlike other small or new parties who seek alliance to make their assembly or parliament debut. Your party has announced that it is preparing to contest the 2022 assembly polls from 100 odd seats in the state. Is it a tactic to position yourself in case of an alliance? There are no talks of alliance with anyone till now. As a party we had to start our preparations for the assembly polls. So we went ahead and shortlisted 100 seats which suited our local equations. It is not about political positioning at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jd-l-open-to-alliance-with-a-respectable-seat-sharing-formula/articleshow/87919483.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No posts against Sameer Wankhede till December 9, Nawab Malik informs Bombay high court||MUMBAI: Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik on Thursday informed the Bombay high court that he would not put up any posts or tweets against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, his father Dnyandev and other family members on any social media platform till December 9, when the court will next hear an appeal seeking to restrain him. Malik’s counsel Karl Tamboly made the statement “without prejudice” when a bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav asked him to take instructions from his client and inform it whether he would “stay his hands” for a week or so till further hearing or it would pass orders. The HC accepted the statement as an undertaking to court and posting the matter to December 9 said, “All contentions of the parties are kept open.” The HC bench was hearing an appeal by Dnyandev who has challenged the single-judge bench order of Justice Madhav Jamdar that had found Malik’s tweets to be “actuated by malice or personal animosity”, but had not restrained the NCP leader from making any alleged defamatory tweets or public statements in future. Justice Kathawalla orally observed, “He is a minister. Does it befit him to do all this and the single-judge bench says it is with malice and personal animosity.” The bench read out findings of Justice Jamdar and asked Tamboly, “Does the SC say if you come to this finding, you should not restrain?” Dnyandev’s senior counsel, Birendra Saraf, sought interim orders against Malik pointing to the Supreme Court ruling that once a court gives a finding of ‘malice’ an order to restrain should follow. Saraf claimed that Malik “has spared no one, even Dnyand-ev’s late wife and daughter, ap-art from Sameer Wankhede”. Saraf asked, “Is it possible that anyone can sling mud at anyone? Social media handles have become a platform for firing loose cannons where anyone can say anything.” Saraf read out portions of the Monday order which accepted that Malik had not done reasonable verification before tweeting about his allegations that Sameer had secured a public service job through false caste certification and that of extortion. Justice Kathawalla, speaking for the bench, said, “Let us take one issue. Caste validity. You have a forum. Anyone can go there. First, you have to get this set aside,” he said to Tamboly. The counsel said: “The caste certificate is of 1974.” The HC replied, “Whichever year it is...It is only media attention that he [Malik] wants every day. More so after his son-in-law was arrested.’’ Malik's counsel later mentioned the matter again for a hearing saying he would suggest via media to work out the appeal. The HC said he could mention it on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-posts-against-wankhedes-till-dec-9-malik-informs-bombay-hc-/articleshow/87919014.cms||Swati Deshpande

Schools in urban areas have been functioning for standards VIII to XII, while those in rural areas had reopened for standards V to XII for several months. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that the decision was taken after a discussion with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the cabinet members and the paediatric task force. “The state cabinet has decided to reopen schools from Std I to IV in rural areas and Std I to VII in urban areas from December 1. We are committed to the safe resumption of schools,” Gaikwad said in a tweet on Thursday evening. The minister, in her tweet also said that this is the third phase of school reopening. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that over the next six days, the emphasis will be on acclimatizing schools, parents and children towards a safe transition to physical classes. The department plans to hold consultations with school management committees and parents. Gaikwad will also meet the paediatric task force about the SOPs for younger children, some of whom may be attending physical classes for the first time. The paediatric task force on Wednesday had made it clear that vaccination is not a prerequisite for reopening schools for primary classes. As per the Unified District Information System for Education data of 2020-21, there are 1,34,85,879 students enrolled in primary schools from standards I to VII in the state. Vasant Kalpande, former director of education and an activist, said they have been seeking the reopening of all schools since August. “Zilla parishads in Dhule, Sangli, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar had passed resolutions for reopening primary schools and they have not seen any alarming cases after the students returned. For rural schools, the decision is a good one as online access to education is a challenge,” he added. Keep options open Alok Mishra, a parent of a standard II student in a Navi Mumbai school, said, “I am fine with the online classes and my child is used to it now. I will wait and see before sending my child to school. Also, I cannot pick up and drop her and private school transport will be crowded. However, the decision to reopen is good for the rural parts or urban areas where access to online education is a problem.” Anubha Sahai, president of India Wide Parents Association, said that schools must not make it compulsory for students to attend the classes offline. “There are many complaints from parents that the schools are making it compulsory for students to attend classes offline. There should be strict guidelines to schools to offer both online and offline classes. We understand that teachers find it hectic to teach in both modes. Hence, the government must come out with guidelines so that the teachers are not overworked,” she added. Initially online Rajendra Singh, president of Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said, “Initially, we will adopt the hybrid model of education. However, once we are able to reassure the parents and make students comfortable, we will make it offline. In our survey, we saw that students attending online classes are much behind those attending offline classes, especially in English, maths and science. Secondly, we see children in malls and every other public place. They can also attend school where it is safer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-gives-nod-to-reopen-all-classes-from-std-1-on-dec-1/articleshow/87919006.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Coimbatore||DMK functionary, government officials booked for swindling Rs 48 lakh||COIMBATORE: The directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DAVC) has registered an FIR against a couple, a DMK functionary, two former engineers and a former executive officer of Kannampalayam town panchayat for swindling Rs 48 lakh from the panchayat fund in 2015-2016. The FIR was registered on November 17 against former assistant engineer M Menaka, 43, former executive officer K R Renuka, 49, former assistant executive engineer K Mahendran, 54, DMK functionary and former president of Kannampalayam town panchayat M Thalapathy Murugesan, 56, K Parthiban, 56, and his wife P Bhuvaneshwari, 49, both contractors from Kannampalayam near Sulur. They were booked under sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 13 (2), 13 (1) (c)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Renuka along with two engineers and Murugesan hatched a conspiracy and floated a tender for a pipeline extension work in the panchayat. They enrolled Parthiban and Bhuvaneshwari as registered contractors though the couple was not eligible to bid for the tender. An estimation of Rs 94.5 lakh was prepared for the pipeline extension work. As the panchayat president has power to sanction only Rs 4 lakh worth of work, the pipeline extension work was split into 27. The tender detail was published in a vernacular newspaper and the couple was selected as a successful bidder. A DVAC official said Parthiban claimed Rs 48,10,265 after completing 27 works by laying substandard PVC pipes. However, the works were not carried out in the Kannampalayam panchayat, the official said. The amount was swindled from the panchayat fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-functionary-govt-officials-booked-for-swindling-rs-48-lakh/articleshow/87918444.cms||---

Small and medium industries form the backbone of Coimbatore, Krishnasamy told reporters. “But they were pushed to the back burner. No announcements were made to uplift them during the investment conclave.”Krishnasamy said that a conference would be held on behalf of Puthiya Tamilagam for the benefit of small investors. “The party will contest alone in the upcoming urban local body polls. We have not approached anyone for alliance. It would be a coalition government in Tamil Nadu in 2026 and Puthiya Tamilagam is focusing on the assembly election,” he said.“The government should come forward to improve road infrastructure in and around Coimbatore. Coimbatore – Dindigul and Coimbatore – Trichy roads should be made six lanes or eight lanes,” he said.In the backdrop of heavy showers across the state, Krishnasamy urged the state government to give Rs 5,000 to all ration cardholders with Pongal hamper. “The party plans to conduct a series of events to mark the 25th year of Puthiya Tamilagam party.

The judgment came almost 11 months after the girl’s mother lodged a case at Sanderao police station in Pali district. According to police, the accused identified as Mohan Singh raped his stepdaughter. “Not only that, he was also intimidating the girl to keep mum and had shown her a knife many a times asking her not to tell anyone about it,” said a senior officer of Sanderao police station. The mother of the girl had lodged an FIR against Singh on December 8, 2020 and he was arrested a few days later. “It was also found that the accused had threatened to kill her mother as well and had repeatedly intimidated the girl,” said the officer. “After recording the statements of 17 witnesses and other evidence, the court of Prahlad Rai Sharma special judge, POCSO court, convicted Singh and awarded a life imprisonment of 20 years.

Shah also called upon industries to invest in the northeast and boost development in the region that was witnessing peace and political stability for the first time. He requested investors to check “for themselves by sending their employees over to the northeast” about the vibrant business atmosphere, and urged industrialists to join a business summit in Assam in March where he would be present. Shah said there was a time when the northeast was saddled with problems like violence, insurgency, floods, corruption, blockades and narcotics etc. “Today, the region is in the news for connectivity, development, tourism, jobs, afforestation and flood control. “For investment, a region must be peaceful, insurgencies and disputes resolved, and an atmosphere created for political stability and economic development. The Narendra Modi government has enabled this over the past seven years,” said Shah. “I appeal to ICC and its members to look at the northeast from a different perspective, understand the changes and invest,” the home minister told the industry captains while emphasising that the target of a five-trillion-dollar economy set by the PM cannot be realised without development of the northeast. Shah said the government has integrated three ‘E’ – empathy, empowerment and enabler – for development of the northeast and would move ahead on these lines. He said the Modi regime would establish peace by understanding with empathy the aspirations of the youths; empower the governments in the northeast with political stability; and be an enabler in empowering the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-can-trade-with-bdesh-via-northeast-rail-route-shah/articleshow/87918470.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin's Coimbatore visit gives political boost ahead of polls||COIMBATORE: More than once during his speeches at government functions in Coimbatore, chief minister M K Stalin said he doesn’t want to talk politics. There was a subtle but clear political message, however, loaded in Stalin’s speeches as well as actions during his two-day visit to Coimbatore – that the DMK should win the urban local body polls in Coimbatore. “I want you to note that I have come to Coimbatore to hold such a huge conference despite the fact that we could not taste victory here in the assembly polls,” Stalin emphasised.  On the first day of his visit, he made half a dozen announcements for Coimbatore – laying of five scheme roads at a cost of Rs 200 crore, underground drainage in added areas of the city like Vellakinar and Chinnavedampatti for Rs 309crore, creating a Rs 200crore Semmozhi Poonga, 63 new health centres and shifting of central prison to city outskirts.  The project announcement spree continued the next day too. Stalin assured that the government would set up a centre of excellence for casting industries, micro clusters of jewellery units and a coir processing cluster in Pollachi. “We want to give Coimbatore the same importance accorded to Chennai,” Stalin said.  Stalin’s visit as well as projects announced have given a morale boost to Coimbatore’s DMK functionaries, who appeared rudderless after the assembly election defeat. “The mandate for us is clear. It is not just to win all the wards in the urban local body elections in Coimbatore but to strengthen our party to win every election in future,” said electricity minister V Senthil Balaji, who was made in charge of Coimbatore district by Stalin.  Balaji's deputation underlined the dearth of leaders for the ruling party in Coimbatore. DMK sent Balaji as he belonged to the majority gounder community and was an aggressive field worker.  For his part, Senthil Balaji went full throttle from the day he was sent here and visited 150 places across Coimbatore and collected 1.4 lakh petitions from the public. “Of this we have resolved 25,000 petitions,” he said.  “The AIADMK government too had promised a slew of projects for Coimbatore. But our leader stood out not only because of his project announcements but because of two gestures he made,” noted a DMK functionary. One was inviting BJP leader Vanathi Srinivasan to the dais and offering her an opportunity to speak. She was given a seat in the front row, but Stalin asked her to come up to the dais.  The second was instruction to DMK men not to erect hoardings or banners anywhere during his visit. “There were no banners, flex boards or flagposts anywhere. I wish to acknowledge this good action. I like to thank the CM for his more responsible visit,” said a relative of K Raghupathy, who died after hitting a hoarding erected on Avinashi Road in Coimbatore in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stalins-visit-boosts-cadres-morale/articleshow/87918472.cms||Mayilvaganan

The CM had announced 63 health centres and three medical laboratories at a cost of Rs 16 crore. The civic body has identified places for all health centres except for 15, an official said. “We are struggling to find suitable places in the central zone, which constitute mostly of commercial and developed areas. We hope to find places by next March,” he said. The city has 32 urban primary health centres in 100 wards. Apart from treating outpatients, the centres provide delivery services. Each centre is catering to the needs of 50,000 people. “Each proposed health centre would cater to the needs of 15,000-20,000 people. They will be similar to the health sub-centres in rural areas. Doctors and nurses will be available during the day. Treatments for common diseases such as fever and cold would be provided. Minor wounds will be treated. Pregnant women will be monitored. The centres will also help to educate people on good habits and sanitation, which are directly related to improved public health,” the official said. The centres will make health services more accessible, another official said. “There will be one in every 2km. The centres will also help to detect complicated health problems at an early stage by directing people to the higher institution. The process of establishing three medical laboratories announced by the CM is under process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-scouts-for-space-to-set-up-health-centres/articleshow/87918455.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Work in groups, retreat if you come across dangerous animal||Nagpur: Work in groups, retreat if a wild animal is in front of you, do patrolling in human presence areas near buffer and review the need for protection huts where there is no human presence are some of the directions issued by the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) park management to its field staff and officials. The 16-point advisory issued by the field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar comes following the killing of woman forest guard Swati Dhumne by tigress Maya in the core area of Tadoba on November 20. The field staff has been asked to remain in groups of 20 while taking up fire-line and wildlife habitat management works. The forester concerned has been asked to guard this group of workers and RFOs has been asked to provide a vehicle for their help. The guards and van majoors have been advised to retreat if they see a carnivore that poses danger to life or fresh pugmarks while patrolling. Officials have been told to give weapons to staff who have been trained to handle them. The employees have been also asked to restrict movement on two-wheelers through the core area and henceforth no staff will accompany NGO or forest officials without the permission of the field director or deputy director (core). If the staff accompanies them entire responsibility of their safety will be of the said NGO and officials. The staff has also been asked not to venture in tigress Maya’s (T-12) territory on foot and not get down from the vehicle. The STPF jawans have also been asked not to go close to the animals in conflict without proper planning. On June 3, TATR wildlife vet was seriously injured in a tiger attack in Doni after a rescue operation went haywire. Deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “Rehabilitation of protection huts has been going on past 3-4 years. We have shifted some huts on the fringes for better monitoring. Secondly, instead of a beat as a unit, now a round — which comprises a group of beats — will be a unit so that work can be done in groups. There will be no compromise with protection.” State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre says considering the unfortunate incident the steps taken by TATR are crucial. “To counter insecurity among staff working with ‘round’ as a unit is safe. If the state is really serious about avoiding such incidents in the future, all the vacant posts need to be filled. Of the post of 70 forest guards in Tadoba, 27 are lying vacant.” “Some of the points are contradictory. Shifting of protection huts from sensitive areas is not advisable considering the poaching threat. Relaxation in patrolling itself is against NTCA guidelines. Instead more vehicles can be deployed,” said Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel. Patel added, “The advisory says ‘no’ to night patrolling but management has no problem with night tourism. The department should involve like-minded people committed to saving wildlife as volunteers for patrolling. They can offer their services free of cost.” “Why the tigress turned violent also needs to be studied. The way Tadoba is being stressed with VIPs and tourists, impacts tiger behavior. They have lost the fear of humans and this needs to be found out,” says Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/work-in-groups-retreat-if-you-come-across-dangerous-animal/articleshow/87918482.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Separating Fire From Fire: How Actual Numbers Are Arrived At||New Delhi: At the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, scientists are busy counting India’s stubble fires. Three US satellites — SNPP VIIRS, Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS — pass over India during the night and the scientists collate the data. After the satellites capture the images of all fire counts, the scientists spend hours analysing them and removing those that are not active paddy residue burning cases. “There are many brick kilns in north India and the fires in these are also captured. Similar is the case with solar parks where the solar panels heat up and are reflected as fires in the satellite imagery. Farmers across the country burn other crop residue too, such as in sugarcane fields in UP by November-end,” explained Vinay Sehgal, principal scientist and in charge of CREAMS laboratory. “However, a forest fire burns for hours to days, while paddy residue burning is for around 20 minutes to an hour.” To ensure that the fire count pertains only to stubble burning, the scientists put the data on GIS platform which already has locations of brick kilns and solar parks on it. A ‘crop mask’, eliminating areas that are not under rice cultivation, is done to eliminate non-paddy residue burning. “Once we get a fire point, we take the land surface temperature of each pixel and compare the temperature with the neighbouring pixels,” said Sehgal. “If the land surface temperature of the point is higher than the threshold limit, it means that there was an active fire. The difference in temperature in such cases is more than 25 degrees Celsius during the daytime in the current season.” According to IARI, active paddy residue burning cases numbered 71,215 in Punjab, 6,829 in Haryana and 3,463 in UP between September 15 and November 24. The scientists also measured the intensity of burning to estimate the amount of biomass burnt. “Our analysis says that though the fire counts were fewer in Punjab this year than in 2020, the intensity of burning was almost the same, indicating the same volume of stubble was burnt this year,” revealed Sehgal. Apart from fire counts and intensity of burning, the scientists also examine the area of paddy burning in every village in six states. It helps to identify the regions with the maximum fires. “Of the total rice area of 2.9 million hectares in Punjab, around 1.2 million hectares were burned till November 10,” said Rajkumar Dhakar, scientist. The amount of pollutants emitted by the fires, like CH4, NOx, CO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10, are also estimated. However, they cannot determine how much of the pollutants reach Delhi because that depends on meteorological conditions. The CREAMS laboratory data is also provided to the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining areas (CAQM), Union agriculture ministry, Central Pollution Control Board and the state governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Though the team at the laboratory work intensively on stubble burning counts in six states, they have been monitoring paddy residue burning across north India for four years. It has also been monitoring farm fires across India that are related to other crops, such as cotton plant residue burning in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/separating-fire-from-fire-how-actual-numbers-are-arrived-at/articleshow/87919508.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shuke and Anil Pansare on Thursday adjourned the hearing by three weeks. Petitioner Mukesh Shahu, who had amended his PIL as per court’s directives, further demanded a 1,200 sq ft home for the CSWs after they were deprived of their livelihood by the police action. He pointed out that some developed countries have legalized the prostitution and the CSWs get all the healthcare, financial and shelter facilities from the government. Countries like Brazil, Israel, Kenya, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, England, USA and other countries have commercialized this profession. Shahu had challenged commissioner of police’s notification of August 25 on prohibiting prostitution activities within 200 meters of public places in the city’s infamous red-light area. The notification issued under Section 7(1)(b) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, is without jurisdiction, as the power to issue it, notifying prohibited public places vests to the state government, he contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pil-demands-monthly-remuneration-home-for-csws/articleshow/87918488.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A senior excise official confirmed to TOI that information has been sought from Thane collector and Thane excise superintendent on how Wankhede procured the licence on October 27, 1997, when he was not even 18 years old against the required age of 21. “Once we receive the information, we will decide the course of action against Wankhede as well as the officials who issued the licence in violation of rules,” the excise official said, adding that then Wankhede’s father, Dnyandev, was an inspector in the state excise department. Last week, TOI had reported that Wankhede has a licence for Sadguru bar and restaurant in Vashi.

---||Coimbatore||Tomato price crash last year affected acreage: Farmers||COIMBATORE: While the price of tomatoes has shot up owing to crop failure due to bad weather, area under cultivation has come down. Tomatoes are mostly cultivated at Madukkarai, Thondamuthur and Kinathukadavu blocks in the district. They are now grown in 1,288 hectares here, down from 1,700 hectares three years ago. One of the reasons for the plunging cultivation area is the poor price tomatoes fetched a year ago. Last year, farmers here dumped tomatoes on fields after they fetched a paltry Rs 5/kg. Now, they are sold for Rs 60 at farm gate. While the price has shot up due to tight supplies caused by widespread rain, not many farmers could reap the benefits owing to crop damage. C Muthukumar, a Pichanur-based farmer, said he used to harvest 15-20 tonnes from one acre, but now has hardly four tonnes. “A kilo of tomato is bought for Rs 57 now as demand has gone up. But I don’t have many left as most of the plants were destroyed in heavy rain,” he told TOI. Thondamuthur-based Rajamani had spent Rs 1 lakh per acre for ploughing, seedlings, fertilizer and staking. “Some farmers, who are fortunate to have decent crops this season, have hit a jackpot. But I will face losses as most of my crops were damage in rain,” he said. “I had cultivated tomatoes in 75 cents last year. But this year, I grew the plants on 50 cents due to poor prices last year.” The horticulture department is trying its best to support tomato farmers, deputy director M Bhuvaneswari said. “As per the data available with the department collated with the help of the revenue department, tomato crops on only 8.62 hectares were destroyed in rain this year. Most of the farmers are getting good returns,” she said. “Tomato farmers added 288 hectares in October alone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tomato-price-crash-last-year-affected-acreage-farmers/articleshow/87918484.cms||V Devanathan

Speaking to the media during his visit to the city, the former minister in Devendra Fadnavis government sought an audit of oxygen supply provided to various hospitals since last year. “All three MVA constituents have failed to provide proper treatment and facilities to the patients leading to their deaths. It also failed to curb the corrupt practices of some hospitals which exploited the patients and looted them under the pretext of Covid treatment,” he said. Accompanied by MLC Girish Vyas, senior functionary Sanjay Bhende and spokesperson Chandan Goswami, the BJP MLA accused the MVA leaders of allegedly being involved in the corruption during the pandemic period. “In last two years, the government has messed up everything. The health minister hardly visited hospitals, except few. The government employees did not get reimbursements for their costly treatments. All this shows that the MVA ministers were busy in transferring police officers, leaving the people at the god’s mercy,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-min-attacks-mva-for-failure-to-provide-facilities-to-covid-patients/articleshow/87918496.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh accuses Central govt of selling off airports||Lucknow: Taking a jibe at the ruling BJP for making a spectacle of the foundation laying of Jewar Airport, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday questioned the need for such pomp and show when the government is selling off airports to private entities. Speaking as the chief guest at a rally organised by a lesser known Janvadi Party Socialist in Lucknow at Ramabai Rally Sthal, Akhilesh pointed out that the Lucknow airport situated near the venue was till recently a government enterprise. But now it has been sold off. “At a time when we have gathered here to decide our strategy to wipe off BJP (in the 2022 polls), BJP leaders have gathered near Delhi to lay the foundation stone of an airport,” he said. This was the first major political public event in Lucknow that Akhilesh had participated in ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. Till now be it the inaugural flag off of Akhilesh’s Kranti Rath Yatra from Ganga Ghat in Kanpur or joint rally with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party in Mau all major political events of the SP have been held outside the state capital. The former UP CM went on to say: “Ye kaise Bharatiya Janata Party ke log hain, ek taraf to hawai adda bench rahe hain… Doosri taraf hawai adda bana rahe hain … kaun bharosa karega in par (What kind of people are there in the Bharatiya Janata Party. On the one hand they are selling off airports … on the other they are making one. Who is going to trust such people)”. Akhilesh then listed names of airports which were incurring losses questioning the ruling BJP about the promise it made that the poor who wear “hawai chappal” (rubber slippers) will be able to afford a “hawai yatra” (flight ticket). “But the government is now selling off aircrafts and airports. How many of you who wear hawai chappals have managed to afford an air ticket to travel,” he asked the crowd. Earlier addressing the gathering, founder and national president of Janvadi Socialist Party Sanjay Sigh Chauhan attacked the BJP claiming that his community voted for BJP in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls but not a single member got a ticket from BJP. “However, in 2019, SP had only 37 seats, still Akhilesh Yadav fielded a member of our community,” he said. He thanked Akhilesh for his support to the party and urged his partymen to vote in favour of SP. Janvadi Socialist Party was founded by Sanjay Singh Chauhan in April 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-accuses-central-govt-of-selling-off-airports/articleshow/87919503.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The spokesperson added that flight operations from Mumbai will be under Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL), introduced for travellers to enjoy quarantine-free access to the country, said . Fully vaccinated flyers can now gain a quarantine-free entry into Singapore by flying on VTL flights and carrying a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP), which can be applied for online. The VTL passengers must present a digital proof of vaccination. IndiGo, which will be launching flights to Singapore from Chennai under VTL, listed the norms for VTL travel. “The passengers will have to undergo two Covid-19 tests – a pre-departure test within two days before departure for Singapore (e.g., test taken any time on 8 Nov is valid till 10 Nov 2359 hrs) while another test on-arrival at Changi airport. After tests travellers have to remain self-isolated until the result is confirmed to be negative. Children upto 12 who are not vaccinated can travel under the VTL into Singapore if accompanied by a VTL traveller who meets all VTL requirements, said IndiGo. “Short-term visitors must purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of Singapore dollar 30,000 for Covid-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore,” IndiGo added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/20-mths-on-flights-to-singapore-from-mumbai-resume-mon/articleshow/87919496.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘AAP playing politics of revenge instead of politics of change’||Kharar: BJP leader Vineet Joshi accused Aam Aadmi Party of indulging in “politics of revenge” with residents of Kharar constituency in Mohali. Joshi questioned senior leaders of AAP, Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann, on why the party was fielding “outsiders” instead of local candidates. “Earlier in 2017, AAP ignored local leaders and gave the ticket to Kanwar Sandhu, who had run away from his responsibility after winning the election. Kharar residents are unable to approach their MLA while their key issues remain unresolved. Not only this, Sandhu never visited his constituency to meet his people and for the residents, he is just a ‘missing person,” Joshi alleged. He added that Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann were responsible for lack of development in the area. “Was it not Kejriwal's duty to ensure that the Kharar MLA was present at every moment for service of the people?” Joshi questioned. He alleged that AAP was not pursuing ‘a policy of change’ but ‘politics of revenge’, which is why the party had now chosen a singer from Mansa as the next candidate from Kharar. “You and Anmol Gagan Mann will have to answer as to why she and her family left Mansa district and why she has been made a candidate from Kharar constituency. Also, you will have to explain about your old relationship with Anmol”, Joshi asked Kejriwal. The BJP leader claimed that AAP did not have a single local leader and activist and that Kejriwal was forced to bring a singer from Mansa to Kharar even though she had nothing to do with Kharar and its residents. “Aren’t local leaders and AAP activists capable of contesting the elections?” Joshi asked Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-playing-politics-of-revenge-instead-of-politics-of-change/articleshow/87918497.cms||---

The deceased Kuchiben Dhanak, a resident of Lagami village, had gone to Mor Dungar forest region on Wednesday evening to take her goats for grazing. When she did not return till late at night, her family members and other residents of the village went out to search for her in the forest. Around midnight, Dhanak’s body was found with injuries on her forehead, abdomen and left leg. The villagers realized that Dhanak would have been attacked by a leopard, so they contacted the forest department. Senior forest officials visited the forest at night and shifted Dhanak’s body to the community health centre in Zoz for postmortem. On Thursday morning, two cages were placed in the region to rescue the leopard. “It may have been a possibility that the leopard may have confused the elderly woman for a goat or another animal and attacked her. We have already placed cages and initiated procedures to compensate the victim’s family members as per the government rules,” said a forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/leopard-mauls-old-woman-to-death/articleshow/87918041.cms||---

The exercise was conducted by the Southern Command of the Indian Army to fine-tune the model of integrated theatre commands. In a war situation, all three wings of the army striking better coordination can demolish the enemy. Clouds of dust, the grumbling of tanks, bomb explosions, sounds of firing, movement of fighter planes and helicopters gave the sight of a war area. For the first time, space technology and artificial intelligence had been included. Army’s T-90 tanks, T-72 tanks, BPM, missiles, RCL guns, and other weapons foiled the pseudo whereabouts of the enemies. Fighter planes of the Indian airforce, including Su 30, jaguar, fighter helicopter Rudra, cheetah, MI 17, and Dhruva demonstrated a war-like situation in the exercise and took flight. Army chief MM Narwane, Southern Command GoC-in-chief Lt Gen JS Nain, Lt Gen Rakesh Kapoor, and air officer commanding-in-chief South Western Air Command (SWAC) air marshal Vikram Singh were present during the drill. On Friday, the drill will end with around 400 paratroopers para jumping and through parachutes showing how an assault vehicle is landed in the war area. In this pseudo-war area, the Indian army got the information that the enemy had entered into the Indian area and the enemy making bunkers at places had seized the area after which the army and the airforce with coordinated efforts surrounded the entire area with the Indian army’s armed, infantry, artillery and fighter planes from all the four sides. The T90 and BMP of the Indian army were moving ahead in the enemy’s area and tanks were firing mortars and the infantry moving on their knees and gave a wonderful demonstration. The army jawans crawling on the sand were firing on the enemy’s whereabouts and were demolishing the bunkers of the enemy and firing flares in the air were giving the information of the victory and seized the bunkers of the enemy shouting encouraging slogans. The fighter planes and lightweight helicopters of the Indian air force were bombarding the enemy due to which infantry was moving ahead. The latest technique is being used in this war exercise especially the drone has been made part of this exercise. Integrated battlegroups have been included in this war exercise. The Indian army was preparing to test it for the last three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/army-airforce-take-part-in-war-games-to-enhance-coordination/articleshow/87918514.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Swarnim Vijay Mashaal to reach CAC today||Prayagraj: Central Air Command (CAC) on Friday would relive the glorious past of its contribution in winning the battle for the nation against Pakistan in 1971 with the Swarnim Vijay Mashaal (victory torch) reaching CAC. The mashaal was lit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the War Memorial on Dec 16, 2020. Talking to TOI, the defence public relation officer (PRO), Prayagraj, Group Captain Samir Suresh Gangakhedkar said, “The liberation of Bangladesh is a proud chapter in the history of CAC. The birth of Bangladesh in 1971 owes a lot to air operations as the political situation on the subcontinent deteriorated, the Indian Air Force (IAF) was alerted to the possibility of another armed conflict. On November 22, 1971, an aerial interception battle, called ‘Battle of Boyra’ was fought between IAF and intruding Pakistani Air Force (PAF) jets that had crossed into Indian airspace by giving cover to its ground forces.” He further informed that a detachment of four Gnats of 22 Sqn intercepted the PAF aircraft. The pilots ejected over Boyra and were made prisoners of war (POW) by Indian forces. The battle of Boyra took place before the formal start of Indo-Pak war of 1971. Gp Capt Gangakhedkar further informed that on the evening of December 3, 1971 (at 5:45pm), Pakistan launched a pre-emptive air strike at Indian Air fields of Amritsar, Srinagar, Awantipur, Pathankot, Uttarlai, Jodhpur, Ambala and Agra. India was fully geared up to respond and went into action on the same light. The IAF continued operations at an unprecedented pace of over 500 sorties per day. As the Indian Army progressed forward in the East Pakistan, the IAF continued with its attack against Pakistan targets as the campaign developed into a series of anti-airfield, anti-radar and close-support attacks by the fighter jets with night attacks against airfields and strategic targets by Mig 21s, Canberras and AN-12s. “Transport and airlift operations were handled by the three C-47 Dakota Sqns, two Antonov-12, one DHC Caribou, one DHC-3 Otter and one C-119 Packet Sqn augmented from Western, Central and Eastern commands and based at Jorhat, Guwahati, Barrackpore and Dum Dum during December 3-16, 1971,” informed the official. Gp Capt Gangakhedkar also shared an interesting incident wherein the Governor of East Pakistan had to resign following the action by IAF fighters. “On the morning of December 14, a message was intercepted by the Indian Intelligence concerning a high-level meeting of the civil and administration in East Pakistan. A decision was then made to mount an attack. Within 15 minutes of the interception of the message, a strike was launched against Dhaka. Armed with tourist guides map of the city, four Mig 21s of 28 Sqn became airborne. Only a few minutes had passed after the meeting had started when the IAF aircraft blasted the governor’s house with 57mm rockets, ripping the massive roof off the main hall and turning the building into a smouldering wreck,” he informed. AH Malik, the then governor of East Pakistan, was so shocked after the incident that he resigned on the spot by writing his resignation on a piece of paper, thereby renouncing all ties with the West Pakistani administration, recalls the official. “The December 1971 war also witnessed the gaining of India’s highest award for gallantry to the IAF Flying Officer Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon, flying Gnats with number 18 Sqn from Srinagar. In the fight that ensued, he secured hits on one PAF Sabre and damaged another. He was posthumously awarded the prestigious Param Vir Chakra,” informed the PRO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/swarnim-vijay-mashaal-to-reach-cac-today/articleshow/87919025.cms||---

General secretary of All India Port and Dock Workers Federation, D K Sarma, expressed serious concern on the implementation of the Major Port Authorities Act, 2021, and the repealing of the Major Port Trust Act, 1963. “We strongly believe that the intention of the present enactment is to convert the major ports as companies and subsequently entrust it to the hands of ‘private cartels’ as has been done in several public sector undertakings in the country. It is our considered opinion that the present enactment has been created by the bureaucrats with clear intention of seeking opportunities after their retirement,” Sarma said. The present enactment does not provide concrete decisions with regard to job security, protection of existing service conditions including pension liabilities. The procedure to be evolved for nomination of labour trustees in the authority board has also not yet been discussed with the federations as assured, he said. President of the federation, P M Mohammed Haneef said, “The rules are being finalised unilaterally though the federation was assured that while formulating the rules, the implementation process of the enactment, particularly relating to labour, would be discussed with the federation before its final conclusion. These assurances given by the ministry have not been honoured so far even after repeated requests made by the federations, individually and jointly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/workers-of-major-ports-threaten-indefinite-strike/articleshow/87918554.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case panch: Forced to sign some papers, says witness||MUMBAI: A panch witness in the cruise drugs bust case had submitted an affidavit before the special NDPS Act court alleging on October 5, an officer of the Narcotics Control Bureau had forced him to sign some papers and threatened him that if he refused, he would face dire consequences. In an affidavit submitted through advocate Ajay Bhise on Wednesday, the witness, Sonu Maske, alleged an officer had threatened him saying, “You don’t know, we are police officers and will take you to the lock-up and you will not come out for a long time.”  The witness said he was recently summoned by the NCB but did not want to go. “The present affidavit may kindly be considered as my volunteer statement is free from any threats, coercion and without any influence depicting true and correct events about the alleged seizure panchanama,” the witness said. Maske is purported to be a panch witness during the raid at the Powai flat of accused Aachit Kumar on October 5. Out on bail now, Kumar was held on October 6 on the basis of the now-retracted statement of Aryan Khan and the alleged WhatsApp chats. Some 2.6gm of ganja was allegedly recovered from his Powai flat. Maske works as a facility manager in Kumar’s apartment complex. He said after he was repeatedly forced to go to the flat along with another staff member, they were asked to sign some papers. “They did not allow us to read what was written in the papers and shouted at me that we can’t wait for you to read this as we are already getting very late. They asked us to sign four papers written in Hindi...,” the affidavit said. Maske said they were then asked to sign a few blank papers to which they strongly objected. The affidavit said he was threatened with false implication. “The panch witness apprehends the NCB, Mumbai, may record my statement against my wish...and further the applicant is under constant threat of false implication in the criminal case by the NCB, Mumbai...,” his plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cruise-drugs-case-panch-forced-to-sign-some-papers/articleshow/87919026.cms||Rebecca Samervel

One of the elephants also delivered a calf three days ago. Conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar confirmed to TOI the herd travelled around 50km through Malegaon forests to reach Wadsa on Saturday (November 20). “One of the elephants also delivered a calf three days ago. We learned about the newborn calf from the placenta found in a paddy field,” said Mankar. The placenta is a large organ that develops during pregnancy. It is attached to the wall of the uterus, usually at the top or side. The umbilical cord connects the placenta to the baby. The placenta is expelled from the body after the baby is born. Mankar said the reports of a calf born to an elephant earlier in Dhanora-Murumgaon were rumours. There were already two baby elephants in the herd when they entered Gadchiroli. As of now, the elephants are not harming humans but the herd is feeding on rice straw lying on the fields after harvest of the crop. There are also bamboo clusters in the forest on which the animals depend. Sagnik Sengupta of Stripes And Green Earth (SAGE) Foundation, West Bengal, an NGO working for elephant conservation, said the gestation period of an elephant is 19-20 months, which means the animal was already pregnant and delivered here. “The herd is not going to move anywhere from Wadsa till the baby elephant is strong enough to walk with the herd,” said Sengupta. The herd of 22 elephants entered Gadchiroli from Chhattisgarh on October 18. According to forest officials the herd has been wandering for the past seven years. “Through our discussions with forest officials of other states, it is learned that these elephants moved out of Odisha in 2014 and travelled through Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh before entering Maharashtra,” they said. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said elephants have staged a comeback in Gadchiroli after 56 years. A book ‘Janglachi Waat’ penned by ex-PCCF Dr Anand Maslekar, mentions a herd of seven elephants had reached Gadchiroli after crossing Odisa and Madhya Pradesh (now Chhattisgarh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadchiroli-elephants-move-50km-to-wadsa-a-calf-born-3-days-ago/articleshow/87918506.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

However, the promise is yet to be fulfilled even after two years. The bad condition of the road leading to the UNESCO World Heritage Site via Sillod has been drawing ire from the tourism sector as some of the tourists allegedly skip Ajanta Caves from their itinerary to avoid the wastage of time. Upset over this, eminent personalities from different fields have now taken to Twitter to express outrage against the poor condition of the road. Industrialist Mansingh Pawar, who has expressed his anguish over the micro-blogging site, said, it took over two hours to cover only 60-km distance between Aurangabad and Sillod, and over three hours and fifteen minutes to reach Ajanta Caves, which are located only 100 km away from Aurangabad. “The road condition is pathetic. With current speed, it will take several months to finish the road work, causing hardship to tourists and locals,” he said. Jaswant Singh, the founder president of the advocacy group Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation, said that it was an irony that other road workers are being completed in record time, but the one connecting to the Ajanta caves is being neglected for months. “The pathetic condition of the road has been affecting tourist footfall at Ajanta Caves for the past three years. Well, before the Covid outbreak hit the local tourism industry, the bad road to Ajanta Caves had started inflicting damage as many tour operators had started skipping the site due to time constraints. Prashant Auti, a senior official from the public works department said, a major portion of the road work was already over. “There was a certain delay in getting clearance from the forest department for road work on the 5-km stretch. Besides, land acquisition is also a hurdle for completing another stretch of 8 km,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gadkaris-promise-to-construct-road-to-ajanta-still-unfulfilled/articleshow/87917037.cms||Prasad Joshi

The suspension order signed by SP headquarters Manoj Meena said that sub-inspector Kamal Pal Singh had been placed under suspension with immediate effect and would be posted at Police Lines in Sector 26. Sources said the police department received a complaint against Kamal Pal Singh, who was deployed at the Police Establish Branch (PEB) of police headquarters in Sector 9 for allegedly demanding money from people of the rank of constable to sub-inspectors for their transfers and postings in different police wings. After verifying facts, SP headquarters suspended Kamal Pal Singh on Wednesday. Former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore launched an automatic placement software for transfers and postings of police officials up to sub-inspector rank at Punjab Raj Bhawan in September 2018. The aim was to bring about transparency and to minimise human interference in transfers and postings. The software was designed to transfer police personnel who had spent more than two years at one posting automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cop-suspended-probe-launched/articleshow/87918518.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Only 9 state transport buses ply across Marathwada||Aurangabad: A day after the state government offered a fresh deal to the agitating Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, only nine buses plied across Marathwada on Thursday. The buses concerned witnessed operation on Aurangabad-Pune route carrying 328 passengers. A total of 347 buses witnessed operations across Maharashtra till 5 pm, implying hesitancy among staffers to resume duties immediately. As per the official data, only 9,705 employees rejoined work on Thursday while 82,561 were still absent.  Shrirang Barge, the general secretary of Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress, said the agitating employees were demanding a merger of the State Transportation and not any meagre salary hike as announced by the government. “Moreover, the salary revision is not in keeping with the seniority and experience. It has caused further outrage among employees,” he said.  A senior MSRTC official said many employees were likely to resume work in the next 24 hours because of the fresh offer from the government. “Even if the attendance was low today (Thursday), we expect it to increase further. It will result in an increased number of bus operations,” he said on condition of anonymity.  The regional unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which staged a hunger strike on Wednesday to express solidarity with MSRTC employees, said the state government should ensure the merger of the State Transportation at the earliest. “The salary hike offered by the government is a mere eyewash. It is an attempt to divert attention from the main demand of the merger,” said AAP Marathwada convener Sugriv Munde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/only-9-state-transport-buses-ply-across-marathwada/articleshow/87917026.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Female sterilisation dips in Maharashtra, condom use up||MUMBAI: While total fertility rate (TFR) average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime is dipping across the country, data from the National Family Health Survey-5 shows female sterilisation is the most common method of contraception. While female sterilisation increased in most states -- from 49.4% to 57.8% in Tamil Nadu and from 20.7% to 34.8% in Bihar – Maharashtra posted a slight drop from 50.7% to 49.1%. In Mumbai, the island city followed the national trend of more sterilisation (up from 36% to 47%) while the suburbs saw a drop (43.5% to 37.5%). BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said male participation in family planning has always been a problem in India. “With regards to Mumbai, a few men opted for sterilization, but their numbers are low,” she said. The traditionally low turnout for male sterilization has dropped further since the Centre stopped the cash incentive and started offering an account transfer. Dr Gomare said it is, however, clear from Mumbai’s low birth rate that most couples have adopted contraception. The big development in NFHS-5 is a drop in India's TFR to 2% -- lower than replacement level (at which the population replaces itself from one generation to the next) of 2.1%. In Maharashtra, TFR is 1.7%. As per NFHS-5, 74% of couples practice contraception as against 59.6% (NFHS-4). Some of it is linked to condom use. Couples who adopted condoms rose from 5.6% (NFHS-4) in 2015 to 9.6% (NFHS-5). In Maharashtra too, it increased from 7.1% to 10.2%.But the heavy lifting is still done by women the percentage which underwent tubal ligation rose from 36% in 2015 to 37.9% in 2019. “While increase in use of modern contraceptive methods is heartening, an increase in female sterilisation coupled with continued stagnation in male sterilisation uptake shows the onus of family planning still lies with women,'' said Population Foundation of India's Poonam Muttreja. “While use of condoms has increased, its uptake continues to be low,” she added. NFHS is done by the Union health ministry using a representative sample of households. Deonar-based International Institute for Population Sciences serves as the nodal agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-female-sterilisation-dips-in-maha-condom-use-up/articleshow/87919040.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Chandigarh||Take strong stand against ads offering floor-wise sale: HC tells UT||Times News Network Chandigarh: Dismissing a petition filed by RWA, Sector 10 challenging share-wise transfer of properties, the division bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri, in their detailed order passed on November 23, said, “It would be a matter of concern whether such home buyers who has purchased a share in a residential building and pursuant thereto has been put into possession of a particular floor/specific portion understands that he cannot assert exclusive ownership to such floor/specific portion. Does he understand that by virtue of purchase of a share he has only become a co-owner/co-sharer in the entire building to the extent of his shareholding? Does he understand that in the eventuality of a dispute arising between the co-sharers/co-owners the only remedy would be to put the property to auction and the sale proceeds thereafter to be distributed amongst the co-sharers/co-owners as fragmentation/division of the building by metes and bounds is specifically prohibited? In our view most home buyers/vendees do not.” The order further reads, “This Court had discovered as many as 24 advertisements for floor-wise sale in the newspaper dated July 25. The same were incorporated in our order dated July 27. Surely such like advertisements spread over a period of time would be manifold. The Administration chooses to stay smug, taking a stand on paper that floor-wise sale of residential buildings is not permissible while residential floors are being advertised for sale right under its nose. In an affidavit of the Assistant Estate Officer duly placed on record it has been deposed that the Administration would take steps to issue an advertisement in the local newspapers to warn the general public against unverified advertisements with regard to sale of immovable property and to request them to conduct proper due diligence. Be that as it may, it stands conceded that no such public notice has been issued till date”. Certain proactive steps are required to be taken to protect home buyers, the order stated, directing Chandigarh administration to take requisite steps. In an inadvertant mistake, the headline of the report on the HC judgment in the local Chandigarh pullout in TOI edition dated Nov 24, 2021 wrongly mentioned that the court had cleared floor-wise sale. The error was inadvertent and is regretted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/take-strong-stand-against-ads-offering-floor-wise-sale-hc-tells-ut/articleshow/87918532.cms||---

The survey showed 35.5% children below five years of age in the country were stunted and 19.3% in the same age group were wasted. Corresponding numbers in NFHS-4 were 38.4% and 21%. In Maharashtra, where officials said incidence of malnutrition had dropped drastically a decade years back, stunting affected 35.2% of the under-five population and 25.6% were wasted. In Mumbai, incidence of wasting has remained constant (25%) while stunting has drastically increased in the suburban region from 21.3% in 2015 to 37.2%. A social worker with a grassroot level NGO in the city said migrant children are the worst affected due to improper access to government’s nutritional support programmes. A study published in Economic and Political Weekly in February 2019, quoted a SNEHA (Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action) representative saying: “The nutrition mission set up in Maharashtra has not been much active and its focus is limited to rural areas. Though ICDS centres (Integrated Child Development Scheme) have been mostly extended to informal settlements also, quality remains a big concern. Also in urban areas, these centers do not measure height of children, as a part of growth monitoring. Thus tracking of child malnutrition, which is an important job of ICDS centers, remains partial’.

The minister was on official tour of Latur where he inaugurated completed road works and laid foundation of new roads worth Rs 1,020 crore. Constructed near Mauje Maslaga village, the 111 meter-long and 16 meter-wide bridge is constructed using Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC), said a social media post from the office of Nitin Gadkari. “Instead of iron bars that are traditionally used in construction works, the UHPFRC technology involves the use of girder made of steel fibre, which increases the strength of the bridge. These girders are light in weigh and can be easily handled at the construction site, ensuring speedy constructions,” it was said. Stating that the technology concerned offers saving in the range of 15% to 25%, authorities said the related constructions are robust, rust-proof and resistant to water and carbon. “The technology is eco-friendly and sustainable in nature and is used in other countries for last many years to ensure construction of bridges having longer life. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre has adopted sustainable and latest technologies in all the fields. As a part of it, the use of new technology has begun in construction of bridges in India,” it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gadkari-inspects-unique-bridge-built-in-latur/articleshow/87917073.cms||---

The airport-like facilities would be provided on the lines of Rani Kamlapati Railway Station of Bhopal, which was recently equipped with international-level facilities and inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Besides, three more railway stations of the North Central Railway (NCR) zone, including Kanpur Central, Gwalior and Agra Cantt, would also be revamped in the state, and passengers would be able to avail facilities as provided at any airport of the country. “Earlier, the work of revamping the facilities at railway stations was entrusted to the Indian Railway Development Corporation (IRDC), which was dissolved a few months back. Following this, the revamp work would be done in the respective zones under which Prayagraj and Kanpur Central would be revamped under Prayagraj division of NCR, Agra Cantt under Agra division and Gwalior Junction under Jhansi division,” said chief public relation officer (CPRO), NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma. For providing airport-like facilities, the Prayagraj division has started the process by issuing a tender on Thursday. The revamp would cost around Rs 400-crore, he added. The plan to make Prayagraj Junction a world-class station was conceptualised in the year 2018 itself, but due to Kumbh in 2019 and later the pandemic no work was done. Now, the NCR administration has made preparations to equip both these stations with state-of-the-art facilities. Under the revamp plan, work will be taken up by the Railways on both the sides of the Junction, i.e., City side and Civil Lines side. By constructing a multi-storey building here, the facility of lodging, food and shopping of essential items will be provided under one roof. During this, routes for the arrival and departure of passengers will be made according to the trains and route. This arrangement will also facilitate the passengers during the Kumbh Mela. The number of lifts and escalators at the junction will also be increased. A modern waiting room will be constructed on the Civil Lines side along with the City side of the junction. Construction of dormitories with a capacity of about 100 passengers, ATVMs, etc., will also be arranged for the purchase of ordinary tickets on all the platforms. Construction of pickup and drop point lanes on both sides, prepaid taxi booths and vehicle parking with modern facilities will also be made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/prayagraj-kanpur-junctions-to-have-world-class-facilities-soon/articleshow/87919046.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Spousal violence in Maharashtra rises, but still below national average||MUMBAI: Instances of spousal violence increased in Maharashtra over the past five years, even as cases reduced in at least six major states including Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Nationally too, spousal violence has reduced from 31.2% in 2015-16 to 29.3% in 2019-21. Data released by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) shows spousal violence, for women between 18 and 49 years age, increased in Maharashtra from 21.3% in 2015-16 to over 25% in 2019-20. Activists also say that the state government is not doing enough in such cases. "When there is an increase in poverty, there is bound to be domestic tension due to lack of resources. Marginalised or weaker sections in the household, which is typically women, will get affected even more, as they already don’t have power," said activist Sandhya Gokhale. The state does not provide a temporary shelter for victims of violence. "Younger women living on streets are more likely to be exposed to violence...the One Stop Crisis Centres, intended to support women affected by violence in private and public spaces, bank largely on non-profit groups for funding. To give women the ability to fight back violence, the government needs to strengthen them first," Gokhale added. Lack of empowerment could also be linked to spousal violence. NFHS data for Maharashtra shows women earning in cash after being employed for at least a year and women operating bank accounts of their own have increased over the past five years though figures for Maharashtra are lower than for comparable states like UP, TN and Punjab. "These are indicators showing some positive change. But whenever a woman shows a step towards independence even in a small way, we may also see an increase in violence. Her husband or partner may inflict more physical violence or deprive her access to her children," said activist Priti Patkar, co-founder of the non-profit Prerana. Among younger women in Maharashtra, instances of sexual violence being experienced by the age of 18 rose from 2.9% in 2015-16 to 6.2% in 2019-20. "Violence against women is inflicted typically by people known to her and rarely by strangers," said Gokhale. "Through an RTI application, we found that numerous victims of sexual violence could not avail the benefits of the Manodhairya scheme. This is because police show little interest. If a woman has changed her location post facing violence, the police may declare that she is untraceable," added Gokhale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spousal-violence-in-state-rises-but-still-below-national-average/articleshow/87919051.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC junks plea of two honour killing accused||HYDERABAD: Justice Kanneganti Lalitha of the Telangana high court (HC) dismissed the bail pleas of two accused in the Chinta Hemanth Kumar honour killing case of last year. Asserting that setting the accused free at this stage could derail the probe, T Swetcha, counsel for the aggrieved wife D Avanthi Reddy, argued against providing any relief to the accused since they had even gone to the extent of threatening Hemanth’s mother with dire consequences. “If they are out now, it will have an impeding effect on the trial,” Swetcha said. The judge agreed with her contention and dismissed the bail pleas of the two accused. Hemanth (28) was brutally murdered on September 25, 2020 by a group of 18 persons, among whom included some hired killers. According to the prosecution, unable to accept the love marriage of Avanthi with Hemanth, an interior designer, the accused killed the latter. Police booked criminal cases against Avanthi’s parents and relatives along with the hired killers. A fast-track court was set up and a schedule for trial was also released. Conveying the resolve of the state government to deal sternly with honour killing cases, additional public prosecutor J Sridevi told the court that the fast-track court was set up to complete the trial expeditiously and to deliver justice. The trial court fixed the schedule of the trial, which would commence on December 29 and conclude on February 14, 2022. “The high court had earlier asked us to complete the trial in a speedier manner,” she said. While Avanthi is a Reddy, Hemanth belonged to the Vysya community. They fell in love but could not obtain the consent of their parents. They got married at Qutbullapur sub-registrar office on June 10, 2020. Avanthi’s relatives kidnapped her and Hemanth and took them to outskirts. Avanthi managed to escape but Hemanth was hacked to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-plea-of-two-honour-killing-accused/articleshow/87918545.cms||---

His opponents too could not muster the required two-third strength to remove him from the post. Both Congress and Amarinder camps claimed victory even as Punjab minister Brahm Mohindra announced Bittu’s suspension saying a notice of no-confidence signed by 40 councillors was sent to the mayor but he moved a motion to prove his majority in the House. In the House of 61, Bittu needed 31 votes for a majority. “He got only 25 votes, in his favour, which means he lost the confidence. He stands suspended and the senior deputy mayor will take over from him,” Mohindra said. However, Amarinder said the main agenda was the no-confidence motion against the mayor, which had been defeated. as those opposing him failed to get two-third majority. On Mohindra’s announcement of suspending the mayor, Amarinder said that if need be, his group will move court. To oversee Bittu’s removal, Congress had deputed Mohindra – who like Amarinder also had a vote in the municipal corporation by virtue of being a legislator from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/setback-for-captain-in-first-post-cong-outing-as-aide-loses/articleshow/87920013.cms||---

The ‘S’ curve, which falls near Mata Sundri Gurdwara in Sector 70, Mohali just ahead of Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara towards Kharar on Airport Road, has claimed many lives. Sources said Punjab chief minister has approached Mata Sundri Gurdwara sect head Baba Balbir Singh to allow Gmada to straighten the ‘S’ curve. However, sources also said that the talks remained inconclusive. Baba Balbir Singh said, “No such call was received as yet but if the CM approaches us, we may rethink to find a solution to the problem.” In 2010, when the road was to be constructed, Gmada approached Baba and he agreed to shift his gurdwara but later backed out. So, Gmada constructed the road with ‘S’ curve at this juncture. In January this year, Mohali traffic police installed rumble strips with the help of Gmada on the S-curve to prevent fatal accidents on the stretch. A comprehensive study on road safety analysis and identification of accident prone areas in Mohali revealed it to have the second highest number of road accident deaths in the state. The report also stated that the most prone was the Airport Road in Mohali, which, according to a study, has major flaws in design and engineering, proving that the road is not pedestrian and cyclist friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-tries-to-straighten-mohalis-deadly-s-curve/articleshow/87918549.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Kundra was arrested earlier this July in another case registered by the Mumbai crime branch, also under the provisions of the Information Technology Act. He was granted bail by court in September. The HC bench of Justice Nitin Sambre rejected six pre-arrest bail pleas after hearing their lawyers, including senior counsel Shirish Gupte and advocates Sudeep Pasbola and Sudatta Patil and also the prosecutor, Rutuja Ambekar, who opposed their pleas. The HC, however, continued the interim protection against arrest for all, by four weeks. The HC will give its reasoned order later.

---||Hyderabad||Pay Rs 3.7 crore aid to 9 Palamuru project-displaced: NGT to Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: THE NGT-appointed joint committee has awarded Rs 3.7 crore compensation to a Kadapa resident and eight others to be paid by Telangana irrigation department for dumping debris of Palamuru Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS) in various locations and displacing the local people. The committee said the construction of the LI project was going on in full scale in violation of environment rules and that muck excavated from the tunnels was being dumped without following the green norms. “At Narlapur reservoir site, the muck excavated from the tunnel is dumped nearby without following any environment management plan. A similar situation is found in other reservoirs like Yedula, Vattem, Karivena and Uddandapur,” the committee said. The government, in its project proponent, had said the muck would be utilised as a construction material and that the dump was only temporary. The Telangana government is constructing PRLIS to lift 90 tmc of floodwater from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir at a cost of Rs 35,200 crore. The mega project on Krishna river is intended to provide drinking water to 1,226 villages in 70 mandals, Hyderabad city, irrigation facilities to 12.30 lakh acres and water for industrial use in Nagarkurnool, Mahbubnagar, Narayanpet, Vikarabad, Rangareddy and Nalgonda districts. The joint committee recalled that the Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) had accorded the terms of reference to the project proponent in 2017 only for carrying out pre-construction activities. “However, construction is going on in total violation of the environment rules,” it said. The National Green Tribunal, Chennai, had constituted the committee comprising officials of MoEF, Central Pollution Control Board, geology and mining department, NEERI, district collector of Mahbubnagar and Central Water Commission experts, besides a member of KRMB following a complaint from Kadapa resident D Chandramouleswara Reddy and eight others against PRLIS.  The committee said: “Construction activities are being carried out for creating a full 90 tmc ft capacity. While the project proponent said it was a drinking water project, we are of the view that Palamuru Rangareddy project is conceived as an irrigation scheme to lift 90 tmc of floodwater in 60 days from Srisailam reservoir.” It also said: “A huge amount of earthen/rock materials is excavated and dumped in various locations. Dumping of excavated materials and stabilisation of overburdened dumps are not carried out properly, especially along the river side.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-rs-3-7cr-aid-to-9-palamuru-project-displaced-ngt-to-t/articleshow/87918553.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||HC extends stay on arrest of trainee IAS||Hyderabad: Faced with a case and a counter case in the alleged rape and cheating case involving a trainee IAS officer, the Telangana high court on Thursday adjourned the case to two weeks for ascertaining truth in the cases with the help of scientific reports from the forensic laboratory. Justice K Lalitha was dealing with a petition filed by trainee IAS officer B Mrugender, who was seeking an anticipatory bail in a case booked against him by Kukatpally police. A complaint was lodged against Mrugender by a woman who alleged that he had cheated her after promising to marry her. The judge, while extending the stay on Mrugender’s arrest for the next 15 days, however, asked him to cooperate with the investigators during this period. Reports of medical tests conducted on the trainee officer would also come in the next fortnight. In the meantime, Devineni Radha Rani, counsel for Mrugender, brought to notice of the court case filed by Mrugender’s family against woman in a cyber crime police station. She was facing allegations of using WhatsApp and other social media platforms to defame women of his family. Accordingly, police informed court that they have sent her phone to the FSL for ascertaining the truth. Visarat Ali, assistant public prosecutor, said SC clearly said that when the promise of marriage was broken, even evidence related to live-in relationship cannot save perpetrator from rape charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-extends-stay-on-arrest-of-trainee-ias/articleshow/87918558.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Imported liquor MRP down by 36% as Maharashtra government halves excise duty||MUMBAI: After Maharashtra government halved excise duty on imported liquor few days back, actual price reduction on bottles of some brands was 31-36%. This, explained excise officials, was because of a compounded (or tax on tax) tax structure wherein excise duty is calculated on the Centre’s Customs duty and on the derived price, a VAT is loaded. Though initially only four brands received approval to their MRP, few more major brands are yet to come up with applications with a final price list for their products, said excise commissioner Kantilal Umap. Slashing excise duty on this premium AlcoBev segment by a steep 50% from 300% to 150% in an attempt to crack down on smuggling and bootlegging has made 750 ml bottled-in-origin (BIO) spirits cheaper. “A Johnny Walker Black Label would cost Rs5,760; now it will be Rs3,750 for a bottle of 750ml. This is a reduction of about 35%. In the case of Red Label the reduction is 36%. For the other two brands the reduction is around 31%,” excise officials explained. International Spirits and Wine Association of India (ISWAI) has hailed the tax cut decision by Maharashtra government, saying that it was nothing but a recognition for the emerging bottled-in-origin (BIO) spirits of premium quality. ISWAI said the decision will significantly curtail illicit and spurious liquor and smuggling of AlcoBev (e.g scotch whisky) products, besides bringing in price rationalisation and price parity with other states. ISWAI CEO Nita Kapoor said these industry-friendly progressive policy change would improve tax compliance, eliminate grey market and inter-state smuggling, increasing state revenue collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-imported-liquor-mrp-down-by-36-as-state-halves-excise-duty/articleshow/87919072.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The man had been known to family for past 10 years and they relied on his advice, Chandrayangutta cops said. The two sisters, aged 32 and 22, were allegedly victimised over the last three years by the accused man (55) and son (25). The ‘black magician’ has two wives. Family was introduced to the accused around 10 years ago by their uncle who had taken the sisters’ ill mother to him for treatment. After the mother felt healed, the whole family began visiting him for health problems. After the elder sister got divorced a few years ago and also faced health issues, the accused suggested a few remedies and advised them to sell the house. Cops said that the ‘black magician’ later engineered a rift within the family, leading to the mother and two sisters living in Bandlaguda, while the father and brother moved to another house. The accused is alleged to have lured the sister under various pretexts and raped her multiple times. On at least one occasion, his son is accused of raping the younger sister at her house. A complaint was lodged by the sisters and police booked accused under IPC sections 376, 420, 506 and Drugs & Magic Remedies Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/black-magician-son-held-for-raping-sisters/articleshow/87918569.cms||---

Sameer was arrested in Bulandshahr on Thursday and all four brothers have been booked under charges of murder, which was committed using the licensed rifle of the main accused. The other three brothers are absconding. A video of the act went viral on social media. It shows a woman running out of Irfan's house as loud gunshots can be heard in the background. Neighbours were seen pleading with the accused to not fire. Two of the four brothers could be seen firing from the rifle while standing near the main gate, while two were on top of the terrace. “The incident left many in shock. Those living in the same lane couldn’t gather the courage to open doors or come out of their homes until the police arrived at the spot,” said an eyewitness who does not wish to be named. Amar Singh, the station house officer (SHO) of the Agouta police station, under whose jurisdiction the crime took place, said that the four accused first fired bullets at Irfan, who died on the spot, and then at his cousin, Imran (goes by his first name only), who received a bullet injury on his leg. He was rushed to the hospital and is now out of danger. “We have booked all four brothers, Mohd Sameer, Mohd Shaquib, Mohd Shahid, and one other for murder and rioting,” the SHO added. The name of the fourth brother has not been mentioned in the FIR and police are trying to ascertain the same. The senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, said that Irfan and his family used to run a barbershop and also gave home salon services. The brothers had asked Irfan to give them a haircut but he refused, asking them to clear their previous dues first. “An infuriated Sameer shot Irfan and brother Imran with his rifle,” the SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-3-brothers-kill-barber-after-he-refused-to-give-them-a-haircut/articleshow/87917741.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath brings up ‘ganna’ and Jinnah to target opposition||JEWAR/LUCKNOW: The election theme ran through the foundation stone ceremony of the Noida International Airport on Thursday with chief minister Yogi Adityanath speaking to the western UP constituency from the stage, bringing up ganna (sugarcane), danga (riots) and Jinnah during his 10-minute address. “Aaj yeh desh ke saamne yeh dwand bana hai, ki desh ganne ki mithas ko ek nayi udaan dega ya Jinnah ke anuyayion se phir danga karane ki shararat karwayega. Aur yahi tai karne ke liye main swayam aapke beech upasthit hua hun (Today, the country has to decide whether it wants to give new wings to the sweetness of sugarcane here or allow the followers of Jinnah to commit the mischief of triggering riots. I’m here to help make that decision),” he told the gathering. The CM was taking a swipe both at the Samajwadi government for its failure to contain the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 in the cane belt of western UP as well as its leader and his main rival Akhilesh Yadav, who had recently referenced Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Adityanath said though local farmers were striving to improve the quality of their sugarcane produce, some people “created disharmony intentionally to make the cane produce bitter”. The CM listed the work his government has done for Gautam Budh Nagar district and said he was grateful to thousands of farmers who gave up their land for the project. The ‘ganna versus Jinnah’ narrative had earlier come up in 2018 during the Kairana Lok Sabha bypoll campaign but it was RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary who had at that time accused BJP of being more concerned about Jinnah than ‘ganna’ after objections were raised to photos of Jinnah at Aligarh Muslim University. While Yogi had then retorted by enumerating the work done by his government for cane farmers, this time, the chief minister is losing no opportunity to fire repeated salvos at the principal opposition party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-brings-up-ganna-and-jinnah-to-target-oppn/articleshow/87919552.cms||Shalabh
---||Aurangabad||Cops form message group of religious heads in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad city police have formed a group comprising religious leaders from across the communities on a popular instant messaging app to ensure their support to maintain communal harmony. The city police recently received praise from state police headquarters for ensuring peace, even when at least three places in the state witnessed large scale violence and riots. Under the latest initiative, this group will not only bridge communication gap between religious leaders from across the communities, but it will also be used effectively to curb the menace of drug abuse, communal elements fuelling polarisation in the society. While confirming the development, commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta told TOI that the initiative is at its primary stage and police are reaching out to religious leaders from across the communities. He said, “The anti-social elements take advantage of the fact that there is lesser interaction, dialogue and exchange of ideas between religious leaders from different communities. Our move is aimed at addressing this issue.” The officer said that the group, in which he will also remain active, will not only be a two-way communication and but will also be used to address other issues like drug abuse. The officer said that though no specific name has been given to the group, it will have a name that conveys peace and harmony. Authorities said that the initiative is being instrumentalised through city police’s special branch. “The clerics will be able to alert about the rumours, messages aimed at malice as well as the ones hurting anyone’s religious beliefs. In return, through this group members, police will convey its messages from time to time to respective communities, clear air on rumours and also run awareness drives,” said special branch’s assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne. Maulana Naseem Miftai, Hafiz Iqbal Ansari amongst others, who attended a meeting with the commissioner of police on Thursday, welcomed the move and said that it will go a long way in addressing the issues faced by the city as well as the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-form-message-group-of-religious-heads-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87917101.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The state also said that as and when qualified people for the post are available, steps would be taken to promote them. The court was hearing the contempt petition filed by K R Raja, a social activist from Madurai district. The petitioner had earlier filed a PIL seeking for a direction to fill up vacancies of 24 additional superintendents of prisons and 12 social workers in all central prisons. The court asked the authorities to look into the matter and bestow their attention so that the posts can be filled up as vacancies not only affects the prison administration but also causes difficulty to the prisoners as they are unable to meet their counsels when they fix the prison visit. Vacancies to the post also cause difficulties when orders are passed for parole and ordinary leave.

---||Meerut||Nexus between cop, criminals and arms dealers comes to light as 400 cartridges seized in Meerut||Meerut: Police in Meerut have seized around 400 cartridges, including the prohibited 0.303 bore, in a surprise raid at Ruhasa village in Daurala block. Cops have booked eight persons, out of which two, brothers Shabi Akhtar and Razi Akhtar, have been arrested. Six others are at large, three of them being women. Preliminary investigations showed that one of the accused allegedly purchased the bullets of the prohibited bore from a UP police constable. According to police sources, the name of the constable who is alleged to have provided the live bullets is Zaheen Ahmad, who is also a resident of Ruhasa village but is posted elsewhere. The duo arrested said he sold 23 bullets of the prohibited 0.303 bore for Rs 5,000. The seized consignment includes 208 live bullets (12 bore), 127 empty cartridges (12 bore), 29 empty cartridges (0.315 bore), and 23 live bullets (prohibited 0.303 bore). These were seized along with one rifle, one countrymade gun, two countrymade pistols, pellets weighing 6.5 kg, and equipment used to manufacture arms and ammunition. According to the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, "We arrested Shabi and Razi from the manufacturing unit. Shabi had earlier been booked for murder, dacoity, and rioting as well." A considerable number of factory-made bullets were also found from the site during the raid, police revealed. Narender Sharma, station house officer (SHO) of the Daurala police station said, "During interrogation, the two arrested men revealed that their main task is to fill the empty cartridges and sell them in the black market. They said the cartridges were sourced from one Ibrahim Ahmed, a resident of Lawad town in Meerut, for Rs 50,000." SSP Chaudhary blamed some arms shops for the sale of factory-made bullets that often enter the black market. "Some of these dealers sell bullets by taking advantage of loopholes in the bullet supply rules. They often end up in the hands of anti-social elements. We wish to plug these gaps. For instance, a weapon license holder from a different district who comes here and buys bullets is difficult to trace as he is not doing anything illegal. However, a few sinister dealings cannot be ruled out, in which the number of bullets sold on paper could be different from the actual," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/nexus-between-cop-criminals-and-arms-dealers-comes-to-light-as-400-cartridges-seized-in-meerut/articleshow/87917776.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Delhi||Taxiing to 2024: Delhi-NCR sets 2-airport course||DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for Noida International Airport (NIA), paving the way for Delhi-NCR to become the first megapolis in India to have two civilian airports for commercial flights by October 2024. The airport at Jewar will begin its journey with one runway and a terminal to handle 1.2 crore passengers annually at an investment of Rs 5,730 crore. It will, in subsequent phases, also have a multi-modal transit hub at its “ground transportation centre” – the first for any Indian airport – for seamless connectivity with metro, rapid rail and high-speed rail stations, taxi and bus services and private parking in a multi-level structure. Modi said NIA will be a “logistics gateway” to north India with a hub for multimodal transport. “Crores of people will benefit from this airport that was first thought of by a BJP government two decades back. After that, this project was almost shelved by subsequent governments both in Lucknow and Delhi. If the airport is delayed now, there is a provision for stiff fines (for the developer),” the PM said at the launch event for the project at the airport site. Depending on how traffic grows, three subsequent phases of expansion by winning bidder Zurich Airport International over a 40-year lease period will see NIA get two runways and as many terminals that will be able to handle 7 crore passengers annually, which is equivalent to Delhi’s IGI Airport’s pre-Covid (2019) capacity. IGIA, that began as Palam Airport in 1962, is still growing and will reach its peak capacity of 10-12 crore passengers annually before 2030. The UP government eventually wants six runways at the Noida airport. Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said NIA could eventually be bigger than Delhi’s IGI Airport (which will soon have four runways) and become India’s biggest aviation hub. “The airport will be ready in three years and change the lives of everyone in the region. It will be a massive boost to the economy in all spheres like agriculture, manufacturing, services and for all walks of society from small farmers to industries here,” the PM said. For seamless connectivity to other states and IGIA, Noida airport will be linked by various expressways, including the upcoming Delhi-Mumbai expressway. “For a landlocked state like UP, this airport will play the role of a port and ensure farmers and manufacturers of unique items in the region — like brassware of Moradabad, petha and footwear of Agra, furniture of Saharanpur… — get quick access to world markets for their products,” Modi said. NIA will have a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility spread over 40 acres. “Today, almost 85% of aircraft with Indian carriers go abroad for MRO service, spending about Rs 15,000 crore annually. This Rs 30,000-crore project will change that,” the PM said. Christoph Schnellmann, CEO of Yamuna International Airport Pvt Ltd, the concessionaire for NIA, said, “NIA will connect western UP to other cities in India and the world. This world-class airport will set a benchmark in aviation infrastructure and development of multiple-airport systems in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/taxiing-to-2024-ncr-sets-2-airport-course/articleshow/87919093.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Nagpur||Primary schools to reopen across the state from December 1||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday gave its nod for restarting physical school for Std I-VII in urban areas, and Std I-IV in rural areas, from December 1. Schools for these students will open for the first time since March 2020. The remaining class levels had reopened earlier in a phased manner. In view of concerns about sending unvaccinated kids to schools, the government has kept attendance optional for all students. The decisions have been welcomed by academics and majority of parents. Education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that in the next few days the state government will consult with all stakeholders, including school management, parents and even paediatric task force, to further fine tune the standard operating procedures. The paediatric task force had said there is no need to link reopening of schools with vaccination for under-18 age groups. “These students will return to campus after nearly two years. We want them to feel safe and acclimatise to physical schooling. Primary section children may not wear a mask, or keep physical distance at all times. But since the paediatric task force felt children need to step into the normal world, or else many will drop out of the education system, we decided to open up schools,” said Gaikwad. She said the SOPs for senior classes were detailed, and most may be replicated again. Pravin Tiwari, director of Central India Public School (CIPS), welcomed the decision saying, “It’s been a long time coming. Physical reopening is good news as students’ academic life has been badly affected.” Ashok Gavhankar, principal of Raosaheb Thawre School, said, “Online classes left majority of kids from poor socio-economic backgrounds out of the learning ecosystem. Students either don’t have smartphones, or if they do, then recharging data is a problem. In some homes, there’s only one phone but two kids, so then a choice has to be made who attends class.” With physical reopening, such students now have an option. A zilla parishad school teacher in Gadchiroli said this was a much needed decision for kids in their region. “We were literally going from village to village and teaching children, so that they do not miss out on education,” said the teacher. Amit Chhabra, parent to two school-going kids, said, “It is one of the best news for children, because their overall development was getting hampered. Being cooped up at home for long had made children addicted to mobile phones. Also, their physical health is getting hampered, which is not good in the long run.” Local authorities will be issuing reopening permissions, once a circular comes from Mantralaya. Principals are confident of having a safe reopening for younger students as well. Premlata T, principal of Bhola High School, said, “In Nagpur, we already have the experience of getting high school kids back on campus, so safety protocols are same. Smaller kids actually listen more to teachers, so it won’t be as difficult to handle as people believe.” How many schools actually reopen will only be known a day before the start date. Once local bodies issue notifications, the education department will start contacting principals and gauge their intent to reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/primary-schools-to-reopen-across-the-state-from-dec-1/articleshow/87918577.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The court was hearing the petition filed by Sivalingam who sought to remove the unauthorised construction put up by A Shanthi in a land situated at Burma Colony in Thamarakki village in Sivaganga district. The government advocate produced a proceedings of the Sivaganga revenue divisional officer which stated that the woman had applied for assignment of land and by considering her economical condition, the land was assigned to her by the tahsildar in 1986. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan observed that the land was assigned in favour of the woman as early as 1986 and the same was known to the petitioner. Yet another factor is that the woman has put up a pakka construction on the land. The petitioner, a resident of the same village, had knowledge about the construction. The judges observed that having knowledge that the land was assigned in favour of the woman, the petitioner had filed the petition by wasting the precious time of the court. Hence, they dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rs-5k-fine-imposed-on-petitioner-for-wasting-time/articleshow/87918572.cms||---

N Muthuraj alias Andavar is a resident of Nettur village. On February 12, 2016, Muthuraj attempted to misbehave with Petchithai’s 21-year-old mentally-ill daughter. Based on her complaint police had warned Muthuraj. Angered by this, Muthuraj hacked Petchithai to death on February 16, 2016. When Petchithai’s younger daughter Mari attempted to save her, Muthuraj also hacked her to death. Subsequently, Muthuraj went to the village and murdered Petchithai’s father Govindasamy. The Alangulam police arrested Muthuraj. In February 2020, the Tenkasi additional district and sessions court convicted and awarded the death sentence for three counts to Muthuraj for offence under Section 302 of IPC. The court also sentenced Muthuraj to undergo two years rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of IPC and one month simple imprisonment for offence under Section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of IPC. Since death sentence was imposed on the accused, the case was referred to the HC Madurai bench in 2020, for confirmation of sentence. Muthuraj had also preferred an appeal before HC challenging the conviction and sentence. A division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that the accused was aged about 32 years at the time of the occurrence. Even though it is stated that he had bad antecedents, the prosecution failed to establish the same. There is no material available on record to show that the accused will continue to be a threat to society. The accused has a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Hence, the judges commuted the death sentence to rigorous imprisonment for 25 years for three counts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-commutes-death-sentence-awarded-to-man/articleshow/87918581.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||India||Judges should deliver justice at doorsteps: Kiren Rijiju||NEW DELHI: Judges should also go out in the fields and give judgments at the doorstep of people, law minister Kiren Rijiju suggested on Thursday. “I have told the CJI that it is not necessary to give judgments from the courtrooms only, but judges can go to the fields and give justice at the doorstep of people,” Rijiju said. He added that the scope of justice dispensation should be enlarged, not bound by the limitations of courtrooms. Rijiju said time has come to step out of “our comfort zone” and not be limited by boundaries, while referring to the vastness of the country and its diversity. “We are such a big country, no one has experienced what we have gone through, the difficulties we face and the problems in reaching out to people,” he said. “Our government is open to all kinds of suggestions,” he added. The minister also said that “...there is no question of any compromise on the spirit of the Constitution. Nobody can play with the basic features of the Constitution or even think of changing it.” His remarks came in reference to “a certain section creating a debate that the government is trying to tamper with the basic structure of the Constitution”. It is a futile exercise of some undesirable elements raising doubts in the minds of people, he added. The law ministry has launched a certificate course on Constitution in association with the NALSAR University, Hyderabad. Rijiju said the government is working on several programmes which will involve the law minister and the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and judges of the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judges-should-deliver-justice-at-doorsteps-kiren-rijiju/articleshow/87920056.cms||---

Coastal areas like Kayalpattinam and Tiruchendur recorded 246 mm and 217 mm rainfall respectively in the 10 hours from 6 am to 4 pm. Rain also threw normal life out of gear in Madurai and its suburbs from afternoon leaving many places inundated. IMD has issued a red alert for Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi. In Tuticorin, many places in and around coastal towns including the Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy temple in Tiruchendur were flooded.

---||Hyderabad||Plea to follow due rigour before tabling Cantt Bill||Secunderabad: The All Cantonments Citizen’s Welfare Association (ACCiWA) has made a plea that the ‘The Cantonment Bill-2021’ be placed for scrutiny before the Defence Standing Committee and tabled in Parliament only after suggestions from all stakeholders are taken into account. ACCiWA’s general secretary, Jitender Surana, on Thursday raised the issue of the bill being tabled in the ensuing winter session of Parliament which starts from November 29. The Centre has listed the bill as No. 6 in the new bills’ list. In fact, it tabled the bill in the last Parliament session, but nothing came of it. The new Cantonment Bill aims mainly at providing greater democratisation, modernisation and overall improvement in the governance structure of Cantonment Boards, Surana said. “The ACCiWA welcomes the Centre’s decision. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has to send the bill first to the Defence Standing Committee and then take consent of every defence committee member. The MoD has already sought recommendations, suggestions and opinions from all Cantonments,” said Surana. On behalf of people of 62 Cantonments in the country, the ACCiWA has asked MPs to discuss certain key points when the bill is introduced, said Surana. “There is a great deal of anger in minds of Cantonment civilians all over the country. They are being deprived of the fruits of democracy as promised by the Constitution of India. This anger is mainly because Cantonments are still governed as they were during British Rule. This cannot be allowed to continue 75 years after Independence,” the general secretary said. He added a Cantonment Board is nothing but a local municipal body tasked with providing civic services to residents. It is recognised to be a deemed municipality. Yet, in direct contravention of the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution, it is not governed by a fully elected body but dominated by nominated members from the Army. Raising another issue, a representation by ACCiWA, speaks of land ownership in cantonments. It adds that suggestions in this regard have to be thoroughly discussed, and the Bill be suitably modified, before voting takes place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plea-to-follow-due-rigour-before-tabling-cantt-bill/articleshow/87918609.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nagpur||Bawankule trashes Cong’s charges||Nagpur: BJP nominee for the forthcoming MLC elections Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Thursday rejected the barrage of allegations against him for belatedly submitting an additional affidavit, mentioning about holding the Mahalaxmi Jagdamba Charitable Trust’s chairman’s post, with the Election Commission of India (ECI). His rival Ravindra Bhoyar, who switched over from BJP to Congress, had raised the objection that Bawankule filed an additional affidavit after he had pointed out that latter was allegedly involved in “office for profit” controversy on account of the post. Bawankule’s affidavit also mentioned that wife Jyoti was chairperson of Jagdamba Lokseva Pratishthan in Koradi. “I had filed both affidavits at the same time while filing my nomination and it was recorded in the camera at the collector’s office on Monday. The nomination form has 26 columns where the candidates have to provide information as per the Election Commission of India (EC) website. So, I filed an additional affidavit informing about my occupation in the Koradi-based trust,” the former minister told TOI while terming allegations labelled by Bhoyar as “baseless” that came “out of frustration” of losing. Earlier, Bhoyar’s election representative Suraj Lolge had accused collector R Vimala that Bawankule’s additional affidavit was not uploaded on ECI website or on the notice board outside her office, as per rules. Vimala clarified that as per ECI guidelines, the first affidavit filed by the contestants was supposed to be uploaded on their website and it was not mandatory for them to post the second one on ECI website. “There is nothing suspicious in the entire procedure, as alleged by the Congress representatives. We have recorded the entire procedure with the CCTV cameras where it was clearly seen that Bawankule had submitted both affidavits on Monday along with the requisite documents. I have given a detailed reply to all their (Congress) objections in my order on Wednesday,” she told TOI. Lolge further pointed out another anomaly in Bawankule’s affidavits stating that the original one had a stamp paper number of 1198 while the second one had a number of 1198. “Both are purchased from different vendors – Harde and Patil. Even typing fonts are different on both. We had approached the charity commissioner for providing us the papers for Mahalaxmi Jagdamba Trust to verify whether Bawankule and his family really occupied the top post there. Being a chairman, he is entitled for a vehicle from the trust,” he told TOI. He questioned how three-time Kamptee MLA’s wife Jyoti could pay equal monthly instalments of Rs 80 lakh-Rs90 lakh each when she had shown her income of Rs 19 lakh in income tax returns. He said Bhoyar would be approaching the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Friday challenging collector’s order of rejecting all his objections on Bawankule’s nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-trashes-congs-charges/articleshow/87918613.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Goa||Nets worth Rs 3 lakh seized from Karnataka fishermen in Goa||POINGUINIM: The fisheries department on Thursday found 25 high speed fishing boats from Karnataka fishing in the territorial waters of Goa within two nautical miles near Talpona in Canacona. Assisted by the coastal police, the fisheries department seized five fishing nets worth Rs 3 lakh and some fish. Goa Kshatriya Pagi Samaj president Ashok Dhuri said for the past eight days, fishermen from Malpe in Karnataka have been fishing in Goan waters violating the distance limit of 12 nautical miles. “We, Pagi Samaj members, who fish in small canoes, have been seeing them and today, along with the fisheries department and coastal police, we went to question them. They were arrogant and on seeing the police in the fishing canoe, they fled in their high speed boats,” he said. “The coastal police is handicapped as they do not possess a vigilance working boat as the one allotted to them is non-operational for the last one year. Besides, the police is equipped with two guns, which have no special room to be kept at the coastal police station at Talpona. The guns are therefore kept at Cutbona, which is many nautical miles away,” Dhuri said. He further appealed to the department concerned to make the vigilance boat available to the coastal police in the absence of which they are handicapped. This, he said, can result in fights between small fishermen and the fishermen with bigger boats. Dhuri added that the bigger boats do bull fishing by violating the distance limit, whereby the small fishermen have no space to carry out fishing. “Whenever these small fishermen go for fishing in their small canoes, the bigger boats can collide with them purposely,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nets-worth-rs-3l-seized-from-karnataka-fishermen-in-goa/articleshow/87918626.cms||---
---||Pune||Sex ratio at birth down in Maharashtra, urban areas a worry||PUNE: The total sex ratio at birth dipped by 11 points — to 913 girls per 1,000 boys in 2019-20 from 924 newborn girls per 1,000 boys in 2015-16 — in Maharashtra , the latest report of the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) revealed. A demographic analysis revealed that the state’s urban population showed appalling low numbers of newborn girls per 1,000 boys than their rural counterparts. According to the NFHS-5, the ratio of newborn girls per 1,000 boys was 878 in urban areas, a sharp drop by 42 points when compared with the NFHS-4 data of 2015-16, when there were 920 newborn girls per 1,000 boys. In the rural areas, the ratio of newborn girls per 1,000 boys was 941, up by 15 points when compared with the NFHS-4 data of 2015-16, when there were 926 newborn girls per 1,000 boys. The state’ health department’s data based on the civil registration system (CRS), which tracks births and deaths, for 2019 showed that the sex ratio at birth was 919 girls per 1,000 boys and went down to 913 in 2020. Experts said both the reports (NFHS-5 and CRS) clearly indicated that the preference for a male child was still predominant in society and that sex-selective abortion might still be prevalent. “If the number of girls born is less than 920, we can assume that there is discrimination against the girl child,” said senior gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte, former national president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India. Health activist and medical practitioner Sanjeev Dabhade said, “The report should be an eye-opener for the state government. Awareness drives, stringent enforcement of the law, initiation of technology like a mother and child tracking system, routine inspection and raids on sonography centres are keys to improving sex ratio at birth.” Child sex ratio is defined as the number of females per thousand males in the 0-6 age group. While child sex ratio was principally determined by the sex ratio at birth, it was also influenced by a number of other factors, such as under-registration of girls, differential infant, child mortality and age misreporting, stated the report, ‘Girls Missing At Birth in India’, published by the United Nations Population Fund-India.  Social activist Sudha Kankaria said, “Prevailing social customs such as dowry and the excessively glorified notion of the male child’s role in many rituals, as well as in cremation, continue to have a lot of bearing on society’s psyche. That needs to be changed through awareness and sensitization programmes.” Despite repeated attempts, Archana Patil, director, health services, could not be contacted for her comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sex-ratio-at-birth-down-in-maha-urban-areas-a-worry/articleshow/87918603.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Vadodara||Community members seek action over alleged conversions||Vadodara: Row over alleged conversion attempt in Godhra is refusing to die down. While the police are yet to register an offence, members of the majority community have sought strict action against those involved in the act. A major row erupted on Tuesday night when a woman named Divya Luhana saw suspicious activities in the house of a member of the Sindhi community who she suspected is involved in religious conversions. The group present in the house was from a Nadiad-based organisation that had earlier converted the man’s brother-in-law to another faith. The man was under the community’s radar as the group had conducted some rituals with him even earlier and the photographs of the rituals had gone viral. After this, members of the Sindhi community had also met the man and had advised him against conversion. A delegation of prominent members of the Sindhi community met the district collector and officials of the Panchmahal police seeking action in the matter. The memorandum names a member of the Nadiad-based organisation as the prime accused in the matter. It further alleges that the organisation had given inducement for conversions and also states that the brother-in-law of the man had also been converted.

---||Hyderabad||‘Merge SCB with GHMC’ voices grow||Hyderabad: With the Covid-19 pandemic under control and the economy fast opening up, many offices have reopened in the city, increasing the movement of people between Secunderabad and Hyderabad. The increased vehicular traffic between the twin cities has only reopened the long-pending demand of lakhs of people living in colonies abutting the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC) in Secunderabad for the merger of Secunderabad Cantonment with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). TOI stands by the people’s demand for a unified city civic body, through the merger of SCB with GHMC. Readers are invited to share their comments or civic problems on Facebook with #MergeSCBwithGHMC and Twitter with #MergeSCBwithGHMC and @TOIHyderabad. The merger will not only solve the problem of “restricted movement” of civilians from colonies around AOC, but also help in honing civic amenities in localities now under control of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB). In the absence of a unified municipal body for Hyderabad and large parts of Secunderabad, the local Army authorities have closed down several arterial roads once accessible to people living in peripheral areas of AOC. This has forced lakhs of people to take a detour to reach their destination in Hyderabad. Locals argue the best solution to frequent road closure in AOC is to merge SCB with GHMC and hand over all roads in the Army area to unified civic body. As the traffic from Secunderabad to Hyderabad, particularly from the colonies around AOC to IT hub, is bound to increase as pandemic virus wanes, there’s every need to look at civic, social and cultural needs of lakhs of people in Secunderabad, particularly those living in the Secunderabad Cantonment. The demand for merger of SCB with the GHMC will help in better civic infrastructure particularly good and wide roads for easy vehicular movement. None of the roads in the SCB are worthy of mention either in terms of cleanliness or width. The narrow roads in the SCB, coupled with road restrictions in AOC, are adding to woes of motorists. The merger of SCB with GHMC is justified as the city is one large geographical entity. There are several discrepancies in development and infrastructure between SCB and GHMC areas. Inequalities range from drinking water supply, urban planning, building permissions to unrestricted movement on roads, better urban life with social and cultural activities. SCB areas come a poor second to GHMC. Thus, Hyderabad and Secunderabad need a uniform civic code for equal development. m dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

While camera traps are being used to estimate the number of tigers in the mangroves, sign survey this year — which is done to get an idea of the abundance of prey species and other predators — will be done through two apps. Till last year, the sign survey was done in the pen-and-paper mode. This is part of the All-India Tiger Estimation Exercise that is carried out every four years. Sunderbans Tiger Reserve deputy field director Justine Jones said, “We will be using two apps, Polygon Search and a patrol app, to record data on sign survey. Earlier, this exercise required pen-and-paper work where the staff used to manually fill in data that was scrutinised and compiled later. This left room for erroneous data-filling due to human error. That’s why we will use these two apps, developed by National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India, this year. This special patrolling and data collection protocols are being introduced for a better estimation.” According to him, about 180 staffers will take part in the exercise in the Indian Sunderbans once it starts. Jones said the department will also be using 788 pairs of camera traps, compared to 600 pairs used during the last exercise. “The exercise will kick off on December 5 in all the ranges of the tiger reserve. It will go on till February,” Jones said, adding that a three-day training workshop is currently underway at Sajnekhali, where a few staffers from Odisha forest department are also taking part. As per the latest report, compiled by Bengal forest department in July, Indian Sunderbans is home to 96 tigers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sunderbans-tiger-spotting-to-go-high-tech-with-apps-more-cams/articleshow/87897688.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee

Senior counsel and former additional solicitor-general Darius Khambata as special counsel for state government said contrary to what CBI argued, that its probe was against only Deshmukh, its affidavit and pleadings show it was against “unknown others’’ too. He said since former Maharashtra DGP Subodh Jaiswal is director of CBI and as a DGP he was involved in decisions and recommendations for transfer and postings of police officers since he was on Police Establishment Boards (PEB) I and II, which deal with postings, he may be called for questioning to verify CBI’s claims that Deshmukh modified decisions of the board. Hence a separate SIT be appointed, he said. Khambata, responding to submissions by ASG Aman Lekhi for CBI, said, “When CBI’s case on oath before HC is that Jaiswal who I believe is a very upright officer was closely involved in PEB I and II, no one how so ever high can argue to the contrary.’’ He said the state was not batting for Deshmukh. Khambata said, “Am a little unnerved as a citizen to see CBI has decided that only Deshmukh is being probed, though.’’ He added, “Am not an apologist for Deshmukh. If he is guilty, he will be hanged. But so also his associates and ‘confederates’. He will be probed. As state, we are looking at an unbiased, untinted investigation… people also need to be reassured.’’ The state government claimed its “highest officers” were harassed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-sit-not-cbi-must-probe-case-against-deshmukh-in-mumbai/articleshow/87919578.cms||---
---||Delhi||Police detain farmers who had planned protest march||Greater Noida: Members of several outfits, such as the Gurjar Swabhiman Samiti, Kisan Ekta Sangh and the Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan, who had planned a march to Jewar to allegedly show black flags to the chief minister were either detained or put under house arrest from Wednesday itself. A group of farmers led by Sukhbir Khalifa of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan, who have been protesting against the Noida Authority for the past two months over various demands, were allegedly detained around 2am on Wednesday from outside the Authority office and taken to the police lines in neighbouring Ghaziabad. Anil Yadav of Congress arrived in support of members of the Kisan Sangathan. The farmers, who sat on a protest outside the police lines, were eventually released around 7pm on Thursday. Holding black flags, about 80 protesters from the Gurjar community were allegedly stopped from moving towards Jewar from the house of Rashtriya Gurjar Swabhiman Samiti leader Ravindra Bhati. Some of them were also dressed in black clothes. Bhati, who had planned to go to Jewar along with his supporters to protest the alleged removal of the word “Gurjar” from a plaque under the statue of 9th century ruler Samrat Mihir Bhoj, said he, too, was put under house arrest. Led by ACP (central Noida) PP Singh, around 100 police personnel reached Bhati’s house in a bus and surrounded it. A group of people who appeared to be lawyers unfurled a banner and shouted slogans demanding a separate bench of the Allahabad high court in Agra. Referring to the 1985 Jaswant Singh commission, the protesters said its recommendations were yet to be implemented in UP. Some of those who were in the audience were taken aback by the sudden outburst and looked back to see what had happened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-detain-farmers-who-had-planned-protest-march/articleshow/87919109.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Lucknow||PM: SP govt had written to Centre to shut Jewar project||Lucknow: Amid efforts of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party to take credit for the development projects launched in the past four and a half years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the previous government (read SP) had written to the Centre to shut the Jewar airport project.  He attacked the Opposition parties for delay in the project and said that Uttar Pradesh, which was kept in deprivation and darkness earlier, is now getting what it always deserved and is making its mark internationally under a ‘double-engine’ rule, referring to BJP rule both at the Centre and Uttar Pradesh.  BSP chief Mayawati, however, was quick to respond to the Prime Minister’s attack. Clarifying for the delay, Mayawati blamed the Congress-led UPA government of that time for sitting over the project in a series of tweets.  The BSP chief also questioned the land acquisition compensation policy citing the court’s remark against the government.  Interestingly, SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav also questioned the Centre’s role in another airport project through a tweet. He said: “Had the BJP government at the Centre not stopped the permission for a proposed airport at Firozabad, today there would have been an opportunity to connect ‘jevar’ (referring to ornaments) with ‘chudi’ (referring to bangles of Firozabad)…” The blame-game is set to intensify with elections approaching near.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-sp-govt-had-written-to-centre-to-shut-jewar-project/articleshow/87919574.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

However, several people had a tough time in refuelling their vehicles as the fuel stations across the district started operations only from 8 am and were found religiously following district collector’s order to verify vaccination certificates, before selling fuel. Following the meeting, the PDA issued a statement saying, “The PDA had a meaningful and mutually agreeable meeting with the district collector Sunil Chavan during which he has assured of safety and support during the day-today operational issues. As a gesture of support to the ongoing vaccination drive, the PDA has offered to start vaccination centers at three fuel stations — Hind Super situated at Kranti Chowk, NA Printer at Delhi Gate and Sai Sharan in Ulkanagari area.” During the meeting that took place at the district collectorate, Chavan requested the PDA members to cooperate with the administration to achieve maximum vaccination following which the PDA withdrew its decision to operate only between 8 am and 7 pm. The orders making vaccination a prerequisite for availing basic facilities including fuel, grocery, LPG, subsidised grains, among others attracted criticism from different quarters. However, the district administration defended the move saying the orders in the past past few days have increased vaccination manifold. The PDA office-bearers clarified that district collector’s order asking to verify vaccination certificate, stamp it and cross verify the stamp before delivering fuel, will continue till further orders. Meanwhile, a delegation led by journalist Prakash Pohre and medico Vilas Jagdale made a representation to Chavan and cited the first real-world assessment carried out by AIIMS concluding that the two doses of Covaxin having 50% effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-fuel-pumps-agree-to-regular-hours/articleshow/87917111.cms||---

On Thursday, a kilogram of ‘saaho’ variety,, considered to be the best,, was sold for Rs 80/kg. “Second quality tomatoes were sold at Rs 60 to Rs 70/kg in the retail market on Thursday. The variety was sold for Rs 120/kg earlier this week. We could not buy the saaho variety those days as it would have no buyers,” N Chinnamayan, president of the Central Market All Traders Association, said. Mattuthavani wholesale vegetable market would get 30 loads of tomatoes, each load having 10 to 12 tonnes, when the production was high and prices were very less. They used to come from the outskirts of Madurai and Theni, Dindigul, Tirupur, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts and from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The market used to get 20 loads when the production was moderate and it dropped to a mere four to five loads over the last few days due to the drop in production in the farms in Tamil Nadu. “So we were getting tomatoes all the way from Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh through the markets in Karnataka and AP,” he said. On Wednesday night, Mattuthavani market got seven loads from those states, resulting in a considerable price drop. The price of a 15-kg tray of saaho variety sold for Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 and the second quality sold for Rs 1,300 earlier this week, was dropped to Rs 700. The third quality tiny tomatoes or those that are half ripe and have dots and are predominantly bought by hotels and canteens were sold at Rs 500 to Rs 600 per tray from the wholesale market. According to wholesalers, the price of saaho and other qualities of tomatoes too would drop further in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tomato-price-dips-to-rs-80-a-kg-in-madurai/articleshow/87918628.cms||---

The road roko led to vehicles piling up at the toll plaza. The protesters said that even after the order from the district administration that they will be allowed fee exemption, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials at the toll plaza started to demand for toll fee again from Wednesday. A similar protest was staged about over two weeks ago. The protesters, which included local residents and bus, lorry and other drivers from Tenkasi, Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur, Thoppur and Thirupparankundram, gathered under the banner of Kappalur Toll Gate Edhirpu Iyakkam. “The Madurai district collector, at the last meeting said that fee exemption will be given for local residents till the matter is resolved in court. However, the NHAI officials have not accepted it saying there is no official order given to them,” said Raghunatha Raja, president, Kappalur Industrialists Association. “For around 10 years, the issue has not been resolved. Whenever we protest, they convince us that they will allow fee exemption without any effort to resolve the issue permanently,” said Andisamy, a co-ordinator for the protest.

The software which was used for the polytechnic examination was adopted and introduced at Mangalore University for examinations from this year. “However, the free software is not helping us. We have failed to deliver as promised. Therefore, I recommend dropping it. The issue will be tabled in the next syndicate meeting on December 15,” said Yadapadithaya. He said to save money, MU rushed with the decision without understanding the nitty-gritty of the software. While 23 state universities are yet to take a decision on in-house examination software, MU became the first to adopt the free software ‘MULinx’. “I had warned officials and even aired my concern during the syndicate meeting on adopting new software. In reply, they were assured of carrying out examinations with the new software without any issues. We would have saved some money, but credibility and sanctity of the examination is lost. The results are not delivered on time as promised. Therefore, I have decided to discontinue MULinx. Meanwhile, registrar (evaluation) P L Dharma has been asked to answer various complaints received from college principals,” said Yadapadithaya. Senior professors criticised the new software and pointed out that it is designed for polytechnic education, which has only a few subjects and no combinations. “When it comes to Mangalore University undergraduate programmes, each course has numerous combinations, and awarding of internal assessment marks and grace marks. The software was not meant for us,” they said.  “I am carrying out duties assigned to me. The decision to continue or discontinue the examination software MULinx is with higher authorities,” said P L Dharma, registrar (evaluation).  Issues galore The first year postgraduate students (2020-21 batch) are reportedly left in the lurch, as MU had failed to confirm their registration, even two months after admissions. The students without issue of ID cards were asked to pay examination fees without getting roll numbers.

---||Mumbai||32-yr-old to hang for ‘diabolical’ rape & murder of child in Thane||Mumbai: The death sentence of a 32-year-old man was confirmed by the Bombay high court on Thursday for the rape and murder of a three-year-old child in a “diabolical manner” in Thane in 2013. Ramkirat Goud, then in his twenties, had bludgeoned the child’s head with a rock after raping her and left the body to rot in a mud pond. Maggots were crawling on it when it was found four days later in October that year. The HC also directed the state to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh under the victim compensation scheme to the father within 30 days. The “crime smacks of degradation of a girl child, depravity and perversity” and its “barbaric and inhuman manner’’ made it the rarest of rare case, fit for sending the convict to the gallows, said a bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan. It is a abhorrent crime that would send a “chill down the spine” of every parent of a small girl child before they send “innocent, undefended’’ children out to see the rainbow. The HC confirmed the death sentence awarded in 2019 by the Mumbai special trial judge under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Goud’s lawyer Sachin Pawar argued for the conviction to be set aside as the entire case rested on circumstantial evidence. But additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh pointed to the stack of evidence and said it led to only one conclusion: Goud’s guilt. She said the brutal crime caused a huge public outcry and clearly falls in the ‘rarest of rare category’; if any leniency is shown, he would be a “menace to society”. Goud, who had come from Uttar Pradesh looking for employment, was arrested on October 3, 2013. The HC said the timing of the crime that was gauged from the maggots on the body matched with unexplained injuries on the accused. It pointed out that the accused “has not shown any remorse’’ and the only mitigating circumstance cited is “economic stringency of his family”. “It is the safety of a girl child which is of paramount importance to a society,’’ said the bench. “It is unimaginable that a cheerful, frolicking child enjoying with her pet would provoke the feelings of lust in a man who is a father of two daughters and a son.” The judgment authored by Justice Jadhav added: “The perversity in the mind of the accused is apparent and therefore, we are of the opinion that the aggravating circumstances in the present case outweigh the mitigating circumstances placed before the court in the course of hearing of the appeal.’’ The compensation under a NALSA scheme for rape victims was not paid as the child’s mother had abandoned her two years before her murder and had not showed up even after her death, the HC noted, after hearing advocate Rebecca Gonsalvez appointed to represent the father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/32-yr-old-to-hang-for-diabolical-rape-murder-of-child-in-thane/articleshow/87919113.cms||---

However, the hospital authorities have denied her allegations. The woman said three days after the birth of her second child, she experienced pain in her abdomen. “The doctors tried to brush it off as normal pain. Later, I doubted whether an IUD could have been inserted and asked the doctors. They then told me that a ‘Copper T’ device has been placed. I was shocked to hear that because they had done the procedure without getting my consent. I wouldn’t have even known if I hadn’t asked,” she said. The woman alleged that the hospital was not obtaining consent from patients to get IUDs. . Denying the allegations, dean of the GRH Dr A Rathinavel said that written consent has to be given by patients for undergoing the procedure to get IUDs placed. “The particular patient was discharged without any complaints. We always get consent from patients and also explain the procedure to patients. The patient will also be aware if such a procedure is done,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/woman-claims-grh-inserted-iud-without-her-consent/articleshow/87918640.cms||---

Police have now arrested an Army personnel, a resident of Haryana, for the crime. The woman’s father had died just 15 days ago in a road accident and her mother along with her brother had gone to their native village near Kanpur to perform the last rites. “Rat poison was found in her house and she had apparently consumed it,” police said, adding that her condition is stable. School students take out a candle march demanding justice for the 21-year-old rape survivor in Mathura on Thursday Superintendent of police (rural) Shrish Chandra said that the suspect, an Army personnel, is married and posted in Ladakh. He had come to his hometown, Palwal, to attend his brother’s wedding, which is scheduled this week. During interrogation, he confessed to the crime, police claimed. The car in which the woman was allegedly raped has been recovered. The driver of the vehicle, a relative of the accused, is absconding. The woman had met the accused on the social media platform about three months ago. She told police that the assault happened when she was returning home after appearing for the Uttar Pradesh police sub-inspector recruitment exam in Agra on Tuesday. UP state human rights commission has taken cognisance of the matter and sought a report from SSP Gaurav Grover.

The local unit of the BJP will send the list to the party’s Central leadership for consent, following which locations of the public rallies and interactions will be planned.The saffron party zeroed in on these names after detailed discussions. Sources in the party said as they have limited time to plan the visits of star campaigners, only 10 names were decided. “The names were decided keeping in mind that natives of Bihar, UP, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana live in the city in large numbers. The dates of their campaigns and rallies will be finalized once we get the green signal from the party’s Central leadership. We are expecting that all names will be cleared,” sources added.Meanwhile, the BJP has started its campaign in the city. All the senior party leaders are meeting regularly to finalise candidates for all the 35 municipal wards. The election committee of the party has been assessing all the aspects before taking the final call. ‘No alliance, have candidates’The BJP will be contesting without tying up with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) this time. Sources said they have suitable candidates for all wards and there won’t be a problem in the absence of an alliance. “We have got dozens of applications from all the wards.

---||Mumbai||Only legislature session discussed at Anil Deshmukh meet: Sachin Waze to panel||MUMBAI: In a denial that any discussion on mobilization of Rs 100 crore had taken place, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze said before the Justice K U Chandiwal commission on Thursday that there was discussion exclusively on the business before the state legislature at a meeting convened on February 21 by the then home minister Anil Deshmukh, which he attended. In his letter sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir had stated that the home minister had asked Waze to accumulate Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in the city. Singh had stated that in and around mid-February and thereafter, the then home minister Deshmukh had called Waze to his official residence. At that time, one or two staff members of the home minister, including his private secretary Sanjeev Palande, were also present. During cross-examination by Shekhar Jagtap, counsel for Palande, Waze said the then home minister had convened a meeting on February 21 at his official residence. Waze said the meeting pertained to preparations for legislative assembly questions and immediately after the meeting, he left the minister’s residence. On November 22, Singh’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud had told the commission that the March 20 letter was hearsay, based on the information given by Singh’s subordinates and colleagues. Following Singh’s letter, Anil Deshmukh had quit the cabinet, and the state government set up a one-man commission led by Justice K U Chandiwal to probe the charges levelled by the former Mumbai CP. The commission is likely to issue a production warrant against Anil Deshmukh for his presence before the panel during the course of inquiry. Deshmukh’s lawyer will cross-examine Waze on Friday. Meanwhile, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said on Thursday that from the depositions before the Chandiwal commission, it appeared that Singh’s letter was politically motivated and an attempt to destabilize the MVA government. “Singh had written a very damaging letter, following which the NCP leadership sacked Anil Deshmukh. Now, his counsel tells the commission the letter was hearsay, based on information given by subordinates. I am surprised how a senior IPS officer can write a letter to the CM without verification,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-legislature-session-discussed-at-deshmukh-meet-waze-to-panel/articleshow/87919146.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19: Andhra Pradesh maps nearly 100% of patients’ contacts||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has accumulated more than 20 lakh Covid-19 cases. In a record of sorts, the state health department could map nearly 100% contacts of all these 20 lakh patients except primary contacts of 86 patients and secondary contacts of 97 patients. Districts like Kadapa, West Godavari, Nellore and Chittoor have not missed the contacts of even a single patient in their respective areas. The officials could not find the primary and secondary contacts of only 11 patients combined in the disease epicentre East Godavari, which is on the verge of reaching an alarming three-lakh infection milestone. The missing contacts run into double-digits only in two north coastal Andhra Pradesh districts – Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam. An efficient contact tracing mechanism plays a crucial role in breaking the chain of transmissions, singling out the suspected individuals, and early detection of cases. Right from the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Andhra Pradesh has stuck to the fundamentals of ‘test, track and treat’. Apart from the medical components of testing and treating, the state has laid equal focus on surveillance and containment to prevent super-spreading events. Director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences and state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said the persons staying in the same close environment of a Covid-19 patient are considered as primary contacts. “Even those providing direct care to a patient without proper personal protective equipment or travelling together for longer durations are also treated as primary contacts. All other contacts shall be identified as secondary contacts. The health department used to conduct confirmatory tests on both primary and secondary contacts in the initial months of the outbreak. At a later stage, the enlisted secondary contacts were kept under surveillance for two weeks. This helped the state in breaking the chain of transmissions,” said Dr Rambabu. Andhra Pradesh had followed a cluster containment strategy during the first few months of first wave last year by demarcating the geographic area. An area of around 3-kilometre radius from the epicentre of the positive case was taken as the containment cluster. These regulations were relaxed by the time the daily infections had plateaued in the first wave. In the second wave, the health department shifted its focus to door-to-door fever surveys, community surveillance, people with comorbidities, high-risk groups, containment zones, and sentinel surveillance testing of various working groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-maps-nearly-100-of-patients-contacts/articleshow/87917810.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||India||Amit Shah cites improved security, pushes for investment in northeast India||NEW DELHI: Citing the improved security scenario in the northeast region, political stability in all the eight constituent states, peace initiatives taken by Narendra Modi government to end insurgencies prevalent for decades as well as improved road, rail and air connectivity, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday invited industries to take advantage of this ‘conducive’ environment and invest in the northeast region. Addressing the annual session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) through virtual mode, Shah said there was a time when the northeast was saddled with problems like violence, insurgency, floods, corruption, blockades and narcotics etc. “Today, the region is in the news for connectivity, development, tourism, jobs, afforestation and flood control. “For investment, a region must be peaceful, insurgencies and disputes resolved, and an atmosphere created for political stability and economic development. The Narendra Modi government has enabled this over the past seven years,” said Shah. “I appeal to ICC and its members to look at the northeast from a different perspective, understand the changes and invest,” the home minister told the industry captains while emphasising that the target of a 5-trillion-dollar economy set by PM cannot be realised without development of the northeast. Shah said the government had integrated three ‘E’ – empathy, empowerment and enabler – for development of northeast and would move ahead on these lines. He said the Modi regime would establish peace by understanding with empathy the aspirations of the youths; empower the governments in the northeast with political stability; and be an enabler in empowering the public. Shah said the NDA government had taken several steps to establish peace in the northeast, citing the land boundary agreement with Bangladesh, end to Manipur blockade, signing of peace pacts with insurgent groups like NLFT and Karbi Anglong groups and also the agreement to end Bru refugees crisis. “Between 2007 and 2014, 385 persons were killed due to violent insurgency incidents, but from 2017 and 2019, just two persons were killed. In the past two years, 3,922 militants have surrendered with around 4,000 weapons,” he stated. On political stability in the northeast, Shah said the region has accepted PM Modi’s leadership and returned 19 of its 24 seats to the NDA. 350 of the 498 legislators are from North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), working under leadership of PM Modi, and thus there is no hesitation in seeking help from New Delhi, he underlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-cites-improved-security-pushes-for-investment-in-northeast-india/articleshow/87920068.cms||---

They then assaulted police personnel and broke a glass in the complainant room at Sola police station. According to an FIR filed with Sola police on Thursday, they got a call from a person who has a shop near Malav Talav (lake) in Thaltej about a theft. When the cops reached there, they found three men beating a man, the suspect of the theft, mercilessly, said the FIR.

The cops called another vehicle and additional personnel, who took the three men and the theft suspect to Sola police station. When the three men got out of the car at the police station, they began abusing the cops and threatened them with dire consequences if a complaint was filed against them.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC ready with candidate list, workers hit the ground||KOLKATA: Firhad Hakim, chairperson of KMC’s board of administrators (BoA), on Thursday cancelled all his official engagements at the civic body even as speculation was rife about who would be Trinamool’s mayoral candidate at the KMC poll slated for December 19. Hakim has cancelled Saturday’s Talk-to-Mayor programme and also conveyed he wouldn’t attend office till the elections. Hakim’s decision came as the model code of conduct was imposed after the state election commission announced that the KMC poll will be held on December 19. The present KMC BoA is, however, likely to continue till it is formally dissolved by the state municipal affairs department. Hakim, Kolkata’s ex-mayor, had been helming the civic body since he was elected as the KMC mayor in December 2018. “The BOA chairman has decided not to attend office till polls are conducted and a new elected board starts functioning. But if the other members choose to continue their official work of the board, they are allowed to do so unless they are not nominated for the polls. Else, the state municipal affairs department will appoint an administrator to run the civic body till a new board is elected after the polls,” said a KMC official. The Trinamool candidate list, which is likely to be announced on Friday or over the weekend, is likely to throw up surprises. This will be the first election the party will face after it introduced its one-person-one-post formula. Several KMC councillors and MMiCs are also MLAs. Taking a leaf out of its assembly election candidate list, octogenarian ward councillors may step back and let younger candidates take the way ahead. According to senior leaders, the party is also considering whether sitting MLAs will contest the KMC polls or not. Led by Hakim, this list includes former deputy mayor Atin Ghosh and BoA members Debasish Kumar, Debabrata Majumdar. Juggling its heavyweight candidates, Trinamool is also unlikely to give multiple tickets to candidates from the same family. There are several examples when a family has multiple KMC councillors. But one thing was for sure, said a source, and that was the Trinamool list was likely to see a lot of youngsters and woman candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-ready-with-candidate-list-workers-hit-the-ground/articleshow/87918679.cms||Saikat Ray

Municipal commissioner Anindita Mitra has constituted a core committee of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), which will not only monitor the works of the field teams and report directly to her, but also formally engage in the work like documentation, uploading of records on the portal of the Central government and holding other activities. Mitra said, “The work of the core committee has been divided. The teams will maintain data on a daily basis, prepare creative ideas, like organising skits, holding competitions and information education communication (IEC) activities. Moreover, the core team will also monitor the field work and report directly to me.”There are around 10 to12 persons in this core team. Sources in the civic body said the role of this team will be very crucial and impactful. There are multiple indicators in the Swachhta ranking and the aim of the MC is to work on each of them. Uploading of data will also be monitored on a regular basis so that information is as per work.UT adviser Dharam Pal had, on Wednesday, held a meeting with all the senior officers and other officials of the MC and asked to pull up socks for a better ranking.

After inspecting the ongoing work of Western Bypass along with Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, Pauskar said that his department would appoint a flying squad to keep a watch. Stating that it will take around one year to complete the project, Pauskar said, “We will take care that people from this area will not suffer due to this work.” Earlier this month, Sardesai, along with residents of Mungul, Maddel and neighbouring areas of Fatorda, had halted land filling in low-lying fields near the wholesale fish market that was being done for the Western Bypass project. “We have demanded a 980m bypass on stilts, the government has approved our demand and now the court has to give its nod,” Sardesai said, adding that he has always demanded that the construction be on stilts in the flood-prone areas He said that people should not suffer due to construction of the Western Bypass by filling low-lying paddy fields. “We are not against the Western Bypass. It should happen, but not at the cost of people residing here.” Sardesai said this work will take months to complete and hence to prevent flooding in the rainy season steps should be taken. He earlier demanded that the government should appoint a flying squad, so a continuous watch remains on this area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-ensure-locals-dont-suffer-due-to-western-bypass/articleshow/87918678.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Hence, we want the centre to bring onion and grapes under the MSP,” Shetti said. Addressing reporters during his visit to Nashik on Thursday, Shetti said the state government needs to make an amendment in Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act. “The government should give the right to vote during APMC elections to those farmers who have been selling their produce at the APMCs for the past three years,” he said. Stating that grape farmers are cheated by traders who procure their produce outside the APMC jurisdiction, Shetti said the government needs to chalk out stringent norms and make license along with bank guarantee mandatory to such traders buying produce from farmers. He has also sought FRP of Rs 3,700 per tonne for sugar cane farmers. “Farmers in western Maharashtra are now getting Rs 3,100 per tonne for sugarcane, but unfortunately farmers from Nashik are not getting good prices for sugarcane comparatively due to closure of sugar factories in the region,” Shetti said. He demanded that the state government should take immediate steps to revive the cooperative sugar factories in Nashik district that are closed for many years due to financial or some other reasons. The leader also blamed the BJP for using the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax department against political leaders. Meanwhile, Shetti inaugurated the convention of farmers on grapes and onions in Niphad taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bring-onions-grapes-under-msp-says-shetti/articleshow/87917154.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Hyderabad techie’s post not directly linked to cricketer, kin: Mumbai court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to a 23-year-old techie arrested from Hyderabad for allegedly posting rape threats to an Indian cricket star’s nine-month-old daughter on social media, a magistrate’s court observed that merely because the matter was connected to a respectable Indian cricket team member, his bail plea cannot be rejected. Granting relief to Ramnagesh Akubathini, magistrate Komal Sing Rajput said from remarks posted and phraseology used in its natural course, it appeared it was made in context of other posts, and may not be directly addressed to the cricketer or his family. The court said as social media accounts are interconnected, it may have been read or received by them. “This aspect for limited purpose of bail cannot be ignored. There appears to be some substance in submission of advocate for the accused,” the magistrate said. Abhijeet Desai, advocate for the accused, submitted that the alleged post was in context of responses of people, it was singly picked up and an offence was registered. Desai argued that it was not directly connected with the cricketer or his family and cannot be read in isolation of other posts. The court said most offences against the accused were bailable, except 67B of IT Act, which deals with publishing or transmitting material depicting children in sexually explicit act in electronic form. He was granted bail on Saturday but a detailed order was made available on Thursday. The court said most evidence was collected. The court said he was young and had a bright academic record and future prospects. “Bail is a rule and jail is exception.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hyd-techies-post-not-directly-linked-to-cricketer-kin/articleshow/87919622.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 5 multispecialty hospitals in tribal areas||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has already started the work to establish five multispecialty hospitals in five tribal areas, said chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Participating in a short discussion on Aarogyasri scheme on Thursday, the chief minister said that these five hospitals would come up in the limits of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) areas. These five would be in addition to the one teaching hospital with medical college coming up in Paderu, the chief minister said. The chief minister said that the government was also establishing 16 medical colleges with teaching hospitals in the state. “We have just 11 teaching hospitals so far in the state since Independence. In the last two years, we have started to add 16 more teaching hospitals. Once these 16 hospitals start providing medical and health services to the people, the state which has 25 Lok Sabha constituencies would have 27 teaching hospitals,” the chief minister said as the members applauded. The chief minister said that his government was giving highest priority to health and education in the state. He said in the last two-and-a-half years, the state had taken up renovation of existing hospitals, primary health care centres (PHCs), urban health care centres (UHCs) and district hospitals under Nadu-Nedu programme. He said that the government is establishing 1032 YSR Village Clinics, 560 urban health clinics, besides renovating 1328 PHCs, 52 area hospitals, 190 community health centres in the state with all national health standards, including the staff and facilities. The government was spending Rs 16,255 crore to upgrade the hospitals and clinics, the chief minister said. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that AP had brought Covid-19 treatment under Aarogyasri health scheme for the first time in the country. The government had spent Rs 3,648 crore on Covid-19 treatment and mitigation. “The Covid-19 death rate in the country was 1.35 per cent while it was just 0.7 per cent in the state. It was possible because of the continued and cautious efforts,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/5-multispecialty-hospitals-in-tribal-areas/articleshow/87917832.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh government apologises in high court for delay in jailed PHD student's treatment||AGRA: The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday tendered an “unconditional and unqualified” apology for the delay in providing treatment to undertrial prisoner, PhD student Atiq-ur-Rahman, at AIIMS-Delhi while filing a compliance affidavit in Allahabad high court. The apology comes two days after the court slammed the state government for not giving medical care to Rahman – suffering from a congenital heart condition for which he was being treated at AIIMS before he was arrested -- despite directions from the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Lucknow earlier. Rahman was admitted to AIIMS-Delhi on Wednesday. The compliance report and the apology were submitted on behalf of the state government by the Mathura jailor, who assured the court of "best medical attention to Rahman". The urgency application was moved by Rahman through advocates Shashwat Anand and Syed Ahmed Faizan, mentioning that he is suffering from a severe cardiac ailment and was referred to AIIMS for surgical intervention. The court had on Tuesday directed Mathura jail authorities to produce a fresh medical report regarding his treatment by the next date of hearing on Thursday. Rahman, along with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others, was arrested last year while on their way to Hathras to meet a 19-year-old Dalit girl who had been raped and murdered. He was charged with sedition and under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. On September 22, Rahman fell ill while he was being taken to the PMLA court for a hearing. He was initially taken to a primary health centre, from where he was sent to Agra district hospital which referred him to three more hospitals, among them AIIMS-Delhi. But the authorities took him back to jail instead. He was later taken to AIIMS-Delhi for an expert opinion and was advised surgery by doctors on October 8, but the surgery never happened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-govt-apologises-in-hc-for-delay-in-treatment-of-jailed-student/articleshow/87917843.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||MPCB nod not must at time of hospital registration: NMC||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) health department has eased the process of furnishing approvals from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regarding biomedical waste (BMW) management and consent to set up a healthcare facility. So far, lack of the approval forms — ‘Consent and BMW Authorization” and ‘Consent to establish” — were holding up registration/renewal of hospitals. The private hospitals through Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) stated that the local authority’s powers were limited to ensure that the hospitals apply for these approvals. As per the Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016, all health care facilities have to compulsorily take MPCB consent and BMW authorization. This entails approval for generation, collection, and disposal of BMW. The Maharashtra Nursing Home Registration Act 1949 mandates consent to establish from MPCB. Yet, there remains ambiguity over the necessity of the approvals as the civic health department’s letter has been interpreted in different ways. In his letter dated November 22, NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said though these approvals are mandatory, non-submission of the same won’t affect the renewal or registration process. When TOI asked if the MPCB approvals were exempted, Dr Chilkar said, “We shall intimate the hospitals to get the MPCB approvals while keeping their registration/renewal pending. Their applications won’t be rejected if they don’t have the approvals. But they will need MPCB registration.” MPCB regional officials said they were unaware of the development between NMC and VHA but came to know about it from media reports. Many hospitals apply but they don’t have BMW authorisation or consent letter from the MPCB at the time of seeking license renewal or registration. The approvals are necessary requirements as per revised norms but old hospitals may not have them because of space and logistical issues. Dr Pradeep Arora, VHA’s legal advisor, had raised this issue with concerned authorities wherein he had sought details of the section, rule or regulation in Nursing Home Acts and Rules that supports the obligation of enclosing MPCB approvals as prerequisite of Nursing Home Registration.  Dr Arora added that hospitals were unaware of any order till date which mandates the local supervisory authority to withhold hospital registration for lack of MPCB consent and BMW authorisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mpcb-nod-not-must-at-time-of-hospital-registration-nmc/articleshow/87918681.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Sitting corporators and aspiring candidates too are holding health campsx where they offer pathology tests, free medicines and diagnostics, even free eye checks and spectacles. Across the city close to a dozen health camps have already been held and many more are lined up. Corporators say that due to the pandemic, awareness of health has increased and residents are turning up for the camps in huge numbers. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said that over 4,000 residents attended two camps he organised. “There is a huge demand for eye check-up and glasses with blood tests to detect diabetes. We are all offering special camps for children and women. We have special camps where paediatricians and gynaecologists examine residents. We have got a huge response since we give medicines too,” Shaikh said, adding that more camps are lined up over next few weeks. Political analysts said that with the redrawing of ward boundaries, many corporators and aspiring candidates are throwing their hat in the ring and health camps are proving to be crowd-pullers. In Malad, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra is lining up a special health camp for taxi and rickshaw drivers. “These people suffered during the pandemic. Many low-sincome families had deferred their medication and illnesses due to a drop in income or since they were in their villages. Now that they’re back, there’s huge demand for even basic health checks and medicines. We will organise a social camp for all taxi and rickshaw drivers. Many suffer from diabetes, back problem and blood pressure, so we will have a special focus on these diseases and give them free treatment not just free tests,” Mishra said. While many corporators have tied up with private hospitals and pathology labs for testing and treatment, some are taking support from civic-run hospitals. In Kalina, Congress corporator Tulip Miranda organised a free eye check-up and distributed glasses last week. “Many senior citizens have eye sight problems, but avoided stepping out during lockdown. But most are vaccinated and xare coming for eye check-ups. Over 750 residents turned up for the eye check-up and over 400 for the full body check-up and diabetes. We gave glasses to all those who wanted. More health check ups will be held in the next wseeks,” Miranda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/netas-check-on-voters-health-at-camps-as-bmc-polls-near-in-mumbai/articleshow/87919627.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

It was a dream project of former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. The MoEFCC had recently put up 14 objections to the UT administration’s proposal. The administration had sought the ministry’s permission to deforest 2.52 hectares of land in Sector 25 to extend the shooting range to bring it on a par with international standards. Bandore had given the approval to use the land for the shooting range and related infrastructure in a phased manner. A senior UT officer said a huge chunk of non-forestland was required for the project that was not available with the UT administration, which has already been struggling to allot land for UT employees’ housing scheme-2008. Moreover, the approval from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) was also required for using non-forestland. But as it was not available, 15,000 trees needed to be cut on the forest land, which was not viable, he said. Therefore, the UT administration has decided to shelve the project, he added. The ministry had sought details on 14 discrepancies in UT’s proposal, major being clarification on the number of trees and plants to be felled. The ministry had also sought a copy of approval of the project from a competent authority and legal status of the forestland. Sources said the UT has not submitted a reply to the ministry, as it was not pushing for the project. The UT sports department, which was executing the work, had proposed that around 16 acres in Sector 53 and Maloya had been approved against the forestland needed for the project. Both these areas are located on the border area of the city, adjoining Mohali. Moreover, the Maloya land was found to be encroached. “In Sector 53, around 10 acres had been given and six acres in Maloya against the Sector 25 forestland. But this too is not viable,” sources said. Following the orders of the former administrator, the UT had prepared all the related sketches and drawings of the initial phase of the project to develop trap and skeet facilities. The extension of the range was to come up in the later phases to develop it as per international standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-centres-firing-line-ut-plans-to-shelve-shooting-range-project/articleshow/87918683.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The latest accidents and suicides report released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reported 430 suicides, of which 91% are men. Around 41% of the businessmen who committed suicide happened to be vendors while tradesmen accounted for 10%. The rest were categorised under ‘other businesses.’ Interestingly, the trend in 2019 is in stark contrast to 2020 with 39% of suicides attributed to tradesmen while 36% of them were vendors. While the latest NCRB report does not categorise Covid or lockdown-related suicides, data shows that 782 people committed suicide due to ‘bankruptcy or indebtedness.’ Overall, suicide among businessmen accounts for 43% of total self-employed persons committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh (excluding farmers). Currently, AP ranks 10th in the country in terms of suicides by businessmen. Prominent instances of suicides and pact-suicides due to business debt have been reported across West Godavari, Vizag, Vijayawada, Kurnool, Chittoor, Nellore and Guntur districts since the pandemic began. Just a week ago, a 35-year-old Venkata Karthik, a businessman who runs an aquarium ended his life by hanging due to financial difficulties, in Bhimavaram, West Godavari. In August, three members belonging to the same family ended their lives by consuming insecticide at their home in Rachapalem village. Rise in suicide rates during pandemic year in AP doesn’t come as a surprise as entire country saw an increase in tradesmen committing suicides by over 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bizmen-suicides-rose-by-56-during-second-wave-of-covid/articleshow/87917853.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

CISCE also sent a circular to principals late on Thursday, saying evaluation and uploading of marks for ICSE (X) first-semester exams, scheduled to start from Monday, will be done on the test days from 1.30pm to 6.30pm. An examiner will evaluate not more than 45 scripts. Three papers of ISC first-semester exams, that of English I, English II and physics, have been completed. This year, evaluation of answer scripts and uploading of marks are being done on exam days. The ISC circular says since examiners have understood the new method of evaluation and submission of marks, they may be appointed for evaluation of scripts of multiple subjects. But as the number of candidates taking the exam at a given centre will keep changing for each subject, the number of examiners will also vary, the circular says. It also mentions each ISC examiner will get an appointment letter in his/her e-mail ID, which will mention the examiner number, different for each subject. “Examiners must make sure they use the correct examiner number at the time of uploading marks,” the circular says. School principals will be informed about the teachers being appointed. A similar intimation will be sent to principals and convenors, who are in charge of clusters of schools, about the schools where the examiners would have to report for evaluation. On the first day of the examination, examiners had a trying time finishing evaluation, which, in many schools stretched beyond midnight. Thereafter the council allowed exam centres to take the help of invigilators for evaluation and brought down the maximum number of scripts for each person from 35 to 20. But on the second day, examiners could not upload marks for several hours in the evening owing to a technical glitch, after which the council temporarily suspended the procedure for the day.  The evaluation of physics papers and the uploading of marks went off smoothly on Thursday, with most schools winding up by 8pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isc-examiners-may-have-to-check-multiple-subjects/articleshow/87918733.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s automated network now world’s fourth largest||NEW DELHI: Driverless train operations were launched on Delhi Metro’s 59-km-long Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) on Thursday by Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot. According to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, it now has the world’s fourth largest automated train network with 97km in the driverless system. The driverless train operation (DTO) facility was launched on the 37-km Magenta Line in 2020. Delhi Metro had then joined just 7% of the metro train systems across the world that run fully automated metro networks. With the addition of the Pink Line, DMRC’s driverless network is now ahead of other automated mass transit networks in the world like the Vancouver SkyTrain (79.6km) and Dubai Metro (89.6km). Delhi Metro’s driverless network is marginally shorter than that of Kuala Lumpur’s Rapid KL system (97.4km). In the next couple of years, after the completion of the 12.5km Maujpur-Majlis Park extension, currently underway as part of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV expansion, Delhi Metro’s automated network will be among the world’s largest alongside Shanghai Metro (101.8km) and Singapore MRT (199km). Driverless operations will also be available on the upcoming Tughlakabad-Aerocity (Silver line). Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that when the Phase IV additions are done, Delhi Metro would be the world’s second largest driverless metro network with 160km of DTO-equipped corridors. After the launch, Puri said that in 11 months of Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching the first driverless train operations on the Magenta Line, another 59-km stretch of driverless operations had been added. The Union minister said that DMRC had established yet another proud moment in the country’s journey towards affordable, inclusive and sustainable public transportation. Congratulating DMRC for achieving the feat, transport minister Gahlot said that driverless operations would also mean more safety for passengers as there would likely be minimised chances of human error. Dayal said that in the DTO system, the driver will initially be present in the train to instil a sense of confidence among the travellers and to provide any assistance. He said that DTO’s higher level of diagnostic features will aid the shift from conventional ‘time-based maintenance’ to ‘condition-based maintenance’. “This will also reduce maintenance down time of trains,” said Dayal. The DMRC official said that the urban train company had already started reaping the benefits of driverless operations on its Magenta Line in terms of increased availability of coaches for service. “Reliability of the trains have increased manifold due to exhaustive self-tests done before induction in service every day, which automatically eliminates all possibilities of human error,” Dayal said, adding that the benefits would further increase with a longer network under driverless train operation. He added that DTO would bring in more flexibility in train operations, reduce human interventions and, thus, human errors. “It will also help in improving the availability of coaches for service. The driverless trains will eliminate the manual process of checking done before induction, subsequently reducing the burden on train operators,” said Dayal, adding that the parking on stabling lines in the depots would also be carried out automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metros-automated-network-now-worlds-fourth-largest/articleshow/87918702.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The move comes a day after joint director of health Dr Nitin Ambadekar visited Nashik civil hospital, where smoke from the switch of a baby warmer in the Sick and New-born Care Unit (SNCU) of the hospital was detected on November 22. The staff quickly evacuated babies. “The collector approved the funds for equipment to be set up in the hospitals across the district. The fire department and electrical division of Public Works Department (PWD) had recommended these for the hospitals – the rural, the sub-district hospitals in the rural areas and the civil hospital,” civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said. The funds will be provided through the District Planning Committee. On November 22, the staff of the Nashik civil hospital detected smoke from a baby warmer at the SNCU and quickly shifted the babies to a safe place. The PWD engineers were called at the place, who rectified the issues. On Wednesday late evening, Ambadekar carried out the inspection of the hospital. The hospital directed the local authorities to ensure all fire detecting and fire fighting equipment as advised were put in place. The fire department and the PWD, which had carried out the fire audit of the establishments had recommended ‘raisers’ (network of pipes to carry water to each floor in case of emergency), smoke detectors, sprinklers, fire alarms etc. The fire audit was carried out after the fire broke out in SNCU in Bhandara civil hospital in January this year. The officials said the work on the installation of the equipment would be expedited soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-collector-okays-rs-7-4-crore-for-fire-fighting-equipment-at-rural-hosps/articleshow/87917161.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The bank is headed by former BJP MLA Chainsukh Sancheti. This is the second cooperative bank in Vidarbha on which RBI clamped restrictions on withdrawals within a month under section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act. In November first week, RBI had barred withdrawals of over Rs5,000 from the Babaji Datey Mahila Sahakari Bank, Yavatmal. Sources said Covid has taken a toll on the functioning of banks. Around 15 banks are under the monitoring of the task force on urban cooperatives (TAFCUB). This is a RBI headed body which keeps tabs on weak banks. Similar action is expected in 4-5 more banks in the coming days if the situation does not improve, said sources. Even as some banks have come out of the crisis, others have been added to the list. This is mainly due to Covid hitting businesses of borrowers, said a source following the matter. Unlike other cases, which includes banks in Nagpur, where fraud led to action by the RBI, here it was due to NPAs. In case of Malkapur Urban, the net NPAs had touched 20% of the total loans. The permissible limit is 6% of total loans. The bank was under TAFCUB monitoring for 1.5 years finally leading to the action, said the source. There are certain points which trigger action under Section 35(A) by the RBI. High NPAs is one of them. The bank’s capital adequacy is reported at 2.2% as against the recommended level of 9%, said sources. The bank has 28 branches majority of which are in Aurangabad. Sancheti, chairman of Malkapur Urban, said the cooperative had 95,000 odd depositors and the total deposits stood at Rs1,200 crore. Of these, 95% of the deposits are within Rs5 lakh and are totally covered under the government’s insurance scheme. “The bank has high NPAs as businesses were hit due to Covid. Following the RBI move, even borrowers are cooperating by coming forward to clear their dues,” he said. Chairman Vidya Kelkar of Babaji Datey Mahila Bank could not be contacted. The bank is known to be run by a RSS affiliated management. “For the first time, RBI has also barred renewal of existing loan limits by these banks. This is expected to only worsen the case. If the limits are not extended, the borrowers are likely to withhold repayment, further adding to NPAs. The matter has been taken up by the Vidarbha Urban Banks Federation,” said Kailashchandra Agrawal, federation chairman. Ravindra Durugkar, federation director, said bar on renewal will ultimately close a source of income for the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rbi-curbs-on-malkapur-urban-coop-bank-covid-has-led-to-high-npas/articleshow/87918700.cms||Shishir Arya

The Mumbai Naka police have booked the minor who was riding the vehicle without licence. The accident had taken place at 8.30 am on Tuesday. The child had received serious head injuries and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Senior police officer Bhagirath Deshmukh said, “The child was riding a non-geared two-wheeler alone on the wrong side of the road. Grievously injured, he was being treated at a hospital where he succumbed on Wednesday.” “The road where the accident took place is comparatively wide. However, because of the way the minor was riding, the collision had a huge impact,” the officer said. According to Bhagwan Bhoye, a police employee who registered the complaint with the Mumbai Naka police, said: “After the incident, the victim was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed. Therefore, a medico-legal case was registered. Further investigations were carried out.” Bhoye added the police visited the spot and carried out the panchanama with the help of eyewitnesses. A case under section 304(A) (causing death due to negligence), 292 (rash driving on public way) were slapped on the deceased. Deshmukh pointed out that the victim’s father had bought the vehicle which was yet to be registered in his name. Therefore, the original owner of the vehicle will now be booked under the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/14-year-old-rams-2-wheeler-into-pole-while-riding-on-wrong-side-succumbs-to-injuries/articleshow/87917166.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Jayprakash Jategaonkar, who is the convener and the chief executive of the festival and also the office-bearer of Lokhitwadi Mandal that is hosting the event, said the names of all the people who have been invited for the inauguration and the chief guest have been sanctioned by the Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal. There is rising discontent among the litterateurs over the invitation to Patil, while some organisations have also expressed their displeasure over inviting renowned lyricist Javed Akhtar as the chief guest of the festival. A media briefing was held on Thursday by the organisers to unveil the schedule of the three-day event. When asked about Patil facing corruption charges and the reservations over his name, Jategaonkar said, “There were charges of corruption against Patil. That much we know. But what happened to them later we do not know.” To the question over invitation to Akhtar not going down well with various organisations, he said, “Mahamandal was aware of and has approved all the invitations.” When asked whether chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be coming for the inauguration event, Jategaonkar said the president of welcome committee, Chhagan Bhujbal, had invited the CM and they were hoping he would come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/organisers-skip-posers-on-invite-to-vishwas-patil/articleshow/87917173.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While the police claimed that four Torrent staffers and 3 policemen were injured in the incident, the power company claimed that 17 of their employees and seven cops had received injuries. Till reports last came in, the process to file complaints was still going on. Police said, “The Torrent power team received information that largescale theft was taking place near Nagina Pol and other areas in Dariapur. The team accompanied by local police tried to carry out a search in the area. However, a group of locals pelted stones at them.” As tension gripped the area, a message was flashed as the area is communally sensitive. At least 10 police inspectors from different police stations and several senior officials rushed to the spot. ACP (Sector II) Gautam Parmar said the checking began at 8 am and heavy stone pelting took placehalf an hour later. “We immediately stopped the operation and decided to continue it after reviewing the situation. To ease tension, we sought the help of local leaders,” he said, adding that the search operation would continue again but the local leaders have sought time to work out a solution. A Torrent Power spokesperson said, “Torrent Power employees with police help undertook a drive on Thursday to detect electricity theft in Nagina Pol. The team detected 18 cases of theft before some miscreants began pelting stones at our employees and the policemen to prevent further detection of electricity theft. This resulted in injury to 17 Torrent staffers and 7 police officials. Two of our team members received serious injuries and have been hospitalised.” Police said, “In order to ensure the situation does not escalate further, traffic from Delhi Chakla to Dariapur was stopped. No outsider was allowed into the area. Two complaints are being registered against residents and a search operation to identify the accused has begun.” Last year, a team of Torrent Power employees was attacked and threatened when they went to check illegal connections in Sarkhej. A complaint was also lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stones-pelted-at-torrent-staff-cops/articleshow/87918705.cms||---

The accused, Joseph Khandagale, was found guilty under section 170 of the IPC relating to pretending to be a public servant. While the section provides a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or fine or both, the court let off the accused on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act. “Considering the nature of offence character of the offender and peculiar facts of the case it would be expedient to release him on probation of good conduct instead of sentencing him,” the court said. The accused has been out on bail. The court said that for a year the accused has “to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-matunga-man-who-posed-as-cop-let-off-with-1-yr-probation/articleshow/87919637.cms||Rebecca Samervel

After the verification, we will get Rs 50,000,” she said. “After my husband’s death, I have been doing domestic work to run my household and raise my two school-going children. This money will help us.” While state authorities claimed the process is smooth for relatives of Covid-19 victims, many Amdavadis sweated it out to gather the documents that need to be submitted in order to receive the Rs 50,000 compensation. Rajendra Trivedi, the state revenue minister, on Thursday said, “We have directed that the details of all families of Covid victims be collated and they be helped to fill forms and complete other processes so they can be paid Rs 50,000 within the next 10 days.” The state administration said that the mamlatdar offices will would oversee the collecting of forms and collating of information for payment.

---||Kolhapur||South Maha districts may struggle to meet vax deadline||Kolhapur: All four districts in south Maharashtra region are unlikely to meet the November 30 deadline to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries with at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine. Kolhapur district, which initially had the highest vaccination rate, has now managed to administer the first dose of the vaccine to just 87% of the target population of around 30 lakh. It will have to vaccinate four lakh beneficiaries in the next five days to meet the deadline. Its coverage of the second dose is comparatively low (41%). Among the four districts, Solapur district has the lowest vaccination. Only 69% of the target population has been vaccinated with the first dose and just 23% with the second dose. Solapur district collector Milind Shabharkar said, “We have made several appeals repeatedly to the eligible beneficiaries to get the jabs as early possible. We have adequate doses available. We are trying our best to address vaccine hesitancy through various means.” A countrywide drive has been launched to reach the doorsteps of beneficiaries to check if they have been vaccinated, and to give the vaccine to those who are left out. However, many people are reluctant to take the jab owing to misconceptions. In all the four districts, most of the population above 60 years of age has been vaccinated with the first dose and more than half of them have also received the second dose. The focus is on vaccinating the 18-44 age group. Health experts have said that vaccinating all eligible population with at least one dose of the vaccine will help achieve the required herd immunity to prevent any major Covid outbreak. It has been found that the vaccination helps in reducing mortality, especially among the elderly population. Sangli is leading in second dose vaccination in the region with 45% of eligible population receiving the second jab as well. Satara district is second after Kolhapur in vaccinating beneficiaries with the first dose but it is lagging in vaccinating with the second dose, only 37% have got the second dose. Satara district collector Shekhar Singh said, “Considering the threat of third wave, the maximum eligible population needs to be vaccinated at the earliest. We have adequate doses available with us. We are focusing on vaccinating those sections of society, which come in contact with large number of people every day.” Health experts have said that in case of a third wave of Covid, the mortality rate will certainly not be impacted from the current (3%) if a large number of people are vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/south-maha-districts-may-struggle-to-meet-vax-deadline/articleshow/87916625.cms||---

After losing the elections, they contested the results alleging irregularities and collusion between the election officials and BJP. The four candidates had also filed an application calling for election-related documents, materials and EVM before the court. “The court noted that as the petitioners have challenged the result, there is no need to produce any election-related materials before the court,” said advocate Nehal Sutariya, who is representing the four winning BJP candidates. The court also pointed out that if particular documents or EVMs are required to be examined then it will pass an appropriate order at the time. The Congress candidates had created a ruckus at the time of counting of votes in February. Parmar had alleged that the election officials had first declared him as the winner in the result sheet but later made corrections to declare the BJP candidate as winner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/court-junks-cong-candidates-plea-to-produce-evms/articleshow/87918112.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The oath-taking ceremony will be held at the government offices across the state at 11am. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s address on the occasion of ‘Nasha Mukti Diwas’ will be telecast live. The authorities in the districts have already made arrangements for the live show of the CM’s address in the government offices. Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan has written to all the district magistrates and the superintendents of police besides heads of different departments to hold pledge-taking events. The proof of pledge, including video, photos and in writing, has to be submitted to the prohibition, excise and registration department. State water resources department minister Sanjay Jha said arrangements for pledge-taking events across the state have already been made by the authorities concerned. “The decision to enforce prohibition in the state was taken by the CM to save future generations,” he said. Describing enforcement of prohibition as a bold initiative of the CM, Jha said the government has taken the issue of implementing the prohibition law in the state as a challenge. “All measures are being taken by the government for the purpose,” he said. Muzaffarpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar said the live streaming of the CM’s programme will be telecast in all offices at the district headquarters, sub-divisions and in the blocks. Besides, different programmes would be held in government schools and other institutions to mark ‘Nasha Mukti Diwas’. The decision to take oath again on prohibition was announced by the CM on Monday, a week after a high-level review meeting on implementation of the prohibition law in the state. The seven-hour-long marathon meeting concluded with the decision to launch an awareness campaign more vigorously and conduct raids to check brewing, sale and consumption of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-neither-drink-nor-allow-liquor-sale-bihar-to-vow-today/articleshow/87918356.cms||Ramashankar

---||Hyderabad||No bottoms up for Hyderabad, Telangana districts lead in drinking||HYDERABAD: Alcohol consumption among Hyderabad’s men and women seems to be much lower than those living in other parts of Telangana. At least that’s what the latest National Family Health Survey (NHFS-5) data suggests. It’s numbers show that about 43 per cent of men in the districts — aged 15 to 49 years — are liquor enthusiasts while the count in the city is just about 28 per cent. It is closely followed by Adilabad at 28.3 per cent. The NHFS-5 data debunks another stereotype: That most working women drink in Hyderabad. In fact, according to it, women — in the same age group — figure at the bottom of the charts with a meagre 0.7 per cent of them consuming alcohol. Another intriguing revelation in the report comes from Khammam. The district that received over 7,000 applications in the recent liquor auction — highest in the state — has just 31.8 per cent of men who enjoy their alcohol. Interestingly, it’s the small and rural district of Jangaon that has maximum men — 60.6 per cent— hitting the bottle. It is followed by Yadadari Bhongir district (58.4 per cent), Mahbubabad (56.5 per cent), Nagarkurnool (55.5 per cent), Warangal Rural (54.4 per cent) Medak (54 per cent) Jayashankar Bhupalpalli (53.1 per cent), Nalgonda (51.4 per cent) and Siddipet (50.3 per cent). Sources in the government say that while population density may be a factor leading to these startling findings, the percentage of people drinking in cities may also be lower due to high level of awareness among them about the health risks associated with alcohol. “While the city has the largest number of liquor stores, they contribute more towards sales than consumption percentage,” said an industry insider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-bottoms-upfor-city-t-distslead-in-drinking/articleshow/87919060.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The company said these results compare well with the 65.2% efficacy against the Delta variant obtained during the controlled phase III clinical trials of Covaxin that were conducted among the general population. “This study also shows that Covaxin meets the World Health Organisation (WHO) efficacy criteria for Covid-19 vaccines for the dreaded Delta variant,” Bharat Biotech said while commending the AIIMS investigators for the study on Covaxin. Bharat Biotech’s clinical lead for Covid-19, Raches Ella, too commented on the findings of the study. “Covaxin vaccine effectiveness in health care professionals (HCP’s) is 50%. These findings are encouraging in a community that has a higher force of infection (during the Delta Indian outbreak April-May 2021)…” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bb-aiims-study-proves-covaxins-effectiveness/articleshow/87919066.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Over 50% of Hyderabad’s children, women anaemic||HYDERABAD: More than 60% children in Hyderabad are anaemic indicating a serious iron deficiency in their food intake, shows national family health survey (NFHS-5) data released on November 24 by the Union health ministry. The report also points to a significant population of women — about 52% of those surveyed — in the city suffering from anaemic. The numbers are much the same at the state-level. Anaemia, caused primarily due to iron deficiency, is a condition which is marked by low levels of haemoglobin in the blood. Over the last four years, Telangana has seen a substantial increase in prevalence of anaemic cases among children and adults, according to the NFHS-5 report for 2019-20. Figures indicate that 70 per cent children between six months and five years of age, 58 per cent women and 15 percent men in Telangana are anaemic. In fact, according to the report, the overall prevalence of anaemia among children increased from 61% in NFHS-4 released in 2014-15 to 70% in NFHS-5 for 2019-20 released recently. “Poor dietary habits result in lack of iron deficiency that in turn leads to anaemia. Not just this, anaemia is also caused due to hookworms that are most common among children who play in the mud and eat their food without washing their hands,” said Dr Sudarshan Reddy, general physician at Nithya Clinic. Doctors say the deficiency results in weakness, diminished physical and mental capacity, increased morbidity from infectious diseases, impaired cognitive performance. Children of mothers who have anaemia are found to be more susceptible. Highlighting that incidence of anaemia is high among women too, the survey shows 58 per cent women in Telangana suffer from it — 22 per cent with mild anaemia, 31 per cent with moderate anaemia and 5 per cent with severe anaemia. “Since women lose a lot of blood during their menstrual cycle, they are more susceptible to be anaemic. Most women have haemoglobin in the range of 9 to 11 grams per deciliter while for men it is around 13. Worse, women tend to neglect signs of anaemia,” said Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu, consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda urging women to seek medical help in case of prolonged fatigue and weakness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-half-of-hyds-children-women-anaemic-nfhs/articleshow/87919056.cms||Preeti Biswas

As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) survey, five per cent have experienced some kind of sexual violence by their husband.

That proportion more than doubles to 61 per cent among ever-married women who have experienced both physical and sexual violence,” according to the NFHS report. Most common injuries among women who have experienced physical and sexual violence are cuts, bruises or aches (56 per cent), deep wounds, broken bones, broken teeth or any other serious injury (16 per cent), eye injuries, sprains, dislocations or minor burns (23 per cent) and severe burns (22 per cent).

Mandava Kutumba Rao, who is an electrician by profession, has eternalised the memories of his wife by installing her wax idol after her demise. Rao spent Rs 7 lakhs to ‘bring’ her back home. Rao is known for his social work and environmental activities. His daughter Mandava Sasya lives in the US. Rao and his wife Kasi Annapurna used to have an organic garden on rooftop and they also took care of the plants on the roadside. Annapurna died of illness in July 2020 during the first wave of Covid-19. Rao, who became upset over her death, went into depression and stayed away from work. After coming across an article about an idol installed by a family in Bengaluru, Sasya decided to have a similar one at her home and give a life-long companionship to her father. City-based sculptor Prasad worked for around 40 days and made the idol of Annapurna. Rao’s family installed the idol on a swing at his house. “I’m emotionally connected to my wife who spent 40 years with me. She is a nature lover and her memories haunt me. I was very happy to see my wife’s life-size idol. It made me feel like my wife is with me all day,” Rao told TOI. Artist Prasad said they used clay and wax to make the idol and took utmost care to give it a natural look.

Bhagwat Shah, 57, a resident of Aaryaman bungalows in Shilaj, said in his FIR with the city crime branch that the accused Dilip Bharani was introduced to him by lawyers in the Gujarat high court named Shaurin Mehta, Vishal Thakkar and Kirtan Rao, son of a lawyer Bharat Rao, as Shah wanted to buy a high-end car in June this year.

He advised the government to study admission rates in different parts of the country. He welcomed the decision to introduce online ticketing. Chiranjeevi’s appeal to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy came on Thursday following the government making it clear that the number of shows will continue to be restricted to four a day and online ticketing will be introduced to get correct assessment. The decision came as a shock to the Telugu film industry as representations had been made to AP government on its demands. Chiranjeevi met Jagan personally. “While it is welcome that online ticketing is introduced in the name of transparency, the admission rates should be increased for not only the survival of theatres but keeping in view of the number of people who are dependent on cinema for livelihood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hike-admission-rates-in-ap-theatres-chiru/articleshow/87918735.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Counselling deferred again, medical aspirants in a limbo||Mumbai: With the medical counselling rounds deferred by four more weeks, aspirants for both MD/MS and MBBS courses are in a limbo. The Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing for January 6 in a batch of pleas challenging Centre's notification to implement OBC and EWS reservations in all-India quota seats for undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses. Admissions have already been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Hospitals in the state are also strained with only two-thirds of the resident doctors' strength managing both Covid and non-Covid work for six months due to this delay. The central government sought four weeks to review the Rs 8 lakh-income criteria for determining eligibility under EWS quota. NEET-PG for MD/MS admissions was held in September this year due to the second wave. Usually it is held in January. While the counselling process was to commence on October 25, petitions challenging the Centre's July 29 notification stalled the process. Dr Yash Tekwani, a petitioner, said that they want MBBS doctors to be treated as equals for PG medical admissions. "Since we already lost time, we had appealed to the court to start this year's admissions without applying the quotas. The government, though, has sought time to review," he said. A government official said, “NEET-PG 2022 is scheduled to be held in March. With this year's batch still in limbo, we don't know how another batch could be managed.” With the criteria for EWS being reviewed, the outcome could affect other admissions too, he added. In state, senior resident doctors (2018 batch) were relieved from their residency on July 1. Since then, hospitals are managing with only two batches of resident doctors, instead of three. “Though there are fewer cases, the jumbo centres and Covid wards are still functioning. Non-Covid work has increased as elective surgeries were postponed in the pandemic. What if we see a surge in Covid cases now?” asked Sion Hospital's Dr Akshay Yadav, national vice-president of Indian Medical Association's junior doctors' network, adding that they want PG counselling to be completed in a fast-track manner. While the NEET-UG results for MBBS and BDS courses were out early this month, admissions cannot commence till the all-India round starts. “Since the July 29 circular is applicable to all-India quota seats in UG too, MBBS admissions also cannot commence in state. The first round of admissions in the state can start only after the first all-India round concludes,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, former director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-counselling-deferred-again-medical-aspirants-in-a-limbo/articleshow/87919656.cms||Yogita Rao

He hasn’t reported for duty after he was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner. Singh moved the SC to get protection from arrest. Nobody will believe his contention in the apex court that he faces threat to his life,” Malik told reporters. Last week, a magistrate’s court had declared Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city. Singh, currently posted as DG, Home Guards, had attended his office last in May, after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay HC in October that his whereabouts were not known. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil of the NCP also said on Thursday that he was shocked to know that Singh, who has earlier served as police commissioner of Mumbai and Thane, should feel a threat to his life. “I am shocked to know that a person who has held the post of police commissioner of Mumbai and Thane should feel a threat to his life,” Walse Patil told reporters. The minister was reacting to Singh’s plea in SC on Monday that he was hiding as he faced a threat to his life.

On Thursday, 25,909 samples were collected in the state. “We have increased sampling in the state for Covid testing. We are collecting more than 24,000 samples daily, which looks fairly good because the positivity rate in the state is just 0.01% while nationally it is 1%,” Vaibhav Galriya, secretary (health), told TOI. Denying allegations that sampling was not being done in the state in a way it should be done, he said it came to his notice that some districts are not uploading sampling figures on ICMR portal. In November (till 25th), the number of sampling done in the state was 3.8 lakh. However, the figures shows a declining trend. Highest number of sampling was done in May when 19.3 lakh samples were collected. This was followed by 12.77 lakh samples in June, 10.66 lakh (July), 7.74 lakh (August) and 4.41 lakh (October). The health department officials said keeping in mind the low positivity rate in the state, the number of sampling they are doing was acceptable and now as the cases are on the rise, they have increased the sampling across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-rise-in-cases-health-dept-increases-sampling/articleshow/87918738.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Activists seek property tax waiver for small homes||AURANGABAD: After Thane Municipal Corporation general body passed a resolution to waive the property tax for flats measuring up to 500 square feet recently, the local civic activists have now demanded similar relief for property owners in Aurangabad. In a memorandum submitted to the state government, civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) should take a cue from Thane civic body and waive the property tax for houses measuring in the range of 800 to 1,000 square feet permanently. “Around six lakh property holders will benefit from the desired decision. Such a measure is essential considering the larger interest of the citizens from low-income groups,” he said. Datey-Patil said the permanent waiver in property tax would have little impact on the income of the local civic body. “Aurangabad is already a part of the Centre’s Smart City Mission, which ensures necessary fund-flow. Moreover, the state and the Centre keeps funding the local civic body under different schemes and programmes. The AMC, on its own, can explore more income avenues to compensate towards the revenue lost due to waiver in property tax to smaller houses,” he said. Ruled by the Shiv Sena, the Thane civic body has passed the proposal for the waiver in the property tax to the state government, which is expected to take the final call on the issue. While the move is dubbed as a poll gimmick ahead of the Thane civic elections, AMC is also slated to go for the poll in near future. “Since Aurangabad Municipal Corporation is in the dissolved state now following the expiry of the term, and is ruled by the administrator, the general body of the AMC does not exist for taking any call on the demand for the waiver in property tax,” a senior civic official said, preferring anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/activists-seek-property-tax-waiver-for-small-homes/articleshow/87917207.cms||---

The committee also announced the quantum of punishment for about 67 students for mass-copying in the exam. The punitive action for these students includes cancellation of results and debarment from taking exams for two semesters. “From commas to full stops to sentence formation, the answer sheets of all these 67 students have a striking resemblance, making a strong case for mass copying. There is a possibility that someone had dictated them the answers for one of the remedial semester exams,” said sources in GTU. In all, the role of about 72 students from the college was under scrutiny for cheating in the remedial examination. However, five students were allowed to go scot-free after the committee could not get enough evidence against them. The committee has also barred the college from having an exam centre. The issue came to light during the evaluation of the exam answer sheets. “The descriptive answers written by a large number of students from this diploma college were found to be similar. On closer examination, it turned out to be a case of mass copying,” said sources in GTU. The university had also issued a notice to the college authorities, seeking an explanation for such large-scale irregularity in conducting the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/commas-full-stops-identical-for-67-students/articleshow/87918761.cms||---

Many have begun a rigorous clean-up and taken up maintenance work on their premises for offline classes. An estimated 1.69 lakh students of Classes I to VII in Nashik city, and over 22,000 students of Classes I to IV in the rural areas will begin attending school from the next month after staying away for 18 months. There are 92 schools under the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and 271 private schools in the city, and 1,600 zilla parishad schools. The NMC and ZP education departments will issue guidelines for all schools once they get the intimation from the education department. Education officer Sunita Dhangar said the current SOPs for students of higher classes would be replicated for the primary section.  “We will ensure that school managements adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour, have a small number of students in a classroom, and provide for sanitisers and other health equipment,” she added.  Both the NMC and the ZP will direct the schools’ managements to undertake sanitisation of the classrooms before December 1.  Himgauri Aher-Adke, the chairperson of the Association of Nashik Schools, for over 25 ICSE and CBSE schools, said all their member schools would follow Covid safety protocols. In Kolhapur, civic schoolteachers are currently on vaccination duty, and will be called back for full-time teaching. Shankar Yadav, administrator of schools in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), said as many as 75,000 students will join classes physically from December 1. “So far, online teaching is going on and some private schools have taken up community teaching with parental consent,” he added. Government schools have adopted group teaching in the rural areas of Kolhapur district. “We don’t have preparations to undertake before the start of the schools for primary classes. We have 1.5 lakh students enrolled in the Classes I to IV. We are waiting for the guidelines from the government. The unaided schools too will now start offline classes,” Asha Ubale, primary education officer of Kolhapur ZP, told TOI. Education officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Ramnath Thore said the civic administration would draft separate Covid-prevention guidelines for reopening of primary schools. “The school authorities as well as parents have to ensure adherence of children to Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said. Acting primary education officer at Aurangabad Zilla Parishad B B Chavan could not be reached for his comments. Meanwhile, from completing the second dose vaccination for more than 95% of its teachers to paying off the outstanding electricity bills so that classrooms have power and getting the furniture in ship shape, primary schools under the Pune zilla parishad are all set to welcome the students of junior classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/schools-start-sprucing-up-premises-for-primary-classes/articleshow/87917204.cms||---

The employees from 13 depots and divisional workshop in Nashik gathered at the divisional office and decided to stay put on their demand of complete merger of the corporation with the state government, saying the hike in salary announced by the state government was never part of their demands. “The government, in the past several times, has announced hike in salary, dearness allowances, house rent, among others and every time part of the hike was passed on to the employees and some part was held back or not paid at all. So now the salary hike was never part of our demands,” Sameer Patil, Rajesh Dheple, Keshav Khode and several others, who are part of the employees agitating for their rights, said. A woman conductor of the MSRTC said, “We have now pledged not to enter the bus depots till our demand merger is accepted. There is no union representing us as they have not done anything good to the employees except for the office-bearers. This time it is a do-or-die situation for us.” Meanwhile, MSRTC officials, who held several meetings and rounds of talks with the employees, said the employees did not seem to be in the mood to end the agitation. “We have been in talks with employees asking them to resume work. As directed, we will wait till 8 am on Friday. Serious action would be taken against those not resuming work,” an MSRTC official said. End agitaion: Shetti Former MP and leader of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana Raju Shetti appealed to the MSRTC employees to end their strike. “Not all demands can be met in one go and there is a limit to stretch things. Salary hike and the demand for merger are being considered. Hence, the employees should now return to duty. People in rural areas, especially students are dependent on MSRTC services and strike is affecting them badly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/staffers-link-return-to-work-to-merger-or-court-decision/articleshow/87917201.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Vijayawada||Sarpanches protest state’s ‘fund diversion’||Amaravati: Sarpanches are up in arms against the state government following the alleged diversion of finance commission grants from village accounts. The state government last week deducted nearly Rs 2,400 crore from village panchayat accounts. The sarpanches, who have been eagerly waiting for the remittance of the finance commission grants since they got elected about eight months ago, were shocked after finding the accounts with zero balance a day after getting the receipts. In fact, the sarpanches have been spending on bleaching powder and all other emergency needs from their own pocket with the hope that they will get their money back soon after receiving the finance commission grants. They were shocked after realizing that the government had deducted the finance commission grant without any information. Village sarpanches have started agitations in almost all the districts demanding that the government return their money. About 10 sarpanches from Khazipeta mandal in Kadapa district have threatened to quit their posts and the YSRC in protest. “We have spent huge amounts from our pocket for maintenance of village sachivalayams, sanitation, repairs of street lights and motors of drinking water schemes in the last eight months. It is unacceptable that the government has diverted the 14th and 15th finance commission grants,” said P Srinivasa Reddy, Khazipeta mandal sarpanches’ association president. He said many of the sarpanches have become bankrupt due to the high expenditure met from their personal funds. However, the agitating sarpanches in Khazipeta backtracked after local legislator Raghuramireddy took them to task for creating controversy over the issue. Sources said the government has deducted the finance commission grants to clear power dues as per Centre’s directive. “The Centre has directed us to clear the power dues from finance commission grants on priority basis. However, only about 30-40 per cent of the panchayats which have high power dues faced the trouble as only a portion of the total grant was deducted at source,” confirmed a senior official. He, however, explained that they were opening separate bank accounts for panchayat executive officers and linking them with the CFMS portal. Sources said government has deducted the finance commission grants to clear power dues as per Central government’s directive||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sarpanches-protest-states-fund-diversion/articleshow/87917939.cms||Samdani MN

---||Delhi||Infant Mortality Rate In City Improves In Last Five Years||New Delhi: There has been a significant improvement in the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), or the number of deaths per 1,000 births, and Under-five Mortality Rate (UMR), or the number of children dying before age 5 per 1,000 births, in Delhi in the last five years. According to the results of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2020-21 and released by the Union health ministry on Wednesday, the capital recorded 24.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the latest assessment. This is significantly lower than the IMR of 31.2 recorded in the survey conducted in 2015-16. The UMR in 2020-21 was 30.6 per 1,000 live births, which is significantly lower than 42.2 in 2015-16. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said the dip in IMR and UMR was a positive sign and it reflected the overall socio-economic development in the state. “There has been significant improvement in areas like institutional deliveries, first-hour breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and universal immunisation. All this has a direct impact on reducing mortality rate in children,” he said. The neonatal mortality rate (NMR), or children dying within 28 days of their birth, has dipped only marginally from 17.8 per 1,000 live births in 2015-16 to 17.5 per 1,000 live births in 2020-21, the survey results show. Dr Gupta, who is also a senior paediatrician, said that this was a worrisome trend. “We need to improve the number of neonatal ICUs in the city significantly to reduce NMR,” he said. Nationally, the NMR, IMR and UMR rates are 24.9, 35.2 and 41.9, respectively. Across India, the latest NFHS survey shows that 88.6% of births took place in medications institutions, such as hospitals and nursing homes. In Delhi, the latest survey report shows, the rate of institutional delivery is 91.8% of total births. Five years ago, in 2015-16, the institutional births in Delhi was calculated at t 84.4%. According to the NFHS survey, deliveries through Caesarean section in the capital has gone down from 26.7% to 23.6% of all institutional births in the last five years. In private hospitals, the latest survey data shows, nearly 42% of deliveries were through Caesarean section, while in public hospitals, the percentage of Caesarean section deliveries was approximately 18%. The sex ratio at birth has increased in the national capital from 812 girls per 1,000 boys in 2015-16 to 923 girls per 1,000 boys now, according to the NFHS survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/infant-mortality-rate-in-city-improves-in-last-five-years/articleshow/87918750.cms||---

Though the bovines were on the roadside earth shoulders, police suspect that an unidentified speeding vehicle could have ran over them. Some locals found a herd of the bovines lying in a blood pool with some already dead along the highway soil shoulder, and later informed some animal lovers who provided primary aid to the injured animals. Some even called animal husbandry veterinarians to treat the animals. People also managed to transport three injured cows to Shikeri Goushala at Mayem, Bicholim. By the time people noticed the incident, four bovines were already dead on the spot. The veterinarian treated two animals, while two were run over after the accident. Of the three cows sent to Mayem, one died by the evening and the remaining two were critical, said Kamalakant Tari, chairman of Shikeri Goushala.

Cama Hospital was where the presence of mind of the staff prevented the terrorists from taking hostages. “We earlier thought there was a celebration going on with the noise and people running amok. We soon realized that something was amiss – I saw two guards just collapsing after gunfire. A panicked message by the telephone operator asked us to implement complete blackout,” recounted Rahate, a staff nurse at the hospital on Thursday. “We were ready with spirit to attack terrorist and used stretchers to block path amid blackout. We even prevented the children from crying, lest the intruders know any specific location.” Rahate was among the three nurses – the two others being Yogita Bagad and Laxmi Shetty – who were virtually present on the occasion of launch of documentary ‘More Than Uniform: Nurses at the Frontline of 26/11’ on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the terror attack on Mumbai at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A). The documentary is created by IIM-A professor Rajesh Chandwani along with a team from National Institute of Design (NID) led by Anshuman and consultant Vinita Satija. “We were working on a project of disaster management by National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) when we stumbled upon the case of Cama Hospital. We generally associate a good response with thorough training and company ethics – but here was the case where the nurses worked on their intuition and humanity to ensure that all the patients get saved,” said Prof Chandwani, adding that the documentary will be launched on YouTube on Friday that encompasses first-hand account of 11 staff nurses. The nurses said that it took a long time for them to come out of the trauma of the incident. “Some training and preparedness will surely help the staff. But at the end of the day, if we don the uniform, it’s our moral responsibility to put the patients first,” said Shetty. Prof Chandwani said that the learning from the event will be taught in the HR practices course to the IIM-A students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kept-spirit-ready-to-attack-terrorist/articleshow/87918772.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Death in repeat crime trial only after 1st conviction’||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday held that the death sentence as provided under section 376E of the IPC, introduced after the Nirbhaya case to penalise repeat offenders, can be awarded in a case which is tried after the first conviction for a similar offence. It ruled that the provision for repeat offenders was not attracted in the Shakti Mills case. The HC noted that following the insertion of Section 376D and 376E of IPC, the punishment prescribed under the newly introduced law was given effect for the first time in the Shakti Mills case. Section 376E is not an offence by itself, the court pointed out, but is an enhanced punishment contemplated for repeat rape offenders. The bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan said “the conviction in both the cases was recorded on the same day i.e. on 20th March, 2013, one after another, consecutively in succession. Both the convictions were on the same day and therefore, one would fail to understand which was the previous conviction.’’ The HC added: “A highly pedantic approach was adopted by the trial court while considering that the conviction (in the telephone operator case) amounts to previous conviction. The special prosecutor submitted the draft charge and it was accepted. No time was lost in pronouncing the judgments of conviction in both cases.” “We would not take a pedantic approach to mean that it contemplates commission of an offence after the first conviction as under section 75 of the IPC.” The section contemplates an enhanced sentence for a person convicted the second time for certain offences. “But it would mean that the sentence of death penalty may be awarded in a case which is tried after the first conviction for a similar offence,” it added. Advocate Yug Chaudhry, appointed as counsel for the three accused, had argued that to fall within the ambit of section 376E, the accused need to be previously convicted under section 376 (rape), 376A (causing death or putting a rape victim into a persistent vegetative state) or 376D (gang rape) of IPC. In the Shakti Mills cases, “both convictions are just 30 minutes apart”, he pointed out. But special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi said section 376E requires no interpretation as it plainly provides for death sentence for a second conviction and was enacted as a deterrent. The HC noted that the J S Verma Committee, which was constituted in the aftermath of the Nirbhaya case, had refused to extend the death sentence to any form of sexual assault, except when the violence leads to death or causes the victim to lapse into permanent vegetative state. It also said the word used in section 376E is “repeat’’, meaning “conviction should precede the second offence. In the present context, it is stated that two judgments of conviction were given simultaneously, therefore it cannot be said the accused were repeat offender.” So conviction could only have been for gangrape in both cases, said the HC, setting aside the death sentence given under section 376E to Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Shaikh and Mohammed Salim Ansari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-death-in-repeat-crime-trial-only-after-1st-conviction/articleshow/87919223.cms||---

On Wednesday she lodged a complaint at the Airport police under IPC Sections 498A (cruelty), 294(b) (using obscene words), 323 (causing hurt). Nisha Wadhwani (named changed) named seven persons, including her husband, in her complaint. Wadhwani said she got married in 1999 and began living with her husband in Sardarnagar. She stated just two months into her marriage, her in-laws started abusing her and would frequently ask her to get money from her parents. She stated that she was even assaulted by her husband. Wadhwani said the family refused to give her money for her expenses or those of her son and daughter. She said she was forced to do odd jobs to get money to meet her needs. She said that when she told her father this, he came to the city and gave her in-laws Rs 2.25 lakh and sent them money from Mumbai regularly. She stated that the family recently started a garment unit, but it ran into losses of Rs 18 lakh and they began to pressure her to repay the debt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/45-yr-old-kicked-out-for-refusing-to-get-rs-18l-from-her-parents/articleshow/87918744.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan Housing Board reclaims land worth Rs 250 crore in Pratap Nagar||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) on Thursday took possession of its nine bigha prime land in Pratap Nagar worth approximately Rs 250 crore after removing encroachments. The land is situated on the corner of Mahal and Haldi Ghati Road and was acquired nearly 30 years ago by the board. RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, for Pratap Nagar, Sanganer Yojna (Phase-5) , the RHB acquired 20,176 bigha in 1990. In 1994, the award of this land was done in favour of RHB and in 2009, the compensation of this land in the civil court by the board. “The possession of the entire land was taken by the board, however, this piece of land remained with the farmers as they approached to the court. On November 17, 2021, the writ was rejected by the high court and direction were given to take the possession the land,” Arora added. In a joint operation, the RHB and police officials took possession of land after razing the construction. To avoid further legal tangles, the RHB had already filed a caveat in the high court before carrying out a drive. Apart from farming, the landowners were carrying out dairy activities and converted a portion of land into marriage garden. An official said, “The area of land is nearly 24,000 square metre and RHB will devise a policy to utilise land for public interest.” After the Congress government came to power this time, the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal brought long pending amendments in the RHB Act 1970 which empowered the RHB to remove encroachments from its land and boost infrastructure. A source said, “Earlier, the big organisation such as RHB had no encroachment wing and rights to recover its dues. The draft of the amendment was tabled in the state assembly to empower the board.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-reclaims-land-worth-rs-250cr-in-pratap-nagar/articleshow/87918743.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Textbook distribution to begin early this year||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State School Textbook Board (GSSTB) has decided to start the process of distribution of school textbooks early for the academic year 2022-23. The exercise involves reaching out to 1.25 crore students of Classes 1 to 12 in the state. This decision was taken after many schools and students complained that textbooks did not reach them even months after the academic year 2021-22 began in July, said sources privy to the developments. “The plan is to ensure that schools get textbooks for Classes 1 to 12 by April. This will give enough time for students to get hold of their textbooks during the vacation before schools resume in June for the new academic year,” an education department source said. Schools need to provide their requirement details online from November 29 to December 15, GSSTB announced on Thursday. Some 30,000 tonnes of paper will to print a total of 8.5 crore textbooks for students of Classes 1 to 12. “A total of 1,480 different textbooks will be printed, in various languages,” said a source. The move is similar to a decision taken in 2017, when the distribution exercise was undertaken six months in advance. In July this year, some 30,000 schools in the state were forced to cancel the social studies unit tests for Classes 6 to 8 after the state education department failed to deliver the textbooks. The department had earlier said they would deliver textbooks at students’ doorsteps, and drew flak for not being able to deliver books to schools on time. “The textbook board sends books to district-level officers from where they go to taluka-level officials. By the time they reach schools, there are complaints of shortages or delays. This year we plan to begin the process well in advance so students can get textbooks from schools during their summer vacation,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/textbook-distribution-to-begin-early-this-year/articleshow/87918780.cms||---

People are agitated about this all over Goa. If a call is given then lakhs of people will come to support this agitation,” he said. Lobo said the chief minister must inspect the site or send oficials to do so and verify the documents. There is illegality and the structure has to be demolished as it is spoiling the sanctity of the place, he said. He expressed confidence that the chief minister would stop the construction of a bungalow by revoking the town and country planning department permission and demolish the structure immediately. Lobo was to meet the chief minister on Thursday. Speaking at the opening of a renovated chapel at Arpora, Lobo if the chief minister does not take a decision against the construction within 48 hours, then the people of Goa will take a decision. “We are here to protect all religions. Somebody cannot just come and do anything they want in a religious place which is marked as heritage zone. Old Goa is a heritage area and has been preserved by past generations for more than 400 years. We need to preserve it for future generations also,” he said. “It is a call which is coming from 'Goencho Saib' to come and save this blessed place. We have to do what has to be done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scrap-construction-near-heritage-site-at-old-goa-lobo/articleshow/87918751.cms||---

Senior solid waste management officials hinted that the AMC may in a few months from now refuse to collect waste from societies and commercial clusters if the waste is not segregated at source. A similar attempt was made in state capital Gandhinagar three months back where GMC sanitation workers visited societies but did not pick waste as it was not segregated. “This had led to citizen group protests which had demanded extra bins from the GMC if they wanted the waste segregated,” says a senior AMC official. Standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said, “Once the Pirana dumpsite gets cleared we cannot be providing mixed waste as that will lead to another Pirana garbage mound.” Mayor Kirit Parmar added, “We have been judged as the cleanest among 30 lakh plus non-metro cities.

The ruling party is facing problems in Adilabad and Kariminagar local authorities constituencies (LACs) where 24 candidates in each constituency are in the fray. While TRS rebels like Kariminagar former mayor Ravinder Singh filed their nomination in Karimnagar, many ruling party leaders at mandal level filed their nominations in Adilabad. Interestingly, they were proposed by the TRS local body elected representatives as at least 10% or 10 people have to propose their nominations. In Adilabad, TRS local body representatives signed as proposers for some BJP and Congress leaders, who filed their nominations. The Congress is officially contesting from Medak and Khammam LACs. In all the nine LACs, as many as 75 candidates’ nominations were found to be valid after scrutiny of nominations on Wednesday. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is November 26. The TRS leadership has roped in district ministers and senior leaders to talk to the rebels and independent candidates and ensure that they withdrew from the contest. Sources said some independent candidates were allegedly demanding Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh to withdraw their nominations. After a minister convinced them, two independent candidates — Kavali Srisailam and Sudhakar Reddy — withdrew their nominations in Mahbubnagar constituency, paving the way for the unanimous election of Kasireddy Narayan Reddy and K Damodar Reddy. TRS candidate Pochampally Srinivas Reddy is set to get elected unanimously in Warangal after three independents withdrew their nominations.

The incident occurred on November 12. Dubai-bound passengers from India have to undergo two RT-PCR tests, one within 48 hours of departure and the other, a rapid RT-PCR test, which needs to be done within six hours of departure. While the regular RT-PCR test costs less than Rs 1,000, the rapid RT-PCR test which uses a technology that gives a report within 13 minutes, costs Rs 4,500 each. “For international travel, passengers have to submit test reports with QR codes that are clear enough to be scanned. When the QR code on the rapid PCR test reports submitted by these passengers was scanned, it revealed information that did not match with that of the passenger concerned,” said an airport source, adding the passengers were stopped from boarding the flight.  Following the incident, the airport stopped pre-registration and home collection of samples for rapid RT-PCR tests. Ankit Sawant, a founder in a travel tech domain, said his relatives, who were booked to board a 2.30am flight to Dubai on November 13 had to reach the airport six hours in advance due to this. “We had booked a home sample collection for the rapid PCR. But the lab that conducts these tests at the airport called and told us all pre-registration and home collection have been suspended due to the incident.”  The Mumbai airport has allocated a dedicated entrance, Gate 8, for all Dubai-bound passengers, with a separate registration area, test area and waiting area in the departure hall of Terminal 2. The passengers undergo the rapid PCR test six hours prior to departure and receive a result within 30-40 minutes, said an airport official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-40-dubai-bound-pax-at-city-airport-stopped-for-fake-covid-reports/articleshow/87918764.cms||---

The state land records department started the process under heavy police protection and expects to complete the process by Sunday. The villagers, who are against the process, have already written to Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar outlining their objections and, therefore, tension prevailed in the area when the process began. The Bhuye talathi office had issued notices to 370 farmers and villagers to be present at the time of the demarcation. If a farmer is not present, it would be considered that the farmer or villager doesn't require common land demarcation and the survey will be carried out accordingly. Rohit Patil, a villager from Bhuyewadi, said, “Despite our objections, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the state land records department are carrying out the land demarcation process, which is wrong. As per the law, agricultural land should not be acquired if there is an alternative route. Here there is an alternative available, but the authorities want to acquire agricultural land ignoring all its adverse effects.” Dr Abhijeet Patil, a geologist, said the decision to construct a road through the flood-prone region was taken without proper research. “This is a threat to biodiversity. No proper environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment report were prepared; the highway authorities are unable to provide the same when demanded through RTI. The proposed road between Kerli to Shiye, comprising around 10 to twelve 12 villages, is a heavy agricultural zone between Sadale-Madale mountain range on one side and Panchganga river on the other. Creating a major road here will act as a barrage obstructing the water flow at various places and will result in further flooding of Kolhapur city as well as the villages located next to this highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nagpur-ratnagiri-highways-land-demarcation-begins/articleshow/87916643.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The members against whom MCOCA has been invoked have been identified as Amol Mahadev Bhaskar, Amit Mahadev Bhaskar, Shankar Mahadev Bhaskar, Mahadev Shamrao Bhaskar and Sanket Sudhesh Vhatkar — all resident of Jawahar Nagar. In the last six months, Kolhapur police have invoked MCOCA against three gangs. Earlier, 13 members of ST gang and 10 members of RC gang faced similar action. District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade said as many as 48 cognisable and serious crimes such as murder, extortion have been registered against members of Bhaskar Don gang. “The members of the gang were involved in frequent brawls with other syndicates to establish themselves as the sole player in the crime sector. Recently, it was found that they were also involved in grabbing property of a retired person,” Balkawade said. “The gang members may be involved in similar crimes and people should come forward and fearlessly register complaint against them. We have resolved to bring an end to organised crime in the city and district and more such gangs are on our radar. We will slap MCOCA against them according to which stringent punishment is prescribed against criminals on record,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mcoca-invoked-against-5-gang-members/articleshow/87917218.cms||---

The ED also attached an office space worth Rs 3.5 crore at Nariman Point in the case. “This property was purchased from the cash siphoned off from the trust and converted into cheque as loan entry from a known accommodation entry provider (hawala operator),” the ED press note stated. It is alleged that Khan used the service of the hawala operator who was earlier arrested in a GST fraud case. The hawala operator layered the cash through shell companies before issuing a cheque of similar amount to Sayeed Khan, showing it as a loan. But they got exposed after the ED investigation found that no interest was paid against the loan in the last two years and the property documents of an unknown person was shown as collateral security against the loan. Around two months ago, the ED had arrested Khan in the case and summoned Gawali three times for her statement, but she failed to appear. Gawali is an MP from Yavatmal-Washim. Earlier, Khan had told ED officials that he took a loan from a money lender (hawala operator) to purchase the office. The ED recorded the statement of the hawala operator who confirmed that Khan had kept property papers worth Rs 50 crore with him as collateral security. The ED examined the collateral security papers that belonged to a businessman based in Malabar Hill area of South Mumbai. The ED called the businessman for the statement which eventually exposed Khan and the hawala operator. The businessman told ED that he didn’t know Khan or the hawala operator, and that his property documents were stolen a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-submits-chargesheet-on-sena-mp-gawali-attaches-rs-3-5cr-office-space/articleshow/87919659.cms||Vijay V Singh

Officials remained tight-lipped about developments and maintained that questioning of key players is underway. “Transactions pertaining to the past few years are under the scanner. A team is taking back-ups of the servers of these companies,” said an official privy to the developments. The department started another search at a city-based investment firm on Wednesday. The department reportedly confined at least one official of the firm, while the search was in progress. The I-T department said they carried out search and seizure operations on Indian companies and associated concerns engaged in the ‘business of chemicals, ball bearings, machinery parts, and injection moulding machinery’ at 20 locations in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Gandhidham and Delhi. The department said the firms were evading taxes through manipulation of their books and transferred Rs 20 crore out through shell companies over the past two years. ‘One of the companies trading in chemicals was found to be routing the claim of purchases through the Marshall Islands, a low-tax jurisdiction. The company actually bought items worth Rs. 56 crore from a neighbouring company but it has been billed from the Marshall Islands,’ the release stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/transactions-of-rs-200cr-unearthed/articleshow/87918759.cms||---

In its notice, the committee chaired by MLA Raghav Chadha said that the statements purportedly posted by her had caused agony and hurt the sentiments of people from the Sikh community, potentially leading to a situation of disruption of peace and harmony in Delhi. The summons mentioned that the committee had received “numerous complaints eliciting, inter alia, outrageously offensive and derogatory Instagram stories/posts allegedly by yourself on November 20, 2021”. According to the complainants, the “stories” published by Ranaut on her Instagram profile, which is followed by around 80 lakh people worldwide, specifically illustrate instances that hurt the religious sentiments of Sikh community. Ranaut was asked by the committee to appear before it “to deliberate on the present issue in a more comprehensive and coherent manner”. The complaints stated that she had allegedly labelled the Sikh community as “Khalistani terrorists”, which led to unbearable humiliation for them and also led to apprehensions regarding their safety, life and liberty in their minds. “One complainant was called out as a Khalistani, which was not only shocking to him but also raised legitimate apprehensions regarding the safety of his family and himself. The complainants implored the committee’s chairman to take immediate note of this prevalent issue,” stated the committee. The statement also mentioned that the committee was duly empowered to consider the factors and situations that had the potential to disturb communal harmony and suggest measures to eliminate such factors. “The same has been acknowledged and endorsed by the Supreme Court as it upheld the inquisitorial and recommendatory powers of the committee, which can be utilised under the principle of better governance,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/house-panel-summons-kangana-for-her-social-media-posts-that-hurt-religious-sentiments/articleshow/87918760.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Ganja is just another cash crop for most tribal growers in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Though cultivation, peddling, buying and consumption of cannabis is illegal and punishable, around 50 per cent of the ganja growers (tribal people) in Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) areas are unaware of this fallout. K Raju (name changed), a native of AOB area, was quick to name five to six crops he produces. He named ginger, pumpkin, rice and a few others including cannabis (ganja). Not only Raju, but a few others also said they produce and sell quality weed (hemp). “I grow vegetables and cannabis in the hilly areas, but I earn more money from cannabis but I need not to go somewhere to sell it. Some people will come and collect by paying good amount and I don’t know growing cannabis is illegal,” Raju added. Vizag Agency and AOB region are quickly becoming the cannabis capital of the country. While cannabis is grown also in some of the states in the country, Vizag and AOB region have seen a spurt in cultivation with Vizag ganja becoming most popular in the country. However, another ganja grower, P Janna (name changed) is much aware of the consequences of ganja cultivation and transportation. Janna is an educated youngster, and he knows that cannabis trade is illegal and punishable. But he continues to be in the trade due to the lure of windfall gains. “We grow ganja along with other crops and hand over the produce to the agents who take the responsibility of transporting the stuff out of the region. One acre of cannabis fetches over Rs 2 lakh and we use the money for livelihood, education and others,” Janna added. “Ganja is cultivated in roughly over 10,000 acres, spreading across over 200 to 250 villages in Vizag Agency and AOB region. We have launched PARIVARTANA (change), a programme which involves destroying the crop and creating awareness on the consequences of engaging in the illegal trade. We explain to them the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 (NDPS Act) besides educating them on alternative crops,” said deputy inspector general (Visakha range) LKV Ranga Rao. A senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said some middle-men and small drug dealers provide cash advances to villagers to grow cannabis. “Hemp is cultivated mostly in public land (forest and revenue) in AOB region. Some ganja growers are illiterate, and they are not aware of the ill effects of indulging in the trade,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ganja-is-just-another-cash-crop-for-most-tribal-growers/articleshow/87917955.cms||Nalla.Babu

A ruling councillor, Filu D’Costa has also opposed the proposal. Village panchayat Avedem-Cotombi and Xeldem had requested QMC to accommodate their garbage at the Pedamoll, Sirvoi plant. Xeldem panchayat sarpanch Caetan de Lima said that the panchayat is finding it difficult to acquire land for a waste treatment plant. The high court had issued directions to all panchayats in Goa to set up plants or arrange to dispatch their garbage to neighbouring plants. Avedem panchayat sarpanch Alleluia Afonso told TOI, “As per high court directions, the panchayat will have to pay heavy fines if they fail to locate land for dumping garbage before the expiry of the court’s deadline.” QMC has earlier rejected both the panchayat proposals because the treatment plant would not be able to cope with additional garbage. QMC has a 10 metric tonne capacity plant in a 20,000sqm land. QMC generates around 6 to 7 tonnes of garbage daily. Council engineer Nitin Kotharkar said that a new bio-methanation plant has been installed recently by the council to treat wet garbage, but is not yet functional due to some mechanical problem. “If the council is willing to allow garbage from other panchayats then the council should have a 11-month agreement with them and impose a rent of not less than Rs 25,000 per month, ” D’Costa said, and demanded a white paper during the next council meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-to-treat-waste-from-two-neighbouring-villages/articleshow/87918754.cms||---

The incident took place just as the vigilance team was disconnecting a civic drain which they suspected was carrying toxic industrial effluent. “One could imagine the plight of aquatic life and villages that depend on Sabarmati waters downstream of Ahmedabad if such toxic, combustible, untreated industrial wastewater is drained into the Sabarmati river via municipal drains,” said a senior municipal official who was part of the 45-member surveillance team. Since November 20, following the high court rap, the AMC has sealed 137 factory units allegedly found injecting untreated industrial waste illegally into the municipal sewage line. Over the past three days, 52 connections were found in the illegal act. “There is tremendous pressure on us from the industrial estates and politicians to avoid certain clusters,” admitted an AMC official. Till Thursday evening, drainage connections of private industrial estates in Odhav, Asarwa, Saraspur-Rakhial, Naroda, Behrampura, Lambha, Isanpur, Bapunagar, Shahpur, India Colony, Viratnagar and Danilimda were sealed. Industrial associations are now being asked to persuade private industrial estates to direct their wastewater to a common effluent treatment plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sewage-line-fire-stuns-gpcb-amc-officials/articleshow/87918768.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Death not mandatory, convicts deserve life term to repent: Bombay HC||Mumbai: Commuting the death sentence of three convicts in the Shakti Mills gangrape cases, the Bombay high court on Thursday said: “The statute has not prescribed mandatory death penalty. Although the offence is barbaric and heinous, it cannot be said… the accused deserve only death penalty.’’ They “deserve imprisonment for life to repent the offence committed by them as death puts an end to the concept of repentance”, it added. Vijay Jadhav, 19 at the time of the crime, Mohammad Qasim Shaikh (20) and Mohammed Salim Ansari (27) had been sent to death row in April 2014 by the trial court in a case of gangrape of a photojournalist, then 22, on August 22, 2013. Besides the three, one person was sentenced to life and a minor accused was found guilty under the juvenile justice board. The accused did not appeal the death penalty. The three had got the death sentence as they were also convicted in another gangrape of a 19-year-old telephone operator on July 31, 2013, on the same premises at Mahalaxmi. Their court-appointed counsel Yug Chaudhry cited several irregularities in the trial court proceedings in awarding them death sentence under section 376E of the IPC, a stringent law for repeat offenders, saying the charge was not invoked as per law. But special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi argued the law permits death sentence for second conviction and the “sequence and time of the offence is immaterial”. On March 20, 2014, the sessions judge had first held the three common accused guilty for the gangrape of the telephone operator and about 30 minutes later, pronounced a guilty verdict in the case of the photojournalist too. In this gap, the state had made a plea to invoke section 376E. The court, therefore, handed the death sentence. The HC bench held that it was not a case of a previous conviction “since both the sessions cases were being tried simultaneously and the conviction in both was on the same day without giving an opportunity to the accused to place before the court the mitigating circumstances”. It added: “In a case like the present one, the court cannot ignore the fact that this incident had shocked the conscience of the society and there was public outcry.” But the court cannot punish based on public outcry alone, it is a court’s duty to consider the case “dispassionately’’ and it cannot ignore legal procedures. “A sentence of death is irrevocable and therefore, the basic principle in sentencing policy would be life imprisonment as a rule and death penalty as an exception,” it added. On Thursday, in a separate judgment, the high court upheld the life sentence of Mohd Ashfaq Shaikh, 25, for the July 31 gangrape. In the death sentence confirmation hearing, the HC said “there is no doubt that the incident as narrated by the survivor on August 22, 2013, had occurred in the backdrop and in the manner in which it was narrated. The courage of the survivor needs to be appreciated: that she had put at stake her reputation... when she set the law into motion”. “Every case of rape is a heinous offence… Rape is tantamount to a serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of woman. It is a violation of human rights,” said the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/death-not-mandatory-convicts-deserve-life-term-to-repent-bombay-hc/articleshow/87919243.cms||---

This, however, comes at the cost of giving up their womb by undergoing a hysterectomy. The practice among these women exists due to lack of information about the menstrual cycle. “The sugar cutting period is just six months in a year and they need to survive on the paltry salary they receive during the harvest time for the rest of year. So women cutters can’t afford to lose even a single day. Unfortunately, due to the biological process of menstruation, they lose three to four days every month. To avoid this, the practice of hysterectomy started about 10 years ago in the village of Beed,” director of the film ‘Bittersweet’, Ananth Narayan Mahadevan said while speaking at the 52nd Iffi in Goa. Quacks and non-qualified gynaecologists that migrated from areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar into Beed started advising these women to undergo hysterectomy. They succeeded in convincing the women that getting rid of their uterus would free them of all their problems, like the pain during the menstrual cycle every month, the loss of wages during those days, and the possible growth of tumours in the uterus and other medical issues. “In the film we have shown that a government officer is probing the issues, but none of the women come forward due to fear of losing their job as it is their only source of income. They say they are doing it willingly,” Mahadevan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bittersweet-story-on-alarming-hysterectomies-in-rural-india/articleshow/87918770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The eco-Nivas Samhita is a programme under Indo-Swiss partnership. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is promoting the concept. Ajay Jain, special chief secretary for housing, said energy efficiency building designs will be implemented in housing with the consent of beneficiaries. “It is a voluntary scheme. Residential buildings will become the largest end-user of electricity in the country accounting for 38% of the total power consumption. In AP, the domestic sector alone consumes around 17,514 MU (28%) per annum out of total annual demand. The proposed scheme will help reduce temperatures inside houses by enhancing thermal comfort (cooling),” he said. Jain, who addressed a seminar on eco-Niwas Samhitha through video conference in Visakhapatnam on Thursday, stressed on the need to create awareness on energy conservation building code. “The state government is taking up construction of 15.6 lakh houses under PMAY-Navaratanalu Pedalaandariki Illu in the first phase at an estimated cost of Rs 28,000 crore. Construction of 10.7 lakh houses has already begun,” he said. Sameer Maithel, head of project management at Indo-Swiss BEE, said AP housing department has given approval for training of employees on energy efficiency measures.

Maharashtra hit 11 crore vaccinations—the second highest in the country—while Mumbai finished vaccinating 70% of its eligible population with both the doses. It is the only district in the state and first among major cities to achieve that level of full vaccination.  The state has till now administered 11,00,26,925 doses, fully vaccinating 3.76 crore (41%) people and giving at least one shot to 7.23 crore (79%) of its eligible population. Around 9% of the 120 crore doses given in the country is from Maharashtra. UP, which is leading among states, has administered the highest doses (15.5 crore), accounting for nearly 13% of vaccination in India.  Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, called it an important milestone for the state. “Maharashtra crossed the mark of 110 million (11 crore) Covid vaccine doses at 5.30pm. We achieved the 100 million (10 crore) mark on November 9,” he said. The last one crore doses were reached in just 16 days. State officials said under the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign, they have increased the momentum of vaccination in all districts. All but one district (Nandurbar) have achieved a single shot coverage of more than 60%. The state was aiming at reaching 100% single dose coverage by November-end. However, considering that 1.9 crore people are yet to take their first shots, that goal is unattainable now. As far as second dose coverage is concerned, as many as 21 districts are below the state average of 40%. Mumbai, which is at the top of first and second dose coverage in Maharashtra, has administered 1,59,33,076 doses. Till now, 65,40,392 (70.3%) have taken both doses while 93,92,684 (101%) have taken at least one. Although the city accounts for 10% of the state’s population, it has administered 14% of the total doses given in the state.  Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, said although the city may be inching towards endemicity and has achieved good coverage, it is crucial to cover every single eligible person with both doses. “Vaccinated people shouldn’t abandon Covid protocols.” He said eateries particularly should ensure proper ventilation. “Also, with constantly emerging variants such as the new one (B.1.1.529), saturated vaccination coverage is the only way forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hits-11cr-jabs-mumbai-first-district-in-state-to-fully-vax-70-of-its-popn/articleshow/87919676.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Sources said extension of the scheme would entail the Centre to procure additional rice and distribute the consignment to the needy as part of the scheme and it was for this very reason, the Union government was reviewing the estimates on paddy procurement from the states. “However, the procurement issue is not specific to Telangana as the Centre is looking at the entire scenario. It has surplus stock and several states have already supplied surplus stock to the Food Corporation of India in the last two seasons. The government is implementing the PM Anna Yojana for the poor in the post-pandemic scenario,” sources said. The Union civil supplies ministry has already said Telangana’s request for a higher paddy purchase quota for the current season is being considered. However, Telangana is still trying to avoid deadlock over procurement of parboiled rice. Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy had made it clear that the Centre will not purchase parboiled rice and buy only raw rice. BJP sources said: “The decision has been taken as consumption of parboiled rice has decreased and other states are increasing their paddy growing area. With the PM Anna scheme, there may be a fresh demand for rice and the Centre will be reviewing this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-anna-scheme-may-help-t-farmers/articleshow/87918766.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Teacher gets 2 years in jail for molesting six-year-old student in Rajkot||RAJKOT: A sessions court in Dhoraji sentenced a teacher to two years in jail for molesting a six-year-old student. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict. The teacher, Praful Makadiya, was earlier sentenced to six months imprisonment by a chief judicial magistrate. Makadiya had challenged his conviction by filing an appeal in the sessions court. But considering the argument of the prosecution, additional district and sessions judge Rahul Mahesh Chander Sharma increased Makadiya’s sentence and penalty. According to case details, Makadiya, a teacher of Bhayavadar village of Rajkot district, was convicted for showing vulgar video to the student and forcing her to touch his private parts. Bhayavadar chief judicial magistrate convicted him on December 8, 2020 and sentenced him to six months imprisonment and Rs 500 penalty. Makadiya challenged this order by filing an appeal in the court of an additional district judge of Dhoraji. Additional public prosecutor Kartikey Parekh argued that, “this act of a teacher can’t be pardoned. According to current law, the punishment for this offence is 10 years but this offence was committed in 2010 when the old law was in force. Cops also recovered porn videos from his possession.” “Considering the arguments and documentary evidence, the court increased the sentence of the convict and awarded two years imprisonment which is the maximum under the law,” Parekh told TOI.

This emotion has been brought to the celluloid through some of the films at the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi). Directed by Argentine filmmaker Juan Baldana, the film ‘Unbalanced’ tells the story of Rodo, who gets obsessed with writing a book about German-Argentine merchant, social activist and long-forgotten theoretical economist, Silvio Gessel. Gessel had propounded some revolutionary ideas about money and economy. The film is among the few Iffi films that is set in the post-Covid lockdown era and features in the World Panorama Section. “I wanted to capture the world before and after the pandemic and that is how ‘Unbalanced’ came about. We used drones for shooting. Even the police shown in some of the scenes are real police who came to frisk us. I also made my new-born baby a character in the film,” he said. The film, which had its Asian premiere at the 52nd Iffi, explores the intellectual and excruciating struggles of Rodo and how the mandatory social isolation in the wake of the pandemic as well as the spread of the virus infecting thousands of people across the world tends to stand in the way of his goals. ‘The Knocker,’ a short film in the Indian Panorama Section shows one man’s loneliness and solitary confinement and the inner struggles it gives birth to. The film is about a man living all by himself when he suddenly hears a knock on his front door. Matters become more complex when the knocks become routine. Director Ananth Narayan Mahadevan said that the film is an attempt to explore the psychic conflicts of men who live alone in cities for years on end due to work or other commitments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/films-on-social-isolation-loneliness-post-pandemic-grab-spotlight-at-iffi/articleshow/87918784.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: BJP to form panel for better election management||HYDERABAD: In a significant move, the BJP has decided to form a state-level election management committee for the first time. The party is also looking at some names to lead the committee. Sources said the move was taken to overcome the BJP’s lack of experience in poll management, which is preventing it from gaining an advantage over the TRS, despite the success in the recent by-elections. The election committee will provide assistance to the party in all aspects of poll management. The committee’s major responsibility will be to keep track of all elections . “At the state level, there will be a three-member committee led by a senior leader. Districts will have their own committees, which will be overseen by the state-level committee, again led by a senior leader,” sources said. “It has been observed that by the time other parties begin poll planning, the ruling party is already in action. So, we have decided to have the committee. Even the TRS leadership believes we are the main opposition party and that the next election would not be easy for it,” the sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-form-panel-for-better-election-mgmt/articleshow/87918782.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||10 speedbreakers come up outside 5-star hotel, agencies pass the buck||New Delhi: Ten speedbreakers appeared overnight on a 100-metre stretch on the road opposite a five-star hotel in Vasant Kunj. While they have become a nuisance for residents and commuters, the hotel authorities say they are unaware of who installed them. The plastic speedbreakers were installed on Tuesday night and all agencies seemed to be passing the buck. Rajiv Singh, Supreme Court advocate and a resident of the area, said the speed-breakers were in violation of a Delhi High Court order. “There were specific guidelines issued by the court and these plastic-moulded speedbreakers were prohibited. Wherever they are installed, they are illegal. I suspect traffic officials in connivance with the hotel staffers did this. This reeks of corruption. From gate number 1 to 4 of the hotel, there are 10 speed-breakers. It not only slows down the speed of vehicles, but one has to carefully cross them. The width and specifications are also in violation of the guidelines,” added Singh. When TOI visited the area on Thursday, some vehicles were crossing from the sides, while some were racing over the speedbreakers. Chatra Ram, a security personnel at the hotel, said they were installed on Tuesday night. “We don’t know who installed them, but yes the road is accident-prone. A few days ago, there was an accident in which an autorickshaw driver rammed his vehicle into another. I was on night duty when some people came and started installing them. They had also kept their equipment on the footpath outside the hotel gate,” he added. DCP (Traffic) G Amrutha said, “They were recently installed by DDA. The permission, according to my knowledge, was granted a couple of years ago. I’m aware of the complaint and we are examining it. The road near the hotel is a high-speed area and an accident-prone zone. This is why permission was granted to install the speedbreakers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-speedbreakers-come-up-outside-5-star-hotel-agencies-pass-the-buck/articleshow/87919313.cms||---
---||Delhi||Atishi slams BJP after court orders FIR against Patra over fake video||New Delhi: After a Delhi court ordered registration of an FIR against Bharatiya Janata Party functionary Sambit Patra for posting a doctored video of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on social media, Aam Aadmi Party claimed that “it proves that the party indulges in cheap antics”. In a press conference on Thursday, AAP MLA Atishi said that the video, which was clearly doctored, had a so-called interview of the chief minister in which he is heard supporting the three farm bills introduced by the central government. She said that the video was marked by twitter for manipulation and fake news. Atishi said that despite knowing the truth, the video was not taken down and ‘continued to mislead’ the people following his tweet. “You have often seen that even BJP’s official social media handles share photos and videos that are repeatedly proven as fake and manipulated by many news agencies,” she claimed. Atishi said that this video has been proved to be fake in police investigation, forensic lab and the court. The reality is that AAP and Arvind Kejriwal had repeatedly opposed these three farm laws. She said that in the fabricated video, Kejriwal is heard saying, “Your MSP will not go anywhere, your mandi will not go anywhere. Now the farmer can sell their crop anywhere in the country. Now the farmer will receive good rates, and they can sell outside the mandis. This will be the biggest revolutionary step in 70 years in the agricultural sector.” “In some parts of the original interview, Kejriwal is found saying that ‘the BJP leaders say that these are the benefits of the farm laws’. The part containing the line ‘the BJP leaders say’ has shamelessly been edited out,” she said. Atishi said that in reality, the CM and AAP repeatedly opposed the three farm bills in Punjab as well as in Delhi. “We dissented against these unjust farm bills in the parliament, in the legislative assemblies, through press conferences, and even on the streets,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/atishi-slams-bjp-after-court-orders-fir-against-patra-over-fake-video/articleshow/87918814.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, new infections have stayed under 50 for over a month now with 34 new cases reported on Thursday. At 255, Goa’s active case count has also continued to remain under the 500-mark. A 79-year-old man from Guirim passed away after eight days in hospital. He had tested positive for Covid-19 a day after he was hospitalised and had symptoms for three days prior. In another case, an 80-year-old man from Quepem succumbed to Covid-19 after 10 days in hospital. He had tested positive on the day he was admitted in hospital and had symptoms for 10 days prior. Both the deceased were reported to have no comorbid conditions. While North Goa’s weekly positivity rate, from November 18 to 24, was at 1.1%, South Goa’s positivity rate was at 0.9%.

---||Nagpur||Infra works, poor planning throw traffic in disarray||Nagpur: Closing of five roads including Kadbi Chowk to Gaddigodam, Jaripatka to Raj Nagar and three roads criss-crossing Mominpura and Santra Market has thrown traffic on these routes out of gear.The traffic movement in Sadar area is the worst affected. On being informed by motorists, TOI visited Mangalwari, Mecosabagh railway overbridges and Residency Road and found traffic crawling during peak hours.Recently, the traffic police gave its nod to shut six roads, which has affected traffic on Kamptee road and Sadar area. Also, after Itwari railway overbridge (which connects Raj Nagar with Jaripatka) was shut early this month, vehicular traffic has been diverted through Mecosabagh RoB.In absence of any checks, motorists wrongfully take a U-turn just at the end of RoB near Mecosabagh Colony causing jam. Overtaking by vehicles on the narrow Mangalwari RoB and double parking on Government Polytechnic-Haldiram section too have been a cause of frequent traffic jams.Barring Kadbi Chowk, TOI did not see traffic cops at any other spots. Even at Kadbi Chowk, the cops were mute spectators to the traffic chaos.Rittesh Arora, a resident of Mecosabagh, said that the traffic police should study the prevailing situation before making a diversion plan to ensure smooth vehicular movement.Despite having wide roads, poor planning and lack of civic sense has thrown city’s traffic out of gear, said motorists. Motorists also questioned the traffic management on Residency Road. Due to closure of Kadbi Chowk-Gaddigodam Road, vehicular movement on this stretch has increased manifold. Many two-and-four wheelers are parked along the road causing traffic snarls, especially during peak hours. Secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association and civic activist Tejinder Singh Renu said that the traffic mess is due to work of two infrastructure projects, which means it has been done after permission from traffic police department. “Before allowing closure of two major traffic routes of the same region simultaneously, did the traffic department study flow on alternate roads?” he said. “Without doubt, we need such projects meant to ease traffic, but that doesn’t mean the authorities ignore the chaos arising out of such road closures,” he said. Now that work has already started, it’s required that dedicated traffic cops are posted at key intersections to manage traffic flow. “If this doesn’t help, parking on roadsides at congested places on alternate roads being used by motorists needs to be banned,” said Renu.Senior PI Jagvendrasinh Rajput too admitted there is chaos and claimed that the traffic police have taken many measures including deployment of cops and restricting heavy vehicles including city bus movement on this stretch during evening peak hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/infra-works-poor-planning-throw-traffic-in-disarray/articleshow/87917281.cms||---

Taking precautionary measures, the forest administration closed the safari for tourists in the particular zone till further orders. An official said, “Continuous monitoring of tigress is being done to observe its behaviour. For this, cameras have also been installed at many places in the zone.” Sultana lives in zone-1 with three cubs. The movement of the tigress along with its cubs was reported on the road leading to Sultanpur outpost . An official said when the tigress chased the biker, her cubs were not seen with her. “But possibility cannot be ruled out that the tigress’s cubs were around when she charged at the bikers to protect her cubs. She stopped after chasing the bike for nearly 30 metres. The incident occurred at 9.30 am.” This is the second time the tigress reportedly charged at a vehicle. Earlier in 2019, a video went viral which showed Sultana came perilously close to tourists before sprinting alongside their vehicle. The 26-second clip was purportedly shot by tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tigress-sultana-chased-a-forest-staff-bike/articleshow/87918829.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pvt hosps get 12k sqft land to set up common O2 plant at Butibori MIDC||Nagpur: The state government has handed over a 12,000 sqft plot in Butibori MIDC to VHA Pranvayu Cluster, a group of 30 private hospitals, to set up common cryogenic oxygen plant.A joint venture with Ministry of Small Medium Entreprises (MSME), the project will come up at a cost of Rs25crore. Around 80% of the project cost will be sponsored by MSME while Pranvayu Cluster shall contribute 20% as a private company.The cluster is expecting a plant capacity to generate around 20 metric tonnes in cryogenic form. The plant is likely to deliver 2,000 jumbo cylinders per day considering each VHA member would need 20 on a daily basis. The demand during Covid peak had shot up to more than 200 per day at every hospital. The plant is expected not to compete with existing companies but take off some pressure from the limited manufacturers.As the state government mandated all 50-bed hospitals to have their own oxygen plants following the second Covid wave crisis, the hospitals formed Pranvayu Cluster to set up a common source of medical oxygen.The plant is estimated to start operations by July 2022. The cluster would operate and maintain it on non-profit basis. The cluster members would get jumbo cylinders at a discounted rate while surplus will be sold to other hospitals at minimal prices.In a press release, Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) stated it was motivated by then MSME Union minister Nitin Gadkari to have a dedicated oxygen plant for all VHA members. “This idea was taken forward and VHA officials met IEDS, director MSME-Maharashtra, PM Parlewar who assured them all support to process project report preparation formalities by CA Anand Daga,” it said.VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat stressed it is not possible for all 50-100 bed hospitals to have their own plants.Dr Alok Umre, VHA secretary, added that subsidized electricity and no GST for 5 years have been assured by the state government to this VHA cluster.Dr Anup Marar, VHA convener, said the land was procured at 50% cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pvt-hosps-get-12k-sqft-land-to-set-up-common-o2-plant-at-butibori-midc/articleshow/87917297.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

In the affidavit filed before the Andhra Pradesh high court, the CBI director, Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, stated that despite repeated requests from their end, the abusive content continues to appear online. Jaiswal filed an affidavit following the directions from the high court in the case of attack over judiciary on social media platforms. The high court directed him to explain the steps taken so far by the CBI to apprehend the accused in the case. Jaiswal stated that they have examined Gurrampati Devendra Reddy, social media in-charge of YSRC, to unearth larger conspiracy and his mobile device was sent to CFSL analysis. The CBI director also stated that they have examined Bapatla MP, Nandigam Suresh, ex-MLA Amanchi Krishna Mohan, K Ravichandra Reddy, spokesperson of YSRC and some others also. Further legal action would be initiated against them post analysis of available evidence, he said. He said that the CBI has registered a case against 16 persons initially and arrested 11 of them. One Cheenepalli Prabhakar Reddy alias Punch Prabhakar, who has been posting scandalous and abusive videos, was included as 17th accused in the case.

---||Nagpur||No 2nd jab, no salary for 250 NMC employees||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has identified about 250 employees, who, despite being eligible, have not taken their second shot of Covid vaccine. “Now, the NMC is going to withhold their salaries for November to be paid in December,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. “The decision has been taken to protect the civic body employees from Covid-19 infection as most of them work as frontline workers who are in regular contact with citizens,” Radhakrishnan told TOI. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said there are around 10,582 NMC employees in various departments and 99% of them have taken their first dose. “Only 32 pregnant and medically ill employees are yet to be vaccinated,” he said. He said an official circular of withholding salaries of non-vaccinated employees will be issued in a couple of days. They will get their salaries released only when they produce the certificates of both the vaccine doses. Early this month, district collector Vimla R and the NMC had issued a circular making vaccination compulsory for entry into government establishments. Both the circulars had directed to withhold salaries of unvaccinated government employees. Sources said that the civic administration came to know that many NMC employees haven’t taken their second dose even after a gap of 84 days. “We had directed them to take the vaccine without delay. Even unvaccinated employees were suggested by the administration to take Covaxin as it has a gap of a month for the second dose,” said sources. Joshi said that those vaccinated with the first dose and are yet to complete 84 days, as required for Covishield jab, will be exempted from the order. The civic chief, however, expressed satisfaction with the number of people vaccinated in the city. He appealed to the citizens to take their jabs before November end as afterwards vaccinations will not be provided free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-2nd-jab-no-salary-for-250-nmc-employees/articleshow/87917285.cms||---

Luckily for his girlfriend, a 24-year-old paramedical intern, whom Chakole had attempted to shoot on November 22, the man could not bring up the courage to enter GMCH, and left the spot. On November 22, Chakole had tried to shoot his former girlfriend at the parking lot outside the GMCH dean’s office after she stepped out of the e-library. Police said Chakole worked with the fire safety team of a popular television serial in Mumbai. As per Chakole’s initial interrogation, he procured the firearm from Mumbai. He had returned to Nagpur to meet his former girlfriend. He intended to ask her to either come with him, or kill her and then end his own life. After getting introduced through Facebook in 2019, Chakole and the intern had been friends till January this year before breaking it off. He felt she had ditched him for another man after making him spend on her lavishly. Chakole said he only wished to see his ex-girlfriend before ending his life when he visited Medical Square again on Wednesday. However, police said he was still carrying the firearm and a live cartridge with him. He appeared to have wanted to sneak inside GMCH but was afraid of getting caught. After waiting for some time near the GMCH gate, Chakole had left the place. From the GMCH gate, he had used a food delivery boy’s mobile phone to call a friend, which led the crime branch cops to him. Crime branch team of assistant PIs Mayur Chourasiya, Jeetendra Thakur and sub-inspector Baliram Jhakhar had zeroed down on Chakole when he was heading to Nagpur railway station to end his life. The crime branch team, which handed over Chakole to Ajni police, managed to trap Chakole after a two-day operation under DCP Chinmay Pandit and Addl CP Sunil Phulari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-who-threatened-gf-in-gmch-returns-nabbed-by-cops-before-suicide-attempt/articleshow/87917303.cms||Soumitra Bose

While welcoming the decision to introduce online ticketing in the state, he advised the government to decide on the hike in ticket prices by studying the admission rates in theatres in different parts of the country. Chiranjeevi’s appeal to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy came on Thursday after the government making it clear that the number of shows will continue to be restricted to four per day and online ticketing will be introduced so that the government gets a correct assessment and tax revenue. The decision has come as a shock to the Telugu film industry as representations had been made to AP government on its demands. Chiranjeevi himself had met Jagan personally. “While it is welcome that online ticketing has been introduced in the name of transparency, the admission rates should be increased for not only the survival of theatres but keeping in view the number of people and their families who are dependent on cinema for their livelihood,” he said. Chiranjeevi said since GST was common for the entire country, the ticket rates should be similar. “Please do a rethink about this. The Telugu film industry will prosper only with the support of the government,” he said, urging the government to do a rethink on the ticket rates. A few months ago, the government fixed the minimum rates of admission at Rs 5 and maximum at Rs 250 in single screen theatres and multiplexes depending on their location — in panchayat areas or municipal corporation limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/increase-admission-rates-in-ap-theatres-chiranjeevi-urges-jagan/articleshow/87918023.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

After successful completion of Covaxin paediatric vaccine clinical trial, the institute is one of the sites for India’s only messenger RNA (mRNA) Covid vaccine’s phase-II and III clinical trials. Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited, Pune, has developed a novel mRNA-based vaccine candidate — HGCO19 — and got DCGI’s go-ahead to conduct a multicentre, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blind phase-II study seamlessly followed by a phase-III study. The vaccines with the highest efficacy are mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The mRNA platform-based vaccines are a promising substitute to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high safety, potency and manufacturing ease. The study will be conducted at approximately 10-15 sites in phase-II. Phase-III will be held at 22-27 sites. Dr Ajay Bulle, consultant intensivist, is one of the principal investigators from Meditrina. He is assisted by Dr Tapan Bodele and institute’s research, nursing and pharmacy staff under guidance of its director Dr Sameer Paltewar. The study will be conducted in two parts. Phase-II part will be conducted in 400 healthy subjects while phase-III part of the study will enrol 4,000 healthy subjects. Phase-II of the study will enrol subjects in 1:1 randomization scheme to receive either HGCO19 (10 µg) or Covishield while phase-III will enrol subjects in ratio 3:1 (HGCO19: Covishiedl). There are total seven follow up visits in the study including dose 1 on Day 0 and dose 2 at Day 29. Enrolment of the phase-II and Day 42 follow-up visit is completed. The institute enrolled 24 volunteers of which 23 are in follow up. The phase-III enrolment shall start in next 2-3 days.

---||Delhi||Polls In Sight, N Corpn Refrains From Increasing Property Tax||New Delhi: Despite reeling under a liability of Rs 8,803 crore and failing to assure regular payment of salaries, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has not proposed any hike in property tax rates for any category, be it residential, non-residential and commercial, in view of the upcoming elections. Presenting the budget estimates for 2022-23 and revised budget for 2021-22 on Thursday, north corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel pointed out that Delhi government had reduced the basic tax assignment (BTA) and other grants by over 20% this fiscal, thereby intensifying the crisis. “Barely a month ago, we withdrew the increased trade and factory licensing fees and extended exemption after rolling back rates of three factors specified under the municipal valuation committee report,” said Goel, adding that the deliberative wing had been urged to consider a 2% increase in property tax. The commissioner added, “Delhi government had made a provision for Rs 764.8 crore as BTA in their budget, which was already Rs 100 crore less than the previous year. In mid 2021-22, they further reduced the amount to Rs 619 crore.” Goel said the stress was on increasing the number of taxpayers and initiatives that would benefit the general public. “Till October this fiscal, we added 30,852 new taxpayers and collected Rs 447.9 crore as property tax, which was Rs 69.8 crore more than last year. Besides, Rs 214.8 crore was collected as transfer duty,” said the commissioner. The poor financial state of the civic body was reflected in the proposed budget as no big project was mentioned. There was a repetition of projects, like redevelopment of properties at Minto Road, Cup and Saucer, Kamala Nagar and some parking lots. “Once any of these projects get finalised, we will earn Rs 3,000 crore from the Minto Road redevelopment project,” said Goel. “There is a plan to create space for 13,500 cars by developing multilevel parking lots at 19 locations in next financial year, including Shiva market (Pitampura), Gandhi Maidan, Qutub Road, Sant Nagar, Rani Bagh, Idgah Road, Shastri Park, Rajendra Nagar, U&V-Block and AC Block Shalimar Bagh, Bank Street (Karol Bagh), Madipur, Udyog Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Nangloi, Mundka Metro Station, RG Complex (Paharganj), Pratap Nagar, Pusa Lane and Old City-Sadar Paharganj zonal office. Work on most of the major projects has started,” Goel said. New sites for stack parking have been finalised at Hanuman Setu near Nigam Bodh Ghat and Fatehpuri with space for 300 cars. The corporation currently has 146 parking sites of which 78 are surface, 63 on-street, two stacks and five multilevel. Goel added that the land and estate department had recently taken over the possession of three sites — Young Men’s Tennis Club, Radhe Mohan Club and Union Club near Old Delhi Railway Station — measuring around 10,000 square yards costing Rs 200 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/polls-in-sight-n-corpn-refrains-from-increasing-property-tax/articleshow/87918838.cms||Vibha Sharma

The 20-year-old had got the contact numbers number of senior police officials and then he started threatening about the blasts. However, with the timely technical surveillance and intervention, the youth was arrested within two hours. The suspect, Mohammed Kaif, had threatened that within 10 days, three bomb blasts will occur at three shops. "He had sent a message to various officers on their mobile phones stating that blasts will take place at the shops, which remain open during the day. He challenged that blasts will occur and nobody will be able to stop it. He told us that our time had started and he will leave the message on social media as well," said a police official, quoting the message. Soon technical surveillance was initiated by the cyber cell and a team was constituted. "We have also taken the screenshot of the t message from the mobile phone gallery of the man. His mobile phone and sim cards were also seized. It was also found that the suspect had taken the sim cards using other IDs," said Ram Murthy Joshi, Bhiwadi SP. It was found that Kaif was working at a shop where he had cheated in money transactions and just to cover it up he had sent those threats. "It appears that his purpose was to hide the wrong transactions and cheating he had done at the shop, which was involved in the money transfer work," Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/20-year-old-held-for-making-bomb-threat/articleshow/87918837.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Weighing about 970MT and involving 390cubic metres of concrete, the girder comprising 42MT of steel, was cast in a single piece sans any construction joint on November 1, 2021. The precast girder was picked up from the stacking yard by a straddle carrier and moved to the predefined location from where it was lifted by bridge gantry for installation. The technical procedure requires high level of precision and expertise, said officials, adding the precast girder was placed between Pier P11 and P12 at chainage 238 of MAHSR corridor. Of the 508 kms, 352km of MAHSR lies in Gujarat and Dadar & Nagar Haveli, while the remaining 156km lies in Maharashtra. Civil contracts of 343km have already been awarded.

Stating that it’s nothing but interfering with the commercial activities of theatres, TDP politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu asked what moral right the state government has to talk about increased financial burden on the public while not reducing fuel prices. “YSRC is shedding crocodile tears, saying cinema tickets are being sold at double rates at present. It should instead talk about the overall price rise that is afflicting people,” he said, while demanding the government to explain why it was silent on increased rates of petrol, diesel, cement, liquor and sand in the state. “What is the mystery behind the government interfering with cinema ticket rates? With each passing day, new bankrupt policies are being brought to punish people,” he added.

A meeting of business advisory committee, which has representatives from all political parties, will be held on November 29 and a final announcement will be made after that. The assembly session was scheduled to commence on December 7 but was deferred following the code of conduct in force for the election of six seats of the legislative council to be held on December 10, and also the health of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who recently underwent a cervical spine surgery. He is still in hospital and is undergoing physiotherapy. It is likely he will not be allowed to undertake long journeys once discharged. “We will hold the session in Mumbai as it will not be advisable for the CM to travel to Nagpur so soon after his operation,” said a minister.

Commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said the corporation would try to push for its completion before that time. “It will be a green, environment friendly building with solar panels. We are setting an example for other builders to follow,” Fernandes said. Monserrate said CCP’s building is crumbling with beams broken and added that he is grateful to the chief minister and urban development minister for clearing the file. Fernandes said Goa State Urban Development Agency had tendered the project and work will begin behind the existing CCP building.

---||Delhi||Delhi govt nod for setting up a cell to oversee Yamuna cleaning||New Delhi: To clean the Yamuna by February 2025, the Delhi government approved the formation of a river cleaning cell on Thursday. “In order to expedite inter-departmental decision-making and execution, we have formed a Yamuna cleaning cell (YCC) today, headed by CEO, DJB, and with representatives of all departments concerned. This will expedite the Yamuna cleaning process,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted. Kejriwal convened on Thursday a high-level review meeting on management of wastewater from industrial areas and slum clusters in the context of the Yamuna cleaning project. Industries minister and Delhi Jal Board chairman Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev and DJB CEO Udit Prakash Rai attended it. Kejriwal said the cell would expedite the government’s projects on cleaning the river and overcome all administrative hurdles. He had recently announced that the river would definitely be cleaned by February 2025. DJB will take over the operations and maintenance of common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) to prevent industrial waste from falling into the Yamuna and drainage from slum clusters will be diverted to sewage treatment plants to eliminate untreated discharge into storm water drains. “As a responsible government, the Yamuna cleaning is our most critical priority at this stage. We have to work upon this issue with the same mindset and seriousness that we had while transforming the education and the healthcare sectors in the last term,” Kejriwal said. “There can be no compromise with the prioritisation of Yamuna cleaning and water supply in this term.” Kejriwal said a major hurdle was the multiplicity of government bodies and YCC was being formulated to oversee all of them. “It will help us in identifying and delegating responsibility and streamline our projects. For instance, if an issue is being faced because of the electroplating industries or some other polluting works, the cell would have to take care of that,” he added. The cell will have six senior officials of DJB, DUSIB, DSIIDC, DPCC and the irrigation and flood control department looking after sewerage of slum clusters and industrial clusters, CETPs, industries violating pollution norms, Yamuna cleaning projects and in situ treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-nod-for-setting-up-a-cell-to-oversee-yamuna-cleaning/articleshow/87918858.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||West Bengal goes past 9 crore Covid-19 vaccine-mark||KOLKATA: The state crossed the 9-crore jab mark on Thursday when more than 4,000 vaccination sites were activated across Bengal. So far, around 86% of the state’s eligible population has been covered with the first dose. About 38% have received both the doses. According to health officials, vaccine supply is in abundance now and plans are afoot to optimise the inoculation drive further. With 1.5 crore vaccine doses in the state kitty, health officials pressed 4,229 vaccination sites into action on Thursday. By 6pm, close to 5 lakh doses had been administered to reach the 9 crore milestone. “We had achieved the 8-crore mark on November 3. Now with one more crore jabs administered in the past 22 days, we have now achieved the 9-crore milestone,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. The state health machinery started speeding up the drive since September as the supply of vaccines became more stable. Around 3 crore doses were administered in September and October. The inoculation drive lost its momentum during the Durga Puja even as the government kept the drive open. But officials ensured to resume the speed after the festivity. With about 86% of the adult population having received the first dose, the state currently is giving more thrust on the second dose. “About 20% to 25% jabs administered is the first dose while the rest is spent on inoculating second-dose recipients,” said Das Malakar. Currently, more stress is being given to a few districts where the first dose coverage is still below 80%. These districts are Malda, Murshidabad, Uttar Dinajpur and Rampurhat health district. According to health officials, vaccine vials are now arriving in the state almost daily. On Thursday, 10 lakh doses arrived, adding to the state’s stock of vaccines. Due to the vaccine abundance in government CVCs, most private CVCs now wear a deserted look. The state has been administering above 6 lakh doses daily over the past few days. “We will be targeting to administer anything between 6 lakh and 10 lakh doses per day as we have enough vials in our stock,” said a health department official. The state has also roped in NGOs to conduct door-to-door search for people who have not taken a single dose or have missed out on the second dose. Currently, the campaign is being initiated in districts, like the two Parganas, Malda and Murshidabad. By maintaining a good inoculation pace, Bengal already has pipped states like Gujarat and Rajasthan that were ahead earlier. Currently, West Bengal holds the third position — after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra — as far as dispensing the highest number of doses goes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-goes-past-9-crore-vaccine-mark/articleshow/87918067.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Schools have started offline classes by calling the Class VII and VIII students in batches at 50% capacity to be able to maintain social distancing, as sessions for students from Class IX to XII are already on. The rest of the schools are preparing to call students of Class VII and VIII from next week. “We are already having physical classes for all students of Class IX and X. So for Class VII and VIII, we called only students from one of three divisions of each class or one-third of the students to begin with. As days go by, we will see how it goes and gradually call more students,” said Vilas Satarkar, headmaster of Dr K B Hedgewar High School, Cujira. Most schools held consultations with parents a day prior to discuss how to go about conducting sessions for students from Class VII to VIII. “Of the students who were called to school, we saw 100% attendance. We saw that all parents were in favour of the school reopening for Class VII and VIII students during the consultation,” said Satarkar. Chairman of the management of Shree Shantadurga High School in Bicholim, Vijay Sardesai, said that the school, besides holding a consultation with parents, had also taken an undertaking from them before calling students to school. “We have started classes for Class VII-VIII by calling students from each class on alternate days. We started conducting classes for them from Monday itself, based on demand from parents, before the education department permitted these students to come to school. We are seating them at 50% capacity, which is why we have to call them on alternate days. It takes time to do the sanitisation, checking of the temperature, etc,” said Sardesai, who said they are seeing 95% attendance. Manager of New Education Institute, Curchorem, Satyesh Kakodkar, said that the school will start classes for Class VII and VIII students from Monday. “We have at least 800 students studying from Class VII to X. So, we have bifurcated each division into two. And we will hold classes at 50% capacity by calling them on alternate days. We have to take it slow with students from Class VII and VII. They are coming to school after a gap of 20 months so we have to see what the mindset of the students is like right now. The student who was in Class V when the pandemic hit, is now in Class VII,” said Kakodkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/physical-classes-for-vii-viii-begin-at-50-capacity-in-some-institutes/articleshow/87918840.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro queue returns with tokens making a comeback after 21-month Covid break||KOLKATA: Tokens were back at the Metro and so are queues with commuters like Arabindo Dey from Sonarpur, Nitish Ghosh from Belgharia and Kumar Haldar from Haltu queueing up at the ticket counters to collect tokens for a ride on Thursday. “I didn’t want to spend Rs 120 for a smart card when I should have spent Rs 10 or Rs 20 for a token to travel up or down or take a round trip between Kalighat and Esplanade. Two days ago, I read in the papers that tokens will be issued. So here I am, back on the Metro after a year,” smiled Haldar, a technician in a printing press at Taltala. “During the pandemic, I am on duty thrice a week. On and off, there are holidays. I also take sick or casual leave. The smart card seemed a waste. I took the bus instead,” the 58-year-old explained. Metro Railway, which reintroduced tokens (available for Rs 5 for the shortest 2km distance) for the first time on Thursday after March 23, 2020, has prepared itself to ensure safety against contagion. It has fed around 3 lakh tokens into the system so that an adequate number of fresh tokens are available to passengers from its 26 North-South stations and the seven along the East-West Metro. “Around 3.5 lakh people ride the Metro every day. Presuming around 60,000 to 70,000 will buy tokens, we have four times the requirement for ready use,” said an official. Metro also has in place a most scientific system of disinfecting the handheld plastic discs — 40 ultraviolet sanitizer machines that sterilize more than 300 tokens in four minutes. “If fresh tokens are ready for use, the reused ones won’t be needed. More time could be spent on sterilizing the used lot if there are enough sanitized ones available in the cash counters already,” the official added. Metro has been avoiding tokens all this time. Even as the transport lifeline had resumed services twice during the pandemic — first from September last year after a six-month hiatus and again after a two-month break because of the second wave — only contactless smart cards were allowed for boarding trains. Finally, giving in to the clamour of those who didn’t travel every day and were reluctant to lock money in smart cards (Rs 80 deposited as security), Metro Railway decided to reintroduce tokens. Weeks before the March 2020 lockdown, the tokens were manually washed with disinfectant and detergents. Exposed to the damp treatment, many smart tokens were damaged. The dry UV machines are perfectly compatible with the chips inside the smart tokens. The sanitization is also foolproof.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-queue-returns-with-tokens-making-a-comeback-after-21-month-covid-break/articleshow/87918075.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ballygunge Circular Road gets new traffic signals||KOLKATA: Kolkata Traffic Police has started the process of installing two new traffic signals on Ballygunge Circular Road — one at the intersection with Deodhar Street and the other with Dover Road — following two fatal accidents involving bikers. Cops are also mulling use of thermo-plastic line marking (demarcating the pavement from the road so that it is easily visible even in fog) and setting up digital speed display boards and speed cameras along with spring posts to stop accidents. “Earlier, we had set up two speed retarders — plastic strips that act as bumpers — at the two crossings on Ballygunge Circular Road. The traffic signal will be for additional safety. If we do find the signal impeding the flow of normal traffic, we will have a rethink,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Sources in East traffic guard said they had already set up “Go Slow” flexes (especially at the two points where the road bends) and have received the mandatory sanction from Lalbazar to set up a new speed camera. The cops are also mulling painting Go Slow slogans at certain points on the road surface so that it is visible from a distance. A separate report is being prepared that will take into account the illumination on the stretch. “We had coordinated with agencies concerned barely a few days back. We might do so again if this can help stop accidents,” said an officer. The local guard though have shot down plans to set up guard rails to demarcate specific lanes. “Any other effort to regulate flow of traffic will lead to lane infringement as it is merely a two-lane road. Since this road is used by some important functionaries of this city, we cannot think of slowing down the average speed on this stretch without a very strong clause,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ballygunge-circular-rd-gets-new-traffic-signals/articleshow/87918080.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Breathalyzer tests keep cyclists in line||KOLKATA: Three fatal and 10 non-fatal accidents in the first 24 days of this month involving cyclists have led Kolkata Traffic Police to carry out breathalyzer tests even on cyclists. The order to test cyclists was issued by Lalbazar on Thursday. If found guilty, cyclists will not be charged under the usual Motor Vehicles Act but under IPC 290 (punishment for public nuisance) or relevant sections of the Calcutta Suburban Police Act. “The necessary drink-driving tests have begun from Thursday,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. The decision is one of many steps being taken to stop haphazard cycling on Kolkata roads. “This move is intended to send out a message that cyclists won’t have free passage when everyone else using the road was being hauled up for breaking rules,” said an officer. “Carry out breathalyzer test for cyclists too. Anyone found having consumed alcohol above the limit (30mg/100ml) should be handed over to local police...” the order stated. Traffic guards have been asked to also impose red light and traffic light violations against cyclists. “The SC has been strict on red-light violations. Hence, we are duty bound to act on cases that cause the maximum number of accidents at crossings. Similarly, we have found that stop-line violations create hindrance to traffic movement,” said an officer. As a future plan, the cops have decided on a few provisions under which cyclists who break rules can be charged. “That will include confiscation of the cycle. So far, they are being let off with warnings,” said an officer. Police have also pointed out that vans and carts cannot take advantage by using relaxations provided to cyclists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/breathalyzer-tests-keep-cyclists-in-line/articleshow/87918089.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kochi||Amrita study sees enhanced role for virtual labs as education tool||Kochi: While institutions made use of virtual labs during the pandemic with learners becoming less dependent on instructors, a study conducted by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham suggests that they seem to be an alternative for laboratory education for distant learners, especially after Covid-19. The study titled “What virtual laboratory usage tells us about laboratory skill education pre and post-Covid 19: Focus on usage, behavior, intention and adoption”, explores the role of virtual laboratories as massive open online courses (MOOCs) in ensuring the continuity of teaching-learning and providing alternative ways for skill-training from home. It also tries to understand the social and behavioral interaction among adopters of virtual laboratories, teachers and students, in the context of an Indian education system using information and communication technologies. To test whether virtualization techniques have a global impact on the education sector, the study included a comparative analysis of student users undergraduate and postgraduate students during the academic year 2019 who opted for blended learning and those of the year 2020, who learned remotely. “The results suggest virtual laboratories may have a prominent role in inquiry-based and self-guided education with minimum instructor dependency, which may be crucial for complementing practice skills and planning online tools to add to the post-Covid-19 teaching and learning scenarios,” said Shyam Diwakar, director, Amrita Mind-Brain Center, and faculty, School of Biotechnology, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, who was involved with the study. More than 90% of users agreed that the virtual platform was useful as an interactive textbook in the absence of an instructor and helped understand experimental concepts with minimum instructor support, according to the study. Among the participants, 20% indicated they have accessed a single module of the experiment only once for learning both theoretical and experimental concepts, while 54% indicated that they accessed less than five times to learn an experiment while 26% indicated they accessed virtual laboratories for more than 10 times in a week for learning the experiment module without an instructor’s support, the study added. What was important is that most students finished a laboratory module in less than 1 hour that would not be possible in the real laboratory, suggesting the efficiency of virtual laboratories as practice tools. “While before and post-Covid-19 may be perceived as two crucially different phases, the post-Covid-19 study on these virtual laboratory usages reveal that these novel trends on the adoption of ICT tools are based on online learning behaviors observed even before the lockdowns. Technology helped students to be better prepared for the wet lab. However, the virtual lab can never replace a real lab in science,” added Bipin Nair, dean of Life Sciences, School of Biotechnology, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, who was also part of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/amrita-study-sees-enhanced-role-for-virtual-labs-as-education-tool/articleshow/87917353.cms||---

---||Dehradun||45 dead in human-animal conflict in U'khand in 9 months||Dehradun: The state has seen the worst-ever man-animal conflict in the past nine months. In all, 45 people have died and 171 attacked by wild animals. As per data, leopard attacks have been behind most of the casualties (19), followed by snakebites (14), elephant attacks (8), tiger attacks (2); and wild pig and bear attacks (1 each). On Wednesday, three women were attacked by a bear. They are undergoing treatment at a Dehradun health centre. Triggering panic among residents was the leopard attack that claimed two lives last week. Living in constant fear, residents say such attacks are bound to rise during winter. The main reason for an increase in the human-animal conflict in the Himalayan state, according to experts, is that Uttarakhand has lost over 50,000 hectares of its forest cover to urbanisation and developmental activities in the past two decades. This has not just reduced food for wildlife, forcing them to venture into human settlements but also hit their habitat size, which has shrunk substantially. “There is a nexus between politicians, builders and forest department. Uttarakhand is seeing rapid deforestation and rapid urbanisation without any check, impacting the wildlife. Also forest department plans to change the forest definition to any area less than 5 hectares having trees to be tagged as a forest, which means they want to convert almost 10,000 sq km forest area into plain landscape, which is further worrying as it will only aggravate the human-wildlife conflict,” said Ajay S Rawat, former chairman, International Union of Forest Research Organisations (IUFRO), Vienna. Due to shrinking forest cover, leopards, tigers and elephants are expanding their territory. “We have around 9 elephant corridors across the state. Do we know their present status and the amount of construction activities that they have undergone? Gola river corridor connects Terai East and Terai central forest divisions. This one has been choked due to anthropogenic pressure. The condition of other corridors isn’t very appealing either,” said Padma Shri awardee Anup Shah. Forest officials say factors like increasing population of these wild animals and lack of adequate wildlife estimation have also led to a rise in the conflict. Airing their views, senior IFS officers of forest department said: “It is high time the research studies’ outcome be implied for which forest department pays huge sums to WII and GB Pant-level premier institutes to combat the rising conflicts in our state.” “Extensive and continued awareness programme on co-existence of human and wildlife needs to be conducted too,” said another IFS officer.  The death toll was 62 the previous year, while 58 people succumbed to animal attacks in 2019 and 52 in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/45-dead-in-human-animal-conflict-in-ukhand-in-9-months/articleshow/87917354.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra gives nod to reopen all classes from standard 1 on December 1||MUMBAI: Two fresh batches of tiny tots will walk into schools for the first time on December 1 as the state Cabinet on Thursday gave its nod to reopen all classes in the physical mode. Students admitted to Class 1 in 2020 and this year have been attending online classes only. With this, just nursery and kindergarten classes will remain in online-only mode. A final decision on reopening primary and secondary schools in the city will be taken by the municipal commissioner. Over 11 lakh students from classes 1 to 7 in the city have been attending online schools for 19 months. The existing standard operating procedure (SOP), including parental consent for physical presence in schools, will continue. The proposal to reopen all schools from Class 1 was put forward by the education department after consultations with the paediatric Covid-19 task force. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is recuperating after a cervical spine surgery, chaired the cabinet meeting online from the hospital on Thursday. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said schools, parents and the paediatric task force will be consulted for further fine-tuning of the SOP for younger children. “These students will be returning to campus for the first time in nearly two years. We want them to feel safe and acclimatise to physical schooling. Primary section children are very young and it may be difficult to ensure that they wear a mask and keep physical distance at all times. Experts were of the opinion that children need to step into the normal world or else many will drop out of the education system. So we decided to open up schools,” she said. Education department officials said a decision on reopening pre-primary schools, anganwadis and daycare centres will be taken based on the response of primary students’ parents. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said the proposal to reopen classes 1 to 7 will be placed before the civic body after the fresh government circular is released.The circular is expected in a day or two. Schools welcomed the decision but stressed on compulsory attendance. “It will be difficult to teach small children in the online and offline mode simultaneously,” said Ulhas Wadodkar, principal, Suvidyalaya high school, Borivli (West). A group of parents that had petitioned the CM to start all classes said they welcome the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sop-will-be-fine-tuned-for-primary-schoolkids/articleshow/87919734.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Surat||Two security guards, car washer questioned||SURAT/VADODARA: Investigators probing the alleged gang rape and suicide of an 18-year-old girl made some headway into the blind case after her cycle was found in Vadodara on Thursday. The cycle was found following a tip-off by a woman living near Atlantis II, close to Vaccine Ground in Vadodara, where the alleged crime is said to have taken place. Police also detained a security guard of the building where the woman was working in the Oasis Institute, a voluntary organization in Vadodara. He is being questioned but it is not clear if he was involved in the crime. The guard had hid her bicycle under a heap of dried leaves and the guard working at the building where the NGO is operating knew each other, sources in police informed.  The victim’s body was recovered from Gujarat Queen Express on November 4. A case of gangrape has been registered by Valsad railway police based on the details written by the deceased in her diary and injuries found in a postmortem report.  Cops were combing the area around Vaccine Ground when a woman tipped cops that a man in his early forties, who used to wash cars, was missing for the past few days. “We traced the person following his suspicious disappearance. During questioning, he said he first noticed the girl’s bicycle parked near Atlantis II. We then detained Mahesh Rathwa, (39), a security guard at Atlantis II who confessed that he found the bicycle and took it to his home near Punitnagar for his daughter,” said a police officer of local crime branch (LCB), Government Railway Police, Vadodara.  The woman first noticed the bicycle while leaning on a wall near the building but it later it was missing. “Meanwhile, Mahesh realized that police were searching for the bicycle when he removed two wheels and hid the remaining frame under a heap of dried leaves. It is suspicious why he hid the frame instead of informing cops,” said a police officer. “We have not zeroed in on any person yet and we are gathering evidence. We got a lead about the bicycle but the accused are yet to get identified,” said Parikshita Rathod, superintendent of police, GRP. According to the description written by the girl in her diary, police suspect that she was gang raped on October 28 after being kidnapped at around 6.21 pm. She was then helped by a bus driver to reach a safe location and she went to her hostel. Vadodara cops at public mercyThe Vadodara police have sought help from the public to crack the 18-year-old girl’s alleged gangrape case. The cops have put out a post on its official twitter account and requested the people to provide any information they have about the case by calling up either the police control room or the crime branch. The post has several phone numbers. Stalker is sexual pervertPolice found that the man, who was caught stalking the girl at Surat railway station few hours before her body was recovered, is a sexual pervert. He spent hours watching porn videos on mobile phone. He made obscene gestures to the deceased on that fateful night after which she sent messages to her NGO colleagues that someone was following her. "He watched porn for six to seven hours daily on his mobile. He is sexually pervert," a source said. Sources added he used to clandestinely click photos of women and girls in marriage and other functions when he worked with a catering service. It has also been revealed that he was addicted to masturbation also.  Surprisingly, Surat cops have not lodged any offence against him. “At present, we are focusing on those who are involved in alleged gangrape.

---||Varanasi||KVT walls being treated under KV Dham project||Revised Varanasi: Many institutes and agencies had been involved in saving the artistic walls of Kashi Vishwanath Temple from the cancerous impact of enamel paint repeatedly before 2008, but the conservation of the temple walls has finally become possible under the Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project. “One of the two domes of the temple has been cleared of enamel paint with the beginning of restoration and conservation work under the KV Dham project,” said divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Areas Development Board Deepak Agrawal. The porous stones of the temple absorb water along with salt and minerals through capillary action, but on applying plastic paint they start decaying as the moisture gets locked inside the stones. Disclosing the details, Agrawal said, “As previous attempts for conservation and restoration of damaged walls of the temple yielded no results, we took up the work at KVT and 24 other old temples unearthed during demolition of 296 buildings purchased for the KV Dham project. Provision of the budget for conservation and restoration of old temple buildings had been made in the Rs 700-crore budget of the KV Dham project.” “After major civil work was completed, the process of conservation and restoration of artistic walls of 17 temples including KVT was started. The conservation work of the remaining 8 temples will be done later,” he added. “At KVT, the work of removing layers of enamel paint for conserving the stone structure and restoration of artistic carving is done only on the outer wall,” said temple’s chief executive officer Sunil Verma, adding that one of the domes and temple structure has been conserved while work on the main KVT building has been started. “The golden top of the KVT dome will also be cleaned. A company, Tanishq, has been roped in for this work,” said Agrawal. The restoration of artistic walls with its conservation and cleaning of golden top will be completed before the inauguration of the KV Dham corridor by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in mid of December. Regarding the decision of closing the temple between 6am and 6pm on November 29 and 30 and for 24 hours on December 1, Verma said that it has been taken for cleaning the marble floor of the main temple which was difficult in the presence of devotees. Built in 1777 by Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore, the KVT’s dome was covered with gold donated by Punjab Kesari Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in 1839. The threat to KVT’s architectural marvel was generated after enamel paints were applied on its walls for five-six before 2008. After Shatrudra Prakash, general secretary of the Citizen’s Forum and Samajwadi Party MLC drew attention of the temple administration and government machinery towards this lapse, the KVT Trust and UP government initially sought help of ASI that recommended assigning national research laboratory for conservation of cultural property (NRLC) in 2009. However, as the NRLC estimated a cost of Rs 2.19 crore for removing the enamel paint from the stone walls in 2010, the KVT turned down the proposal. Another estimate of Rs 1.22 crore given by NRLC for the same work in 2013-14 was also not accepted. After it, the temple trust had engaged Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee by paying Rs 57 lakh in December 2014 to find ways for removing enamel paint from the artistic walls of the temple apart from assessing the strength of the stony structure of KVT building. The CBRI conducted a study in 2015 but its recommendations were not accepted by the trust. In 2019, the Indian Institute of Technology-Roorkee conducted 3D imaging and mapping of the artistic walls of the temple to assess damages and decide ways of their restoration. But, the required restoration work was finally started in the KV Dham project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvt-walls-being-treated-under-kv-dham-project/articleshow/87918883.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Verma also directed the DGP to issue a circular in this regard to all police stations in the state. The court stressed that adults have the right to marry a person of their choice. The court noted that it was receiving 10-15 petitions every day by such couples and rapped the police for "not performing their duties properly." It observed that the police failed to provide couples protection even though they filed applications addressed to the senior superintendent of police before approaching the court. "Such cases can be settled within police stations itself," the court noted. The court’s observations came while hearing a case of disputed property in Nainital, in which the police had registered a case on the complaint of one party and not on the complaint of the other side. As reported by TOI earlier, the court had ordered the SSP to appear in the matter but was told that she is on leave and is not traceable. Expressing displeasure, the court thereafter asked the DGP to make an appearance. The DGP appeared in the court via videoconference and told the bench that the kotwal had been suspended for negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/register-fir-take-strict-action-against-those-who-threaten-couples-others-on-caste-communal-grounds-ukhand-hc/articleshow/87917414.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Countries focussing on tech, innovation remain in forefront, says Prez Kovind||Kanpur: Emphasizing the need of innovation and technology development in India, President Ram Nath Kovind said here on Thursday that only those countries remain in the forefront, which give priority to innovation and new technology and continuously enable their citizens to face the challenges of the future. He was addressing the centenary celebrations of Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), one of the oldest institutions of the state. “Our country has increased its credibility in the field of technology, but we still have a long way to go. Technical institutions like HBTU should inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship in their students. Students should be provided an environment from the very beginning in which they can contribute to the development of the country by becoming ‘job givers’ instead of ‘job seekers’,” the President said. He also urged the former students of HBTU to help current students who are in need. The President lit a lamp to mark the start of the three-day centenary year celebrations of the university. “When HBTU is celebrating its centenary, the country is celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to commemorate 75 years of independence. And in the year 2047, when the country will be celebrating the centenary of independence, HBTU will be completing its 125 years,” he highlighted. Lauding the role of HBTU in the field of academics, Kovind said that the university has been recognized for its contribution in the fields of oil, paint, plastic and food technologies. “The glorious history of this institution is linked to the industrial development taking place in India since the beginning of the 20th century. The technology and human resources provided by HBTU has been instrumental behind the fame of Kanpur as ‘Manchester of the East’, ‘Leather City of the World’ and ‘Industrial Hub’,” he said. The President also pointed to the current ranking of HBTU in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), which is at 166th. “It should be the endeavour of all stakeholders of HBTU that by the year 2047, this university should be ranked among the top 25 institutes of the country.” Emphasizing that to achieve this goal, all the stakeholders will have to work with determination. “I am confident that all the stakeholders would make every effort to take HBTU and the country to new heights,” he said. Kovind also pointed to the low participation of girl students in technical education. “I have attended convocations of many educational institutions across the country and observed that the performance of girls was very impressive. However, in the field of technical education, participation of girl students is not satisfactory. Today, the need is to encourage more and more girls to come forward in the field of technical education to boost women empowerment,” the President said. Referring to the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2021 held in New Delhi last Saturday, the President noted that in the Swachh Survekshan among the urban bodies of the country, Kanpur city jumped to 21st place in 2021 from 173rd in 2016. “I know the people of Kanpur. If they decide to do something, they achieve it,” he said, urging them to make the goal of cleanliness of the city a mass movement. He also expressed confidence that the administration and municipal corporation of Kanpur would take inspiration from Indore city, which is consistently ranked first in the country in cleanliness, and make efforts to rank Kanpur in the five cleanest cities of the country. Great enthusiasm was seen among the university administration, faculty members, current and former students on the varsity completing its hundred years of establishment. The programme became all the more special due to the presence of the President, Governor and Chancellor of state universities Anandiben Patel. Ministers Satish Mahana, Jitendra Prasad, Neelima Katiyar were also present on the dais.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/countries-focussing-on-tech-innovation-remain-in-forefront-says-prez-kovind/articleshow/87918905.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

There's more than a month remaining for the season to be declared as over. “The state received 3,522.2mm rainfall as on November 24, 2021, the highest since 1961. According to IMD data, the closest to this figure was during the Kerala floods in 2018 when the state recorded 3520.1mm rainfall,” said P S Biju, senior scientist-IMD, Thiruvananthapuram. According to the IMD data, between 1901 and 2021, eight years have recorded annual rainfall of more than 3,500mm. The highest stands at an unbeaten 4,258mm in 1961, followed by 4,226.4mm in 1924, 4,073mm in 1933, 3,746mm in 1959, 3,671.2mm in 1907, 3,565.5mm in 1946, 3,522.2 in 2021 (till November 24) and 3,520.1mm in 2018. In 1961, which recorded the highest ever rainfall, all districts except Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam recorded more than 3,500mm rain and northern Kerala districts such as Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod recorded more than 5500mm rainfall with Kozhikode recording the highest of 6236.4mm. The rainfall received in the core monsoon season months of June and July this year was much less than those recorded in August, September, October and November. “Such has been the change in rainfall pattern that we should now be thinking of giving a time-shift for the June 1-September 30 monsoon season. June is the core rainfall month for Kerala while it is July for rest of the country. But for some years now, that has changed. We have been seeing cyclonic formations just before the monsoon onset in mid-May. Normally, the monsoon current comes into the Arabian Sea and one branches off into the Bay of Bengal. But we are seeing a cyclonic storm in that region which is taking away the monsoon rains,” said Prof K Mohan Kumar, founder director, Advanced Centre for AtmoSpheric Radar Research (ACARR), Cochin University. He said atmospheric humidity is very high and fully saturated during the monsoon period. “That’s why we are seeing so much increase in quantity of rainfall. If this humidity occurred during the non-rainfall months of February-March, it will just get evaporated,” he said. Veteran atmospheric scientist C K Rajan said Kerala will have to look for ways to store this rainwater because more than 70% is going in overflow. “Climate change is here to stay. Now, we have been having excess rainfall, but it could suddenly change into a deficient season too in the coming years. Storage mechanisms have to be increased so that the excess waters released from the reservoirs could be saved instead of flowing into the sea,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/at-3522mm-state-records-highest-rainfall-since-1961/articleshow/87918277.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Noida||Special day for special guests: Farmers from Jewar villages who parted with their ancestral land||JEWAR: Farmers from villages in Jewar reached the site of the ground-breaking ceremony in large numbers on Thursday, being as much an integral part of the occasion as the airport itself. The ones who have parted with their ancestral land to make way for the Noida International Airport — 1,334 hectares were acquired for Phase 1 — were given special status equivalent to VIPs and sat in special enclosures that had been set up near the main stage. Many who arrived earlier managed to find seats while the others mingled within the four enclosures created for VIPs or blended in with fellow villagers in the crowd. “We have been given the status of ‘vishisht atithi (special guest)’. Many of us didn’t know we would be allowed within the VIP enclosure with a pass, so only a limited number of people who had it came. The others are watching the proceedings live from the screens,” said Pravin Agarwal, a youth in late 20s from Kishorpur, one of the villages acquired for the airport. Pravin’s neighbour Bhagwat Prasad, who is in his late 40s, was informed in advance by a contractual employee deputed in Jewar tehsil about the importance of the passes, only 600 of which had been issued to landholders and local residents, according to an administrative officer. Others who were not offered any special status had no complaints either. For many, it was an occasion to celebrate what they saw as a new wave of development for the region, one that would help them and their families prosper with many new job and business opportunities. For instance, Satyavir Bhati, his relative Ravindra and two others heading back home on a bike spotted a few villagers and immediately stopped to distribute sweets they had bought soon after leaving the venue. “I am from Falaida Bangar in Jewar. Our village has not been acquired. But it is the first time we got to see an event of this scale in our area. Though my village is connected to Delhi via a wide expressway, I had never experienced city life the way I felt on Wednesday noon. I just feel overwhelmed and elated,” said Satyavir. Satyavir and Ravindra, who is from Karauli Bangar, enthusiastically participated in Thursday’s event along with their families. While their wives and children were packed together on a tractor-trolley from the village, the two men rode to the venue on their motorcycles. At the same time, Ravindra acknowledged that dozens of families are still camping under tarpaulin sheets in the biting cold, not too far from the fanfare. “They claim their rehabilitation and resettlement (RnR) benefits have not been paid yet. We feel sorry for them and hope the administration resolves their problems if they are genuine,” he said. The group of villagers standing nearby added that more than 95% of people have already got their dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/special-day-for-special-guests-farmers-who-parted-with-their-ancestral-land/articleshow/87919342.cms||Shalabh

---||Kochi||Law student’s death: Congress protest turns violent in Kerala's Aluva||KOCHI: The protest by Congress workers, seeking the dismissal of inspector CL Sudheer in connection the suicide of law student Mofiya Parveen over domestic violence, turned violent on Thursday. Aluva town witnessed violence for over three hours and police had to use force to disperse protesters who tried to enter the premises of district police chief’s (Ernakulam Rural) office around 11am. Meanwhile, a special investigation team, led by deputy SP V Rajeev from Ernakulam Rural district crime branch, will investigate Mofiya’s case. The protesters, led by DCC president Mohammed Shiyas, were stopped by using barricades a few 100m away from the chief’s office by the police. At the same time, a sit-in- protest, attended by MPs Hibi Eden and Benny Behanan and MLAs Anwar Sadat, Roji M John and Eldhose Kunnappilly, was launched in front of Aluva East police station. Mofiya’s parents met the leaders. But, the protest turned violent when party workers hurled stones, eggs and wooden pieces at the police. More than 200 policemen, who were deployed there, retaliated with lathicharge, teargas shells and water cannons multiple times. Though the protest was called off by 1.30pm after consultation with opposition leader VD Satheesan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran, Behanan said that they will not stop until the officer is dismissed and arrested. Sudhakaran, who criticized the government for ‘honouring’ the inspector by transferring him to the police headquarters, said the fight for truth and justice cannot be stopped by police force. He said that the 11,124 cases registered for atrocities against women this year showed women were unsafe under Pinarayi’s government. Police also took 20-odd students of Al-Azhar Law College, Thodupuzha –where Mofiya studied–into custody for protesting at the SP office. Ajmal Hakeem Pattery, a student, said the police acted without provocation. Meanwhile, Ernakulam DIG Neeraj Kumar Gupta, who conducted an enquiry in the way the case was handled initially, will submit a report to the state police chief soon. Though he kept mum, it is learnt that the enquiry found severe lapses on the part of inspector Sudheer as he registered a case of domestic violence only after Mofiya’s death though the complaint was filed 25 days ago. But, Congress leaders alleged that the report did not mention anything about the unprofessional behaviour of the policeman. Meanwhile, Aluva FCJM court remanded Mofiya’s husband Mohammed Suhail and in-laws Rukhya and Yousuf (who were arrested on Wednesday) into judicial custody for 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/law-students-death-cong-protest-turns-violent-in-aluva/articleshow/87917440.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Whistle removed from boy’s lung||Kolkata: A 12-year-old boy got a new lease of life after a plastic whistle, which he had “swallowed” 10 months ago, was removed from his right bronchus by a team of doctors at IPGMER on Thursday. Rayhan Laskar from Baruipur had accidentally swallowed the two-centre-long plastic whistle at home in January. His parents rushed him to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. The boy was treated with medication for seven days, after which doctors referred him to SSKM Hospital. Despite this advice, his parents took him home. “He didn’t have much problem apart from cold and cough initially, which was treated with alternative medicine. But his condition deteriorated and he started having severe breathing issues,” said a relative of the boy. When doctors came across the boy at IPGMER’s ENT OPD, they knew they would have to act swiftly to save the boy. He was admitted immediately and all relevant investigations were carried out to find the exact location of the whistle. “We found the object lodged in his right bronchus. The surgery was risky as the object had been there for 10 months and it had got wrapped around his body tissues. We had to be extremely cautious,” said ENT assistant professor, Arindam Das. Under the supervision of department head, Arunabha Sengupta, the medical team comprising Das, Ankit Choudhary and Aripurna Mondal decided to remove the object via a bronchoscopy procedure. On Thursday morning, Rayhan was put on the operating table, an endoscopy was lowered in the trachea and the object was brought out successfully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/whistle-removed-from-boys-lung/articleshow/87918235.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Lucknow||City crosses 50L vax doses milestone, highest in state||Lucknow: With over 27,500 people taking the jab against Covid-19 on Thursday, Lucknow crossed the milestone of administering 50 lakh doses, highest in comparison to other districts of the state. The feat was accomplished in 10 months since the roll out of the mass immunisation campaign on January 16 to vaccinate the entire 37.4 lakh population aged 18 years and above. However, a close look at the data also reveals a significant gap between rural and urban populations covered during the drive. On Wednesday, 15,983 people took their second shot, thus completing the two-dose course and taking the number of fully vaccinated beneficiaries to 17.6 lakh, which is 47% of the total adult population. Similarly, the number of partially vaccinated people with a dose reached 14.8 lakh — nearly 40% of the population — with at least 11,557 individuals taking their first dose. Lucknow’s urban adult population is 23.6 lakh. Of these, about 57% (13.6 lakh) people in urban areas have so far been fully vaccinated and 33% (7 lakh) have received a single jab and are waiting for the second. In comparison, of the 13.7 lakh rural adult population, 4 lakh (29%) people have been fully vaccinated and 7.1 lakh (52%) partially.  This means that the rate of vaccination in the rural belt is significantly lower than in urban areas. Officers cite delay in the start of the inoculation drive in rural areas and hesitancy among people due to several myths as the main reason for the villagers lagging in overall vaccination. Also, overall 5 lakh people have not taken any dose so far.  Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, “Initially, the target was to cover as much as the population as possible in quick time. Hence, the focus was on urban areas where more people reside. Besides, there were some rural pockets, where vaccination started late. But later, by cluster approach and special camps, rural areas also picked up pace.”  Now, in the ongoing door-to-door awareness campaign in the villages, healthcare teams including Asha and Anganwadi workers are busting myths and motivating people to take the jab as soon as possible, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-crosses-50l-vax-doses-milestone-highest-in-state/articleshow/87919350.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

However, residents of the twin cites, who have been eagerly awaiting this transformation will have to continue doing so for another two months. The Hubballi-Dharwad Smart Cities Ltd (HDSCL) has directed contractors entrusted with the task of upgrading various roads to expedite the process, and is hoping to unveil the refurbished roads no later than mid-February. Koppikar Road, Dajibanpeth Road and Murusavira Math Road will be upgraded by February, while Coen Road, Shah Bazar Road, Maratha Galli and MG Park Road are expected to be wear a new look before the end of the year. The roads in the twin cities are being upgraded under the ‘Smart Cities’ project, with funds to the tune of Rs 89 crore being released in two instalments for the same.  People in the business community, in particular, have been complaining about the poor condition of roads in the twin cities, besides calling on the authorities to expedite work on thoroughfares slated for an upgrade by the HDSCL. Clamour for fixing the poor roads only grew louder in the wake of the recent showers, prompting the authorities to expedite work on the thoroughfares. Upset with the pace at which the roads are being repaired, shopkeepers in the twin cities’ commercial pockets have taken to blocking roads to express their ire at both the civic authorities and the elected representatives. HDSCL managing director CW Shakeel Ahmed said that the Covid-induced crisis, among others, stalled work on the roads. “Now that there are no more hurdles to speedy execution of the project, instructions have been issued to all contractors to finish work by December. We will monitor their progress to ensure that they meet the deadline,” Ahmed said. The HDSCL MD said that the concentration of people and traffic congestion on the thoroughfares was adding to the delay in completing work on those roads, while work on some of the bylanes, where there was less movement of people and markedly lower vehicular movement, work was proceeding apace. “Contractors have been asked to ensure work goes on uninterruptedly round-the-clock,” Ahmed added. ‘Will take stock again in December’ I have inspected all the roads, and directed officials to complete work at the earliest so the citizens are not inconvenienced. We will take stock of the situation again in December. - Shankar Patil Munenakoppa | Dharwad District In-Charge Minister||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/work-on-roads-being-upgraded-under-smart-cities-project-to-be-completed-in-two-months/articleshow/87917438.cms||J Abbas Mulla

A Saravanan, a maths teacher, took permission from the school and went to his father-in-law’s house at Sengattupatti in Trichy where he hanged himself in a room in the upstairs. He is survived by his wife and two sons. The girl, who was a student of the same school, had ended her life at her house on November 19 after leaving a suicide note blaming sexual harassment for her action though she did not name anyone. The only daughter of her widowed mother, she was also attending NEET coaching class at the school. Stating that she should be the last victim of sexual harassment, she said she was afraid of revealing the identity of the perpetrators of the crime. Vengamedu police which booked a case of suspicious death could not get any clue about her allegations. Police said Saravanan was not taking classes for the girl as she was in another section. However, some students dragged him to the issue and made insulting comments against him, stated Saravanan in his suicide note. A facebook post while regretting his action, praised Saravanan’s dedication to teaching saying several students had benefited from it. Thuraiyur police brought Saravanna’s body to the government hospital for post-mortem and are investigating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/upset-at-being-linked-to-girls-suicide-teacher-44-ends-life/articleshow/87918906.cms||---

The primary objective behind the ZP’s decision to construct the ‘pink’ toilets is to create a safe and secure atmosphere for girls and secure their menstrual hygiene. Of the 32 pink toilets that the ZP is planning to build across Gadag, eight have been completed. Each of these completed lavatories in Hulkoti, Jakkalli, Bogeri, Lakkundi, Gojanur, Hunasikatti, Mevundi and Kotumachagi villages, consists of an incinerator set up exclusively for discarded sanitary napkins, a dressing room and a rest room. A source in the Gadag ZP said, “By creating an atmosphere where adolescent girls do not have to worry about their menstrual hygiene, we are hoping to increase enrolment at government girls’ high schools across the district.” Gadag ZP chief executive officer S Bharat told TOI that the construction of ‘pink’ toilets was being undertaken as part of the ‘Swachh Bharat’ initiative, and by enlisting workers roped in as part of the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). “We are focussing exclusively on girls’ high schools in rural areas. Having completed constructing eight of the 32 ‘pink’ toilets, work is under way on the remaining 24, which will be completed in a month’s time. We are spending approximately Rs 5-6 lakh on the construction of each lavatory,” Bharat said. Headmistress of the Government Girl’s High School in Lakkundi, one of the institutions where the ‘pink’ toilet is up and running, Manjula Gudagur said, “Earlier, many girls chose not to attend school during their periods owing to the lack of a hygienic facility on the campus, but following the construction of the ‘pink’ toilets, they are no longer very apprehensive about attending classes. In fact, the strength at our school has shot up to 264. Even parents are feeling a lot more secure sending their girls to our school.” Bhuvaneshwari Kavalur, Nirmala Gundalli, among other students at the school in Lakkundi, admitted that, the presence of the ‘pink’ toilet made them feel much relieved. “This is encouraging many girls not to miss too many classes,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/gadag-zp-undertakes-construction-of-pink-toilets-at-girls-high-schools/articleshow/87917434.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said it would scrutinize the before settling the amounts. The decision comes on the heels of the poor response to PMC’s ‘debris disposal service’, under which the civic body took on responsibility of disposing of construction waste and charges contractors a fee. But many firms that build roads, flyovers, and bridges dump the debris at public places or on the riverbeds. The PMC has prepared a detailed project report to understand the quantity, quality and source of construction and demolition waste. As part of its measure to reduce the debris dumping on the riverbed, PMC had started a transportation facility in 2016, under which it would collect and dispose of construction waste for a fee. Under the new initiative, civic officials said a no-objection certificate will be mandatory for the developer. The NOC will be issued only on submission of proof of scientific disposal. The PMC also operates a helpline (1800 233 9595) for the transportation of C&D waste. The civic body charges Rs19 per tonne per kilometre to lift and transport the waste from the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scientific-debris-disposal-rider-for-contractors-payments/articleshow/87918231.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The panel sought to know why the remand case diary mentioned truck owner P Srinivas Reddy brought the accused to the police station, while the IO stated it was Shadnagar SHO Sridhar Kumar who caught the four from their villages on November 29, 2019. While quizzing the state’s counsel, the chairman pointed out that the panel only wanted to know the link between four accused and the case, and they were not there to establish their criminality. When the panel said they couldn’t find any accused carrying the girl in CCTV footage of Thondupally Toll plaza, state counsel V Surender Rao once again played it. Rao said Jollu Shiva was the man seen riding the bike towards parked truck near the toll plaza on November 27. He said 15-25 metres separated the truck next to highway and the isolated place where she was raped and killed, and said, “An advocate couple was murdered in daylight when bus loads of people were present and no one bothered to stop. That’s how people are. It is easy to drag a girl in such a dark spot and nobody will bother. If panel wants, it can appoint an advocate commission to find out facts by visiting the spot.” Panel asked state counsel to convince them that SHO Kumar had gone to villages and apprehended them since remand case diary of ACP V Surender said it was lorry owner who brought them to the PS. Accused’s family had said men in civil dress came to their houses. When state’s advocate said during cross-examination accused Arif’s father Pinjari Hussain said police in uniform had come to his house with truck owner, the panel said he also mentioned plain clothes men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-asks-state-to-prove-basis-of-arrests/articleshow/87918246.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The victim (45), who is a Manchar-based manager of a credit cooperative society, lodged a complaint against his driver with the Shivajinagar police on Wednesday. Sub inspector Vinod Mahangade of Shivajinagar police station told TOI, “The car owner’s wife went to Ganapati temple located at Budhwar Peth in the car. She kept her cellphone in the car and went to the temple. The driver told her that he would park the car at Shivaji road.” “The woman then returned to Shivaji road but could not find her car,” Mahangade said. He said the driver is not at his home in Manchar. “Police have obtained CCTV footage from the spot and further investigations are on,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/driver-flees-with-car-phone-of-employer/articleshow/87918237.cms||---

Mofiya later ended her life and sought action against the police officer in her suicide note. Speaking to the media here on Thursday, SWC chairperson P Sathidevi said that the commission would approach the chief minister, who is handling the home portfolio, seeking stern action against the officer as there had been complaints against him in the past as well. She said that the incident shows that the anti-women attitude prevailing in the society was affecting the police machinery as well. “Women should be able to go to police stations and lodge complaints without any fear. Actually, police should adopt a stand of taking the complaint of a woman at face value. But often what happens at police stations are a trial,” she said. Sathidevi, however, said that it could not be generalized and added that when compared to other states, women generally can approach police stations in Kerala and lodge complaints in a friendly environment. Sathidevi said that SWC had suggested to the police that officers should be given gender justice training and it should implemented in an effective matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/womens-panel-demands-action-against-police-officer/articleshow/87917450.cms||---
---||Pune||RT-PCR test before joining schools must for boarders in Maharashtra||PUNE: Students studying in boarding schools in Maharashtra, both public and private, will have to undergo a mandatory RT-PCR test at the time of resuming physical attendance, the state paediatric Covid task force has said in its latest guidelines on Thursday. The state government has not issued any order on the reopening of residential schools as yet. Senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the task force, said, “Residential schools can be opened with all the precautions outlined in the previous guidelines for all schools. The only additional recommendation is to do an RT-PCR test at the time of entry to the residential school. Excursions outside the school should be avoided.” Pune, Lonavla, Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar host many private boarding schools. Besides, there are scores of ashram shalas and Navodaya Vidyalayas where students stay on the premises and get an education. Markus Deshmukh, advocate and spokesperson for The Bishop’s School in Pune Cantonment which has boarding facilities, said that the school is adopting a hybrid model of education for secondary classes and online classes for their primary section. “We have a residential school with a capacity of 100 students, but only 25 students are boarders at present. All of these children are in secondary classes. The remaining are attending classes online and most probably will continue to do so. In case there are any students who take up the boarding facility, we will ask them to submit an RT-PCR negative report,” he added. Assistant project officer from Integrated Tribal Development Project that runs the residential ashram shalas that house 4.49 lakh students in the state, the highest among all managements, said that they have not yet reopened the schools but will do so in a phased manner. “Higher authorities at a recent meeting have decided that the schools will start in phases. All these students come from remote villages and their RT-PCR tests cannot be done from their home towns as it is not practically possible. However, whenever one class arrives, we can tie up with the local primary health centre and get their tests done at the school,” the official said. TOI had reported in October that tribal students were struggling to cope with online learning given the remoteness of their villages and needed to come back to the government hostels for proper education. Subhalakshmi, a volunteer who works with the tribal children in Ahmednagar, had said, “Schools have reopened for higher classes and in rural areas for Std V onwards, but the students who have registered in the hostel cannot take the benefit of this relaxation. They are very eager to go back to school. Many students do not have the necessary digital devices for online education and hence they should be the priority to send to schools with proper precautions.” Parents of students studying in these schools had said that the schools in rural parts were buzzing with students when theirs had to stay at home.  “We have enrolled them in hostels because we are either migrating or the schools are very far from our hamlets. The hostel facilities should be revived with appropriate care,” Kamal Sihore, a parent of a tribal student, had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rt-pcr-test-before-joining-schools-must-for-boarders/articleshow/87918911.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Singapore Airlines has started Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flights from Chennai from November 29 so that people who pay 125 Singapore dollars and get an approval can enter that country without the seven days quarantine. However, those flying from Trichy and Madurai by other flights have to undergo the quarantine. The flight from Chennai has good demand because passengers need not have to undergo quarantine but only a rapid test on arrival, said an airport official. Arul Lazaran of United Travels said that people from other cities are requesting to be booked on the flight from Chennai because they can avoid the quarantine which is expensive. As demand is high, one-way fare to Singapore is Rs19,000 from Chennai for travel in the first week of December on Singapore Airlines. However, travellers, especially those from towns like Trichy, which has more diaspora presence, have demanded that the government ensure more flights between airports in the state and Singapore as vaccinated travel lane flights are available only from metros. Trichy international airport which handled around 80,000 passengers for Singapore in both directions during the pandemic, the highest compared to other airports, has not been included in the list. Air India Express has been operating four flights a week in the sector. Scoot Air is going to resume its weekly five services and IndiGo a daily service in the sector. “When the services are added, the number of passengers to travel to Singapore from Trichy will be manifold. However, travel restrictions imposed on the travellers who opt for Trichy airport to fly back to Singapore would severely affect their plans. There is no logic behind the instruction that passengers coming via Singapore Airlines need no quarantine and travellers coming via other flights should undergo quarantine,” said K Mythili, an IT professional in Singapore. The travel plans of hundreds of Tamils who arrived during the pandemic and are waiting to fly back to Singapore will be affected, she added. A Nargis Beham from Al Parvez International Air Travels and Services said VTL agreement would affect hundreds from Trichy and surrounding districts. Except Singapore citizens and permanent residents, other travellers who opt for VTL are facing problems to get their registration approved. Arul Lazaran said that the number of flights is inadequate and the fare is high. “Singapore is the most popular destination from Tamil Nadu. The government should ensure that there are enough flights and the fare is low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/7-day-quarantine-in-singapore-for-fliers-from-trichy-not-chennai/articleshow/87923864.cms||---

A bicycle ride from my residence in Golaganj to Lucknow University still remains one of my fondest memories of the 1970s, said former LU student and IFS (retired) Dinkar P Srivastava. He was speaking at the university’s foundation day at Malviya hall on Thursday. With a former student sharing how beautiful the road to LU was, and how young girl students dressed in blue denims and maroon T-shirts used to rock the campus, and a current student Dharmendra performing a scintillating classical dance performance on Ganesha Vandana, Lucknow University’s’ foundation day celebration was a perfect amalgamation of both old and new students raising a toast to their alma mater. “From parking my cycle near student Union buildings to walking up to the political science department everything is still fresh in my mind. I can see a number of university days friends seated here as faculty, that also reminds me of the great teachers I had in my university days who were an epitome of knowledge,” said Srivastava. LU VC felicitating Dinkar P SrivastavaOn the occasion, Srivastava also spoke about his recently published book on Kashmir and read excerpts from it. Srivastava was felicitated by presenting LU’s Coffee table book, memento and a shawl. His felicitation ceremony was followed by Ganesha Vandana chanting and echoes of Ganpati Bappa Maurya. After a spiritual performance, a musical performance in Sanskrit by university students left everyone spellbound. Dressed in colourful attire, over 30 students showcased their musical and dancing talents but the hall got overcrowded soon after LU’s first ‘all-girl' band came up with a medley.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-foundation-day-lu-past-present-students-raise-a-toast-to-alma-mater/articleshow/87919363.cms||---
---||Pune||Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar Metro work officially begins||PUNE: The Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) has announced the appointed date — actual work commencement — of the elevated 23km Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar Metro corridor on Thursday. The project, coming up on the public-private partnership model, will have to be completed by the concessionaire, Tata-Siemens, in the next three years and four months. PMRDA commissioner Suhas Diwase told TOI that the appointed date was announced on Thursday and the letter was submitted to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and the urban development department secretary. “The work will begin and be completed in three years and four months from this commencement date. The commencement date was announced as PMRDA has completed all the required land acquisition process and handed the land over to the concessionaire,” he said. Now that the commencement date is announced, work will begin simultaneously at eight locations along the 23.3km route, officials said. An official close to the development said pre-engineering work and geotechnical investigation have been completed, while 70% of the work sites have been barricaded; soil testing, structural design, and work at the casting yard have also begun The corridor will connect Maan, near the Hinjewadi IT park, to the Civil Court in Shivajinagar. Officials said it would take 40 minutes to complete the end-to-end commute on the route, which will comprise 23 stations. The concessionaire will execute the project on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis for an initial concession period of 35 years. The route will have 23 elevated stations and the project is estimated to cost a little over Rs 8,000 crore. The Metro project is coming up according to the norms of the Centre’s new Metro policy, through the PPP model. A few days ago, the Centre had pledged Rs1,230 crore as part of the viability gap funding. About 98% of the land was acquired, paving way for the announcement of the date of commencement, said officials. The double-decker flyover at the University chowk, which is coming up in place of the older University flyover, too got the green signal; the transport authority had suggested changes for traffic movement to make way for construction work. The barricading work is in progress in Hinjewadi Phase-3 and onGaneshkhind Road, and the traffic department will be issuing orders for traffic management. This is the third Metro corridor coming up in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The other two routes — the fully elevated 14km-long Vanaz Ramwadi corridor and the 16km Pimpri-Swargate corridor, which will be elevated from Pimpri to Range Hills and underground thereafter — are being developed by the MahaMetro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hinjewadi-to-shivajinagar-metro-work-officially-begins/articleshow/87918248.cms||Nisha Nambiar

On alerting KMDA officials, the fire was doused and the heap of garbage and leaves was cleared from the vat. The Rabindra Sarobar Morning Walkers Guild later sent a mail to the KMDA authorities, saying that such burning of garbage and dry leaves must be prevented as it further deteriorates the condition of the already highly polluted air. Regular morning walkers, who were passing by the spot on Thursday morning, saw smoke coming out from the vat. “I was on my morning walk when I noticed it. Earlier too, such accumulated dry leaves were set on fire. This is an easy way to get rid of such leaves,” said P K Bose, an educationist and Lake regular. “This an environmental crime. Rabindra Sarobar is an eco-sensitive zone and such activities only further degrade the environment. There should be a proper enquiry,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/leaf-burning-at-lake-leaves-walkers-fuming/articleshow/87918262.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The money collected by them is not going into their pockets. About 95% of it will be shared from top to bottom working at DPCs on contract basis,” Shanmugavelu alleged. He said the government should make all contract workers permanent and their salary should be fixed according to the scale laid down by the government. TNCSC authorities should frequently visit the procurement centres and take stringent action against workers who resort to this practice. The minister should instruct officials to do the needful to make the system corruption-free, he further stated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/workers-call-for-steps-to-ward-off-graft-in-dpcs/articleshow/87918912.cms||---
---||Delhi||DU teams can compete in inter-varsity games again||New Delhi: Delhi University has now permitted its sports teams to participate in inter-university tournaments across the country. Senior officials said that the move was a step towards normalcy and to ensure that sports students get ample exposure after the nearly 20-month break due to the pandemic. With most inter-university tournaments scheduled to begin from the second half of December, DU is planning to call sports students to the campus and hold trials for the university teams. Pankaj Sinha, chairman of DU Sports Council, said, “We will conduct trials for selections to the university teams. There are 27 games and trials will be held for all. Students will be called to the university by the first week of December so that the trials can be held and teams formed for the tournaments.” The trials for selections to the varsity teams are expected to begin from December 7. According to officials, schedules for each of the games will be issued so that students can return to the campuses accordingly. Officials are also working on the modalities to arrange for accommodation of students who decide to appear for the trials. “We are working on the accommodation bit and will coordinate with sports teachers of each college. We will at least try to make suitable arrangements for accommodation for at least the trials. All necessary anti-Covid-19 protocols will be followed and it will also be essential for students and their parents to take an undertaking stating that they consent to the participation,” Sinha said. Stating that it was important to boost the morale of sportspersons who had not had a chance to participate in tournaments since the pandemic struck, Sinha added, “After selections, practice and coaching will also be done. There can always be concerns about how a team would be without practice for so many months. But one has to give them the opportunity to participate, otherwise how else will they qualify for world tournaments. The step has been taken keeping their interests in mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teams-can-compete-in-inter-varsity-games-again/articleshow/87918938.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges for the offences of rioting, unlawful assembly, mischief by fire or explosive substance, dacoity against Krishan in the case. The court noted that it was true that in the statement under section 161 (examination by police) CrPC dated March 6, 2020, the complainant has mentioned that he did not know or recognise any person in the violent mob, but that cannot be taken to imply that he could not have identified any of the assailants present in the mob, if shown to him later. “It cannot be disputed at this stage on the basis of the material on record that they were not the eye witnesses to the incident…I do not find any reason to discard these statements at this very stage,” the judge said .

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Protests against helicopter survey||KOZHIKODE: The ongoing helicopter survey by Konkan Railway Corporation (KRCL) in Wayanad for the Thalassery-Wayanad-Mysuru rail line met with protests on Thursday as agitators staged a march to the helipad set up at Sultan Bathery alleging that the move was aimed at scuttling the proposed Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line. The protest was organized by the people’s committee comprising representatives of Nilgiri-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Council, Sultan Bathery Merchants Association. They said that the central government has not given the nod for the Thalassery-Mysuru line and that Karnataka government too has not sanctioned the survey. “Still the survey for the rail line is being held in state by the government at a cost of Rs 18 crore. Conducting a survey for the interstate rail line without getting the nod from Centre and Karnataka for the project is a misuse of public funds,” said TM Rasheed, convener of the action committee. He said that UDF government had allotted Rs eight crore and asked DMRC to conduct a survey to prepare a DPR for Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line which had secured all central approvals. But, LDF government later withheld funds saying that Karnataka government has not given nod for the survey. The council said that despite Karnataka government giving it in writing that it will process the application for survey of Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line and forward it to the Centre if the alignment passed through a tunnel along the forest stretch, Kerala government wasn’t ready to submit the application. They alleged that while the Nilambur-Nanjangud line will benefit the entire state, Thalassery-Mysuru line would benefit only part of Kannur. KRCL had launched the survey for Thalassery-Mysuru rail line in Wayanad by using the heli-borne geophysical mapping technique of CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/protests-against-helicopter-survey/articleshow/87917473.cms||---
---||Pune||Rural schools spruce up premises for reopening||PUNE: From completing the second dose vaccination for more than 95% of its teachers to paying off the outstanding electricity bills to getting the premises ready, primary schools under the Pune zilla parishad are all set to start now that the state government has allowed them to reopen from December 1. The education office of the Pune zilla parishad said that the ground work for preparing the schools for reopening had begun. Chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad Ayush Prasad said, “The foremost thing we did to prepare for the reopening of primary schools was to pay off the outstanding electricity bill of Rs 1.91 crore. The outstanding was over Rs 2 crore but that was including the late fee and interest charges. So, we will get our electricity restored in schools when the government gives the nod. Secondly, vaccination of teachers for resuming classes is nearly 100% for first doses and over 95% are fully vaccinated.” The Pune ZP is now looking at the teachers who are either due for their second shot or have not got vaccinated for some medical reason and other things. Prasad said that the remaining teachers will be taken up on priority and the officers will ensure their vaccination is done soon. Apart from the topmost priority aspects, the Pune ZP conducted a meeting with block development officers on Thursday morning to instruct them about having the campuses ready. “Many schools were used as quarantine centres so the officers are getting such centres also ready. The benches and tables, chairs were moved so they are back in place and some of the infrastructure that was broken or was not in state to use has been discarded and schools have been given funds to purchase new furniture,” Prasad added. On the academic front, Prasad said that the schools would first complete the bridge course for students as prepared by the MSCERT. “The school management committees are also interacting with the parents for their consent to send their children to school and there is no problem in the rural areas. In semi-urban areas, there is a bit of hesitancy, but over a period of time, parents would overcome it,” he added. Other civic bodies may draft separate Covid prevention guidelines for reopening of schools for primary classes. The school authorities as well as parents have to ensure adherence of children to Covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-schools-spruce-up-premises-for-reopening/articleshow/87918920.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Pune MSRTC staffers demand merger, refuse to end strike||PUNE: Employees of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) in Pune have refused to rescind their ongoing strike despite the state government announcing a revision of their salaries. With employees stating that the strike will continue, senior officials of the MSRTC have said that strong legal action will follow now if they don’t return to work. “The strike will go on in Pune. Our demand is the merger of MSRTC with the state government. We didn’t demand a salary revision. Unless the state government takes visible action on our demand, we will not stop. Until now, around 200 employees of the Pune division have been suspended by the headquarters. But this will not deter us,” said Gajanan Kachwe, one of the striking employees in Pune. The protest has been on across the state for around 29 days now, while in Pune it has lasted for almost 16 days. On Wednesday, the state government had announced a pay hike ranging between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000 in the basic component of the employees, based on seniority. State transport minister Anil Parab had said the striking employees need to respond to this offer by Friday, adding that the issue of merger was being handled by a committee formed on the directions of the Bombay High Court. Shekhar Channe, vice chairman and managing director of the MSRTC, told TOI, “If they don’t relent, tough legal action will be taken against them. We are awaiting their answer. Based on this, a further course of action will be planned.” Sources said while suspensions and terminations are ongoing, they will also be implemented on a larger scale if employees didn’t relent. “There will be more lay-offs and other strict steps. In the last two weeks, the MSRTC Pune division has faced losses of over Rs20 crore. This is happening at a time when transportation has just restarted after the successive Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, and we should have focused on getting MSRTC back on track after last year’s debacle,” an official told TOI, choosing to stay unnamed. Compared to around 6,000 buses that the Pune division ran each day, private buses running from MSRTC depots are only 120-130. “On weekdays, around 130 buses ply; weekends see around 150-160 bus movements from the depots. Across the state, 2,000-2,500 private buses are running from MSRTC depots in total. Many routes aren’t being covered, and many private operators are not agreeing to ply buses from depots as there is a fare cap involved.

A bench headed by Justice A J Desai ordered to release Yogendra Shekhavat, Krishna Kalal and Bharat Taili on conditional bail pending their appeal against their conviction to life imprisonment on charge of murder and other offences including rioting, unlawful assembly and arson. These three were the last of the accused persons out of 24, who were punished by the special court in 2016 with imprisonment of various terms, said their advocate Kshitij Amin. These accused got the benefit of parity as other life term convicts were released on bail by the court earlier. Fourteen years after the incident, a court set up to prosecute cases probed by the special investigation team (SIT) found 24 persons guilty. It, however, acquitted 36 others. Only 11 persons were found guilty of murder in this case, whereas 13 others got convicted for lesser offences like rioting, arsoning, unlawful assembly, loot, trespass etc. for which maximum punishment is 10 years. Five of 11 persons accused of dragging, killing Jafri and burning his body were convicted for murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-grants-bail-to-last-three-convicts-in-gulbarg-massacre/articleshow/87918275.cms||---

PMR’s active caseload was around 2,300 during the festive period. Health officials said after the festive period, the cases have not recorded any spurt so far. Notably, the number of cases in the rural parts is lower than that in Pune municipal limits now. As per the data provided by the district health office, there were 823 active cases in the PMC limits on Wednesday, while the rural areas and Pimpri Chinchwad had 752 and 379 cases, respectively. An official from the PMC’s heath department said, “Around the festive time, the active case count in the municipal limits was around 760, which has increased slightly to 823. We are monitoring daily cases. Some increase was anticipated with relaxations and more people gathering during festivals. We have asked the teams to keep a close watch on the cases. The citizens are appealed to undergo testing in case of symptoms,” the official said. Another official from the PMC’s health department said the cases being recorded now are sporadic. “We are ready with the required infrastructure and planning. If the cases go up, we will be able to handle it, but we hope to see a downward trend only,” the official said. The active case count had dropped below 2,000 on November 15.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat loses 13.6 lakh mobile subscribers||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat reported a drastic decline of 13.6 lakh mobile subscribers in September, according to the latest telecom subscriptions report by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Accordingly, Gujarat’s total mobile subscribers fell from around 7 crore in August to 6.8 crore in September, suggests the report. All major telecom players reported a decline in subscriber numbers in September. Telecom industry sources have attributed the decline to the weakened spending capacity of people around the second wave of Covid-19, due to which mobile connections were cancelled or not recharged. The effect of consistently not paying bills or recharging connections was seen two-three months later in September, when connections went inactive. “During the second wave, a lot of people, particularly those at the bottom of the pyramid failed to recharge their connections or pay their mobile bills regularly. After the connection remained inoperative for a couple of months straight without being paid for or recharged, the overall number of mobile connections went down. Its effect became visible in September,” said a well-placed source. Reliance Jio, which holds the highest number of subscribers in Gujarat currently, lost a maximum of 10.98 lakh connections followed by, Vi which lost some 1.48 lakh subscribers and Airtel which lost about 1.24 lakh subscribers. State-owned telecom operator, BSNL, which has been consistently losing subscribers, contrarily gained some subscribers in the state in September. The trend remained the same pan-India as well, wherein most players reported a decline in subscriber numbers. According to TRAI data, the number of urban subscribers showed a steeper fall as compared to rural mobile subscribers across the country. Specific data for Gujarat is, however, not available. With the decline in subscriber numbers, the tele-density in Gujarat once again dropped to 97.6% from 99.62% in August. Tele-density in the state had touched the peak of 100.17 in July this year, which once again began to drop with reduced subscribers. In fact, mobile subscribers breached the 7 crore-mark in June in Gujarat, according to TRAI data. This means barely a couple of months after the state saw a surge in subscribers, mobile connections began getting cancelled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-loses-13-6l-mobile-subscribers/articleshow/87918289.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt wildlife board defunct||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government is yet to appoint members to the Gujarat State Board for Wildlife, two months after their term ended on September 21. The Gujarat chief minister is the ex officio chairman of the board. Officials said the Gujarat government is yet to decide on the appointment of members of the Gujarat State Board for Wildlife, two months after their term ended on September 21. While the forest department has recommended extending the terms of the current members to December 21, till a decision is taken, this proposal has also been pending at the ministerial level for a long time, said sources in the state government. “According to the Wildlife Protection Act, the state wildlife board is a statutory body where important decisions relating to wildlife and conservation are taken. Many important decisions are pending as the board has not met for quite some time now,” said a source. As a result, several issues pertaining to forest and wildlife conservation and their protection are pending in Gujarat. The approval of developmental and industrial projects that require forest land, discussions on electrification of railway lines passing through the Gir Sanctuary, a proposal for widening and upgrading a road that runs through the area where the core population of Asiatic Lions live, and many other matters are pending due to the wildlife board being defunct. Some members also wrote to senior officials of state forest department about corrections to the minutes of the nineteenth Gujarat State Board for Wildlife meeting on September 29, 2020. “A proposal was submitted by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd to upgrade the current metre-gauge line to broad gauge with electrification and some members objected to the minutes of the meeting, which claimed that the board had approved the project. This is contradictory to the stand taken by some board members who objected to the project,” said a wildlife expert who was a member of the board. Gir Sanctuary has been declared an eco-sensitive zone, and there is a restriction on such construction activity within a 10-km radius of the sanctuary, he further said. A senior officer said the board is to meet to take up the proposals, but the authorities are not bothered. “We usually review status reports of wildlife such as lions, the great Indian bustard, the wild ass and sloth bear, but this year no meeting could be held and such issues have just not been taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wildlife-board-defunct-as-term-ended-two-months-ago/articleshow/87918278.cms||---

They filmed the man with the woman in a compromising state and later blackmailed him for Rs 4 lakh threatening to upload the video and share it with his family members. The shell-shocked victim paid them Rs 93,000 while looking for options to get out of their clutches. He finally lodged a case. ADCP, east zone, Qasim Abidi said that two persons, Sunil and Kaushal, claiming to be journalists, were exploiting the victim. “We have launched a hunt for the woman,” said the officer. Abidi said the victim told police that he had got a call from a woman named Komal on November 13. She told the victim she wanted to sell her house but the victim refused to purchase it. The next day, she called again, pleading that she needed money. The man refused again. On November 15, the man got a third call from the woman who again insisted and requested him to see the house. An unsuspecting victim went to see the house. “She took me inside and closed the door. Suddenly two men, later identified as Sunil and Kaushal, entered and introduced themselves as journalists. They forced me to strip and asked me to lie on the bed next to the woman and they filmed us,” the victim narrated his ordeal. “The miscreants demanded Rs 10 lakh from me threatening to make the video viral. They took my son’s mobile number and said they would send the video to him,” the victim said. On November 17, the victim got a threat call again.

Meanwhile, one more case of Zika virus was reported from Kanpur on Thursday taking the tally to 140. Chief medical officer Kanpur Nagar Dr Nepal Singh said, “With one more new Zika virus cases, the total tally in City (Kanpur) now stands at 140. So far 131 people have recovered and tested negative. Active Zika cases in Kanpur now stand at 9,” said CMO. According to reports, a 37-year-old man of Trilokpur village in Fatehpur has been confirmed as positive for Zika virus infection. The patient has been isolated at home. The district health department has issued an alert in the village, and a massive cleanliness and fogging drive has been launched. “We have arranged 61 beds for Zika patients at the district hospital. Symptomatic (symptom based) treatment will be treated here,” informed a senior health official. District magistrate Fatehpur Apoorva Dubey, CDO Satya Prakash and CMO Dr Rajendra Singh and additional CMO Dr SP Johri reached the village to take stock of the situation. A survey is underway to trace patients, particularly pregnant women suffering from fever across the village. “Survey of more than 80 houses has been done on the first day, and on the next day the remaining 300 houses will be surveyed,” said the official. “The first Zika virus has been found in the district. A list of patients suffering from fever is being prepared in the village and sampling exercise is underway.

---||Kochi||Indian monsoon, Arctic ice melt linked||KOCHI: If we thought that the Arctic sea ice melt would lead to sea surges and increased sea-level change affecting our coasts, it is time to think again. “Climate change in Arctic circle is worrisome even for our region as it impacts our Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Some studies indicate that the extreme heat and rainfall events are also leading to ice melting in that region,” said M Ravichandran, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). In recent years, whenever there has been an increased rainfall over northwestern India and Pakistan, the heat released during such events has been transported through a pathway to the Canadian Arctic region. “A huge amount of heat is released in the atmosphere due to these extreme events. This heat reached the Canadian Arctic where it causes rapid sea ice melting,” he said while delivering a plenary talk on ‘Teleconnection between the Arctic and Indian monsoon extreme rainfall’ on Thursday. Yet another cause for concern has been the influence of Greenland Sea ice on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. “The autumn sea ice area in the Greenland Sea is related to the central Pacific sea surface temperature. Reduction in Greenland Sea ice area warms the central Pacific Ocean which in turn causes reduced rainfall during our monsoon season,” Ravichandran said. He said that although these teleconnections are through the atmosphere and thus propagate fast, oceans too play an important role in shaping tropical climate response to polar sea ice changes. According to the IPCC reports, all models show that there will be no summer sea ice in the Arctic from 2050. “More studies are needed using ocean-atmosphere coupling modelling as that is the key to predict extremes in the tropics associated with Polar regions, especially the Arctics,” Ravichandran said. In his talk, he mentioned that there has been a near two-degree decadal rise in temperatures in the Arctic region. This is almost double the temperature rise caused by global warming. “As a result, glaciers melt at a rate of 4% per decade in the winter season and 13% per decade in summer leading to reduction in the ice area. This leads to complex changes in the atmosphere and oceans and distorts the rhythm of the weather,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/indian-monsoon-arctic-ice-melt-linked/articleshow/87918304.cms||---
---||Pune||Weekly positivity in 11 districts higher than Maharashtra’s average of 1.02%||PUNE: Two weeks after Diwali festivities, 11 districts in Maharashtra have registered weekly positivity rates (WPR) higher than the state’s average of 1.02%. Akola (2.77%), Amravati (2.56%) and Buldhana (2.33%) were carrying out fewer tests and topped the weekly positivity rate chart in the week from November 17 to November 24 (See graphic). The state public health department presented the figures at the state cabinet meeting on Thursday. Pune’s weekly positivity rate has dropped to 2.07% this week from 2.52% in the week ending November 9. The active cases have dropped below 10,000 between November 17 and November 24, with Mumbai leading the tally (2,591), closely followed by Pune (1,975), the health department’s report stated. The health department has already alerted the districts conducting fewer tests to step up testing in the coming week. After registering less than 1 lakh tests for over two weeks till November 24, 1.04 lakh tests were carried out following the health department’s instructions. “Though the situation is largely under control, we cannot err on testing. These districts have been pulled up,” a health department official said. The Centre had on Tuesday directed the state to test more on the ground that low testing could not present a clear picture of the spread of the disease. The Centre had even pointed out that nine districts were testing lower than the WHO norms of 140 tests per million population. A health official said a decrease in testing would undermine the actual infections spread within the community with travel, weddings, festive celebrations and vacations picking up.” A state task force member told TOI that though the Covid cases were down in the state, there should not be any laxity in terms of testing and tracking in all districts. “Areas showing no infections or just one or two cases a day should be focused and ensure that there is no sudden spurt in the infections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekly-positivity-in-11-dists-higher-than-maharashtras-avg-of-1-02/articleshow/87918957.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||Privatization will make OFs competitive: Ex-MGO Nimbhorkar||Nagpur: Former master-general of the ordnance (MGO) Lt General (retd) Rakesh Nimbhorkar — the officer who also oversaw the surgical strike after Uri attack in 2016 — says ordnance factory setup should eventually be privatized to make them competitive. As the MGO, Nimbhorkar directly dealt with the ordnance factories (OFs) and was on the ordnance factory board. He was involved in providing inputs during the corporatization process. At the behest of the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar, he had also initiated the involvement of private sector in indigenization of ammunitions. This led to issuing of request for proposal (RFP) from private players, for seven types of ammunitions. Nimbhorkar was in the city recently to attend a function at a private defence manufacturer Solar Group when TOI met him. The Army has to simply manage with the items made by the ordnance factories, which are not up to the mark often. On the other hand, costs are too high for a number of items, he said. As the government worked towards the factories’ corporatization, there was opposition from several quarters, he added. There have been 175 accidents involving faulty ammunition, including the blast at Central Ammunition Depot at Pulgaon, which killed over 16 people. Over the years, hardly any transfer of technology has been absorbed properly, said Nimbhorkar. Citing the example of T-90 tanks, he said the engines made by the OFs continue to have problems. Even the fin-stabilized armour-piercing discarding sabot (FSAPDS) ammunition of the tanks, which was originally procured from Russia, has not been indigenized fully yet. “The costs have been exorbitant. Imagine how much should usually combat dress of soldiers cost. It cannot be more than Rs1,400 to Rs1,500, even after a liberal estimate. The ordnance factories have been charging as much as 3 to 4 times,” said Nimbhorkar. This eventually led to giving away of 22 non-core items like clothing to the private sector. Nimbhorkar was involved exclusion of non-core items from ordnance factories’ ambit too. However, there have been issues with even simplest of the items like parachutes, which are made at Kanpur. There have been issues with the L-70 anti-aircraft ammunition too, he said. The costs are too high as all the losses and overheads are loaded in the final price to be paid by the armed forces, said the former MGO. “A large number of grenades would not burst, ultimately affecting the operations,” said Nimbhorkar. Corporatization was the solution to improve the performance of ordnance factories. However, privatization can be the eventual step, he said. Nimbhorkar said the fears that privatization of the defence industry can lead to compromise with the national security were unfounded. To the contrary, private sector can deliver the products at much lower rates, and also ensure timely production so as to make them competitive. ‘Strong political will a pre-requisite for surgical strikes’ Remembering the first surgical strikes across the line of control (LoC), LT General (retd) Rakesh Nimbhorkar says despite apprehensions, everything went as planned that day. A strong political will was pre-requisite for such an operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/privatization-will-make-ofs-competitive-ex-mgo-nimbhorkar/articleshow/87934393.cms||Shishir Arya

The police have registered a case under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sandalwood-tree-stolen-from-farm/articleshow/87918296.cms||---

They closed the stadium gates and did not allow him to leave for an hour-and-a-half on Thursday. Sagar termed the incident as a result of “excited children who had won”. According to sources, the Sansad Games were organised by the MP at all the six assembly constituencies of Shahjahanpur district between November 21 and 25. The winners – some 300 boys and 250 girls – were invited to Shahjahanpur city to come for the prize-distribution ceremony. While filing nomination, they were told that there would be given some cash prize However, at the prize distribution ceremony, only cricket players were awarded cash. MP Sagar’s son was one of the winning cricket players. The winners of individual events did not get any cash prize. This did not go down well among the athletes. When a group of girls questioned the BJP MP, he allegedly replied in an abrupt manner and tried to leave. Some of the athletes began to raise slogans against Sagar. As the protest escalated against the MP, some athletes locked the stadium gates and did allow him to leave the premises. A circle officer and the local SHO rushed to the spot and tried to calm down the protesters. Unable to do so, additional force had to be summoned to rescue Sagar and escort him out of the stadium. Sunaina Jauhari, an athlete, told TOI, “We have been travelling here and there at our own risk for five days to compete in the quarter, semi and finals. No facilities like travel allowance or food and water were provided to us. We still performed but, in the end, there was nothing for us. We were promised a cash prize but it was only given to cricket players.” Divyaansh Awasthi, a wrestler, claimed that when questioned, MP Sagar had snapped, “Paise kyu de, kya tumhare ghar me paisa nahi he (why to give money, Isn’t there any money at your home)”. “We refused to take the medal and certificate they offered.” Sagar told TOI, “The decision on the prizes was taken by the nodal officer of the games. We had arranged for sufficient food packets for everyone.” District sports in charge Jitendra Bhagat told TOI, “We were only coordinating with the organizing committee. The prizes were provided by the committee and we did not have any role in it. The cricket team was awarded with a cash prize apart from the medal and the certificate.” S Anand, Shahjahanpur SP , later said, “The matter has been resolved after mediation and no FIR has been registered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/not-given-cash-prize-at-sansad-games-athletes-cry-foul-lock-mp-in-stadium/articleshow/87917531.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

It has been observed in numerous cases that the process server served summons to witnesses through WhatsApp messages or SMS, which has no sanction in law and cannot be deemed as proper service of summons, it said. “No action can be taken against a witness on the basis of such a report if the witness opts to remain absent on the date fixed for his examination in court. In such situations, the date of hearing gets wasted without effective judicial work, which hampers the trial of case,” said Additional Sessions Judge Vishal Singh in an order on November 23. The court issued notice to the DCP (Central) to issue strict instructions to all the police stations under his jurisdiction to ensure proper service of summons as per law and as per instructions mentioned on the summons. The observations came after prosecution witnesses did not appear before the court. A report was filed, which stated that the summons were served to them through WhatsApp messages. During the hearing of a case, the court noted that the signature with date and mobile number of the served witness has not been taken by the process server on the returned summons. “This is despite specific instructions prominently mentioned on the summons to the effect that ‘process server to get signature of witness with date and also to mention mobile number of witness’,” it added. The court said that the report of process server, forwarded by the concerned SHO, was in clear violation of instructions, which cannot be deemed as proper service of summons and it cannot take any action against the witnesses for non-appearance in the absence of their acknowledgement of receipt of summons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/summons-via-whatsapp-not-as-per-law-says-court/articleshow/87918963.cms||Usha Das

The arrested persons include the main accused. Sanjay Tripathi, the father of the deceased Aman Tripathi, and his mother Madhu, who were on a hunger strike for the past two days, called it off after the intervention of the local administration on the assurance of justice in the matter.

---||Delhi||DU forms panel to analyse admission trends||New Delhi: Delhi University (DU) has constituted a committee to analyse data on admissions this year and to also examine the board-wise distribution of students. According to senior officials of the varsity, the committee will also be analysing the courses where over-admissions have taken place and the ones where seats are lying vacant even at the last leg of admissions. A senior official, who is a part of the committee, said, “One of the primary objectives is to analyse the admission trends of this year.” “Based on the data analysed, recommendations will be submitted. In DU, the issue is that admissions are done based on cutoff marks and colleges are required to admit all students who are clearing the qualifying marks. So, it is pertinent to analyse the data and examine how admissions can be done in the future,” the official added. Once finalised, the report will be placed before the university’s academic council, the official said. The committee has also been tasked with the responsibility of analysing data on the board-wise admissions that have taken place this year. DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said that while the committee’s report was expected soon, a call on the mode of admissions for the next academic year would be taken based on the recommendations of the committee. “The committee is expected to submit the report soon. They are examining the entire issue, including board-wise distribution of students. Once it is done, we will examine whether normalisation of marks is required and if at all it is a feasible option as there are so many boards across the country. Depending on the recommendations of the committee, the future course of action for the next academic session will be decided,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-forms-panel-to-analyse-admission-trends/articleshow/87919419.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Power generation from coal falls 56% in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s production of electricity from the coal-fired thermal power plants halved in October as private sector plants struggled to generate power due to spiralling prices of imported coal. State’s thermal coal-based electricity generation declined by 56% to 3,465GWh (gigawatt hours) in October 2021 from 7,877GWh during the same month last year, shows the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)’s tentative monthly report for October. Steep reduction in power generation by private sector plants, including those run on imported coal, brought down the overall electricity generated from the coal-based power plants in October. Private sector’s generation from coal plunged 70% to 1,858GWh from 6,142GWh. The generation stood at only 32% of the targeted generation of 5,839GWh for October 2021, according to the report. “Spiralling prices of imported coal primarily affected the production at the private sector power plants,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy and regulatory expert. Imported coal-based plants in the state stopped production as the generation had turned unviable due to the high prices of imported coal. “On the other hand, the shortage of domestic coal impacted the production at the state-run power plants,” added Bajaj. The generation by state-run coal-based power projects eased 8% to 1,607GWh in October this year from 1,735GWh during the corresponding period last year. In fact, the state sector plants produced 79% of the 2,038GWh power that was targeted to be produced in October. As electricity demand rose with economic activities picking up after the second wave of the pandemic, the state-owned power distribution company, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) had to procure electricity from a power exchange at high prices to meet the growing demand. The production of power from coal had also remained low in September. In fact, the production levels showed some improvement in October when compared with September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coal-based-power-generation-in-state-drops-56-in-oct/articleshow/87918298.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The Grant’s zebras, the most commonly found in the world, have travelled about 5,000km from Israel to reach here. Their enclosure has been cleaned and sanitized and the inmates will be in quarantine for 15 days. Their transportation has cost almost Rs 1 crore. “The animals will be in quarantine to make sure they don’t spread or catch any infection. We will help them acclimatise as they have travelled from afar. For quarantine, their enclosure has been covered with a green curtain from all sides. After quarantine, they will be ready for visitors,” said zoo director RK Singh. Zoo officials and staff excitedly welcomed the animals on Thursday evening. Suraj Pal Yadav, a police officer deployed in zoo, said, “I have been here for 21 years. I clicked several pictures and shot videos when the zebras came. It is always a happy moment when we welcome new members to the zoo family.” Staff member Kamaal Seth and keeper of the owl enclosure, said, “Every new animal in zoo brings new excitement to all the keepers. The zebras will adapt in some time as a keeper from among us will help them.” The last zebra at zoo, Bankit, died in 2015 due to old age. The pandemic delayed the process to get zebras thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zoo-welcomes-3-zebras-from-israel-in-its-fold/articleshow/87919417.cms||---

The order rejecting the allegations of Thomas Lawrence was issued by Chief Secretary V P Joy based on a hearing held in August following a direction from the High Court on the petition filed by Lawrence. The High Court had disposed of the petition directing the Chief Secretary to hear and pass orders. Additional secretary, electronics & information technology department, District Collector, Thiruvananthapuram and the chief executive officer, Technopark, were present during the hearing.  District Collector said in the hearing that the government had accorded sanction for conversion of the land invoking relevant provisions of Kerala Conservation of Paddy land and Wetland Act for the development of Phase III campus and hence was not in a position to take any further action on this. As per the latest order issued by the Chief Secretary rejecting the contention of Lawrenece, the order was issued by the government in 2018 to convert paddy land under the clause ‘public purpose’ and that it was issued considering all the aspects of the matter. ‘There are no reasons to warrant interference with the same. Accordingly, the petition is rejected being devoid of merits,’ order issued by Chief Secretary reads. The SC had in 2020 disposed of an appeal petition on alleged reclamation of wetland by stating that the petitioner could file an appeal in accordance with the law. Lawrence had approached the SC citing that the Collector had not acted in accordance with the order issued by National Green tribunal in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-upholds-order-to-convert-paddy-land/articleshow/87918295.cms||---

He said employees of all departments are get trapped by the ACB. He was speaking to media after visiting the Prashasan Gaon ke Sang programme in Dausa. The chief minister while lauding the ACB said that the anti-corruption agency is doing a good job in Rajasthan. “In Rajasthan even SPs and collectors were trapped by the ACB. They were suspended and some were even dismissed from service," said the chief minister. The chief minister pointed out that even the home department handled by the chief minister himself, many cops were in the ACB net for corruption. Chief minister while addressing the teachers award function two days ago had asked them whether they had to give bribe to gets transfers and overwhelming majority said in the affirmative. This had come as a serious embarrassment to the education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra who was sitting at the dais with the CM. Chief minister then promised that a transfer policy will be brought in so that no body needs to bribe anybody but get their transfers on their turn. Dotasra then had to clarify that he and his staff had not even had tea for transfers. Very often transfers are being done on the 'desire' of local MLA to get transfer in their area and it has been alleged that the MLAs take bribe to get transfers done. After the chief minister reference of bribe in transfers, the opposition targeted the education minister forcing the chief minister to come out with a clarification. The CM reference to bribe in the function was interpreted as targeting the minister and there were rumours that it was a ground for the education minister be dropped in the upcoming cabinet reshuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-says-corruption-is-not-confined-to-any-particular-dept-but-is-everywhere/articleshow/87788320.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC notice over minimum age limit for NCLT members||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued a notice to the Centre over a PIL challenging the provisions of law and the ministry of corporate affair’s bid to recruit technical members for the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by fixing minimum age limit of 50 years. A chartered accountant, Vikash Jain, has filed the PIL through advocate Vishal Dave challenging the advertisement issued by the ministry of corporate affairs on October 13 for filling up posts of technical members in NCLTs and termed it in violation of constitutional provisions. He has claimed that this is against tribunalisation and bureaucratisation of justice and has its impact on judicial independence and separation of powers before the high court. The petitioner’s objection is because the advertisement fixes a minimum age limit of 50 years for appointment in view of proviso to section 413(2) of the Companies Act. It was submitted that this is contrary to various directions issued by court and the Supreme Court has emphasised the need to appoint younger members in tribunals to make their functioning effective. When a person below 50 years is eligible to be appointed as HC judge, it is strange to keep minimum age limit of 50 years for tribunal members. The petitioner has also taken exception that the advertisement was issued by the ministry of corporate affairs whereas it should have been issued by the ministry of law and justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-minimum-age-limit-for-nclt-members/articleshow/87918310.cms||---

Khollam had taken money from the surgeon between June and October on the pretext of investigating a cellphone hacking case that was reported by the complainant. The surgeon told TOI that one of his acquaintances had introduced Khollam to him. The suspect had told the complainant that he was a police officer posted with the Pune crime branch. “Someone was hacking my cell phones and leaking information out. I discussed this with Khollam believing he was a police officer,” the surgeon said. He said Khollam had demanded Rs 50,000 for some “field work”. “I gave him the money. After a few days, he told me there was lobby of politicians, police, lawyers and some doctors behind the hacking of my cell phones and they wanted to kill me,” the complainant said. He added that Khollam took Rs 60,000 more to issue warrants against those people. He then took Rs 50,000 for “his men”. “He told me that these people had met at a resort and were planning to finish my career. He then acceted Rs 15,000,” the complainant further said. Sub-inspector Varude said, “Khollam came to know about the complainant’s (hacking) issue. To extort money from him, Khollam posed as a police officer. We are probing whether other persons are involved in the case or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-policeman-extorts-rs-1-75l-from-surgeon/articleshow/87918300.cms||---

He had approached the court with a plea for pre-arrest bail when Thampanoor police registered a case against him after receiving a complaint from one of the car owners. Earlier, he was arrested and sent to jail by railway police. The railway police had arrested Joshua on October 10 after registering a case based on a statement from one of the car owners Neeraj Kumar, who reported a loss of more than Rs 10,000 and the damages caused to his car. After serving in jail for a few days, Joshua was granted bail. Thampanoor police registered another case on October 23 after receiving a complaint from another car owner Subha, who alleged that she lost a pair of gold earrings weighing 12 grams and Rs 3,100 from her car. She has incurred a total loss of Rs 56,500. Joshua's counsel argued that the allegations against him are falsely foisted. However, judge L Jayawanth rejected the plea taking into account the argument presented by public prosecutor K L Hareeshkumar who cited that custodial interrogation was necessary for the recovery of the stolen properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pre-arrest-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/87918312.cms||---

Prince claimed that he killed Nanhe to avenge the death of one Lal khan, another land dealer, and requested the police not to arrest innocent persons in this case. He also announced that he will surrender before the police once he kills the sons of Fahim Khan, the Wasseypur gang lord currently lodged in jail. Prince’s announcement is unprecedented in the long and bloody history of gang wars in the coal fields of Dhanbad. Through a video and a written letter addressed to Dhanbad SP, Prince alleged that the murder plot for Lal was hatched by Fahim and his sons. “Fahim and his men paid Rs 10 lakh to UP-based gangster Aman Singh through his son Iqbal and two others to kill Lal,” Prince claimed. He also blamed a few others for conspiring to kill Lal and said that he would kill all of them and no one would survive. “Anyone working for Fahim or his son would die a dog’s death and it is my promise to the people of Dhanbad that I would finish the Sultanate of Fahim Khan within six months,” Prince said. Prince also threatened to kill Iqbal and another of Fahim’s sons within two days. Dhanbad SSP Sanjeev Kumar on Thursday said that the police were keeping an eye on all the developments and none of the persons involved in the crime would be spared. “Different police teams are conducting raids in different localities and many persons have been apprehended and are being interrogated,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/accused-releases-video-threatens-to-kill-more-men/articleshow/87918092.cms||Anil Ashutosh

BJP’s state president Deepak Prakash joined the campaign at a petrol station in Ranchi’s Dhurwa while other office-bearers, such as Pradeep Verma, Dharampal Singh and Balmukund Sahay, went to the fuelling stations in Pandra, Nagri, Ratu Road and Harmu. Prakash, while speaking to reporters, said, “JMM, Congress and RJD, which were very vocal in demanding the Centre for a cut in the prices of petrol and diesel just weeks ago, have suddenly fallen silent when it came to doing their bit and reducing the VAT. Their conduct has exposed the state government’s double standards.” In Bokaro, Chandankyari MLA Amar Kumar Bauri also attacked the state government as he took part in the campaign, along with BJP workers. Bauri said, “The state government’s true colours are being revealed gradually. The JMM-Congress-RJD government’s strategy is ‘All good things are mine and all bad things are yours’. We request the government to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel without any further delay in order to provide relief to the common people.” BJP’s campaign found takers among the common people as many stepped up and signed the petition. “The state government should reduce the VAT on petrol for people like us. From vegetables, fruit and groceries, everything is becoming more expensive day by day,” Bokaro resident Manish Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-holds-drive-to-demand-reduction-in-vat-on-fuel/articleshow/87918114.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||JPSC issues category-wise cut-offs after protests||Ranchi: The Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) on Thursday issued a 20-point clarification against allegations levelled by aspirants of the 7th to 10th combined civil services examination and released the category wise cut-off marks for selection in the preliminary test (PT) examination. The move comes within 24 hours of the commission’s chairman being summoned by governor Ramesh Bais over the issue on Wednesday. The commission uploaded a five-page clarification, answering the 20 points raised by the protesters and a BJP delegation through three different petitions. The commission has said it had not declared the cut-off, following the practice of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). “Since UPSC declares cut-off during the declaration of final results, we were following suit but in the light of candidates being misled by ‘few with vested interest’, we are declaring the category wise cut-offs,” the statement reads. According to the cut-off declared, 260 marks is the highest for unreserved (UNR) (male and female) while 180 is the lowest fixed for physically handicapped (PH) category for candidates with autism and multiple disabilities. The cut off for ST-230, SC-238, EBC (Annexure-1) and BC (Annexure-II)-252 and economically weaker section (EWS) is fixed at 238 for both males and females. Further, under sports quota, UNR cut-off is fixed at 212, ST-210, SC-230, EBC (Annex I) -218, BC (Annex-II)-214 and for EWS, it has been fixed at 210. Under the PH category, the cut-off for deaf and dumb candidates is 212 while for the blind, it is 220 and for those with locomotive issues, the cut-off has been at 246. Explaining the case of roll no. 52077036 about whom the protesters argued that he was rejected despite securing 266 marks, the commission has said it was wrong on part of the protesters to argue when the cut-off marks were not declared. “Since we have declared the cut-off, it would be pertinent to mention that the candidate in question secured 240 marks and not 266, whereas in his/her category the cut off is 260,” the statement reads. Clarifying the issue of candidates with consecutive roll nos being declared pass in examination centres of three districts, JPSC has admitted “unforeseen situations” at the examination hall in two districts—Lohardaga and Sahebganj. “Due to a large number of candidates, 3.7 lakh appearing for the 7th JPSC, some unforeseen circumstances, not related to malpractice, were reported at two places and an inquiry is going on. But for that secluded incident, it was not fair for the commission to hold back the entire results and the examination process. They have been declared qualified provisionally, pending further inquiry,” the commission said. To allegation of selecting fewer candidates in the PH category, JPSC has said according to the thumb rule, 15 times the number of vacancies are selected in PT. “There are seven vacancies in the PH category and we have declared 107 candidates as qualified which is slightly more than 15 times the vacancy,” the commission clarified. Responding to the clarifications issued by the commission, a JPSC aspirant, Praveen Kumar, said, “We plan to meet at the Bapu Vatika at Morhabadi ground on Friday to discuss the commission’s reply. We are also collecting more evidence related to irregularities. In one of the replies, JPSC has admitted that candidates with consecutive roll numbers have qualified from two centres. Such instances raise suspicions regarding irregularities. Prima facie I am not satisfied with the JPSC arguments to prove that the preliminary examination was fair.” BJP MLA Navin Jaiswal, who was a part of the delegation meeting JPSC chairman Amitabh Choudhary on Tuesday evening, said he hasn’t gone through the JPSC statement. “Let me go through the contents first, then we can decide the further course of action,” he said.

---||Vadodara||Lip-smacking cuisines, generous sprinkling of history||Vadodara: The ‘patti samosa’ with its ‘satvik aaloo’ filling that almost everyone loves to gorge on is, in fact, inspired by a Mughal non-vegetarian cuisine that was relished during the period of Muhammed Bin Tughluq. Surprised? Centuries ago, when Gujarat was ruled by the sultanate, the humble ‘patti samosa’, a vegetarian version of the Mughal dish, made its way to the kitchens across the region. Generous sprinkling of such anecdotes during the two-hour food heritage walk made the experience an unforgettable one for the Barodians. “Gujaratis experimented with the Mughal dish and started filling left-over veggies in the wheat flour and started calling it ‘samsad’. Gradually, the name changed to samosa and now it is one of the favourite snacks in Gujarati households,” said Chandrashekhar Patil, who organized the walk around Sursagar Lake in the city on Wednesday evening. Dozens of Barodians tasted a variety of food around the Sursagar lake in the old city while relishing the sight of some historic buildings. “Most of the heritage walks focus on buildings and monuments but food is also a part of our culture and traditions. People should know the story of the tasty cuisines they have regularly. So, I decided to organize a food heritage walk,” Patil told TOI. The foodies first gulped down some spicy ‘pani puris’ near the Faculty of Performing Arts building and then flocked the eatery offering piping hot ‘ragada patis’. When it comes to food walk, how can one leave out the ever popular ‘paav bhaaji’. “The food-buffs were then served Mathura-style milk stuffed with cream and dry fruits at the stall run by Manoj Sharma, whose third generation is selling the milk near Sursagar. His family came from Mathura to Baroda state decades ago,” Patil said. The participants also got a peek into the history of the Faculty of Performing Arts building as well as the magnificent 19th century structure of Nyay Mandir. “Apart from Sursagar lake’s history, I also briefed them about the single-screen theatres near the lake and how it was one of the most favourite hangout places for Barodians in the older times,” Patil added. The two-hour walk ended with some chilled Rajasthani kulfi stuffed with some fresh fruits as the foodies walked away with their soul and tummy satiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lip-smacking-cuisines-generous-sprinkling-of-history/articleshow/87918282.cms||Tushar Tere

State department of sports, arts, culture and youth affairs has written to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and sought to host the national team in Jamshedpur. Officials said the AIFF has given its in-principle approval for the same. “The AIFF has given its in-principle approval. We have sought the schedule of the team but we are yet to get it,” state sports director Zeeshan Qamar told TOI on Thursday. “We have proposed to host the U-17 national women’s team in Jamshedpur,” he added. Notably, Jharkhand had first proposed to host the team in July last year. Originally slated to take place last year, the world cup has been postponed to February next year due to Covid-19 pandemic. In August this year, Jharkhand hosted the senior national women’s football team as it prepared for the AFC Women’s Asia Cup 2022. The camp, which began on August 16, is to continue till February next year. The senior team is currently in Brazil to participate in a four-nation tournament as a dress rehearsal for next year’s event. The state government has been pushing for a long-term association with the AIFF for long term development of women’s football in Jharkhand. On Wednesday, the government went out of its way to ensure that the ban issued by the AIFF on Jharkhand Football Association’s (JFA) participation in the upcoming Santosh Trophy, which is due to commence from December 3, is lifted. The AIFF had banned JFA after the latter violated protocols and submitted the details of four squads (including two men and two women) in place of two. “The AIFF protocols mandate that the state associations need to shortlist two teams, one men and another women, for the tournament. However, due to the internal bickering between JFA officials, they shortlisted four and attracted a ban. The AIFF lifted the ban on pursuance of the government and on our request, two national selectors were brought in to select the players for the men and women’s squads,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-offers-to-host-indian-u-17-womens-football-team-for-their-wc-boot-camp/articleshow/87918204.cms||Dhritiman Ray

One person has been arrested in this connection. Deputy commissioner Anjali Yadav said, “We are working to bring an end to the agitation at the earliest. The representatives of Visthapit Vikas Sangharsh Samiti (under the banner of which the protesters are agitating) have been invited for talks.” On Wednesday, the BHEL team was visiting the plant for maintenance work and the team was on a bus when they were stopped at the entrance gate by a group of protestors, who urged the engineers to turn back. When a few of the team members got down from the bus and tried to dissuade the demonstrators, they were allegedly attacked. Fearing for their lives, the team left the site and drove to Tandwa police station and lodged a complaint. Hours after their complaint, Tandwa police arrested one Tileshwar Sahu, who has been spearheading the agitation. Sahu’s arrest infuriated the protestors who then gathered at the gate in greater numbers and raised slogans against the NTPC. NTPC officials said the protests have derailed their plans of commissioning the first unit of 660MW by March next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bhel-team-attacked-at-tandwas-ntpc-power-plant-site/articleshow/87918128.cms||---
