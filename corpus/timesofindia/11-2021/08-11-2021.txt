Speaking to the media at the BJP national executive here, the finance minister said MSP has been increased by 1.5 times and Kisan Debit Cards were also distributed. While there was some speculations since former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh spoke about a likely alliance with BJP in Punjab polls, Sitharaman indicated that the party is not ready to backtrack on the issue and it will combat the campaign against it by highlighting the measures it has taken to empower farmers. BJP president J P Nadda too in his address stressed the Centre’s commitment to farm issues and said that before 2014, India’s agriculture budget used to be just Rs 23,000 crore which is now Rs 1,23,000 crore. Under PM Kisan over 10 crore farmers have benefitted. He also spoke about record purchase of foodgrains under the MSP mechanism across the country. Sitharaman said, “We are open for talks. Please tell us what you are opposed to in the laws. We have not been told what the objection is and their (farmers’) story is incomplete. We are still willing to listen to the farmers.” She was speaking on the political resolution passed by the party which endorsed PM Narendra Modi’s leadership and accused the opposition of “opportunism” and amindset of “extreme hate”. It said BJP is set for a big win in states due for polls on the basis of development work and organisational strength. The resolution spoke of Modi government’s handling of issues from the Covid-19 vaccinations to climate change, with Sitharaman asserting that the PM has restored faith in governance and built the country’s image abroad. India has played an active role in the domain of foreign policies and ensured that it is heard, she said. The resolution said India is setting new standards of success globally under Modi but the opposition is solely acting out of “extreme hate”, alleging that it was busy derailing the Covid vaccination drive by making every effort and spreading disinformation. The resolution says BJP did well in Bihar, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Bengal, and numerous bypolls and local polls, claiming that this shows the party have lived up to people’s expectations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-meet-sitharaman-lists-out-farmer-sops-hints-at-no-dilution-in-agri-laws-stand/articleshow/87573332.cms||---
---||India||BJP not family-run party, will win coming state polls: PM Modi at party national executive||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a swipe at Congress and regional parties dominated by families, drawing a sharp contrast with BJP, which he said derives its strength from the commitment of its cadre. Addressing the valedictory session of BJP’s national executive here, the Prime Minister said BJP was distinct because it was defined by “sewa, sankalp aur samarpan (service, resolve and commitment)” and does not “revolve around a family”. The remarks came in the lead-up to the face-off with Congress and regional parties like Samajwadi Party and ally-turned-bitter rival Akali Dal in the elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. The Prime Minister asserted that BJP will win the elections because its workers have remained aligned with the concerns of the people. Chief ministers and BJP presidents of poll bound states Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur gave presentations on the upcoming assembly elections at the meeting. A similar presentation was given by BJP’s Punjab unit president Ashwani Sharma, who noted that the state organisation has worked to fight on all assembly seats there in the upcoming polls. Party general secretary and Union enviornment minister Bhupender Yadav maintained that there were no alliance talks in Punjab currently. “If BJP is growing stronger, it is not because of Modi but due to the toil of the committed workers of the party,” Yadav quoted the PM as having said at the session. The executive saw the party striking a confident note on the economy, adopting a combative posture on farmers and UP CM Yogi Adityanath moving the political resolution, in what confirmed his growing stature in the saffron hierarchy. “In his address, PM Modiji gave a big mantra to the party workers that they should become a bridge of faith between the common man and the party, while referring to the party's history of sustained engagement with the issues close to the common man of the country,” said Yadav while briefing media about the salient points of the PM’s 50 minute-long speech, the highlight of the marathon sitting. Yadav said the PM urged the party members to continue working with the spirit of serving the people, which has been central to BJP’s expansion across the country. Modi referred to the welfare work done by BJP workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it reflected the party’s commitment to humanity and focus on serving the people. He expressed gratitude to the people of the country for giving a “full majority democratic government” due to which India has been able to deal with internal and external issues assertively and has been “winning laurels across the world”. Modi also spoke about a new initiative of Kamal Pushp launched on the Namo App for paying tributes to all party workers who devoted their entire life to the party. He asked party members to be in touch with veteran workers, saying a lot could be learnt from them. Sources said Modi also mentioned BJP’s win in the Telangana bypolls, its improved performance in the Ellenabad assembly byelection in Haryana and local body polls in Tamil Nadu besides the improved vote share in an Andhra bypoll to assert that it shows growing acceptance of the party’s development agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-not-family-run-party-will-win-coming-state-polls-pm-modi-at-party-national-executive/articleshow/87573603.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Even as the Centre is closely monitoring nationwide stocks to ensure sufficient quantities are available for those eligible for second doses, there is a strong recommendation to allow boosters for the vulnerable population, as it will be “criminal negligence” to waste or let even a single dose expire. The issue was raised recently in the National Covid Task Force by its member Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who is of the view that those responsible for vaccination at a public or private level, need to draw up a strategy for immunisation for both — second and booster shots — to be taken up concurrently. Data gathered through Cowin makes it possible to know the daily stocks, expiry date of vaccines and those eligible for second doses, hence the Centre should take a call quickly on this as a majority of doses will expire soon, Dr Subhash Salunkhe told TOI. This comes at a time when municipal bodies like BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) and large private hospitals are stuck with vaccine stocks, many of which will expire by January as they have a shelf-life of six months. What is also concerning is that there is massive vaccine hesitancy, with a huge set of population not coming forward to get the second jab. About 7.17 crore people have ‘missed’ their second shot, with unused vaccine doses of nearly 16 crore lying with states, as per health ministry estimates. A top Mumbai-based corporate is struggling to donate its excess vaccines, after it discovered that NGOs in Maharashtra and Rajasthan are also sitting with doses. “We completed the immunisation of our employees, and are still left with 300-odd doses, which will expire in January. The Centre should allow a booster to protect frontline medical personnel and vulnerable populations,” the company’s MD, who didn’t want to be named, told TOI. The third or booster shot could be rolled out after a critical analysis of doses reserved for those eligible for second jabs, and a compliance of each district on its vaccination usage. Those who haven’t been able to use them can hand them back to the central or state authorities, Dr Salunkhe said. Major hospitals have also urged the central government to allow boosters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-demand-for-booster-shots-grow-as-soon-to-expire-doses-pile-up/articleshow/87573808.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The surge came as the pandemic increased the demand for cash and shrunk the GDP. At the same time, the surge in every form of digital payments continues on the fifth anniversary of demonetisation — whether it is Unified Payments Interface (UPI), credit and debit cards or FASTag — demonstrating that the shift to digital as well as cash intensity are not mutually exclusive. The post-pandemic increase in currency in circulation has been a global phenomenon, described as a ‘dash to cash’ under extreme uncertainty. This has been experienced by the US, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Brazil, Russia and Turkey. Meanwhile, digital payments are nearly three times what they were in FY18. The Reserve Bank of India’s digital payments index, which has 2018 as the base year at 100, has risen to 270. This index also captures the spread of digital, taking into account growth in the payments infrastructure. Read AlsoPost demonetisation, notes in circulation on rise; so are digital paymentsNEW DELHI: Five years after the demonetisation, currency notes in circulation continue to rise albeit at a slower pace even as digital payments surge with more and more people embracing cashless payment modes. Primarily, banknotes in circulation went up in the last financial year as many peopleOf the four key objectives of demonetisation, India appears to have done well on three. There has been a rise in digital transactions. Besides this, there has also been a drop in fake currencies. Counterfeit notes detected continued to fall from 310,000 in FY19 to 290,000 in FY20 and 200,000 in FY21. There are also indications that the economy is getting more formalised. According to SBI group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh, there are indicators that the informal economy has shrunk to 20% of GDP from 40% a few years ago. This is comparable to Europe and much better than Latin American countries where the size of the informal economy is estimated at 34%.

Constable Tausif Ahmad was targeted around 8pm near his residence at SD Colony in Batamaloo, a police officer said. The critically injured cop was declared dead on arrival at SMHS Hospital. A clutch of political parties, including Farooq Abdullah's NC and Mehbooba Mufti's PDP, condemned the attack on an unarmed cop. "No words of condemnation would be enough! May Allah grant him a place in Jannat. Our hearts go out to his family and friends at this time of grief," NC tweeted. People's Conference president Sajad Lone termed the killing "an addition to the army of orphans and widows". In September, a 25-year-old police officer taking a detained person to a hospital for a check-up was shot dead at Khanyar in downtown Srinagar. Sub-inspector Arshad Ahmad Mir's killing was caught on camera, with CCTV footage showing a lone terrorist approaching him from behind and pumping three bullets into the back of his head. Three months earlier, on June 27, Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists had barged into the house of special police officer Fayaz Ahmad in Pulwama's Awantipora and opened fire indiscriminately, killing him and his wife. The couple's injured daughter died the next morning. The Pulwama incident came five days after police inspector Parvaiz Ahmad Dar was shot and killed while on his way to pray in a mosque in Srinagar's Nowgam. Union home minister Amit Shah visited Dar's family during his recent visit to Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/terrorists-shoot-dead-cop-in-srinagar/articleshow/87574097.cms||---

They have to take control and start running AI, AI Express and AI-SATS (in which 50% stake is with the new owners) latest by January 23, 2022 — the “long stop date” as per the share purchase agreement signed with the government last month. Comments from the Tatas were sought on preparations being made for this transfer of ownership and awaited till the time of filing report. They have so far not spelt out their plans for AI like whether there will be mega airline or a low-cost and a full-service carrier, the management structure and fleet and cabin upgrade plans. “The long stop date of January 23, 2022, is the outer limit by when Tata’s wholly owned subsidiary Talace has to take over AI. This date has been agreed upon by both the parties (seller government and buyer Tatas),” said people in the know. “If there is a delay in fulfilling conditions precedent (CP) requirements or disagreement on the closing balance sheet, the long stop date can be extended with mutual consent of both the parties. But that is an option unlikely to be exercised as January 23 was the date agreed upon by both,” they said. Top government officials don’t see AI takeover being delayed and they are trying to ensure the transfer of control takes place by the end of this calendar year itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-take-over-operate-air-india-by-jan-23-2022/articleshow/87574173.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The state unit has formed four teams led by senior functionaries to tour the state to consolidate votes.BJP general secretary Arun Singh, in Bengaluru on Monday for the core committee meeting, will review the bypolls performance and deliberate on the strategy for upcoming elections.While BJP won Sindgi handsomely and lost Hangal to Congress, BJP functionaries said they didn’t want to take chances in the upcoming elections starting with polls for 25 seats in the legislative council from urban and rural local bodies. These will be followed by polls for zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats, which will test parties ahead of assembly polls.The four teams will be led by party president Nalin Kumar Kateel, former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eswarappa and former chief minister Jagadish Shettar. They will tour selected regions for three days from November 21, convene public rallies and meet local functionaries.“We want to be prepared for polls well in advance and this tour is the first phase of preparation,” said BJP general secretary and MLC N Ravikumar, also convener of the Yediyurappa-led team.While Kateel’s team will cover Kalyana Karnataka districts, Yediyurappa’s team will tour across Kittur Karnataka. Eswarappa’s team has been given Malnad and coastal districts and Shettar will cover remaining districts in Bengaluru and South Karnataka.“This tour is significant in view of upcoming MLC elections,” said BJP MLC Lahar Singh Siroya. BJP will secure a majority in the upper house if it wins 13 of 25 seats going to the polls, including seven from which its members retire in January 2022.Some members upsetA section of BJP is miffed with the leadership ignoring Yediyurappa’s proposal to lead the state tour alone. “Sending four teams will create confusion among voters, while leaders like Yediyurappa are forced to take a back seat. The party would have benefited if a single team led by Yediyurappa toured the state,” said BJP MLA and Yediyurappa confidant SR Viswanath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-gets-ready-for-pollsfour-teams-to-tour-state/articleshow/87574352.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

This automation, combined with other measures, have made the facility one of the greenest in the country.The company said the campus sources 90% electricity from renewable sources, it reduces 55% load on potable water with intelligent fixtures, and it recycles 98% of its waste. Sanjeev Sharma, MD of ABB India, said by the end of 2022, the campus will only use renewable energy, and there would be zero waste going to dump yards. The main building is where most of the automation technologies have been used. There are sensors all around that capture temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2), and lighting levels. There are motion sensors. Sharma demonstrated a central dashboard that tells you those levels in different parts of the building and outside it.The system senses where people are, and accordingly operates the airconditioning and lighting only in those areas. The cooling levels can be pre-set. If CO2 levels in areas where people are sitting are too high, fresh air is pumped in to lower those levels. “People don’t often realise we have a very corrosive environment inside buildings. But if we can measure it, we can control it,” Sharma said. On the dashboard, the CO2 level outside the building showed as 609 PPM (parts per million), but inside was 518. Peenya is an industrial area, so the CO2 level, Sharma said, is a little higher than in Bengaluru city, where the average would be 550 PPM. ABB’s circuit breakers today are based on power electronics and advanced software algorithms that control the power. They also communicate information about voltage, current. ABB UPSs back up the circuits, and those too are communicating data. The dashboard provides full information about the UPS status, so that you are assured that if power fails, the UPSs will back it up.“With so many sensor points, we are generating lots of data. Over a period of time, we will go through the seasonality of the city – different weather conditions – and occasions when fewer people come in, and occasions when more do. That’s where AI/ML will come in. The building will optimise itself to the different conditions as it learns more. It will be able to predict how to set itself in different corners of the building,” Sharma said. The government’s Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) estimates the building sector accounts for about 35% of total energy consumption. Sharma said automation technologies can bring 30% efficiency in energy consumption in buildings, which means “you can knock off 10% of total energy consumption in the country.” The Peenya facility, Sharma said, is a great one to showcase to customers – instead of the traditional practice of building separate customer experience rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/abbs-15-acre-peenya-campus-turns-green-with-automation/articleshow/87574353.cms||---

MUDA cannot be heard to say the petitioner has bought the property knowing these problems,” the judge stated.The judge also described as unacceptable another MUDA submission that if a portion of the property is relinquished by the petitioner, it could be set off against civic amenities that the petitioner has to leave as and when he forms a layout. “Having erred in formation of a drain on a folly of MUDA, the petitioner cannot be penalised by seeking the land for completion of the drain,” the judge added. The petitioner purchased the property in 2002 and converted it for residential purposes in 2004. MUDA, which formed a layout in the adjoining lands, laid a drain. But, it was stopped near the petitioner’s property. As the neighbouring lands are a little higher, the land gets flooded during monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-muda-compensate-owner-get-land-for-drain/articleshow/87574356.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Based on blood test reports, Jeevan Bima Nagar police arrested Sriki and Bhat under Section 27 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (Punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance). Later, cops searched Bhat’s house in Indiranagar and claimed to have seized 10 cigarettes filled with ganja, along with some ganja powder. Cops did not recover any such material from Sriki’s room on the fourth floor room. According to a senior police officer, the duo was arrested under the NDPS Act around 10pm Saturday. Both were produced before a magistrate on Sunday night who directed that they be produced in court before him on Monday and till then, remain in judicial custody. Earlier, Bhat and Sriki were arrested under Indian Penal Code Sections 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) for allegedly attacking hotel staff. Bhat was trying to enter the lobby without entering his details in the register when hotel staff stopped him, leading to an altercation. Bhat had come to see Sriki, who has been staying in the hotel for more than 55 days. Acting on a police complaint, the duo was taken to Jeevan Bima Nagar police station. There were reports that a businessman’s grandson was reportedly present during the scuffle, was taken to the police station but let off. Asked why Sriki, who had no role in the scuffle apart from looking on silently when Bhat was abusing the staff, was subjected to a medical test, a senior cop said, “Bhat and Sriki were behaving strangely when they were brought to the police station for questioning. While Bhat was crying or laughing, Sriki was struggling to speak. Therefore, we subjected both to medical tests.” According to sources, Sriki’s father is being treated in a private hospital on Old Airport Road for injuries sustained after he fell down from a staircase in his Jayanagar residence about 90 days ago. As Sriki found it tough to shuttle between hospital and house every day, he booked a hotel room nearby. “Sriki booked the room in his own name. Till now, he has paid around Rs 3.5 lakh towards the bill,” an investigating officer said. “We’ll continue probe Bhat as we recovered ganja from his house. As for Sriki, we have to question him about the source of ganja he consumed,” cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hacker-sriki-friend-test-ve-for-ganja-consumption-nabbed/articleshow/87574358.cms||---

The underpass is under construction from February 2019 and has missed several deadlines. In August, BBMP officials had told TOI that work would be over in 60 days. However, there is no sign of progress. “Sixty days and counting!” tweeted Ananda Gundurao, tagging the TOI report where BBMP had made the promise. Palike officials blame the two-corner properties near the underpass for slowing down the pace of work. “A commercial building in the corner is hindering the work. We had to raze it in September but they took the issue to court. So we are trying to sort it out,” said Lokesh, chief engineer, Project BBMP. The joint commissioner of Mahadevapura promised to fix the problem in three days and hand over the land to BBMP, he added. “Our team is ready to complete the work within 60 days. The traffic diversion route has been prepared and sent to the department for approval. The pre-cast for work is also ready,” Lokesh said. The underpass was to be completed by December 2019 but work stopped within a few months owing to land acquisition issues. The last deadline the project missed was February 2021. Initially, the delay was because there were 24 properties that were to be acquired and the owners were seeking compensation. “We offered 1.6 times the guidance value of properties but the residents did not accept it. Later we offered them double the guidance value and they agreed, following which work began,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-fails-to-keep-kundalahalli-date/articleshow/87574360.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The trees are growing faster than the project but there is no sign of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) getting its act together to complete it by laying viaducts over the columns.Four years after work began on the 2.5km flyover, only about 40% of it has been completed. With work having come to a halt, the space between the columns has turned into a garbage dump with commercial establishments and eateries discarding their waste there. “We initially protested against the felling of 67 trees for the project. BBMP translocated 17 trees and that has to be appreciated, regardless of the fact that the project is a never-ending drama,” said Padmini Santhosan, resident of Koramangala. “The road width has narrowed, causing more traffic problems. The project was to be completed by 2020, but now the Palike is blaming the pandemic. What happened before it?” asked Avani R, a resident. When TOI visited the construction site recently, it was found that only 40% of the flyover work was complete. Labourers were seen hanging around and many of them complained that lack of payment of wages on time and construction material supply to finish the project were the major problems. “We have not been paid for three months while the contractors are constantly expecting us to finish the work. They do not even provide required construction material. How do we work on it?” said a labourer. Information accessed by TOI revealed that a Kolkata-based firm was awarded the contract to build the flyover, but washed its hands of the project two years ago. Sources close to the contractor revealed the civic agency was unable to clear the bills due to which the contractor stopped his work. “The bills were pending for almost two years, which forced the contractor to stop work,” he said. Manoz Jain, BBMP special commissioner, major projects, said the lack of trust between the contractor and BBMP affected the progress of the flyover work. But, other BBMP officials have a different story to tell. “The contractor-company’s financial condition was very poor and the project has been affected. The same firm had taken up Metro construction work, but due to inefficiency in managing funds, they lost the Metro contract too, and their fund flow was affected,” said an official.The government has sanctioned Rs 203 crore for the work but BBMP did not release a single rupee due to trust issues. “We have learnt that money sanctioned for this was used for Metro work, due to which payments were halted. Things have now been streamlined between the two civic agencies,” said an official. BBMP has already cleared Rs 69 crore worth of bills and as soon as the state government releases more funds, pending bills will also be cleared. “By the first two months of 2023, the project will be completed,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-years-outgrown-trees-work-on-ejipura-flyover-still-drags-on/articleshow/87574362.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Motorists launch drive to implement BH series||Bengaluru: With the transport department delaying Bharat (BH) series’ registration for new vehicles, many motorists in the city have launched an online campaign.The hashtag campaign, #ImplementBHregistrationinKA, was launched on Twitter. On August 26, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) issued a notification on BH services which came into effect on September 15. At least 15 states and UTs, including Delhi, Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Chandigarh and Tripura, have rolled out the new BH series so far. BH series is mainly to facilitate seamless transfer of vehicles moving from one state to another. It is considered as the preliminary step towards the Centre’s ‘One Nation, One Motor Vehicle Tax’ plan. States/UTs like Odisha, Maharashtra and Chandigarh have already implemented it. However, the state transport department has not started it as yet.Waseem Memon of Drive Without Borders, a citizen group which has been campaigning for ‘one nation, one road tax’, said: “Many owners who paid booking amount for their vehicle are not taking it from showrooms because of this delay. They have been waiting for nearly 50 days for implementation of the BH series. When many non-BJP governments implemented this, why Karnataka is turning a blind eye?”Many motorists are now thinking of purchasing new vehicles from states that have implemented BH series and then bringing them to the city. A transport department official said they are discussing the financial implications. “We’ll start issuing BH series registration once we get government nod,” he said. According to Motor Vehicle Rules, a vehicle can’t ply with another state registration number beyond 11 months from the date of migration. Otherwise, vehicle owners will have to re-register it from the parent-state to a new state, which is cumbersome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/motorists-launch-drive-to-implement-bh-series/articleshow/87574363.cms||---

The private firm providing the smart cards has said the shortage is due to a global semiconductor shortage. Sources said there is a backlog of nearly two months. It means that motorists who applied/renewed licences or bought a vehicle/made changes in the registration certificate of existing vehicles will have to wait for a long time for the cards. The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) had extended the validity of the transport documents that expired on or after February 1, 2020, till October 31, 2021, due to the pandemic. However, MORTH officials now say they will not give a further extension and the onus is on respective state governments to extend the validity, if necessary. The Delhi and Kerala governments have extended the validity of expired documents till November 2021 and December 2021, respectively. However, the Karnataka transport department has not given any such extension even though motorists are struggling to get slots to get services for the past few months. Nagesh H, who applied for licence renewal, said: “RTO officials are saying there is a shortage of smart cards. Neither the Centre nor the state is extending the validity of documents. If traffic police catch us, we will end up paying fines.” According to rules, a fine of up to Rs 5,000 each will be imposed for driving without a valid licence or registration certificate. J Purushotham, additional commissioner for transport (environment and e-governance), said: “We have resolved all issues related to the delay in issuing smart cards. We are now issuing smart cards in 20-30 days. It will take some time to print the cards and then send them to the applicants, but there are no major delays.”  Delhi-based Rosmerta Technologies Ltd has been supplying smart cards for the last 12 years. In 2009, the transport department switched from paper-based licences and registration certificates to smart cards. Transport department officials said they have already issued a notice to the firm on the delay in providing the smart cards. Rosmerta in a letter to the department said they are finding it difficult to obtain chips to produce the smart cards due to a global semiconductor shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smart-card-shortage-for-registration-paper-dl-worries-vehicle-owners/articleshow/87574367.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||HC: Police failure to take action must be stated in pvt plaint||Bengaluru: Mere verification of the complaint by the complainant in the form of an accompanying affidavit does not meet the requirements laid down by the Supreme Court in the Priyanka Srivastava case pertaining to private complaints, the high court said. “In the (private) complaint, the failure of police to take action when a report is submitted to them must be stated very clearly in a separate affidavit,” Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar observed in his order while upholding the objection/contention raised by the income tax department.However, the judge dismissed the department’s petition as improper since of the three I-T officers named in the complaint — B Arun, S Arun Kumar and Rohit Sharma — verified the petition, as required under the law. The department had challenged the complaint lodged against its three officers by Pavan Kumar Sachdeva, alleging excesses during a raid on their offices in August 2019.Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said if those allegations are true, it falls within the scope of section 166 of IPC (Public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person) and added that it only shows excess on the part of the officers while conducting the raid. The judge described as unacceptable and improper the inclusion of Anand, assistant director of I-T, as the fourth petitioner along with the three accused. However, it was specified in the order that the dismissal of the petition won’t come in the way of the three officers filing a fresh petition, properly verified by one of them.Sachdeva, one of the employees of Aone Steels India Private Limited, Sahakarnagar, Bengaluru, had submitted a complaint alleging that police did not register a complaint filed by him and other employees alleging assault by the I-T officers during the raid, and only issued an NCR (non-cognizable report). According to Sachdeva, the assault had damaged his left ear.Later, Kodogehalli police registered an FIR against the officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-police-failure-to-take-action-must-be-stated-in-pvt-plaint/articleshow/87574368.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||JavaScript widens lead over other languages||Bengaluru: JavaScript is the most popular programming language by a wide margin, with nearly 16.5 million developers using it globally, showed data from SlashData's latest State of the Developer Nation report.About 4 million developers joined the community in the last year, by far the highest growth in absolute terms across all languages. Upwards of 2.5 million developers joined in the past six months alone. The report showed that even in software sectors where JavaScript is not among developers’ top choices, like data science or embedded development, about a fourth of developers use it in their projects. Python takes the second spot, with 11.3 million users, after adding 2.3 million net new developers in the past 12 months. That’s a 25% growth rate, one of the highest across all the large programming language communities of more than 7 million users. The rise of data science and machine learning (ML) is a clear factor in Python’s popularity. More than 70% of ML developers and data scientists report using Python.Kotlin has consistently been identified as a rising star among programming languages, with an audience that has doubled in size over the last three years, the report said. This trend is largely attributed to Google’s decision to make Kotlin its preferred language for Android development. Kotlin is currently the third most popular language in mobile development, behind JavaScript and Java.Rust has grown faster than any other language in the last 24 months, nearly tripling in size, from just 0.4 million developers in the third quarter of 2019 to 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2021. According to SlashData, Rust is mostly used in embedded software projects, but also in AR/VR development, most commonly for implementing the low-level core logic of AR/VR applicationsThe study shows Greater China is the epicentre of 5G for software developers. It found that four in every five software developers are either interested in, learning about, or working on 5G technologies. The percentage of developers deploying their games via the cloud rose by 10% in the last six months, the largest increase of any platform type. Of the professional game developers deploying their code to the cloud, 43% are using a multi/hybrid strategy. Backend technologies are now the third most used technology in game development, behind only 2D and 3D game engines. Professional game development requires more usage of backend technologies, with a majority of developers using storage/database technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/javascript-widens-lead-over-other-languages/articleshow/87574373.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||India||New cases in Diwali week fall to lowest since start of 2nd wave||Fresh cases of Covid-19 recorded during the Diwali week that ended on Sunday were the lowest since the beginning of the second wave in the country in mid-February this year. India logged a little more than 80,700 new cases of the coronavirus in the week (November 1-7), a steep 16% drop from the number (96,500) recorded in the previous week. This was the lowest weekly tally since February 8-14 this year, when new cases had dropped to 77,284. From mid-February onwards, infections started rising in what turned out to be a devastating second wave of the pandemic in the country. A key reason for the sharp fall in cases in the current week could be the disruptions in testing and detections due to Diwali. The coming week could reveal whether the festivities had any impact on Covid infections. Cases of the coronavirus have been decreasing steadily for the past nine weeks, with only the week after Dussehra/Durga Puja registering a marginal drop of 1%. Daily numbers show cases decreased in nearly all states and Union territories of the country during the week, except for Jammu and Kashmir, which saw a spike in infections, particularly in the last two days. The UT reported 165 new cases on Sunday, the highest daily count since September 23, when 172 cases were reported. Meanwhile, 2,614 deaths from the virus were recorded in the week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-cases-in-diwali-week-fall-to-lowest-since-start-of-2nd-wave/articleshow/87574394.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The administration has also declared 12 ghats as “dangerous” and “unsafe” due to rise in the water level in Ganga, dirty water and soil erosion. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said all the dangerous and unsafe ghats would remain out-of-bound for the devotees as they have been barricaded from the approach road itself with signboards. Police personnel have been deployed at these ghats to guide the devotees. The ghats which have been identified as “dangerous” are Kantahi Ghat, Tedhi Ghat, Maharaj Ghat, Mirchai Ghat, Adalatganj Ghat, Mishri Ghat, T B Banerjee Ghat, Judges Ghat, Jahaz Ghat, Anta Ghat, Bankipore Ghat and BN College Ghat. Due to water and swamp on approach road leading to Mahendru Ghat and Collectorate Ghat, a makeshift bridge is being constructed as an approach road to connect to ghats.

Huge rush was witnessed at local markets in the city as people were busy buying bottle gourd, seasonal fruits, coconut, banana leaves, bamboo soop, tokri, sugar cane stems, ghaagar nimbu (pomelo), earthen stoves, brass utensils, flowers, dry wood of mango trees and other puja materials. Vendors selling Chhath items were happy as they earned extra money due to the high demand. Pintu Kumar, a fruit seller at Bazaar Samiti, said at least three trucks laden with fruits like banana, orange, pomelo, apple, guava and custard apple were unloaded on Sunday and 40% of fruits was sold during the day. “Last year, the sales were down due to Covid restrictions,” he added.

The sales will start picking up from Monday,” he added. Namita Sinha, a resident of Jagganpura, said she bought bottle gourd, rice and chana dal for ‘nahay-khay’. “Since the Chhath rituals will start from Monday, I have made all the preparations. As it is the most important festival, we prepare everything with purity. I fetch water from Ganga and clean the home and all brass utensils in which prasad will be cooked,” she said.

Twenty-five of these ghats are under Danapur Nagar Parishad and the rest 12 under Danapur Cantonment Board. Though Danapur Nagar Parishad has floated a tender of Rs45 lakh for cleaning and barricading the ghats, the condition of most of them continues to be highly deplorable due to mud and slush, particularly at Gopalan Ghat, Chaudhrana Ghat, Nariyal Ghat, Chai Tola Ghat, Rajputana Ghat, Babu Saheb Ghat, Daudpur and Thakurbari Ghat in Danapur. According to Danapur Nagar Parishad executive officer Sushil Kumar, receding river water has left mud and slush at a few ghats. The district administration has worked out a contingency plan to keep these ghats in readiness by Monday or Tuesday. Cleaning drive will be launched on Monday morning and arrangements are being made to put Ganga sand at those ghats. The local administration has decided to barricade each ghat with proper lights. A district control room is being set up at Danapur to keep a close watch on the movement of devotees and erect watch towers at each sensitive ghats. A section of NDRF men will be deployed from Peepapul to Daudpur to meet any emergency, Kumar said. Boat patrolling will be carried out at the ghats. Medical kiosk and first-aid arrangements will be available at all major ghats, he said, adding Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh held a briefing session with the officials of Danapur on Sunday to complete the arrangements at the earliest.

The woman, a Dalit, was a native of Srikakulam district and was studying at a private engineering college in Vizag city. She committed suicide on October 30. Family members conducted her final rites without informing the police. However, her family came to know that a youth from the district had befriended her over WhatsApp video calls. The youth allegedly recorded the victim’s nude videos. The family members approached the police seeking action against the youth. Preliminary investigation revealed that the youth had a pre-existing rivalry with the victim’s brother, who stays in Vijayawada. He sent the videos of the victim to her brother and threatened that he would circulate them on social networking sites. Shocked, the woman’s brother admonished his sister. Depressed over the series of events, she ended her life. After her death, the youth allegedly circulated the video clips on social media. Based on the complaint from the woman’s family, a postmortem on the body was conducted after exhuming it in the presence of a magistrate. An investigation is on. Leaders and activists of Dalit organisations have demanded action against the youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/students-body-exhumed-after-kin-cry-foul/articleshow/87572998.cms||---

In the absence of that risk assessment, EV financing is happening on a company to company and product to product basis with big players tying up financiers using their own credibility. “It is true there is hesitancy among financiers about electric vehicles particularly e- two wheelers and currently only 9% of e-two wheelers get financed,” said Sohinder Singh Gill, director general, Society of Electric Vehicle Manufacturers. EV dealers say only a couple of financiers like Hero Fincorp and IDFC First Bank and Karur Vysya Bank are offering competitive rates and upto 80% financing. And some OEM tie-ups with lenders are helping finances flow for buyers. Auto finance sources said the risk factor in this segment is that both products as well as companies are new. “Typically the customer’s credit worthiness and the vehicle's resale value (in cause of loan default) determines loan tenure, rate and availability,” said a financier. Dealer sources say in the absence of established vehicle resale history, the rates vary from 10% to 22%-23% depending on the product, company and the customer’s risk profile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/evs-face-finance-hiccup-with-lenders-hesitant-to-offer-loans/articleshow/87573024.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Operation Parivartan was launched with a two-pronged approach to curb ganja trade and to bring in reform and rehabilitate cultivators. An extensive drive was launched across the state involving the SEB and police. Apart from enhancing surveillance at places like bus stations, railway stations and border checkposts, extensive vehicle checks are conducted as part of the programme. SEB officials have also launched a drive to destroy ganja crop in Agency. So far, they have identified ganja crop on 800 acres and destroyed it. Along with the enforcement drive, SEB officials also launched an awareness drive in the Agency, explaining the legal consequences that arise from cultivation of ganja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/seb-records-283-cases-under-op-parivartan/articleshow/87573016.cms||---

The brainchild of IIT-M aerospace professor Satya Chakravarthy, who founded the National Centre for Combustion Research & Development, and IIT-M student (2019 batch) Pranjal Mehta have been designing and building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) planes for door-to-door commute within cities at a price point on a par with road taxis. They hope to fly by 2024, if the government allows it. The ePlane is a two-seater that can carry 200kg for 200km, flying over traffic. It can make city commute ten times faster at just 1.5 times the taxi fare. All you need is a 4x4 space to take off and land. Chakravarthy, who has paused teaching to turn full-time CTO with ePlane, says their eVTOL uses both rotors and wings and can "take off like a drone and fly like a plane." Mehta says they decided to focus on an intra-city model, given the range of electric mobility and the traffic problem in the 5km-20km range. With the government framing rules for cargo delivery using drones, the team is conducting trials for a smaller version of the aircraft with a 6kg payload (e6) that will be ready in six to nine months. The government move on drones has enthused the startup, which says Indian regulators have shown high levels of willingness and openness. The team anticipates an early 2024 launch of the e200 air taxi. "If the government here works in tandem with startups in this sector, it is likely that India and we at ePlane will have the first flying taxi take off sooner than in other global markets. We are optimistic with the government’s recent announcements around drone transport," Mehta said. Despite years of development and billions in venture funding, most global flying taxi players haven’t commercialised yet because of regulatory constraints. The government of India is backing the use of drones for last-mile delivery and has increased the payload of drones from 300kg to 500kg. The startup raised around $1million in seed funds last March in a round led by VC firm Speciale Invest with participation from Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant and Java Capital. It is working to close a new funding round soon. With large aerospace R&D MNCs being forced to lay off talent during the peak of the pandemic, ePlane says it has also been able to attract quality senior talent who share its vision. A futuristic product coming from an Indian campus and more so from a professor-student team is sure to grab global attention. The startup benefits from the combination of the professor’s fierce focus on getting the tech right and Mehta’s business acumen, but when asked who wins in case of a tie, Chakravarthy says: "Business always wins".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-its-an-eplane/articleshow/87573134.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The accident took place on Saturday at the Mohkampur crossing at Haridwar road in Doon. The impact of the crash was such that the scooty and some of its parts got stuck to the train's engine.  The train could only move ahead after around two hours when the scooty's parts were extracted fromthe engine. No casualties were reported in the incident and all passengers on board the train were reported to be safe.  The scooty rider, identified as Dev Mishra, 24, a resident of Rishikesh, told police that he decided to take the shortcut through the tracks since there was a traffic jam at the railway overbridge on Haridwar road. He has been booked under section 153 of the Railways Act (endangering safety of persons travelling by railway by wilful act or omission). “An inquiry into the matter is underway and we will take action accordingly,” Suresh Rastogi, sub-inspector of the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Dehradun, said. He added that “a major mishap was averted since the loco driver spotted the scooty on time and immediately applied the emergency brakes.” “Even though a scooty is a relatively small object and collision with it even at full speed would not have derailed the train, any collision carries the prospect of casualties. We are lucky such a scenario did not happen,” he said. Meanwhile, as a result of the accident, multiple trains on the route were delayed, with local passengers getting off and looking for alternative modes to reach their respective destinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/close-shave-delhi-doon-shatabdi-crashes-into-scooty-left-on-tracks-by-man/articleshow/87572532.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Her ‘dish of the day’ needed to be the perfect blend of all-natural nourishment. And, it had to be tasteful. After all, it was a vegan eye shadow she was creating… I’m sorry, did you think we were talking about breakfast? Shobana launched Blush Bee Beauty, a line of "clean beauty" cosmetics, a couple of months ago. It’s one of several organic make-up brands eyeing the $747.3m natural cosmetics segment in India. The segment, which covers beauty products for the face, eyes and nails made completely or partially from natural ingredients, is expected to grow annually by 5% in the next five years, according to a report from market research firm Statista. Globally, the clean beauty market is expected to reach more than $54 billion by 2027. "Blush Bee began as a home business," says Shobana, a chartered accountant based in Chennai. "I didn’t want to put chemicals on my face and so started making lipsticks for myself, then friends and family." This year, with several manufacturing units and certifications in place, Shobana and her husband Navaneethan, who has quit his corporate job, are "planning to enter the funding zone in a couple of months". "We’re currently boot-strapped but already fielding offers from investors who have seen the potential in this segment of the cosmetic industry," she says. Earlier this month, Shweta and Darshana, both based in Chennai, launched Aardae (‘earth’ in Dutch) online as well as a store in Singapore, to focus on clean beauty products from India. "The natural cosmetics market is growing 3x post-Covid with people looking for chemical-free and organic products. Several of the Indian brands we feature have managed to raise funds. Some of them have been around for a decade but are doing well now and are on a par with international standards," says Shweta. "The idea is to expand to the ASEAN and GCC market in the next year," says Darshana, who adds that they have 39 internationally certified brands on their site. Chennai-based Suganthshree S, the founder of NanoAuVeda, just launched skincare products fortified with gold that use nanotechnology to improve penetration into the skin. "Our products are rooted in Ayurveda but backed by science," she says. "Over the past decade, there has been a shift towards natural products, more so after the pandemic. People have realized the value of local sourcing and natural products for personal care." Coimbatore-based Juicy Chemistry, which Pritesh and Megha Desai Asher launched in 2014 with Rs 5,000, saw its first round of funding of $650,000 in 2019. Today, it has more than 100 skincare products, is expanding globally, and plans to start a line of all-natural. cosmetics soon. "Every single one of our products is certified free of synthetics. We work with farmers in more than 20 countries to create products with potent organic ingredients," says Pritesh. In March, Juicy Chemistry hit a turnover of Rs 25 crore and received funding from global investor Verlinvest, whose Indian portfolio includes brands such as BYJU’S, Sula Vineyards, and Epigamia. Clearly, the all-natural gold rush is only just beginning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/beauty-comes-clean-city-based-homegrown-organic-brands-see-growth/articleshow/87573106.cms||---

Senior BJP leaders, including Union minister of state Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi, Bihar ministers Mangal Pandey, Nitin Navin, Jivesh Mishra and several others reached the IGIMS and paid tributes to Garg. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal officially received the body from Garg’s nephew Arvind and presented him the certificate for the whole body donation. IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas and other doctors were present on the occasion. Dr Mandal said both the eyes of Garg had already been retrieved on Saturday evening and preserved in the eye bank for transplant. “Since the body was received here after long hours of his death, many other organs could not be transplanted. However, the skin would be of significant use for study and research in MD, MS courses,” Dr Mandal said. Soon after the arrival at IGIMS, formalin was injected into the arteries of the body by infusion pump for protecting internal organs from decomposition before handing over to the head of anatomy department, Dr Avnish Kumar, for further medical purposes. Though many people have started organ donations, especially eyes, whole body donation for medical purposes is still rare. “It was the fourth whole body donation at the IGIMS. Earlier, such donations were made by Bishvanath Ram, Sipra Sen and Rajeshwar Narayan Agrawal,” Dr Mandal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rss-leaders-body-donated-to-igims-for-med-purposes/articleshow/87572526.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||RJD questions prohibition law||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday uploaded 15 questions to his party’s official Twitter handle seeking answers from chief minister Nitish Kumar on the issues related to excise and prohibition policy in the wake of recent hooch deaths in West Champaran, Gopalganj and Samastipur districts. The RJD alleged that a huge consignment of smuggled liquor was being seized almost every day in the state. The seized consignment and vehicles are ‘auctioned’ from the police station concerned and a big share of the money realised from the smugglers goes to the officers and political workers of the ruling parties. The RJD alleged that the consignments reached their destination from other states after crossing four to five districts. It asked: “Is it possible to transport the consignment without the tacit support of the officials of district administration, excise and prohibition department and the police?” The RJD further alleged that a parallel economy worth Rs20,000 crore was being run by the liquor smugglers in the state. It also expressed surprise over the police’s lackadaisical attitude towards senior officials and political party workers despite their involvement in the illegal trade flourishing in the state post-prohibition. The new prohibition law, however, proved to be a curse for the majority of the poor as around 3 lakh people belonging to the lower strata of the society were sent to jail. On the contrary, neither any influential person nor any affluent man was arrested for violating the prohibition law, the party alleged. Reacting to the RJD questions, JD(U) leader Sanjay Singh said Tejashwi should stop talking about prohibition as his family members had been the beneficiaries of the liquor trade during the RJD regime. “How Lalu Prasad and his family that used to stay in a 10x10ft house before him becoming the CM accumulated unaccounted wealth? Tejashwi must be aware of this fact,” Singh said, adding that prohibition was a bold step taken by CM Nitish Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-questions-prohibition-law/articleshow/87572564.cms||Ramashankar

In Davanagere, select students from various schools are being housed at the MSS Training Centre in Kondajji village – a facility that sprawls 13 acres – for a period of one week where they are being imparted lessons to enhance their concentration, grasping power, memory and increase their reading speed. MSS Training Centre director Dr Jayanth said that offering such training had been the dream of the late founder of Sri Siddaganga School in Davanagare, MS Shivanna. “He founded this centre, and wanted students from across the state to benefit by learning these skills. We have written to the chiefs of schools across the state, requesting them to send one boy, and a girl, to our training camp, which will start on November 14, which is also Children’s Day. We will be training students in batches of 80 for a week, and this will continue for four months. These skills will equip students to face the key examination without fear,” Jayanth said. Head of Siddaganga School in Davanagare Justin D’Souza said that they were calling the initiative ‘10X Plus Training Camp’. “We trained 230 children from our school using these methods last year, and found them to be very effective,” he said. Programme co-coordinator DS Hiremath said that they would teach students various techniques that would help activate the brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/sslc-students-to-learn-how-to-improve-memory-understanding/articleshow/87573231.cms||SA Gangaraju
---||Business||Power up, get set, go||Chennai: Well begun is half done. Tamil Nadu has done well to attract some OEMs and some part makers to give wheels to its e-vehicles sector. But, more policy initiatives and incentives are needed to help it accelerate. The state has a good mix of innovators, driven by a clutch of startups and technology support from IIT Madras’s Centre for Battery Engineering for Electric Vehicles, early adopters or those who have converted ideas into commercial use and spotted early the global opportunity, OEMs and part makers that have already started projects. Now, it is important to capitalise on this. "Every state has a plan to woo investors, the differentiator has to be the quality and the ecosystem advantage the state can showcase," said a policymaker with the state government. The state has managed to attract nearly Rs 15,000 crore in investments for EVs and related parts since 2019, the most in India. The world’s largest e2-wheeler factory in Krishnagiri by Ola will roll out a vehicle every two seconds. Lucas-TVS is setting up a giga factory in Tiruvallur for making batteries for EVs. And TVS, Ather, Srivaru Motors, BYD, and Tube Investments have projects. The state government is revamping its EV policy to tie up loose ends, offer incentives to manufacturers and buyers, and set up charging infrastructure. The upcoming dedicated EV Park at Manalur near Chennai is another step forward. Some believe the demand for EVs will bring in more investments. "I have asked the state government to make it mandatory for three-wheelers and pickups to be EVs in five years. Once this is done, the demand pull will be significant. This, coupled with incentives for motors and controllers, batteries, chargers and converters will make the ecosystem complete as the state already makes other parts such as body, tyre, brakes and suspension," said Professor Ashok Jhunjunwala of IIT Madras. Maheshbabu, CEO of Switch Mobility India (EV arm of Ashok Leyland), says: "Tamil Nadu has a comprehensive EV policy as well as a good industrial promotion policy. Advance chemistry battery plants are also being pursued and this will attract EV investments to TN." Nagesh Basavanhalli, Group CEO & MD of Greaves Cotton (which acquired Coimbatore-based Ampere in 2019), says: "Tamil Nadu is one of the key states in leading the auto and EV revolution, and it is one of the fastest growing states with a conducive policy environment. With its R&D centre and existing facility in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu was a preferred choice for Ampere." Greaves is putting up its biggest EV plant in Ranipet, which will make two-wheelers and three-wheelers. And it is not just new age EV makers that are investing. Chetan Maini of Sun Mobility, which made India’s first electric car Reva, says existing players such as Ashok Leyland and TVS are ramping up their EV portfolio investments. While all of this is good news, EV industry insiders say other states are not sitting idle. It is "exciting to see almost every state working towards being the EV capital of India," says Maini. India’s 2030 vision of e-mobility is a revenue of $206 billion with an investment opportunity of $192 billion. "For this, we will require not one but multiple EV hubs. Karnataka has a head start with Mahindra Electric, Ather, Sun Mobility and lots of other startups and tech centres of EV companies," says Maini. The EV manufacturing ecosystem works a bit different from traditional auto companies. "EVs are much simpler to assemble, so OEMs will choose to assemble them in a distributed fashion (micro/mini factories) to reduce logistics cost and benefit from several states’ sops," says Amitabh Saran, CEO of Altigreen Propulsion Labs. Regional hubs will be created closer to electronics and electrical component manufacturers as well, says Saran. The good news is TN’s components giants are stepping up their EV game. Lucas-TVS, which is setting up a Rs 2,500-crore factory near Chennai with US-based 24M Technologies, is also looking to invest in charging infrastructure. The company, which has also bid for the ACC battery storage PLI scheme, is evaluating how large the pilot will be and is in touch with customers in the EV and energy storage space, says Arvind Balaji, MD, Lucas-TVS. Several TN-based players have applied for the PLI scheme, and are awaiting Niti Aayog’s nod, said a government source. This, say EV experts, is critical because TN will need to scale up from mechanical to electrical/ electronics parts competence if it wants to retain its edge in EV investments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/power-up-get-set-go/articleshow/87573163.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Prof Sita Ram Singh and Prof R K Srivastava, who had superannuated from B D College, said they were chronic patients and needed money every month for medicines and had to take loan to meet their medical expenses. Patliputra University Teachers’ Association (PPUTA) president Prof A K Singh Thakur and general secretary Prof Hridya Kumar Singh condemned the callous attitude of the state government and university. “Chhath puja is such an important festival that it is celebrated in every house in Bihar. It will be a tough task for the teachers to celebrate Chhath without salary payments. Chances of getting payments on Chhath seems remote due to holiday in government offices and university,” Prof Thakur said. According to PPU registrar Prof Jitendra Kumar, the university could not arrange payments of salaries and pensions to teachers due to non-receipt of money from the state government. There are about 1,000 teachers and 350 pensioners in the PPU, he said and said the file related to salaries and pension was still lying in the finance department for final clearance and release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ppu-teachers-not-paid-for-past-3-months/articleshow/87572340.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Vijayawada||Spl police officers slog sans pay as govt corps back out||Vijayawada: Special police officers (SPOs) recruited by the state government for curbing illegal liquor transport are struggling without payment of salaries for the past seven months. More than 1,500 personnel were recruited on a contract basis for a salary of Rs 15,000 after the new excise policy was announced to guard interstate checkposts and conduct vehicle checks. The government originally made an arrangement that the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) and Andhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL) would bear the salaries in a 50:50 ratio. Initially, the duties of SPOs also included keeping vigil on illegal sand transportation. However, after the change in sand policy, under which all sand operations are managed by a private company, APMDC came out from the arrangement of payment of SPO salaries. At the same time, APSBCL also wrote to the government, stating they could not pay the salaries as they were struggling from a lack of funds to manage operations of the corporation. The issue of who should pay SPO salaries has been pending with the finance department. Though the police department has no role to play in salaries, it has been feeling the heat from the SPOs as they work under the administrative control of local station house officers (SHOs). Speaking to TOI, Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal admitted that there has been a problem with payment of salaries to SPOs, which he has appraised the officials, including the chief secretary. “Deliberations are taking place to find a permanent solution to the issue, and we are hopeful that it will be resolved very soon,” he said. A senior official of APSBCL said they have written to the government explaining the financial situation of the corporation as they have been struggling to make ends meet from the commission they get from the sale of liquor. “We do not have funds to pay salaries to SPOs and if the state government increases our commission at least to the extent to match the salary bill, we do not have any objection to pay salaries to SPOs,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spl-police-officers-slog-sans-pay-as-govt-corps-back-out/articleshow/87573075.cms||Srikanth Aluri

In a letter to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Ganga Rao said under the CFMS, all taxes and other earnings of GVMC will first go to the state government before being deposited back into the GVMC’s account. “There has been an inordinate delay in this process, throwing the corporation into financial troubles on a constant basis. Even the funds released under various schemes such as Smart City, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), 15th finance commission, etc. is remitted to the CFMS’ account. Due to the same, GVMC has dues to the tune of Rs 800 crore to the contractors, who did various developmental works in the last three years,” said Rao. Rao added that about Rs 120 crore earnings of the GVMC goes to the CFMS every month. “In a nutshell, the GVMC has lost its autonomy over spending its own revenues generated from various streams due to the CFMS. This goes against the very objective of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/exclude-gvmc-from-cfms-demands-cpm/articleshow/87573070.cms||---

Surendran alleged that the sanction must have been accorded with the consent of the chief minister and the forest minister and that the government cannot escape by laying the blame on its officials. “No one can believe the story that the officials gave the sanction to Tamil Nadu to fell these trees without the knowledge of the chief minister. It is better for CM Pinarayi Vijayan to resign and go for ‘Vanaprastham’ if officials are able to issue orders that are detrimental to the interests of the people. This is a serious betrayal against the people of Kerala. Action must be taken against the officials who had issued the orders,” he said. The BJP leader said that the letter from Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin thanking Vijayan for the sanction to fell trees clearly indicated that there is a secret understanding between the two chief ministers. Surendran alleged that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy behind the order which could adversely affect Kerala in the Mullaperiyar case. He demanded a detailed probe into the circumstances that led to the issuance of this order. Surendran was in the city to attend BJP’s national executive committee through an online platform, along with other prominent leaders like Kummanam Rajasekharan, E Sreedharan, PK Krishnadas, Aneeshkumar and M Ganesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/betrayal-of-the-people-of-kerala-says-surendran/articleshow/87573158.cms||---

Locals said Mohammad Irfan aka Ujale, who was wanted by the police of 12 states and arrested at Ghaziabad in UP two months back, built seven roads and narrow lanes at his native village Gad Jogia and neighbouring localities in Jogia panchayat under Pupri subdivision of the district at a cost of around Rs1 crore. The money was allegedly collected from heists across the country as part of the 11-member gang targeting affluent families only. “My husband has promised not to commit any crime once he is released on bail. We want to work together to serve the people. He has helped many needy people for their daughters’ marriage, education expenses of their wards and medical treatment,” she told this reporter over the phone. Raj Ballabh Sinha, a retired engineer of Parihar assembly segment in Sitamarhi district, said Irfan donated Rs20 lakh to a neighbourhood family for the treatment of a girl suffering from cancer. “The roads and lanes that he built from his personal funds were meant to ensure victory of his wife as a district board member,” he added. Locals said Irfan, who loved to travel in luxury cars like Jaguar and spent lavishly, had introduced himself in the area as a big businessman. “He used to visit the ancestral village in brand new luxury cars. People were fond of him due to his social works,” said Md Afroz. Irfan, a daily wager, committed a robbery for the first time 11 years ago to pay the dowry for his sister’s marriage. Then he moved to metro cities. He has cases pending against him in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Goa, Pune, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram among other big cities. Police sources said he was an accused in at least 40 cases lodged in different cities across the country. He is stated to have amassed wealth worth Rs20 crore. He was arrested in connection with a theft of cash and jewellery worth Rs1.5 crore from the house of one Kapil Garg under the Kavinagar police station area in UP in September last. A Ghaziabad police team had raided Irfan’s house in Sitamarhi on September 7, but he was not there. His two associates — Md Shoaib and Vikram Sah — and his wife were arrested with the help of the Pupri police. Pupri police station SHO Ram Ekbal Prasad said they had earlier detained Irfan for interrogation on a tip-off about his involvement in big heists in other states. “We had to release him as there was no case pending against him under our jurisdiction,” he told this newspaper over phone on Sunday. Later, he was arrested by the Ghaziabad police and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/district-board-member-wants-to-see-criminal-hubby-as-mla/articleshow/87572569.cms||Ramashankar

The sixth IDDC has been jointly organised by the NU and India Foundation. Naidu also called for critical reassessment of lifestyle and thinking in the wake of Covid pandemic to establish peace and harmony in the world. He added peace and brotherhood preached by Gautam Buddha was the central idea for ensuring development in the country. “We should strive to follow these principles. The universal principles of peaceful co-existence, cooperation, mutual care and share, non-violence, friendliness, compassion, peace, truth, honesty, selflessness and sacrifice have been an integral part of dharmic ethical exhortations,” he said, adding the resurrected NU should not only impart knowledge to the students but also make them wise. Addressing the event, governor Phagu Chauhan discussed at length the past glory of NU and expressed his happiness over its revival. Chief minister Nitish Kumar said Rajgir had a glorious history and it was associated with all major religions. He used the occasion to highlight the success of Covid vaccination in Bihar and elsewhere in the country. In her welcome address, NU vice-chancellor Sunaina Singh said the middle path shown by Gautam Buddha and the Veda would guide in overcoming the economic and mental distresses caused by Covid pandemic. Around 150 scholars from the country and abroad will present their research papers at the IDDC. State rural development minister Shrawan Kumar, Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh and Nalanda SP Hari Prasath S were among those present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vp-for-review-of-lifestyle-in-post-covid-world/articleshow/87572493.cms||Farrukh Nadim

With this, Bihar has become sixth state in the country to cross the seven-crore vaccine mark. Health minister Mangal Pandey said Bihar has achieved the milestone of administering 7.06 crore vaccine doses since the beginning of the drive in January this year. “We have administered 5 crore vaccine doses in the last 15 weeks alone. Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and guidance of CM Nitish Kumar, the vaccination drive has gathered pace in the state,” Pandey said. Nearly 5.07 crore population above the age of 18 years have been immunized in the state with at least one dose and 1.99 crore have been fully vaccinated. Addressing mediapersons here, Pandey said the state has set the target to administer 8 crore vaccine doses by December-end. “During the special vaccine drive on Sunday, 8,246 motorbike vaccination teams were deputed across the state to administer vaccines to by reaching their doorsteps. A survey is being done to identify people who have not taken their vaccine doses,” he added. The minister said arrangements have been made for Covid test and vaccination at Chhath ghats too. According to health department data, 60.17% people have been vaccinated in the age group of 18-44 years, 22.76% in 45-59 years and 17.06% in above 60 years. Patna has administered the maximum doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far as 34,42,540 people have taken their first jab and 24,53,960 both doses in the district.

Police issued another notice to organisers of the padayatra, claiming violation of conditions for grant of permission by the high court and director general of police (DGP). Police asked the organisers to ensure there are not be more than 157 people in the yatra as per the condition. Police also asked the farmers not to use loudspeakers or make political statements during the yatra. Darsi DSP Prakash met JAS leader Sivareddy and asked him to take measures to obey all conditions in the permission, adding the padayatra might have to be reined in otherwise. The organisers told the police they have been strictly following the guidelines of the high court and continuing their protest rally peacefully. Leaders Sivareddy and Rayapati Sailaja told the police they are conducting the padayatra with just 157 people and others joined them only to extend their solidarity. “We cannot stop those who are joining us to extend their support. We are going ahead complying with the norms,” said Sivareddy. Meanwhile, Santha Nuthalapadu legislator TJR Sudhakar Babu met Prakasam district SP Mallika Garg and requested her not to allow the padayatra through villages where local body elections are scheduled. He also submitted a memorandum to district collector Praveen Kumar to change the route map of the yatra. The SP advised Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi to conduct the padayatra in accordance with rules and regulations issued by the high court and the DGP. She said the HC granted permission to conduct the maha padayatra with certain conditions. “The organisers submitted a route map along with a list of 157 members who will be participating in the yatra and a list of vehicles that will be part of the procession to the high court based on which the permission was granted. The organisers can’t violate the conditions imposed for the yatra,” said Garg. She said they found several violations when the yatra entered the district at Chinna Nandipadu village. “We have noticed that more than 2,000 people participated in the programme. While permission was granted only for four vehicles, more than 500 vehicles were part of the yatra,” said Garg. The SP said some politicians whose names were not on the list submitted by the organisers to the high court were seen participating and firecrackers were burst in contravention of the conditions. Two cases were registered for violations, she said, adding that all efforts are being made to ensure the padayatra is conducted in a peaceful manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/farmers-cops-collide-over-rally-guidelines/articleshow/87572987.cms||Samdani MN

The announcement comes even as some analysts are unconvinced with the bank’s explanation that a ‘technical glitch’ resulted in 84,000 loans being disbursed. The analysts are awaiting clarifications as many had a positive outlook on the bank. On Friday, The Economic Times reported that, acting as whistle-blowers, senior executives in the bank had alerted the RBI about ever-greening of loans in the bank’s microfinance arm BFIL. On Saturday, the bank issued a statement “strongly denying” any ever-greening of loan accounts. “All the loans originated and managed by BFIL, including during the Covid period which saw the first and second waves ravaging the countryside, are fully compliant with the regulatory guidelines,” the bank had said. However, the bank said that due to a technical glitch in May this year, nearly 84,000 loans were disbursed without the customer consent getting recorded at the time of disbursement. “This issue was highlighted by the field staff within two days and the technical glitch was rectified expeditiously. Out of the above, only 26,073 clients were active with the loan outstanding at Rs 34 crore, which is 0.12% of the September-end portfolio,” the statement said. It added that the standard operating procedure has been revised to make biometric authorisation compulsory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indusind-to-probe-glitch-that-gave-out-84000-loans/articleshow/87573217.cms||---

He plans to buy manufacturing facilities in food staples and expand them — a playbook he followed in the edible oil business, which today commands a dominant share of India’s organised market. Most of the edible oil refineries his JV company Adani Wilmar owns are buyouts and the company already has ideas to beef up its presence in food staples that includes wheat flour, rice, pulses, ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat products. “We intend to spend about Rs 500 crore on acquisitions of production units in food staples to turn the company into a large player in this industry,” said Adani Wilmar CEO Angshu Mallick. An equal joint venture between the Ahmedabad-based billionaire and Singaporean agri-business company Wilmar, the India unit is among the nation’s largest FMCG players with a revenue of Rs 37,115 crore in fiscal 2021. Rivals ITC and Hindustan Unilever clocked revenues of Rs 48,151 crore and Rs 45,311 crore. Edible oils contribute most to Adani Wilmar’s revenue followed by industrial essentials (like castor oil and oleochemicals) and food staples. “Our focus is on food staples for the next five years, driven by the industry’s high growth rates, among other factors,” said Mallick. “Our history suggests that we are good at acquisitions and this will remain our core strategy to expand our food staples’ play.” To fuel growth, Adani Wilmar will be raising capital through the primary market. Of the planned Rs 4,500-crore IPO, Rs 500 crore will be spent on acquisitions in the food staples business, while the rest will be used to retire debt and to expand current capacities. Adani and Wilmar owner Kuok Khoon Hong — the 12th wealthiest person from Singapore — will not sell any stake in the FMCG company’s IPO. While the kitchen staples — including sugar — and industrial essentials businesses are routed through Adani Wilmar, the Singaporean partner also has separate interests in India. Wilmar owns a majority stake in the publicly listed Shree Renuka Sugars. Further, Adani and Wilmar have an understanding that the Indian JV will not have a play in countries where the latter has a direct presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-targets-food-staples-biz-for-expansion/articleshow/87573249.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Kotak, who had six months ago called upon the RBI to expand its balance sheet, said that printing money is only a short-term solution. Hinting at a need for normalisation, Kotak said in a tweet that central banks and sovereigns globally have one medicine for all problems — print money. This distorts value as well as values. “Like climate change, it is the future generation’s problem. We need to solve it, not kick the can. Future is here. Future is now,” said Kotak. In May, Kotak had called for printing of money as relief in the wake of the ferocious second wave of the pandemic. “If not now, then when?,” Kotak had asked. Explaining the change in stance, Kotak said in a subsequent tweet, “Six months back in May was a specific crisis of Covid 2.0, which needed a temporary ‘steroid’. Global policy makers are using the same medicine for ALL situations since 2008. A steroid taken for long is very harmful.” Kotak is the second senior banker to point out how surplus liquidity is distorting values. Last month, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara had warned that there is mispricing of credit risk due to surplus liquidity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/printing-cash-short-term-solution-kotak/articleshow/87573211.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Amid festive cheer, vaccination drive takes a hit; govt looks to ramp up efforts||New Delhi: While the number of containment zones in the capital has gone up by nearly 35% in the last one week and Covid test positivity rate has also slightly increased, there has been a dip in the pace of the vaccination drive. Approximately 60,000 vaccine doses against Covid were administered in Delhi in the last week of October. October 30 saw 79,092 cumulative doses being administered. The number, however, dipped from the next day and November has not seen the figure cross 60,000 and, in fact, the average jabs per day is less than 40,000. While the festive season has seen a huge dip in the number of vaccine doses being administered during the first week of November, the numbers are slowly climbing up with Saturday witnessing 56,916 people getting a jab and around 45,000 vaccine doses being received on Sunday. Although government vaccination centres remain closed on Sundays, this Sunday saw a total 1,361 vaccination sites being operational, including 1,260 government ones. The total number of doses administered in the city now stands at 2,07,37,037 and the number of beneficiaries who have received the second dose and are fully vaccinated is 75,93,143, as per the CoWIN dashboard of the Union ministry of health and family welfare. While nearly 88% of Delhi’s adult population has received at least one dose of vaccine against Covid, the number of people who are fully vaccinated is 50.6% and most of the doses being administered in Delhi now are the second shot. There has been, however, a significant dip in the pace of vaccination in Delhi since the week between September 18 and September 24, which saw nearly 12 lakh cumulative vaccine doses being administered with 1.6 lakh jabs per day on average. While the total number of doses administered dipped slightly to 11.3 lakh during the week between September 25 and October 1, the number tumbled to less than 8 lakh between October 2 and October 8, with 1.1 lakh doses being administered a day on average. This month has seen more than 2.5 lakh doses being administered till Sunday, with the average being 36,532 doses a day. According to sources in the Delhi government, a targeted approach has been implemented to reach out to the remaining eligible beneficiaries who haven’t received a single dose of vaccine, apart from also creating awareness about getting the second dose of vaccine in time. The Delhi government is planning to organise special camps for the more than 18.5 lakh balance eligible beneficiaries, apart from those who have become eligible for a second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-festive-cheer-vax-drive-takes-a-hit-govt-looks-to-ramp-up-efforts/articleshow/87573151.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The three had allegedly reached Singh’s official residence in Madhubani district on Saturday evening and offered him a liquor bottle. They were forwarded to judicial custody on Sunday evening after production before a court at Jhanjharpur. The CO, who was offered liquor bottle by his subordinates, called up SHO of Madhepur police station, Ashok Kumar, and requested him to take action. A police team soon reached the CO’s official residence and arrested the three accused, who were identified as revenue department employees Saket Kumar Singh (26) and Chandrashekhar Yadav (52) and one Lallan Mishra alias Sudarshan Mishra (50). “The three were brought to the police station and then taken to a local hospital for medical test. They were found in an inebriated condition in breathalyser test,” the SHO said. He added the CO has lodged an FIR in connection with the case, alleging that it was Saket who took out a smuggled IMLF bottle from a bag and tried to gift the same to him. “Primary investigations revealed that there was a dispute between the CO and his two arrested subordinates. The two revenue department employees were probably trying to please the CO by offering him the liquor bottle,” the SHO said. He added the police also raided the residences of the three accused after their arrest. “A half-filled liquor bottle was recovered from Yadav’s kitchen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-revenue-dept-staff-among-3-held-for-offering-liquor-to-co/articleshow/87572521.cms||Debashish Karmakar

It was the first hooch tragedy after the implementation of prohibition law in the state on April 5, 2016. Shukla was the only accused who had been evading arrest since the August 16, 2016 incident in which 19 persons had died at Khajurbanni under the Town police station area in Gopalganj district. Nagina Pasi and eight male members of his family were awarded death sentence by a special excise court in Gopalganj on March 5 this year. Four of his female family members were sentenced to life imprisonment in the same case. Shukla was declared an absconder by the court. Shukla was arrested in the heat of 43 reported hooch deaths in Gopalganj, West Champaran and Samastipur since Diwali eve, leading to massive statewide crackdown on liquor smugglers. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said Shukla was arrested from Bangali Pakhri locality under Mahadeva police outpost of Siwan town where he was living on a fake identity and earning livelihood by selling vegetables. He belongs to Jalalpur village under the Jamo police station area in Siwan. Incidentally, hours before Shukla’s arrest, convict Nagina Pasi, who used to receive raw spirits, homeopathic medicines and other chemicals from him for manufacturing hooch at Khajurbanni, died at the Patna Medical College and Hospital where he was undergoing treatment for kidney ailment. “We have received information about Pasi’s death,” the SP said. Gopalganj Town police station SHO Lallan Kumar said Shukla used to smuggle a particular homeopathic medicine and raw spirits from Kolkata and other places and supply it to Pasi for manufacturing hooch at Khujbanni. “Shukla confessed that he started smuggling raw materials for hooch soon after complete prohibition was enforced in the state. He also used to consume hooch at Khurjbanni,” the SHO said. Kumar said Shukla used to mix four litres of water in one litre homeopathic medicine before selling it to Pasi for hooch manufacturing. He had fled to Patna and then to Kerala. He returned to Siwan in February last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/khajurbanni-hooch-case-main-accused-nabbed-after-5-years/articleshow/87572512.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Bareilly||UP: 3 kids of Pilibhit family die in 3 days due to ‘mystery fever’||BAREILLY: Weeks after viral fever resulted in deaths of several children in Uttar Pradesh's Firozabad district, panic gripped a village in Pilibhit as three kids, aged 3, 4 and 5, of a farmer's family died due to a “mysterious fever” within a span of 72 hours. The villagers of Baraatbhoj are in mourning since Thursday evening when Veerpal's younger son, Naresh (3) died of fever. His nephew Govind (4) fell ill, too, and was taken to a private hospital in Bareilly where he died during treatment the next day. On Saturday evening, villagers were in for more shock when Veerpal’s daughter Laxmi (5) suddenly suffered a seizure after drinking milk and died within a few minutes. After the death of the third child in three days, a team of health officials sent Laxmi's body for autopsy. The other two children’s bodies had been cremated soon after death. Speaking to TOI, Pilibhit's chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Seema Agarwal said, “Till now, 151 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported from Pilibhit with one death. Our team visited Baraatbhoj village in Jahanabad area where three children died in 72 hours and they medically examined the family. We also conducted tests of several residents, but no one was diagnosed with dengue or malaria. The autopsy report will make things clear.” Notably, almost all the hospital beds in four districts of Bareilly division are occupied at the moment and most of the patients are suffering from vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Bareilly's CMO Dr Balveer Singh said that 403 cases of dengue and 2,200 cases of malaria have been reported so far in Bareilly district. “Five people also died due to the diseases here. We are now conducting over 200 tests on a daily basis and advising people to maintain cleanliness. Most of the patients in Bareilly hospitals are being referred from neighbouring districts.” Meanwhile, a 14-year-old boy from neighbouring Budaun district succumbed to dengue at a private hospital in Bareilly on Sunday. Firozabad district has been worst-hit by viral fever cases with an official death toll of 75, including 56 children, so far this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-children-of-pilibhit-family-die-in-3-days-due-to-mystery-fever/articleshow/87571993.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Eggs make a comeback riding on protein power||VISAKHAPATNAM: The pandemic has given a boost to consumption of egg in parts of Andhra Pradesh, rising by as much as 15 to 20 per cent in urban areas of the state. Prescribed as a protein-rich food, eggs have become a part of the daily diet in urban areas to build immunity against Covid-19. While the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended consumption of 180 eggs per capita per year, it is around 110 to 120 in urban areas and 60 to 75 in rural pockets of the state. Speaking to TOI, chairman of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC), Visakhapatnam zone, T Uday Bhaskar said with doctors advising higher intake of protein to recover from Covid-19, the demand for eggs has increased in urban areas. “Earlier, the consumption was 90 to 100 eggs per capita per year in urban areas, now it has increased to 110 to 120 eggs. We observed that people want to improve their immune system with protein-rich eggs. The consumption of eggs will further increase in cities in coming years and the poultry sector in the state will grow,” he added. Andhra Pradesh contributes over 19 per cent of egg production in the country and over five crore eggs per day. Poultry businessmen say that despite the high production of eggs in the state, consumption is yet to pick up in semi-urban and rural pockets. The sector has been depending on export of eggs to other states, they added. “Eggs are cheaper at Rs 5 a piece and contain nutrients such as zinc that are essential for the proper functioning of enzymes in the body and keep the immune system strong,” said members of NECC. “Due to some myths, many people consider egg to be a non-vegetarian food and avoid consuming it regularly. We are appealing to parents of children to feed them eggs in some form for good health,” they added. Meanwhile, some consumers prefer eggs laid by country chickens, citing better taste and higher protein content. Though the price of these eggs are higher at Rs 10 each, the demand is greater in the cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/eggs-make-a-comeback-riding-on-protein-power/articleshow/87573078.cms||Nalla.Babu

The price of fine quality tomatoes touched Rs 80 per kilo in local markets on Sunday. Around 80 metric tonnes of tomatoes are imported from Madanapalle region to Rajiv Gandhi wholesale vegetables market in the city on ordinary days. The demand per day rises to around 120 metric tonnes during the wedding season. But traders say they are now receiving only half the quantity they need to meet the demand. Tomato harvesting has been suspended for the last three days in Madanapalle as labourers went back to their native places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to celebrate Diwali. “The sudden shortage of tomatoes resulted in prices skyrocketing. We are buying tomatoes at Rs 58 per kg from the farm. Transportation adds another Rs 8 per kg and we are selling to retailers at Rs 72 per kg. The shortage is likely to continue for one more week as labourers are yet to reach the farm for harvesting,” said B Obulesu, a wholesale trader at Rajiv Gandhi market. Meanwhile, consumers are unhappy with the hike in prices and demanding that rythu bazaar authorities maintain sufficient stocks. “We have removed tomatoes from our wish list. The price of tomatoes at rythu bazaars is fixed at Rs 50 per kg, but the quality is very poor. Many sellers at rythu bazaars divert the stocks to retailers. Stern action should be taken against them,” said Kanuru Sumathi, a homemaker. On the other hand, the price of onion has come down to Rs 32 per kg on Saturday as against Rs 48 per kg on November 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/at-rs-80/kg-tomatoes-pushed-out-of-kitchens/articleshow/87573050.cms||Venu Lanka

The temple officials on Sunday announced a detailed schedule for the fest. Bhavani Deeksha is the second largest festival celebrated at the Kanaka Durga temple after Dasara. Devotees take a 40-day-long Deeksha during which they wear red robes and offer special prayers. Around 6.5 lakh Bhavani devotees relinquished their deeksha at the temple in 2019. This number reduced to 1.4 lakh in 2020 due to Covid-19. Devotees will take Mandala Deeksha (40-day deeksha) at the temple between November 15 and November 19. Devotees can also take Artha Mandala Deeksha (20 days) between December 5 and December 9. The temple management said they will implement similar measures followed during the Dasara celebrations to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They are expecting around 2.5 lakh devotees this year. Addressing the media, temple executive officer D Bramarambha said, “Bhavani Deeksha will be celebrated on a grand note this year following Covid-19 protocols. We have already passed information to the Guru Bhavanis across the country explaining the guidelines. Right from Deeksha Sweekarana to relinquishment, everything will be performed following guidelines. Fifty relinquishment centres will be arranged at the temple to prevent rush and congestion of devotees. Bathing in river ghats is strictly prohibited and 300 showers will be arranged at Seethamma Vari Padalu Ghat.” Altogether 16 lakh laddu prasadams will be made available for devotees, keeping in mind the scarcity of laddus during Dasara, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/durga-temple-readies-for-bhavani-devotees/articleshow/87573029.cms||Venu Lanka

According to the civic body, the integrated command control centre, Uyyakondan riverfront development, smart signage boards and heritage tourism development projects are likely to be commissioned in the next few weeks. “We recently audited the progress of civil work under the smart cities programme and the contractors were told to expedite the remaining work. By June 2022, more projects will be available for public use,” a senior corporation official said. Projects such as Chathiram bus terminus, Commercial complex in Thillai Nagar and 2.4 MW solar power park in Panjapur are yet to be commissioned though 90% of the work was completed months back. Some of the crucial projects such as the multilevel car parking continue to stagger. The truck terminal on East Boulevard Road and Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) park on Flood Bank Road in Srirangam are among the proposals that are progressing steadily. Selected for the smart cities programme as part of developing urban infrastructure in 100 cities across India in June 2017, Trichy has managed to complete only 23 proposals in the past four years. The civic body has shifted the blame on pandemic and other constraints for the delay. “The delay in completing malls and commercial complexes will hinder the commercial growth of the city. Leading retailers and multiplexes looking for commercial space may opt for renting private spaces,” N Manivannan, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-aims-to-complete-14-projects-by-november-end/articleshow/87573581.cms||Deepak Karthik

Providing details about the rescue, Subrahmanya range forest officer (RFO) H T Raghavendra told TOI that the department received information about the leopard on Sunday morning. “We suspect that it fell into the well while attacking a hen, and probably spent the whole night in the well located on the property belonging to Ramanna. The department received information by 11 am and swung into action,’’ he said. He said since the animal was in the water, it was difficult to dart and tranquillise it, and hence a woodden structure tied to a rope was placed inside the well, with food on it, and the moment the leopard sat on it, it was dragged out of the well. It looks healthy and is currently under observation. Based on the direction of the senior officials, it will be released into the wild, the official added. Staff from the Panja, Puttur and Subrahmanya range participated in the operation in the presence of Subrahmanya range ACF Praveen Shetty and Uppinangady range RFO Madhusudhan and Subrahmanya RFO Raghavendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/leopard-rescued-from-well/articleshow/87572545.cms||---

On Diwali (November 4), the AQI had shot up to 327 (‘very poor’) in the city. The AQI in areas surrounding Clock Tower was recorded at 348. According to official data, while pollution levels rose in the low-lying areas of Uttarakhand during Diwali, the hilly areas fared better. Data shared by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB) states that plains like Dehradun, Rishikesh, Haldwani, Kashipur and Rudrapur were among the top five most polluted cities of the state during Diwali period. Dehradun had the worst air quality on Diwali and effects were to be seen even the next day as well. But on Sunday, things improved drastically as AQI levels went below the 170-mark in the city. Similarly, other cities like Haridwar (162) and Kashipur (163) also saw a significant fall in pollution levels. On Sunday, the AQI in Vikasnagar, which is on the outskirts of the city, was 179, the highest in the district. Meanwhile, a few districts like Pithoragarh and Chamoli have maintained their AQIs with figures being recorded at below 150 throughout the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/relief-for-doon-residents-as-aqi-back-to-moderate/articleshow/87572559.cms||Mohammad Anab

Calling themselves Roborex Goa, they were the only team from Goa. It took them over six months to build a robot and to write over 5,000 blocks of codes to solve the problem. The team admitted that the task was very difficult, but completed it successfully. WRO is a global robotic challenge-based competition that helps young people hone their creativity and problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. The theme was ‘Park and Charge’ wherein teams had to build and programme a robot that organises the parking of cars and brings electric or hybrid vehicles a battery to charge. The robot had to pick up vehicles at the entrance of the parking garage and bring them to the correct parking space depending on the type of vehicle and then distribute batteries for charging hybrid and electric vehicles. The team was coached by Arya Khedeker, an IT professional based in Ponda, and the mother of one of the participants. Unlike in metro cities where professional coaching classes are available, the team managed the entire activity of building and programming the robot by themselves. The team has won a number of other competitions, including team and individual awards in Hygiene Mania Coding Contest organised by FIRC (Future Innovators Robotics Competition) and have participated in Quark, a programme organised by BITS Pilani, Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-goan-kids-build-robot-bag-11th-rank-in-national-contest/articleshow/87573981.cms||---

The water level on Saturday was 2,398.70ft. As per the new rule curve for Idukki dam, the red alert level is 2,398.79ft and the upper rule level is 2,399.79ft. The power generation was maximum at Moolamattom power plant as 17.535mu power was generated on Saturday. The storage level at the dam on Sunday was 94.85%. According to a KSEB dam safety official, the lack of rainfall in the catchment area and maximum generation of power led to the decrease in the water level in Idukki reservoir. If the situation remains the same, the water level will decrease further in the coming days, he said. Meanwhile, the water level in Mullaperiyar dam was almost steady at 138.50ft on Sunday. The average inflow to the dam declined to 1,867 cusecs and Tamil Nadu was drawing water at 1,867 cusecs. The maximum water level allowed is 142ft. The upper rule curve in the dam till November 10 has been fixed 139.5ft. Tamil Nadu had on Saturday closed all the spillway shutters after the water inflow to the reservoir decreased. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-level-in-idukki-mullaperiyar-dams-come-down/articleshow/87573161.cms||---

She tested positive for Covid on the day she was admitted and had symptoms for five days. She was reported to have bronchial asthma as a comorbidity. Goa’s active caseload fell to 300 on Sunday after the festive weekend, the lowest count since the beginning of June 2020 as 31 new Covid-19 infections were recorded, and 43 persons recovered. Testing also fell to 2,808 samples. New daily infections have stayed under the 100-mark for 37 days since October 1, while active cases have remained under 500 for the past 13 consecutive days. Five persons were hospitalised and 26 opted for home isolation. The weekly district positivity rate dropped to 1.23% for South Goa and 1.11% for North Goa between October 31 and November 6.

---||Kochi||Tree felling at baby dam: There was no need to give the nod, says expert||IDUKKI: Permission for removing trees from the baby dam area of Mullaperiyar has been Tamil Nadu’s long-pending demand and there was no emergency for permitting it, said an expert. Former Mullaperiyar special cell chairman MK Parameshwaran Nair told TOI that TN was trying to get the permission for removing trees after the 2014 SC verdict. “Over the years, TN sought permission to remove trees from the area. But Kerala refused the repeated requests and raised a new dam issue. The reality is that there was no need to grant permission to remove the trees,” said Nair. “TN water resources minister on Friday said that if they get permission to remove trees from the baby dam area they will strengthen it and move the apex court to raise the water level to 152ft. But they can’t raise the water level without strengthening the main dam. I suspect that they made very calculated moves. They first expect to get permission to strengthen baby dam and later the main dam,” he said. “The tree-felling permission was a major step for the MK Stalin government politically against its opposition parties. But it is a major setback as it will be used against Kerala to create a notion that the state has withdrawn from the demand for a new dam,” said Nair. Kerala forest department granted permission for felling trees after detailed verification in September, said sources. In 2021, Periyar Tiger Reserve deputy director had given a report to chief wildlife warden on permission to cut trees. Later, the chief wildlife warden himself inspected the area in September and gave permission to remove the trees. The permission was granted based on the lease agreement and section 29 of forest protection act, said sources. Residents of Vallakkadavu, the first residential area downstream of Mullaperiyar dam, were upset over the government decision to grant permission for felling trees near the baby dam. Puthenpurakal P N Sebastian, a Vallakkadavu resident, said that without top influence the chief wildlife warden cannot give permission for felling trees. “I have known the chief wildlife warden for the last twenty years and he clearly knows the details of Mullaperiyar dam. I suspect that he granted the permission only after directions from top ministerial levels. The permission shows that the government publicly agreed that the dam is safe and it is ready to strengthen it and raise the water level,” he said. “The government’s decision is a major hit to people living in downstream areas of the dam,” Sebastian added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/there-was-no-need-to-give-the-nod/articleshow/87573170.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Dehradun||As air quality turns 'severe' in Delhi-NCR, many reach U’khand hills for long vacations to avoid pollution||Dehradun/Mussoorie/Nainital/Almora: The rising levels of air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas is forcing residents of the national capital region (NCR) to head to the Uttarakhand hills in the hope that they could breathe fresh air and minimise the risk of respiratory diseases. In the past few days, several towns in the state -- mainly those situated in the hills -- have witnessed a rush of visitors from NCR, say people involved in the hospitality industry. The air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas has turned 'severe' due to the cumulative effect of firecracker emissions and stubble burning. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's 'Sameer' app, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 420, in the "severe" category, at 6 pm on Sunday. In Uttarakhand, the AQI level in Dehradun and Mussoorie hovered around 90, which is considered ‘satisfactory’. Hoteliers in places such as Nainital, Mussoorie, Almora and even in smaller tourist destinations like Bhimtal and Lansdowne say several guests have booked rooms for a week or more. For instance, hoteliers in Mussoorie said a large number of tourists from Delhi had arrived just before Diwali and spent two to four days here. But now, many have extended their stay and are opting for homestays located on the outskirts of the town. “We reached Mussoorie on November 3 and shall leave on Monday. Since the air quality in Delhi turns bad during Diwali period, we came here to breathe some fresh air,” said Aniruddh Kumar, a tourist from Delhi. Ajay Duggal, a resident of Paschim Vihar in Delhi, had reached Dehradun with his family after celebrating Diwali, and now plans to extend his stay for a few more days, till the air quality improves in Delhi. "We bought a house in Dehradun in 2019 and stay here whenever we come to Uttarakhand, either on holidays or at the start of winters when air pollution rises in Delhi. We came for the weekend but are now planning to extend our stay by a few days more," said Duggal. Tourists are also reaching Almora, Ranikhet, Marchula, Bageshwar and Mukteshwar in Nainital district, though their numbers are small. President of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand, Sandeep Sahni, said, "Traditionally, people did not venture out on Diwali, but now we are noticing that the trend is changing. Nowadays, an increasing number of people from Delhi visit Uttarakhand during festivals. An important factor might be the high pollution levels in Delhi during Diwali. This year, too, we are witnessing a spurt in tourists from Delhi in places such as Mussoorie, Nainital, Rishikesh and Ramnagar."

Jaipur Met office stated that in the next couple of days, the mercury will take a dip and cold conditions will aggravate. Chittorgarh remained coldest in the state where a minimum temperature of 10.4°C was reported, the Met reports said on Sunday. Attributing the dip in the mercury to the active northerly winds, Jaipur Met office stated that mercury will further dip in the state especially in the Shekhawati region including Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning with minimum temperature of 17.8°C. In the morning, it was hazy and a rise of almost 1°C in the minimum temperature was witnessed. In the afternoon, a maximum temperature of 31.2°C was recorded. “Jaipur is likely to see its minimum temperatures below 15°C in the next couple of days due to active northerly winds,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Chittorgarh was followed by Sikar where a minimum temperature of 10.5°C was recorded, Udaipur 10.8°C, Churu 10.9°C, Dholpur 13.2°C, Kota 13.6°C, Sawai Madhopur 14.3°C, Ajmer 14.5°C, Sriganganagar and Jodhpur 15°C each, Alwar 15.3°C, Bikaner 15.4°C, Phalodi 17.6°C and Jaisalmer 17.7°C. Jaipur Met office stated that in the next one week shivering cold conditions will further aggravate especially in the Shekhawati region including Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu.

However, so far, the average minimum temperature of above 15°C and above 28°C,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. However, Jaipur Met office in its forecast stated that cold conditions will witness in the state from Tuesday onwards. Also, it would be mainly clear sky with northerly winds on Monday which will guide the mercury to take a dip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/continuous-dip-in-mercury-chittorgarh-coldest-at-10-4c/articleshow/87573169.cms||---
---||Goa||Despite a file tracking software, MMC babus prefer manual method||Margao: As the issue of missing files dominated the proceedings of the recent meeting of the Margao municipal council (MMC), lack of transparency in the affairs of the civic body has come to the fore once again. What’s significant is that while a file tracking software was introduced in the MMC almost a decade ago, civic officials have chucked the digital mode, preferring to use the manual route instead. “The file tracking system and the software are there, but they (officials) aren’t using it,” chief officer of MMC Agnelo Fernandes told TOI when queried over the tracking issue. Fernandes, however, failed to spell out any measures that could help end the malpractice. Engineers of the technical section of MMC had come under heavy fire at the council meeting after a couple of files pertaining to infrastructural development works at Sonsoddo were found to have gone missing from the municipality. While irate councillors had leveled charges of corruption against the technical section, Fernandes and chairperson Lyndon Periera also cast aspersions on the integrity of the team of engineers. Though the issue of missing files has plagued MMC over the past decade and more, attempts by several chief officers of the municipality to switch over to the e-mode of file tracking registry haven’t yielded much success. Sources said that officials largely prefer to manually maintain the records in the file tracking register instead of using the software application. Former MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho, speaking to TOI, said that while deliberate concealment of files (in expectation of palm greasing or other politically motivated reasons) was very much a probability, human error in movement of files leading to files landing on wrong tables or sections was a common occurrence in the MMC. Coutinho strongly pitched for switching over to a paperless digital mode of file transfers to ensure enhanced transparency. “Authorities should work on creating a digital platform where citizens are able to upload their applications and documents, and officials can process them online and forward them for onward approval, thus doing away with physical movement of files. The system should be adopted not just by MMC but by all government offices in the interest of transparency and thereby reining in corruption,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-a-file-tracking-software-mmc-babus-prefer-manual-method/articleshow/87573624.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao goes to war with BJP on fuel prices, farm laws, paddy||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday declared an all-out war against the BJP government at the Centre and the saffron party in the state to protect the interests of farmers and people of Telangana. KCR will lead an all-elected representatives’ delegation to New Delhi and sit on a dharna, demanding procurement of paddy from Telangana, withdrawal of three central farm laws and withdrawal of cess on petrol and diesel. “We will fight against BJP and expose its failures at the national level and in Telangana by holding dharnas on the streets of Delhi and Telangana,” KCR said at a media conference. The Telangana CM said the central government had lied to the people of the country on petrol and diesel prices and was running the show on lies and communal hatred politics and done nothing significant in the last seven years. “The crude oil price was $105 in 2014 and now it is $83. The BJP lied to the public saying that prices of petrol and diesel have increased internationally. The prices never crossed $105 but the BJP government levied cess on petrol and diesel increasing its prices. By increasing the cess, the centre also deprived the state government of its share in taxes,” he said. KCR made it clear that Telangana will not reduce its tax share on fuel as it has not increased a single paisa on VAT on fuel in the last seven years. “We are demanding that the central government withdraw total cess on petrol and diesel. It will allow the government to give petrol at Rs 77 per litre,” KCR said. The CM termed the BJP government as inefficient, anti-farmer and unable to stop China’s transgression into Arunachal Pradesh. KCR accused the BJP government of crushing farmers under the wheels of cars in Lakhimpur Kheri, and mishandling the economy leading to the GDP falling below that of Pakistan and Nepal, even as prices of all essential commodities were sky-rocketing due to rise in fuel prices. “While the central government is saying it will not procure paddy, the BJP state president is instigating farmers to cultivate paddy. We will support farmers in the north agitating for a year now. We will also fight in Parliament and on the streets against BJP,” CM KCR said, adding that the central government announce its policy on paddy procurement. “We are also demanding withdrawal of three controversial central farm laws. We are demanding that the central government refer the crucial issue of river water share of Telangana to the tribunal by stopping its drama of Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards,” he said. Five days after the crucial Huzurabad bypoll result which saw Eatala Rajender of the BJP emerging victorious, KCR also dared the BJP to order an inquiry against him into the allegations of corruption in irrigation projects. “I will not allow the BJP to play with the lives of farmers. As long as I am alive, no one can harm the farmers and interests of Telangana. How dare BJP state president Bandi Sanjay say he will send me to jail. Let them dare touch me and we will show what TRS is capable of. We’re not going to tolerate irresponsible statements from Bandi Sanjay and other BJP leaders anymore,” KCR added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-goes-to-war-with-bjp-onfuel-prices-farm-laws-paddy/articleshow/87573998.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Winged visitors join tourists, as footprints register increase||PANAJI: Winged ‘tourists’ are landing directly along coastal areas of the state. Seemingly undaunted by rainy conditions even at this stage of the year, the birds, some of who are mere passing-through migrants are waiting to recoup their energies before taking off on the long arduous haul to their winter destinations. The destinations as far as the African coast, a non-stop flight for the birds. “These are mostly shore birds and flocks of them have arrived. The European roller, Eurasian cuckoo, osprey, steppe gull and others are here. Amur falcon and Jacobin’s cuckoo are among those which will arrive soon,” said Savio Fonseca, chief naturalist at a company that conducts bird trips for tourists. Mild winter conditions typical in Goa are yet to set in but the arrival of the early birds is timed to perfection and in sync with nature’s cycle. At plateaus where migrant birds halt the grass which was just a feet long earlier, grows quickly to about five feet in 15 days after monsoon. It is breeding season for various species of insects on plateaus. “The caterpillars of moths and butterflies feed on the grass nature has sprouted for them. The birds, in turn, rack up enough proteins for their flight, feeding on these insects,” Fonseca said. Goa’s plateaus, many of them now industrial and institutional hubs, harbour micro habitats with unique floral and faunal biodiversity, though the real estate development lobby usually considers these to be wastelands. A scientist from Indian Institute of Science, Pronoy Baidya said, “Lateritic plateaus are biodiversity refugia hidden within Goa and are of ecological importance. Sadly the majority of development occurs on such plateaus as they are regarded as wastelands. This attitude must change and future development activities must also take biodiversity management into account.” “The plateaus are still greener than usual due to the extended monsoon. Long-billed pipit and other birds have been sighted on some plateaus. Montague’s Harrier was spotted on the Verna plateau. Among shore birds, Eurasian oystercatcher and Pacific golden plovers have been sighted on Agacaim and Morjim beaches,” Mandar Bhagat, birder and co-founder Goa bird conservation network said. Eurasian cuckoo, one of the early migrants has been spotted recently on the biodiversity-rich Socorro plateau, where birders and enthusiasts documented 600 species of birds, amphbians, reptiles, insects and assorted plant life. Breeding in a wide spectrum of habitats across Europe and Asia, the Eurasian cuckoo even leaves the eggs in foster care. “From Goa after about a week’s halt, it flies with the wind blowing from northeast to southwest to Africa – a journey of immense endurance of about eight days non-stop flight,” Fonseca said. The wind direction is another boon for the avian navigators. Jacobin cuckoo – that heralds arrival of monsoon - flies with the southwest monsoon wind from Africa to India. After the monsoon it flies back with the force of reverse wind. The Covid-19 pandemic hit tourism but the winged visitors continued their migration. This winter birders expect the usual avian groups to arrive. “Due to late rainfall the wetlands are still full and various species of ducks which prefer shallow water will arrive in a bit,” Bhagat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/winged-visitors-join-tourists-as-footprints-register-increase/articleshow/87573616.cms||Paul Fernandes

Out of these, 6,595 took their second dose and 965 their first dose. At the last mega vaccination drive on October 31, over 14,000 persons were vaccinated and everyday around 5,000 persons take their first and second jabs. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said there are still over one lakh persons who are due for their second dose, but are not showing up. The response was less than expected on Sunday, he said and attributed it to the festive season. “We have literally gone to the doorsteps of people and we expected more people to come out,” he said. Before the last camp, messages and phone calls went out to hundreds of beneficiaries. However, since Saturday was Bhau Beej, vaccination staff were unable to mobilise beneficiaries. On November 14, too, the health department has planned another mega vaccination camp. The Union health ministry recently asked all states to get its district administration to mobilise people and also rope in influential persons and religious leaders to assist the health department to mobilise people. With just a week to go, the state is highly unlikely to achieve 100% coverage of the second dose to its entire eligible population by the November 15 deadline announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant. Borkar said that currently 110% of Goa’s eligible population has received their first dose while 80.6% have received both doses of the vaccine. As on date, 9.4 lakh people are double vaccinated and just over 3% are partially vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poor-response-to-2nd-mega-vax-camp-due-to-festivities/articleshow/87573994.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Garbage, dogs & pigs spur man-versus-wild at Aarey||MUMBAI: Broken street lights, traffic in Aarey Colony, open defecation in the forest, garbage lying in the open resulting in abundance of dogs and pigs are among the reasons being cited for the growing man-animal conflict and delay in capturing a sub-adult female leopard. Mayur Kamath, honorary wildlife warden, said the leopard did not fall for the bait that had been kept in the cages as it was not “hungry enough”. In nearly eight attacks on humans in more than a month, there was not a single fatality, but Kamath said in future if there is an attack on a human being may not be a minor one. The spotted cat had walked into one of the cages set up by the forest department last Wednesday. Kamath visited Unit No 4 a few days ago where the leopard was trapped in a cage. “The place has a two-storey toilet block which is under lock and key, forcing people to go out in the forest to defecate. In other adivasi hamlets, the toilets are defunct as they are not maintained. The government is now constructing several more 70-seat toilet blocks, but if these are not maintained, the problem of man-animal conflict will persist,” he said. Siraj Usman, a member of Aarey Milk Producers Association, said internal roads in Aarey are not well maintained and in many places street lights do not work. “Walking down these roads without street lights makes one an easy prey for the animal,” he said. The main road in Aarey Colony is packed during peak hours and drivers often take their vehicles on the internal roads. “This would have driven the animal further into the forest to avoid being hit by vehicles and so it possibly managed to stay free,” said Usman. Kamath said that the abundance of prey in Aarey Colony in the form of dogs and pigs could possibly have delayed the leopard from entering the cage. “When there is so much food easily available, why would the cat enter the cage?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-garbage-dogs-pigs-spur-man-versus-wild-at-aarey/articleshow/87573623.cms||---

As per the figures available till October, 46,378 cases were registered for protocol violation in the city and police levied a total fine amount of Rs 4,60,69,500. In two months since July, 1.9 crore was collected as fine for protocol violations. Till August, it was Trivandrum rural which outnumbered other regions across the state in fine collected from Covid protocol violations. Thiruvananthapuram rural had collected a fine amount of Rs 9.04 crores between March 2020 and July 31, 2021. In August and September, the fine recorded an increase of nearly 60 lakhs, taking the cumulative collection to Rs 9.63 crores. In rural limits, 1.4 lakh cases of violations were registered in an year. Ernakulam city which recorded the highest cumulative collection of fine amount in one year in the state recorded an increase of Rs 1 crore between August and October. According to the city police, ruthless slapping of fines has been a major deterrent in dragging down the case graph. “Despite the city having the major chunk of traffic and busy market areas, we have been stringent towards violations and if we look at the entire state scenario, daily case graph of Thiruvananthapuram city would be lower than some of the districts which record proportionately lower number of cases. Heavy fines have been a major deterrent when it comes to bringing down the number of cases,” said Vaibhav Saxena, DCP Law and order. The hefty fines were mostly slapped on violations with regard to social distancing. This often happens with family functions, gatherings organised in various parts of the city where organisers fail to adhere to the stipulated number and end up paying heavy fines. Records show that an amount of Rs 2 crores was collected as fine from merchants across the state. The representatives of merchants association in the district say that for police, slapping fines for violation is more of an exercise to attain targets. “The shocking increase in fines being levied happened during a period when unscientific rules regarding functioning of shops were in effect. Merchants were already reeling from debts and they were then asked to follow illogical time schedules which resulted in crowding in shops. Again police held merchants responsible and we were forced to pay huge amount as fines,” said S S Manoj, state secretary, Vyapari Vyavasaayi Ekopana Samithi. He said that the government has failed to deliver its promise on rehabilitation package and that there should be a system to repay the merchants the fine amount squeezed out from their meagre income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/trivandrum-tops-in-covid-protocol-violation-fine-collection/articleshow/87573202.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Dehradun||Pea farmers at rain-ravaged Adhoda village stare at bleak season||Nainital: Pea growers at Adhoda village, 20 km away from the Himalayan resort town, stare at a bleak season this year, with torrential rainfall adversely impacting the crop plantation, which was to be done in the first week of November. Such was the devastation that the lining of canals that received water from the Chinar river was ripped apart, disrupting water supply to irrigate fields. Villagers said it was on October 18 that their months of hard work was washed away within hours. Pea growers eagerly wait for this time of the year as they are able to reap rich harvest in terms of profit. They say if plantation is not done at the earliest, there can be a minimum loss of Rs 40,000-50,000 or more. Worse, if water is not supplied to fields, farmers fear their land could turn barren. Fifty families that reside in the village work day in and day out to supply produce to Nainital, Kaladhungi and Haldwani vegetable markets, where the price of vegetables is quite high. The situation has come to such a pass that villagers are not sure if they will be able to sell any produce this time. Though they plant other vegetables too, rain has added to the farm distress as they themselves don’t know if they will have anything to eat. Villagers told TOI that assistant engineer, Neha Amreen, had assured them that canals will be repaired soon. She said a road that was under construction under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana had been swept away, causing damage to the canals. In response to a question on the repair work of canals, Amreen said she had not fixed any deadline for the work, adding that most labourers had gone to their native villages to celebrate Diwali. “As soon as the labourers are back, the work will start,” she said. Diwan Singh Mehra, former village head, said if things remained the same, famine-like conditions could arise. A young farmer, Rajendra Garjola, said villagers will have no option but to migrate if timely action is not taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pea-farmers-at-rain-ravaged-adhoda-village-stare-at-bleak-season/articleshow/87572605.cms||---

In a Facebook post made at 8:38am from her profile, Deepa alleged that the minister for higher education R Bindu was in support of sabotaging of the case registered under SC-ST Atrocities Act. “…It was the party that protected (him) till date, including in sabotaging the SC-ST atrocities case. Minister Bindu has been supporting this. There is not much to expect any more from the wife of a state leader of the party. At a situation when a university inquiry report is existing against Nandakumar, he is still being maintained in the Left syndicate, IIUCNN and Left teachers’ association,” the FB post read. The allegation came a day after MG University removed Kalarikkal from the post of the director of the International and Inter University Centre for Nano Science and Nano technology (IIUCNN). However, the researcher was continuing the hunger strike as she was firm on her demand to oust the professor from the centre. Deepa, who has been on an indefinite hunger strike in the varsity for over 10 days, had also alleged that the professor prevented her from doing her research. On Saturday, the vice-chancellor of the university Sabu Thomas had taken charge as the IIUCNN director, and the university was learned to have made the decision based on a directive from the state government. On Saturday, minister for higher education Bindu had reiterated her support to the student. In a Facebook post the minister had said that the VC has taken over the IIUCNN director post and urged Deepa to end the hunger strike and focus on her research as her most important demand was met. The VC had said on Saturday that Kalarikkal had stepped down and that the decision was made after holding talks with Kalarikkal based on a directive from the government. Thomas had said that Kalarikkal was a brilliant faculty member and that he was willing to step down. He had also said that nobody can remove Kalarikkal as a faculty member, adding that he will continue to serve in the centre as well as in the physics department. Kalarikkal had moved court on the allegations against him and the court had quashed all the cases against him, the VC had said, adding that the issue needs to be settled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-minister-protecting-kalarikkal-mgu-researcher/articleshow/87573195.cms||---

He was handed over to his brother by Bongaon police on Sunday. Life had been unkind to the Debnath brothers who lost their parents several years back. The deaths had an immense impact on the mentally challenged younger brother Sachin. Extreme poverty forced the elder brother Prabir to leave school and start working. He learnt how to drive and started driving trucks for a living. Sachin (20), who stayed at their Hili, Dakshin Dinajpur house alone when his brother was away, got onto a train one day. Police spotted him at Bongaon. Figuring out his mental condition, they contacted West Bengal Radio Club for help. “We have a strong network across India and our members have handled such situations earlier. We alerted everyone in our network and shared Sachin’s photograph,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas, founder of the organization. “We got a response from a HAM radio operator at Dakshin Dinajpur. We tracked down his uncle at Hili who said Sachin was missing for the past two months,” said Biswas. The HAM radio operators got the reference of Prabir who was at the Bangladesh border driving a goods truck then. Biswas’ team then tracked down the transport operator who had given the truck to Prabir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rohit-ham/articleshow/87573185.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Mumbai||In 10 months, NCB has frozen 'tainted' assets worth Rs 11.9 crore in 8 cases||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has in the last 10 months frozen assets worth over Rs 11.9 crore in eight cases under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (Safema). These 8 cases are the ones in which the anti-drug agency had earlier arrested 76 people, including actors Rhea Chakraborty, Ejaz Khan and Gaurav Dixit, but no actor's property has been frozen. Among the 8 properties, the NCB has got confirmation in 7 properties from the competent authority. "The properties are frozen in cases where commercial quantities of drugs are seized or the punishment in the case is more than 10 years," said an NCB officer. These "tainted" properties, a portion of which is acquired or generated using the proceeds of crime, are also frozen under the Act. "We had presented the documents of properties to be frozen before the competent authority. He asked for an explanation from both sides within one month. After hearing both sides, the authority confirmed the freezing of properties," said the officer. NCB prize catch: Rs 7 crore assets of former don’s kin in MumbaiIn the last 10 months, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has frozen assets worth over Rs 11.9 crore in eight cases under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (Safema). The maximum property, worth Rs 7.2 crore, was frozen in a case early this year wherein the NCB arrested 10 people, including yesteryear don Karim Lala’s grandson Parvez alias Chinku Pathan and his aide Aarif Bhujwala. The duo was arrested for allegedly manufacturing and selling narcotic drugs. DJ and rapper Rahul Verma and jeweller Vikrant Jain, who allegedly financed the drug syndicate, were also arrested in the case. Bhujwala has been on the run since NCB officials raided his Dongri residence on January 20. The NCB had seized 5.42kg of mephedrone, 990gm methamphetamine, 2gm heroin, 6.1kg ephedrine and 5.6kg clonazepam. They had also found a ‘laboratory’ below Bhujwala’s house with a huge stash of packaging material and other apparatus used to manufacture the contraband, said sources. The income-tax department, Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Mumbai Police are likely to initiate separate proceedings against the Pathan gang. “While the I-T department will probe the seizure of Rs 2 crore from Pathan’s house, ED will look into the money laundering angle and the police will register a case under the Arms Act as two illegal weapons were recovered from Pathan,” an NCB official had said earlier. The frozen properties’ matter is now before the tribunal for attachment. The attachment procedure will be pending before the tribunal till the NDPS court passes judgment. “Once conviction is secured in any case, the frozen properties will be attached. The accused has the option to approach the Bombay high court,” said the officer. If an accused, whose property is to be frozen, is in jail, then his lawyer represents him/her before the competent authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncb-prize-catch-rs-7crore-assets-of-former-dons-kin-in-mumbai/articleshow/87574014.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Goa||Goa recovered only a pittance from CRZ violators as compensation: Green tribunal||Panaji: Based on a status report submitted by Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the tribunal found that the environmental compensation recovered from CRZ violators in Goa so far was a pittance. NGT found the compensation was especially low considering the number of CRZ violations in Goa. GCZMA has told the tribunal that it was in need of experts who can assess and fix compensation for environmental damage caused by violators. This is the reason the recovery is meagre, GCZMA has submitted. “A perusal of the status report dated October 25, 2021, would prima facie disclose that compared to the large volume of violations, recovery of the environmental compensation appears to be pittance, and, according to the counsel appearing for respondent No.1 (GCZMA), for want of experts as to the assessment of the environmental compensation, much headway could not be made in this regard,” NGT has noted. GCZMA has told NGT that it has approached the state government for assistance in providing the experts. It has said that at a meeting earlier this month, GCZMA has also discussed the modalities on how best the recovery can be carried out from violators. “They (GCZMA) in turn approached the state government for rendering necessary and effective assistance and, as and when it is rendered, the problem of assessing and recovery of environmental compensation would be a thing of the past,” the NGT order states. The tribunal was hearing a matter where it was approached by Goa Paryavaran Savrakshan Sangharsh Samitee over CRZ violations in Goa. “The counsel appearing for respondent No.1 would submit that in the 276th GCZMA meeting held on October 21 and 23, modalities have been discussed as to the recovery of the environmental compensation from defaulters/violators for violating the rules and CRZ regulations. It is also pointed out that for assessment of the environmental compensation, a committee comprising expert members also have to be constituted,” NGT noted of the GCZMA’s representation to it. GCZMA, therefore, sought more time from the tribunal to file a further status report. The authority also told NGT that the high court of Bombay has vacated any orders pronounced in view of the pandemic, and therefore now GCZMA can expedite the work of acting against violators. “It is also brought to the knowledge of this tribunal that the blanket interim orders passed by the high court on account of the Covid-19 pandemic has been vacated, and all other efforts would be taken to proceed against the violators,” NGT noted of GCZMA’s submission. The authority has been given time up to December 8 to file a further status report on action taken against violators and environmental compensation recovered for structures that have come up post 1991.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-recovered-only-a-pittance-from-crz-violators-as-compensation-green-tribunal/articleshow/87573655.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Hyderabad||Second dose pain: Only one jab, status fully vaccinated in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Getting the second vaccine shot has turned into a nightmare for some in Telangana after they found out that they were already ‘fully vaccinated’, despite having taken only one jab. This came to light when they turned up at the vaccination centre for a free dose, residents told TOI. “Last week we went to the Mayuri Nagar community hall centre in Begumpet for our second dose. We stood in line for a long time, but when our turn came we were told that we have already been vaccinated. Though we repeatedly told them that we had not taken the second dose, they turned us away without giving us any further information.,” said Lingaya Lakshmi who works as a cook in the area. Her husband, Lingaya Ganpati too was also denied the second shot. “After that we went to at least three other centres, including the one at ESI Hospital, but met with the same fate. Everywhere they said that as per their records (on the CoWin site), we had already received two doses,” Lakshmi said, unsure about what to do next. TOI spoke to some other people from the area who too admitted to facing a similar issue. They said that they are still making the rounds of vaccination centres in hope of a solution. “Since I missed attending the special drive in our basti, I went to the local centre (in Mayuri Nagar) for my second shot. But officials there turned me away saying I was already fully vaccinated,” said Parvathi A, who works as a house help. She added: “I later got to know that there were other people from the locality as well who didn’t get the second dose because of the same reason. Sadly, nobody is able to tell us where to go to register a complaint or whether we will get the second dose at all now.” There are others who received mysterious text messages confirming someone else had taken the second dose using his number. “I got a message saying that some Usharani had received the second dose in a remote district. I hope someone erroneously selected my number. I am going for my second dose soon,” said S Sairam, a resident of Secunderabad. Attributing the issues to a technical glitch on CoWin, state health authorities said that people facing this problem can reach out to them on WhatsApp to get it resolved. “We have received a few such complaints, along with other concerns. Such individuals can reach us on 9154170960 (for all Covid-19 vaccination grievances) and we will ensure that they get the vaccine,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. He said that the state department has now taken the vaccination drive to the doorstep of people to ensure that second doses are not missed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2nd-dose-pain-only-1-jab-status-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/87574015.cms||Amrita Didyala

In an interaction with mediapersons during his visit to the village, where he had come after almost three years, the 79-year-old Koshyari said,"The question of being part of active politics does not arise at this age." However, political observers say that Koshyari’s visit ahead of state assembly elections is significant as the former chief minister still has considerable influence in the region, especially the Kapkot assembly constituency. On Saturday, Koshyari visited the primary school where he once studied and offered prayers at his kuldevi (family goddess) Bhagwati’s temple. Talking about the issues of migration from hills and unemployment, he said they can be resolved if local handicrafts and plantation of Himalayan herbs are encouraged. "In Maharashtra, farmers earn well by patenting the produce unique to the state. The same model can be followed in Uttarakhand as well," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wont-return-to-active-politics-now-maha-guv-koshyari/articleshow/87572623.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik civic admin proposes works worth Rs 7.5cr in govt hospitals||Nashik: The civic administration has proposed fire-extinguisher systems and other works worth Rs 7.5 crore at the Nashik civil hospital and 31 other government hospitals in the district. The proposals for these works have been sent to the state government as well as the district planning committee (DPC) for funds. The proposals gain importance against the backdrop of the fatal ICU fire accident at the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital that claimed the lives of 11 Covid patients. According to Dr Ashok Thorat, the Nashik civil surgeon, fire and electricity audits were performed at various hospitals after the incident at the Sick Newborn Care Unit in the Bhandara Civil Hospital in January this year. “We had received recommendations from the fire department. Proposals related to the same have already been submitted to the state government and the district planning committee. On Saturday, queries related to the same were cleared,” Dr Thoratsaid. Major equipment required at these hospitals include riser — a system of pipes that can carry pressurized water to various floors of a building to help extinguish a blaze. Risers have been proposed at the Nashik Civil Hospital and even rural and sub-district hospitals. “Besides the risers, the fire department has also asked the authorities to install smoke-detecting alarms,” said Sanjay Bairagi, the chief fire officer of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). The civil surgeon said there were some queries raised by the authorities over the proposals, and the same were resolved on Saturday. As far as the NMC hospitals are concerned, medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the systems as per the requirement of the fire-brigade department were installed and updated recently. Electrical audit was also carried out a month ago and all rules were complied with. It may be noted that an incident of oxygen leak had occurred at the Zakir Hussain Hospital on April 21 when the liquid medical oxygen tank was being refilled. That incident had claimed 24 lives. Subsequently, on May 18, there was short-circuit in the bio-medical equipment at the New Bytco Hospital at Nashik Road. “All we can say is that protective measures that were prescribed are now in place,” said Nagargoje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-admin-proposes-works-worth-rs-7-5cr-in-govt-hospitals/articleshow/87572080.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The father refused to keep the child when was woman was in jail due to which he had been staying at the child shelter since September. The six-year-old son of the constable had been kept at the children shelter in Jaipur since his mother’s arrest. The officials had claimed that the boy’s aged maternal grandparents would be unable to take care of him properly and his father was also absent from the child’s life because of which he had been accommodated at the shelter. After getting bail, the constable had sent an application to the child panel asking for her son’s custody. “We called both the parents and handed over the boy to the mother with certain conditions including that a monthly report would be given to us on his well being”, said an official. The purported video showed an RPS officer and the woman constable in a semi-nude condition indulging in sexual activities even as the minor boy was is seen in the same pool. The Special Operations Group (SOG) had registered a case under Pocso based on obscene videos of two cops in the presence of a six-year-old boy in a swimming pool that went viral on social media. According to the report, an unidentified person had sent the copies of two videos in a pen drive via post to the police officials mentioning that as a concerned citizen he was deeply disturbed with the recordings that showed a police official molesting the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/son-handed-over-to-woman-constable-who-is-out-on-bail/articleshow/87573205.cms||---

He was wanted by the NIA (National Investigation Agency) in connection with the Edakkara Maoist case for his alleged participation in the arms training camp conducted by CPI (Maoist) inside Nilambur forests in 2016. Raghavendran was nabbed by Kannur police during a vehicle inspection carried out after receiving intelligence input that a person associated with Left-wing extremist organization was travelling in a jeep in the area. He was later handed over to NIA which recorded his arrest. “Police intercepted a jeep and asked the three passengers about their name and details but they were not willing to share details. When they were taken into custody, one of them shouted Maoist slogans and later the police found that he had two Aadhaar cards with the same photo but different names. Later, we found out that he was wanted in connection with the Edakkara Maoist case,” said Kannur police chief R Ilango. The case related to Maoist arms training camp was originally registered by Edakkara police in Malappuram in 2017 and was handed over to NIA in August 2021. The extremists had allegedly conducted a training camp, including arms training. A flag hoisting was held as part of foundation day of CPI (Maoist) during September 2016 inside Nilambur forest. There were 19 accused in the case registered under various sections of IPC, Arms Act, UAPA and this included Kuppu Devaraj, Velmurugan and Ajitha, who were killed in an encounter with the Thunderbolt squad. Till date, NIA has arrested nine persons in connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/maoist-leader-held-in-kannur/articleshow/87573210.cms||---

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: ICU of Ahmednagar hospitallacked fire safety equipment||Nashik: The Ahmednagar fire brigade in March had carried out a fire audit of the Civil Hospital and suggested the installation of proper fire-fighting equipment on the premises. On Saturday morning, 11 patients, including four women, died when fire broke out following a short-circuit in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital at 10.30 am. The deaths occurred either due to suffocation or from burns. An eight-member committee has been formed to look into the cause of the fire. Shankar Misal, chief fire officer of Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade department, listed the missing fire-safety equipment at the ICU. “It did not have a fire alarm system, which is mandatory. It did not have water sprinklers or a smoke detector. The water pipeline in the ICU too was not up to the mark. Moreover, the fire hydrant was missing,” he told TOI. These critical omissions were not limited to the ICU, but the entire hospital. The ICU, on the ground floor, had been made operational last year after the Covid outbreak. This block was originally constructed to treat women and children. However, following a surge in the number of Covid cases in the district, the administration converted it into a Covid ward. District collector Rajendra Bhosale admitted that there were fire-safety lapses in the ICU. He added that equipment like a fire hydrant and water sprinklers should have been put in place at the time of the unit’s construction. It becomes challenging to take up these additional works once the wards become operational. As of Sunday, there were 25 patients admitted to the general ward of the hospital. Senior officials said the other 20-bed ICU of the hospital is intact and even if more serious patients arrive, they can be shifted to that ICU. However, after Saturday’s fire, there were no new patient admissions in the ICU. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Sunday said that the eight-member committee, headed by divisional commissioner Radhadkrishna Game, has been directed to submit a report within eight days. Anyone found responsible for the fire will not be spared, he said. The committee, comprising fire and health experts, are working to find the cause of the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/maharashtra-icu-of-ahmednagar-hospitallacked-fire-safety-equipment/articleshow/87573657.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Hyderabad||CM trying to fool farmers, says Revanth||Hyderabad: Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy on Sunday said both prime minister Narendra Modi and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao are hand-in-glove in pushing the farmers into distress by stating that paddy will not be procured from the ryots. “KCR is trying to fool the farmers by declaring a war against the BJP government. It is the KCR government which meekly surrendered to the BJP government by giving an undertaking that there is no need to procure paddy. It was CM KCR who supported the centre’s three controversial farm laws,” Revanth said in a sharp response to KCR’s presser on Sunday. The TRS government has given an undertaking to the centre that the state government hereafter will not ask the central government to purchase boiled rice from Telangana. “Who gave KCR the authority to take unilateral decisions on this issue which has a total impact on the lives of farmers? How can he give an undertaking without consulting farmers associations and its leaders?” asked Revanth Revanth alleged that the KCR-government gave the undertaking to save the skin of KCR from CBI and other central investigating agencies' inquiry against him.  “The farmers have been fighting against the Modi-government on Delhi borders for a year now. KCR never extended support to them. In fact, KCR went to Delhi on several occasions to meet PM likeTRS party office foundation stone laying ceremony. But KCR never went to the farmers camp to express solidarity. Today, he is trying to fool the farmers and people of Telangana by declaring a war against the BJP government,” Revanth alleged. The Congress had high hopes that CM KCR would come out with measures to protect the interests of Telangana farmers when he convened a media conference on Sunday. However, the Congress and people of the state are disappointed with KCR repeatedly trying to fool and mislead the people by speaking against the BJP government. Only 2000-odd paddy procurement centres have been set up so far against 6,000-odd announced by the state government. “KCR lied when he said Telangana did not increase VAT on fuel. The TRS government increased it by Rs 2 on an occasion and Rs 2 on another occasion in the past. The Congress-government in Punjab has reduced Rs 10 on per litre of fuel,” Revanth said..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-trying-to-fool-farmers-says-revanth/articleshow/87573671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Deaths of stray dogs due to this virus have been reported from areas like Kovalam while cases are also being reported in areas like Attingal and Pappanamcode. Corporation officials handling stray dog management confirmed that cases of CDV are being widely reported in the city. One dangerous aspect of this disease is the manner in which infected animals continue to shed virus even after recovery in some rare cases. The virus spreads by aerosol transmission. “Stray dogs have the habit of sniffing at the gates of houses and pet dogs usually chase them away and sniff the gates. This would expose the dogs to infection if they are not vaccinated,”,a vet said. Initial symptoms include discharge of pus from eyes and nose and later the dog suffers from uncontrolled muscle jerks which shows that the nervous system has been affected. “It is a very fatal disease and it spreads at a fast rate. Stray dogs are rarely vaccinated and this results in high chances of infection spreading. Once infected, even after recovery, the dog will be a carrier and extreme measures are needed to curb the spread,” said a city based dog lover. The canines in the zoo were administered with a multi component canine distemper vaccine. The authorities are ensuring booster doses to keep the animals safe from viral infection and had managed to obtain ferret distemper vaccine from Etawah lion safari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/deadly-canine-virus-spreads-among-strays/articleshow/87573209.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana facing revenue deficit of Rs 8,000 crore||HYDERABAD: At a time when states are facing pressure to lower value added tax (VAT) on diesel and petrol sales, the Controller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report for Telangana reveals that the government was already facing a revenue deficit of Rs 8,000 crore according to calculations till September. In sharp contrast to budget predictions of a total revenue surplus of Rs 6,743 for the entire fiscal year, CAG now predicts a revenue deficit of up to 119%. The budget estimates (2021-22 financial year) states that the state’s own revenue receipts will be Rs 1.76 lakh crore this fiscal year, with Telangana’s own resources being Rs 1.23 lakh crore. Until September, it was projected that the state would earn Rs 53,000 crore in revenue, but it only received Rs 43,000 crore from its own sources, which is only 30% of the anticipated income.The state has raised loans of Rs 25,573 crore in the first six months of the fiscal year. According to CAG estimates, the state has also earned Rs 12,000 crore through VAT sales. The numbers also reveal that the state’s own tax collection is on course, but the Centre’s grant, the state portion of central taxes, and non-tax revenue forecast have all taken a hit. From the collection of VAT, the state enjoyed a significant income source in the form of Rs 13,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore from excise duty. Stamps and registration revenue was the next largest source of revenue, accounting for Rs 4,000 crore so far. The state government has estimated that it will get Rs 30,000 crore as non-tax revenue in this financial year, but has only earned Rs 4,000 crore until now. The state had anticipated receiving Rs 8,721 crore as its share of taxes from the Centre, but has only received Rs 3,000 crore till September-end. “The income produced from the state’s own sources remains positive. We anticipate that the dent will be reduced after the current fiscal year, but any change in VAT is still a debate,” one top official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-facing-revenue-deficit-of-rs-8000-cr/articleshow/87574017.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||To escape Delhi pollution, people flock to Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE/NAINITAL/ALMORA: The rising levels of air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas is forcing residents of the national capital region (NCR) to head to the Uttarakhand hills in the hope that they could breathe fresh air and minimise the risk of respiratory diseases. In the past few days, several towns in the state -- mainly those situated in the hills -- have witnessed a rush of visitors from NCR, say people involved in the hospitality industry. The air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas has turned 'severe' due to the cumulative effect of firecracker emissions and stubble burning. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's 'Sameer' app, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 420, in the "severe" category, at 6 pm on Sunday. In Uttarakhand, the AQI level in Dehradun and Mussoorie hovered around 90, which is considered ‘satisfactory’. Hoteliers in places such as Nainital, Mussoorie, Almora and even in smaller tourist destinations like Bhimtal and Lansdowne say several guests have booked rooms for a week or more. For instance, hoteliers in Mussoorie said a large number of tourists from Delhi had arrived just before Diwali and spent two to four days here. But now, many have extended their stay and are opting for homestays located on the outskirts of the town. “We reached Mussoorie on November 3 and shall leave on Monday. Since the air quality in Delhi turns bad during Diwali period, we came here to breathe some fresh air,” said Aniruddh Kumar, a tourist from Delhi. Ajay Duggal, a resident of Paschim Vihar in Delhi, had reached Dehradun with his family after celebrating Diwali, and now plans to extend his stay for a few more days, till the air quality improves in Delhi. "We bought a house in Dehradun in 2019 and stay here whenever we come to Uttarakhand, either on holidays or at the start of winters when air pollution rises in Delhi. We came for the weekend but are now planning to extend our stay by a few days more," said Duggal. Tourists are also reaching Almora, Ranikhet, Marchula, Bageshwar and Mukteshwar in Nainital district, though their numbers are small. President of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand, Sandeep Sahni, said, "Traditionally, people did not venture out on Diwali, but now we are noticing that the trend is changing. Nowadays, an increasing number of people from Delhi visit Uttarakhand during festivals. An important factor might be the high pollution levels in Delhi during Diwali. This year, too, we are witnessing a spurt in tourists from Delhi in places such as Mussoorie, Nainital, Rishikesh and Ramnagar."

---||Hyderabad||‘New policy will trigger more encroachments’||Hyderabad: Tiger conservationist Imran Siddique of HyTiCoS (Hyderabad Tiger Conservation Society) has written a letter to CM K Chandrashekar Rao against the granting of rights to tribals under Podu cultivation. Imran cautioned that the government's new policy will encourage a fresh wave of encroachments. "If encroachments are passed as Podu rights, it would trigger fresh encroachments. All such demands are in conflict with the Forest Rights Act 2005 (FRA), Forest Conservation Act and Indian Forest Act," he said. In Telangana, as per the reports, 2.12 lakh claimants sought 7.61 lakh acres of land under FRA, of which about 44% were granted. Forest encroachments estimated at 10.5 lakh acres belonging to about 1.5-2 lakh people accumulated over the past few decades. "The regularisation of encroachment (including podu) is not the first time. Each time such endeavours have only led to more encroachments. If regularization of patta is done, there is a huge threat of losing the gains of haritaharam and future of forests of Telangana," Imran mentioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-policy-will-trigger-more-encroachments/articleshow/87573681.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Ludhiana||F&CC likely to discuss today civic body taking over Glada colonies||Ludhiana: The decision of MC taking over several colonies from Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) will be taken up in front of the finance and contracts committee members and after their approval, it will further go to house meeting for final approval. The officials claimed that the F&CC meeting is likely to take place on Monday where this issue will be discussed. For almost four years, officials were sitting over this proposal to take over 16 colonies and urban schemes which at present are being managed by Glada. The technical teams of MC and Glada conducted a survey in the colonies to check what kind of basic amenities are absent in these colonies. Officials claimed that some street lights, roads, bridges and other works are pending and roughly Rs 21 crore will be spent on the work. As per the agreement, Glada will pay this one time amount to the civic body for carrying out the development works and after that, the MC will handle the routine work. Additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said, “The proposal includes monetary issue so approval from F&CC and gradually from the house is a must. We will take up the proposal in front of authorities for final decision.” The MC will take over areas including Sector 32-A and Sanjay Gandhi colony, central park and green belt EWS pocket and static compactor site 32 sector, sector 33, 100 square yards pocket in sector 38, sector 39-A, commercial pocket in sector 39, sector 40, commercial pocket and parks in phase IV Focal point Dhandhari Kalan, Phase 3 Dugri Road, 200 feet wide byepass Dugri Road, Missing link, Dugri Road, commercial pockets phase 1 and 2 urban estate Dugri, Railway under bridge near Lodhi Club, commercial pocket cana colony site near Nehru Sidhant Kendra, old court site and Old Kotwali site. Rs 77 crores issue to be taken at govt level Apart from this routine development works, the MC had to recover Rs 77 crores from Glada in the form of disposal charges as Glada connected sewerage disposal of its colonies with MC sewer line without paying any money. However, Glada officials took the plea that government waived off those charges but MC officials maintained that these charges will have to be recovered as if Glada had not connected these connections with MC sewer, then it should have arranged for its own sewerage treatment plant and it would have proved a costly affair. Now, this issue will be taken up at government level for settlement. The officials claimed they will ask for funds from Glada. Additional burden on MC In Glada areas, at least 94 parks are there and all these parks will be handed over to MC. Officials claimed that staff is short and it will become an additional burden on them. Similar is the condition with other civic amenities. Officials claimed as soon as the colonies are transferred, they will go to park management committees for maintenance of parks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fcc-likely-to-discuss-today-civic-body-taking-over-glada-colonies/articleshow/87572652.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Liyon Johnson alias Ajith, 29, of Menamkulam, Vijeesh alias Saathi Santhosh, 34, of Kazhakootam and Vishnu, 21, of Parassala. The police said the three men were caught from the Kadakkavoor police station limits on Sunday by a team led by inspector V Ajesh as well as members of rural district anti-narcotic force. The catch was the result of an intense vigil maintained against drug mafia in the wake of school reopening. The police said that Liyon Johnson was a notorious criminal involved in several grave crimes. He was arrested six months ago by Kadinamkulam police with MDMA and crude explosives from his rented house under their limits. He recently got out on bail.

---||Delhi||Husband viewed wife as cash cow, says Delhi HC as it grants divorce to couple||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has granted divorce to a couple on the ground of mental cruelty by the husband, observing that he viewed his wife as a “cash cow” and became interested in her only after she got a job with Delhi Police. A bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi said the husband’s materialistic attitude, without any emotional ties, would have caused mental agony and trauma to the wife, which is sufficient to constitute cruelty to her. The bench, also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh, observed that generally, it is the desire of every married woman to start a family, however, in the present case, the husband appeared to be “not interested in nurturing the marriage but only interested in the wife’s income”. The court set aside a family court’s order which rejected the wife’s divorce plea and dissolved the marriage between the parties under the Hindu Marriage Act. She sought a divorce on the ground that the husband was unemployed, an alcoholic and used to physically abuse her and demand money. In the present case, both the parties belonged to poor background and the marriage was solemnised when the husband and the wife were 19 years old and 13 years old, respectively. Even after attaining the age of majority in 2005, the wife was not taken to the matrimonial home until November 2014, that is, when she secured a job with Delhi Police. “The continued distance between the parties even after the appellant (wife) attained majority would, in itself, have caused trauma and resulted in cruelty to the appellant apart from everything else... (the) circumstance probabalises the stand of the appellant, that the respondent (husband) harassed the appellant to pocket her income, since he was himself unemployed,” the court said. “The respondent, it appears, viewed the appellant as a cash cow and became interested in her only after she got the job with the Delhi Police. Such brazenly materialistic attitude of the respondent, with no emotional ties, would have in itself caused mental agony and trauma to the appellant sufficient to constitute cruelty to her,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/husband-viewed-wife-as-cash-cow-says-hc-as-it-grants-divorce-to-couple/articleshow/87573693.cms||---
---||Kolkata||No fitness certificates to public vehicles without police NOC||Kolkata: The Bengal transport department will not renew certificate of fitness (CF) for any public vehicle, including buses and taxis, without a no-objection certificate from the police. The Kolkata Police urged the state to make the police NoC mandatory to issue CFs after a private bus mowed down a 25-year-old biker on Bagha Jatin RoB on Saturday morning. The transport department has agreed to the proposal. The killer bus, plying on the Garia-Bagbazar route, had about 500 traffic violation cases against it, a fifth of which are pending in courts. “We had proposed that all public vehicles should receive a no-objection certificate from Lalbazar about their pending cases before they receive the CF and pollution certificates from the RTOs. This will stop any vehicle with huge number of pending cases from hitting the roads. Our data indicates that fine amounts close to Rs 16 crore and cases since 2016-17 are pending with transport owners,” said a senior traffic cop. A state official said, “We have received the proposal and agreed to it. The NoC from police will be made mandatory before issuing CF or during their annual renewal.” However, it is still not known from when this norm will be implemented. The death of Subhajit Sur, an engineering graduate, on EM Bypass on Saturday by the bus, which has around 492 traffic cases pending against it in the past five years has raised questions on how the bus managed to ply on the road. As many of 347 of these cases are pending at the lower courts. Sur, the only earning member of the family and a red volunteer, had played a major role in providing relief to the Covid patients in and around Garia earlier this year. On Sunday, more serious allegations surfaced against the bus (WB07J2826) involved in the death of Sur on Saturday. A social media group alleged with photographs that the bus used to ply on the route 203 originally and that during its mandatory fitness test at the RTO, the bus was painted in blue and yellow — that was mandatory for the test — and switched to the other route on Bypass. The fatal squad of traffic police has summoned the owner of the bus. Cops have also proposed joint checks by cops and transport officials to ensure that buses ply as per their permits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-fitness-certificates-to-public-vehicles-without-police-noc/articleshow/87573226.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The number fell below the 7,000-mark per day in the first week of November. It was as low as 2,087 on November 5 and 3,945 on November 6.The health department officials said the testing has decreased because of the festival season and the rough daily target for the district was between 7,000 and 8,000.Meanwhile, tests per million population of Ludhiana were on an average 1,233 per day till the week ending November 5. The figure was 1,217 on October 23 evening; 1,159 on October 2; 1,156 on September 30; 2,158 on August 2; 1,865 on July 30; 2,337 on July 15; and 2,772 on July 8.

Gurdaspur is at the top (2,242), Pathankot second (1,603) and Ropar third (1,364). Moga has the lowest tests per million population at 474.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “Recently, a message was sent to all the senior medical officers (SMOs) to ensure increase in testing, as it has dropped from the pre-Diwali daily figure of 7,000-8,000. We should cross 10,000 daily tests in Ludhiana and increase to 15,000, depending on the positivity rate.”“There have been multiple festivals in the past one month, when people meet each other. As Covid spreads through close contact, the only way of isolating a positive patient is through good sampling. Testing, identification of patients and isolation continues to be our main strategy to check the disease,” he added. “People with symptoms should isolate themselves and go for test so that they don’t infect others,” said IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal.The department officials said, “Daily tests and tests per million are directly related. Lesser number of daily tests results in fall in tests per million.”District vs stateWhile Ludhiana had 1,233 tests per million on November 5 evening, the state had 981.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/festival-season-sees-fall-in-daily-covid-tests-in-district/articleshow/87572656.cms||Shariq Majeed

The city police had taken about 300 beggars in custody, got their verification done and uploaded their pictures on the lost and found portal http://khoyapaya.gov.in/ to help their families trace them. However now, the beggars have returned to the city and can be seen in several markets and at chowks. Majority of them are seen carrying infants and toddlers while begging.Markets like Sarabha Nagar, Malhar Road, Dugri and Jamalpur and chowks, including Bharat Nagar, Dugri, Bhai Bala Chowk, Old City, Chandigarh Road, near Durga Mata Temple are dotted with beggars.The city police had started a drive against beggars in November 2019 when they had arrested a homeless man, Krishan, for kidnapping children and forcing them into rag-picking. The accused had kidnapped two children, aged 10 and 4, from outside their houses by luring them with crackers. Thereafter, he forced them into rag-picking. During the campaign, the cops had taken about 300 beggars into custody, and after their verification, uploaded their pictures on the portal.After seeing their city beggar-free for some time, residents are taken by surprise when mendicants tug at them or knock at their car windows. Pakhowal Road resident Anu Vohra said, “I went to Malhar Road on Saturday and saw many beggars carrying infants in their laps. A woman beggar came near me with a baby and kept saying that her child was unwell and she wanted money. I offered to get medicine for the child, but she refused and asked for money. I really wonder if these are their own kids or if they have kidnapped them for begging.”Lokesh Sharma of Rajguru Nagar said besides the kidnapping fears, beggars don’t make for a pleasant sight in the markets. “The administration should get their verification done and then shift them to shelter homes or help them get some work,” he said.Vivek Kumar, a resident of Old City, said, “A group of beggars sits outside gaushala here. They surround people visiting the cowshed. If we give money to one beggar, others start chasing us.”Joint commissioner of police (city) J Elanchezhian said, “We will be reviving the drive against beggars.

Additional DCP Ram Singh said that the accused was running an illegal refilling plant where he poured cheap liquor into discarded bottles of foreign liquors before pasting new stickers on them. "The accused earned a huge profit by selling these liquor bottles to mafia operating in the city," Singh said. Police said that they have recovered several liquor, packets, bottles and stickers from the accused during the raid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-held-for-selling-desi-liquor-in-branded-bottles/articleshow/87573257.cms||---

The mishap occurred at Chavakkal under Vithura police station limits. Ashiq, 20, son of Kabir and Sheeja of Shafeek Manzil, Attukal near Chullimanoor is the deceased. According to the police the mishap occurred around 2.30 pm. The three friends were trying to cross the tributary of Kallar river at Chavakkal to reach the forest area on the other side by hopping over the rock formations in the river. It is suspected that Ashiq slipped and fell into the river. Though his friends tried to rescue him they failed. His body was recovered an hour later after a search was conducted by locals and fire and rescue services personnel. Ashiq was accompanied by his friends Ahsan and Jassy. They told the police that they suggested to Ashiq that they can cross the river through a shallow portion. But he insisted on crossing the river from that spot itself. Following this, the duo left him there and walked a few meters downstream where the river was comparatively less deep. They sensed danger when they saw Ashiq's footwear floating downstream. They rushed to the previous spot and one of them jumped into the waters, but could not reach Ashiq. The police said the spot where the mishap occurred was not a tourist area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-drowns-trying-to-cross-kallars-tributary/articleshow/87573255.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two snatchers shot in knees, nabbed||New Delhi: Two notorious snatchers were shot in their knees by Dwarka district cops during an exchange of fire on Sunday morning. The accused, Lalit Jain and Mohit Jain, were involved in around 100 cases of street crimes. DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said the two men were brothers and released from jail on October 22 after a year of incarceration. After their release, they went on a crime spree with nine robberies/snatchings within 10 days. “Lalit (54) has 43 cases lodged against him, while Mohit has been booked in 39 cases. They were associated with jailed gangsters Bablu Ghogha and Neeraj Bawania,” he added. The criminals started being tracked during the investigation of a snatching case reported by a woman on October 31. Police teams analysed footage from CCTV cameras, mounted technical surveillance and got information from informers to get details about the suspects. The technical investigation revealed that the criminals had used the snatched mobile phone after changing the SIM card, but their location couldn’t be zeroed in on. Early on Sunday, police received a tip-off that the duo was again in Dwarka for committing another crime. The two men riding on a motorcycle were trapped by a team comprising inspector OP Pawar and others around 8am. When asked to stop for checking, they tried to flee. However, their bike skidded and they fell down. “While trying to escape on foot, they fired upon the police team. The lives of two policemen were saved due to bulletproof jackets. When the cops fired back in retaliation, Lalit got a bullet injury in his left knee and Mohit in his right knee,” said Chaudhary. Two pistols and four live rounds were seized from them. Both were sent to a hospital for treatment and arrested upon discharge. The brothers were drug addicts. They stole bikes and used them for firing upon targets during extortion bids, apart from committing street crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-snatchers-shot-in-knees-nabbed/articleshow/87573711.cms||---

To put an end to such evil practices everyone should be aware of the laws, said senior civil judge and member secretary of District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) CM Pushpalata. Speaking at a legal awareness programme on legal education for women, organised by DLSA in association with women and child welfare department here on Sunday, she said Indian tradition has held women in high esteem but domestic violence continues to exist due to lack of knowledge of tradition and laws. “The clash of interest among family members especially between mother-in-law and her daughter in-law is leading to the rise of old-age homes. Every daughter-in-law should understand that she too will be a mother-in-law in future and will face the same situation. If love and harmony persist in the family, peaceful family life can be achieved,” she said. The existing laws should be used for creating peace and harmony and not for abusing them to keep enmity alive, Pushpalata said. Deputy director of the department of Women and Child Welfare Huligemma Kukanoor asked women to gain legal knowledge to protect themselves from harassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/legal-knowledge-will-help-put-an-end-to-domestic-violence-says-judge/articleshow/87573206.cms||---

The dog was taken to the Belgachhia Veterinary Hospital and later shifted to another veterinary hospital in Mukundapur, where it will undergo a surgery soon. The move followed an initiative by the animal rights organization, People for Animals, that sent a team to Kharagpur to bring the dog to Kolkata for treatment. Kharagpur police said they have started an investigation and detained nine people for questioning in connection with the cruel act. Doctors examined the dog at the Belgachhia hospital and said that it needed a surgery within two days. The surgery will be conducted at the Mukundapur hospital. Other than the dog’s leg, a part of which has been blown off, its tail and cheek have also been seriously injured. The team from Kolkata was joined by the president of People for Animal’s Hooghly branch, Ayushi De. Earlier, the dog had been rescued and treated by a local organization, Street Paws, in Kharagpur. The dog will be sent back to Kharagpur after its recovery, said De.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/injured-dog-brought-to-city-for-surgery/articleshow/87573250.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Ludhiana||Protest at Bharat Nagar Chowk for 2hr, traffic hit||Ludhiana: Vehicular movement was hit in areas adjoining Bharat Nagar Chowk on Sunday afternoon due to a protest by members of a community. The agitators blocked the chowk for two hours, from noon to 2pm, demanding the arrest of Anil Arora, an outfit leader who is wanted by the police for hurting religious sentiments. The agitators reached the spot and blocked the main chowk. Initially, they made a small human chain to block the traffic and thereafter barricades were put up. They burnt the effigy of Anil Arora and the Punjab government. One of the protesters, Bhavandeep Singh, said, “We have been protesting peacefully near Samrala Chowk, demanding the arrest of Anil Arora, but the police have failed to nab him. Therefore, on Sunday we blocked the Bharat Nagar Chowk for two hours.”As Bharat Nagar Chowk is one of the main intersections of the city, connecting several areas like bus stand, Jagraon Bridge, Mall Road, Ferozepur Road and other adjoining places, huge traffic mess was witnessed. Despite the diversions made by the police, the connecting areas faced congestion. Additional deputy commissioner of police-III Sameer Verma said, “The police reached the protest site before the agitation started. Diversions were made near ESI Chowk, Mall Road, Bhai Bala Chowk and Jagraon Bridge to ensure smooth traffic flow. The agitators ended the protest after two hours.” Despite the diversions, Kochar market, Model Gram, Ghumar Mandi, Fountain Chowk, Jagraon Bridge and Sham Nagar witnessed traffic chaos. A resident of Dholewal, Harshdeep Singh, who was stuck in the jam on Jagraon Bridge said, “I was going to DMCH to see my relative who is admitted there. I was unaware of the protest and the blockade. When I got stuck in the traffic jam at the Jagraon Bridge, I came to know of the protest. The administration has provided a designated place to protest, so the roads should not be blocked and inconvenience avoided.” Anil Arora was booked on October 20 for hurting religious sentiments after an alleged audio clip went viral. The police have arrested those who had sheltered him and also announced a Rs 1-lakh reward for information leading to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/protest-at-bharat-nagar-chowk-for-2hr-traffic-hit/articleshow/87572689.cms||---
---||Goa||Quelossim locals, MLA approach NGT over land-filling||Panaji: Quelossim residents and local Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha have approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over the filling of a wetland and khazan land area in their village. The tribunal has been told that the company, which has allegedly carried out the land-filling, has shut down seven sluice gates which led to drying up of the khazan land. It has also been told that the company has failed to execute an order of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), which had asked for the sluice gates to be opened up. “Saldanha submitted that the report given by a GCZMA expert member is very clear and in the said report directions were given to the respondent to open the seven sluice gates as due to the closure of the sluice gates there was a putrification of water. Further, the complainant submitted that they have filed an appeal before the NGT for non-execution of order which is pending for decision,” minutes of the GCZMA meeting stated. In January 2017, the Goa Foundation and Quelossim local Lopinho Xavier complained to the GCZMA that illegal dumping of mud had been carried out by a company in the CRZ area of Quelossim village in two survey numbers. The company was accordingly issued stop work orders and inspection of the site by GCZMA expert members was also carried out. During the site inspection, it was found that the wetland and khazan area had gone completely dry due to the sluice gates having been closed. The alleged violator, however, claimed before the GCZMA expert members that the shut sluice gates could not be opened due to the stop work order of the GCZMA. “The proponent has not bothered to open the sluice gates by taking permission from the GCZMA despite bringing it to the notice in site inspection report that the biodiversity and the environment is degraded due to closing of sluice gates. The drying of the wetland due to stopping of natural water from all sides of the wetland area has spoiled the biodiversity and the environment further,” the GCZMA expert members found. In the meantime, the alleged violator approached the high court and based on the court’s orders the GCZMA had to hold fresh hearings in the matter. The GCZMA, meanwhile, ordered that the sluice gates be opened immediately. Later, the Cortalim MLA also complained before the GCZMA stating that the illegalities were being carried out in Quelossim for the Mini India Park project. The company, however, said that action was being taken by the GCZMA based on hearsay from the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quelossim-locals-mla-approach-ngt-over-land-filling/articleshow/87573729.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Firefighting system of Kandivli high-rise was non-operational||MUMBAI: The fire brigade has said the firefighting system of Hansa Heritage, the Kandivli high-rise where a blaze erupted late on Saturday night, was non-operational. Officials said this led to the rapid spread of fire across two rooms on the 14th and 15th floors of the building. A notice was served to the society on Sunday under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. The blaze comes less than a fortnight of a fire in a 60-floor tower in South Mumbai, in which one was killed; in this case, the building’s fire-fighting system, although operational, did not trigger immediately. Five persons who were rescued from the Kandivli apartment blaze by firefighters on Saturday had locked themselves in a bedroom. Two family members who died could not escape the hall-kitchen. An LPG cylinder in the kitchen exploded in the fire. The four-member Parekh family in whose home the blaze erupted lived on the 14th floor. On Saturday, four relatives were with them when the incident occurred. The two victims were Ranjanben Parekh, 90, who could move only with a walker, and her daughter-in-law Nita, who was paralytic. Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said that a diya was learned to be the cause of the blaze, but it wasn’t confirmed yet. “We have not yet been able to record eyewitness accounts and contrary statements have been made by those who saw the blaze. We will need to investigate further to ascertain the exact cause of the fire. Those trapped in the bedroom were saved in the nick of time. The flames had crossed the door and reached the bed. As the window was open, there was an outlet for smoke.”  This Diwali, the fire brigade received 65 fire calls on account of fire-cracker-related blazes. The total number of calls was 159.  The section under which Hansa Heritage has been served with the notice says that it is the owners or occupiers' liability to provide for fire prevention and life safety measures. “Our teams reached the site and found that systems were non-operational. They tried their best to make use of water from tanks while using fire hoses to extinguish the blaze,” said Parab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-firefighting-system-of-kandivli-high-rise-was-non-operational/articleshow/87573721.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Kolkata||Cops moot FOB extension, fences on Bypass, underpass to curb accidents||Kolkata: To reduce the number of accidents and ensure smooth flow of traffic, cops have proposed several steps to decongest some of the most crowded pedestrian crossings across the city. Most of the proposals by the cops are pertaining to the areas in and around EM Bypass, said sources. The proposals have been forwarded formally to the authorities concerned, including the railways, KMDA and Metro Rail. In the proposals, cops have mooted the idea to decongest the Ultadanga Crossing-Bidhannagar railway station stretch. “Ultadanga Main Road, adjacent to the railway station and Basanti Colony near Ultadanga Underpass, is a highly saturated stretch in terms of both vehicular density and pedestrian movement. Every day a large number of railway commuters from various parts of the city’s adjacent districts, get down at Bidhannagar railway station to take buses or autos from Ultadanga Main Road for their destinations. In addition, a large number of people alight from buses and autos on CIT Road, close to the railway station, for taking trains. The haphazard crossover of people on Ultadanga Main Road near the underpass is the main reason behind traffic disruptions and it also increases the number of accidents,” said an officer. Cops feel that the existing foot over bridge at Ultadanga Crossing needs to be extended till the railway station for the benefit of railway commuters. They have also proposed that two ramps be constructed — one each on the northern and the southern flanks of Ultadanga Main Road. Similar plans have been suggested for the Metropolitan crossing close to Chingrighata crossing, an accident-prone zone. Cops have also proposed that a plot be identified on the service road (opposite Dhapar Math) on the Chingrighata-bound flank to set up an auto stand and stop such slow public transport from crossing over to the station side. The fourth proposal by cops is about building high fences on the Bypass median to stop people from crossing the road. The Ruby Crossing may get an underpass in the future. The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is firming up the proposal to decongest the busiest intersection on EM Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-moot-fob-extension-fences-on-bypass-underpass-to-curb-accidents/articleshow/87573256.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s custody needed to confront him with Sachin Waze: ED||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said the special court erred in holding that it had shown no new grounds for extending the custody of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. It said the new grounds included a confrontation “after re-examination of prime accused Sachin Waze” as well as confrontations with his CA and sons Hrishikesh and Salil. Justice Madhav Jamdar of HC directed Deshmukh’s remand with ED from November 7 till November 12. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Shreeram Shirsat for ED submitted that the judicial custody order was “in the midst of custodial investigation”. Singh said, Deshmukh through his lawyers acceded to ED’s request for extension of his ED custody for custodial investigation for four days. His senior counsel, Vikram Chaudhary, with Aniket Nikam said that though they have a “lot to say on merits of the case and on maintainability of ED’s revision application”, given the instructions from their client (Deshmukh), the PMLA court order may be set aside by consent. ED had on May 11, 2020 lodged an alleged money laundering case against Deshmukh. On November 2 when he appeared before it in response to summons, after HC rejected his petition to quash them, he was arrested. The special PMLA holiday court judge had initially on November 2 granted ED custody of Deshmukh till November 6. At the second remand, the holiday court refused the agency’s extension plea and sent him to judicial custody incorrectly, said the ED. Before HC, the agency said that despite its “fervent request” to extend Deshmukh’s custody, the special judge sent him to custody in jail thus denying it “adequate opportunity of investigation especially in a case like the present one having wide serious ramifications and more so when the investigation is at a crucial stage”. Justice Jamdar in his order said that after going through the PMLA court order and investigation papers, “prima facie there is substance” in contentions raised by ED and its counsel Anil Singh about the legality of the order under challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukhs-custody-needed-to-confront-him-with-waze-ed/articleshow/87574039.cms||---

The magistrate of the court refused his bail plea and questioned the police’s logic behind going soft on him with a bailable IPC section (304A) for the offence. Rajat Subhra Das, the lawyer representing Roy, who owns and runs a pet clinic in south Calcutta, said that the accused had a a “momentary brain fade”, which led to the accident. He had appealed for Roy’s bail before the ACJM Santanu Gangopadhyay while stating the cops themselves had booked him in a bailable section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chingrighata-accident-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/87573261.cms||---

The local body has recently kicked off the mission with a workshop. The awareness programmes and training programmes as part of the cleanliness scheme were organized in association with the Haritha Kerala mission and Suchitwa mission. For the implementation of the cleanliness project an organising committee was formed at the panchayat and ward level. Members of Haritha Karmasena, Kudumbashree Arogya Sena, anganwadi workers, residence associations, library, and youth voluntary organizations are actively participating for the successful implementation of the project. At the workshop organised as part of the cleanliness programme the topic was presented by panchayath secretary Apsara Kumar, assistant secretary Ajay Kumar, village extension officers Binoy Bhuvan and Soumya. Over the next one-year, organic waste will be treated at source by installing compost pits and compost bins in every home. The organisers said that organic vegetable gardens will be set up in all backyards using the manure obtained from processing of waste. As part of the project, the inorganic and plastic wastes collected by Haritha Karma Sena members from each home will be handed over to Clean Kerala Company. The local self-government rural development, Agricultural University Nava Kerala Mission, local government engineering department will supervise and evaluate the programme to ensure its success. The programme was inaugurated by Venganoor panchayat president R S Sreekumar. Vice president Rani Vatsalan presided over the function while health education standing committee chairperson Rema Priya, development standing committee chairman G Surendran, welfare standing committee chairperson Shailaja Kumari and members Ashta Balan, Sunitha Binu also took a session in the workshop. “The workshop helped us in finding innovative solutions in the waste management process. “We are planning to stop the flow of drainage waste into the lake by finding its origin and initiating drainage management,” said R S Sreekumar, Venganoor panchayath president. The panchayat has already initiated a massive campaign to clean Vellayani lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/panchayat-launches-haritha-veed-scheme/articleshow/87573262.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19 positivity rate at 0.11% in Delhi, second highest in four months||NEW DELHI: Delhi saw no fresh Covid death in the last 24 hours even as it recorded 47 new cases from more than 43,000 tests on Sunday, with a positivity rate of 0.11%, the second highest in over four months. It was also the third day in a row that the positivity rate was above 0.10%. The over 43,000 tests included 35,154 RT-PCR tests and 8,183 rapid antigen tests. On Friday, the city had recorded 32 new cases from 22,603 tests with a positivity rate of 0.14%. The test positivity rate was the highest since June 29, when it touched 0.15%. It was also the first time since October 4, when a positivity rate of 0.10% was recorded, that the figure had breached the 0.10% mark. Saturday, too, had seen a test positivity rate of 0.10%, with 36 samples from 34,554 tests returning positive for Covid. A senior Delhi government official said though the situation was not alarming, people should not give up Covid-related safety measures and continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing, apart from getting fully vaccinated. While the test positivity rate has remained consistently around 0.05% to 0.07% for several weeks, the figure has been slowly going up during the festive season. On November 1, Delhi recorded 18 fresh cases of Covid-19 with a test positivity rate of 0.04%, which went up to 0.07% on November 2 and remained 0.08% over the next two days before increasing to 0.14% on November 5. While the test positivity rate of 0.14% was from a comparatively much fewer number of tests, the positivity rate has remained above 0.10% despite the number of tests going up. The number of containment zones in Delhi at the beginning of the month was 86, but has now gone up to 116. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation on Sunday was 161, compared with 142 last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-positivity-rate-at-0-11-second-highest-in-four-months/articleshow/87573263.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Call meet of NCR states to douse farm fires: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Blaming the large number of farm fires in the neighbouring states for dragging the city’s air quality to a critical stage, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai has urged the Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav to call an emergency meeting with the environment ministers of Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan to find a solution to the practice. Rai, in a letter, said that while Delhi had taken measures to control pollution, they “cannot bear fruit till stubble burning in NCR states are stopped”. He called upon Yadav to hold an emergency meeting and devise a mechanism to deal with crop residue burning to “secure the life of citizens of Delhi”. Track the pollution level in your city“Transboundary movement of pollution from stubble burning saw an increase during the last three days… There was also the effect of cracker bursting on Diwali, but it’s waning now. The effect of stubble burning in neighbouring states, however, continues to worsen air quality in Delhi during winters,” said Rai. Citing 21,623 stubble burning incidents recorded through Nasa imagery in Punjab, Haryana and UP between November 1 and 6, the minister said the data showed that pollution levels in Delhi degraded when farm fires increased. “We cannot get rid of pollution in Delhi unless immediate as well as long-term steps are implemented in the neighbouring states to curb stubble burning. It is necessary to immediately hold an emergency meeting of environment ministers of Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan along with Delhi and the Centre to implement solutions to curb this menace. People of Delhi are suffocating on polluted air, thanks to the negligence of the Centre and neighbouring states,” said Rai. The minister pointed out that on November 1 with 2,077 incidents of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP, Delhi’s AQI was 281, while with 3,291 incidents on November 2 the AQI was 303. “The data clearly shows that pollution reaches devastating levels in Delhi as the number of stubble burning incidents rise. The situation becomes aggravated further with pollution generated by firecrackers,” Rai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/call-meet-of-ncr-states-to-douse-farm-fires-rai/articleshow/87573727.cms||---
---||India||Last year’s road accidents were most fatal in 5 years||NEW DELHI: In 2020, every 100 road crashes claimed, on an average, 37 lives as recorded by police across the country, the most in the last five years. Overall road deaths, however, reduced due to the pandemic induced restrictions on vehicle movement for months. A comparative analysis of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2017 to 2020 shows that the number of lives lost per 100 road crashes was 35 in 2019, 34 in 2018 and 32 in 2017. This is also defined as “severity of accidents” and an indicator of how safe or unsafe roads are. According to the latest report on accidental deaths published by NCRB for 2020, the overall road fatalities reduced by nearly 14%, from about 1.5 lakh in 2019 to 1.3 lakh during last year, primarily on account of restrictions due to Covid-19. But indicators such as severity of crashes and increased share of two-wheeler occupants’ deaths in total fatalities — from 36% in 2019 to 43.6% in 2020 — emerged as issues of concern. “The NCRB report also shows how the number of road crashes increased as restrictions on vehicle movement were lifted during the second half of 2020. This could be due to increased number of vehicles and also signs of systemic problems such as traffic engineering and faulty road designs that we need to fix rather than simply putting all the blame on road users,” said Rohit Baluja, a road safety expert and president of the College of Traffic Management. In fact, the data shows that the number of road crashes in 2020 recorded by police departments touched the lowest ever in April at 8,350 and remained less than the figures of 2019 till October. The traffic crashes spiked in November and December. In November last year, the number of registered road crashes was 36,607 compared to 36,131 in 2019 and in December 2020, these increased to 38,128 compared to 36,394 a year back. The NCRB does not publish the month-wise fatalities, unlike the ‘Road Accidents in India’ report that the road transport ministry publishes annually. The ministry has not yet published the report of 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/last-years-road-accidents-were-most-fatal-in-5-years/articleshow/87574502.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Mumbai||More than 50 lives lost in fires at Maharashtra Covid hospitals||MUMBAI: At least 51 lives have been lost to hospital fires in Maharashtra in the past 14-15 months, putting the spotlight on how both public and private facilities have failed miserably to prevent such incidents. Majority of these fires were in Covid-19 hospitals, where the patients were either strapped to oxygen or life-support, which hindered their chances of escaping or being rescued promptly.  Fire experts have pointed out that Covid wards and ICUs could become tinder boxes with alcohol from sanitizers lingering in the air. Rich oxygen supply for patients can be the perfect fuel, should there be even a minor leak in the pipeline or cylinders. Above all, the absence of firefighting tools, along with the lack of stringent audits at hospitals, is proving to be a lethal combination for patients.  The year started with a devastating fire at the Bhandara District Hospital that led to the death of ten infants. It was followed by multiple incidents in Mumbai. The November 6 fire at Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, which claimed the lives of 11 Covid patients, had broken in the ICU. Preliminary investigation has found that the fire-fighting equipment was inadequate.  Ex-chief fire officer Pratap Khargopikar said that prevention is key. For that, hospitals must have good fire detection systems, such as alarms. “Whether it is a temporary or permanent structure, all must have a good detection system as it allows people time to escape,” he said. Next would be to have a very competent fire-fighting system.  Fire expert Nilesh Ukunde had previously told TOI that in case of an electrical failure caused due to overuse of machines the heat mixed with the cloud of alcohol expands and a pressure wave is generated. This can cause an explosion and a phenomenon called flashover may engulf beds and curtains. Khargopikar said that hospitals must start investing in fire retardant paints, curtains and bedsheets. “It’s also important to keep checking wards and ICUs for any oxygen leak,” he said. A senior fire official from Mumbai said that most Covid care centres were erected as field hospitals in a pandemic situation. “The fire fighting systems were probably not given as much importance. However, even if they were unable to stick to the National Building Code of India (NBC) guidelines, they should set up sprinklers, fire alarms where possible, or station portable water pumps,” he said, adding that the staff must be trained to use the systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-than-50-lives-lost-in-fires-at-covid-hospitals/articleshow/87573738.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Several parents TOI spoke to cited various reasons behind their decision — from the belief that young children have a low risk of catching severe Covid, lack of research data available in the public domain on vaccine trials to small trial sizes. In August, the Indian drug regulator granted an emergency approval use to Zydus Cadila’s vaccine for children above 12 years. However, it is yet to become part of the vaccination programme. In the US, Food and Drug Administration has approved vaccination for children in the age group of 5-11 years. Tanya Aggarwal, a lawyer and a parent of a Class I child, said, “Many doctors have said that unlike adults, young children have a low risk of severe Covid. Given this risk profile, small trial sizes and lack of long-term safety data, it’s difficult to definitively say yes to Covid-19 vaccines for children.” Another parent, Mohit Goel, who has two children — one in Class X and the other in nursery, attributed his reluctance to lack of “reliable research data”. “I will prefer not to vaccinate them now as reliable research data is not available about the efficiency of vaccine and its side-effects in the long run. Overall, two waves have passed, and children have shown considerable immunity against the virus with negligible cases,” added Goel. Satya Prakash, who lives in Rohini, however, will go for it if sufficient data is made available in the public domain. Prakash, who is also the president of Delhi Parents’ Association, said, “Let the government publish the raw research data, observation and findings. Let me be assured that the finding is compatible and safe for my children, then I am willing.” Ravi Khatri, another parent, is also willing to vaccinate his children as he felt most people had taken a calculated risk and gone for the vaccine. “As far as the side-effects are concerned, this was also the case in adults’ vaccination. I am willing to take the calculated risk of side-effects,” he added. Even Sumit Kumar, a parent of two daughter studying at schools in Vasant Kunj, favoured it. “All of us got vaccinated, so why should we risk our children’s life! Once they get vaccinated, we can send them to school without any fear,” he pointed out. Another parent, who did not want to be named, however, would wait like many others. “Still studies are going on regarding the kids’ vaccination and children have better immunity as compared to adults. I will wait for some more time before I get my children vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-parents-in-city-are-in-two-minds-about-getting-their-kids-vaccinated-against-covid/articleshow/87573284.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Scientists played a major role in freedom struggle’||Thiruvananthapuram: Vijnana Bharati National organizing secretary Jayant Sahasrabudhe, who was delivering the Sir C V Raman lecture here on Sunday, emphasised the need for the country to thoroughly acknowledge the role of scientists who worked against the odds imposed during the two centuries of English rule that focused on de-nationalising India more than colonizing it. While delivering the lecture at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the city, he said that history has largely neglected the contributions of scientists towards the freedom struggle since the 1757 Battle of Plassey that gave the British a decisive victory. “As much as seekers of knowledge and truth, those scientists strived to regain the identity of India from the hands of the invaders,” Sahasrabudhe noted in his speech on ‘freedom struggle and science’ organized on the occasion of the 133rd birthday of legendary physicist Dr C V Raman. He quoted how the patriotic fervour exhibited by several scientists in imperial India added to the spirit of the nationalist movement. For instance, the British regime refused botanist Jagadish Chandra Bose a teaching job in Presidency College of Calcutta in 1884 after graduating from the University of Cambridge in UK, prompting the youngster to go on a protest spanning three years. Succumbing to pressure, the administration eventually absorbed Bose as a faculty in 1887, abolishing a two-tier pay-scale for higher-education teachers based on their nativity. “I would say this was the first case of a ‘Satyagraha’, which happened three decades before Mahatma Gandhi resorted to it .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/scientists-played-a-major-role-in-freedom-struggle/articleshow/87573272.cms||---

Arun of Nallakad near Venjaramoodu is the accused. The police said that Arun was an accused in a case related to theft of two motorcycles registered by Kazhakootam police in April. They traced the stolen vehicles near Kilimanoor and soon tracked down the accused. They managed to catch Arun and his accomplice. But, Arun pushed away the officers while entering the police vehicle and fled. The police had been on the lookout for him ever since. On Saturday, the Venjaramoodu police caught him based on a tip off received regarding his whereabouts. He was charged with relevant sections for causing hurt to a public servant and resistance or obstruction of duty of a government servant.

---||Delhi||Chadha: Treatment plants back at full capacity, water supply to improve||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board’s vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Sunday said that south, east and northeast Delhi areas, which have been facing reduced water supply, wouldn’t face a problem anymore as water treatment plants (WTP) functioning at 50% capacity due to increased ammonia levels are now operating at full capacity. On Sunday, Chadha took to social media and said that ammonia levels in river Yamuna had increased up to 3 ppm (parts per million) near Wazirabad due to heavy sewage and industrial waste discharged by Haryana. He tweeted that this has affected water production in Sonia Vihar, Bhagirathi, Chadrawal, Okhla and Wazirabad WTPs. Usually, WTPs can function with ammonia levels of up to 1 PPM. Chadha further added that during the Dussehra and Diwali period, the Ganga canal, which supplies Ganga water to Delhi, gets shut for annual maintenance. As a result, the production in Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi WTPs, which too get their raw water supply from Yamuna, gets reduced by 50% during this period, he said. Chadha alleged that WTPs are not operating at optimum level due to pollutants discharged in Yamuna by Haryana. “To control the increased water pollution, DJB’s water quality management team has increased coagulants and disinfectants dosing in raw Yamuna water to maintain the water quality as per production norms,” he wrote. “We are working closely with Haryana to address the issue of ammonia in Yamuna,” he added. To meet with the reduced water supply in the affected areas of south, east and northeast Delhi, DJB had deployed an adequate number of water tankers. “I would like to thank the affected residents for their co-operation and assure them that our team of officers and engineers are working day and night to ensure Delhi residents’ water woes stay at a minimum,” he said. Speaking about the status of the WTPs, Chadha said that though production at WTPs had reduced to 50% capacity due to ammonia and pollution, efforts made by DJB engineers and officers have helped reduce the ammonia level and water production capacity now stands at 100%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-treatment-plants-back-at-full-capacity-water-supply-to-improve/articleshow/87573287.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Joshi, who distributed letters of possession to 786 Hubballi-Dharwad Urban Development Authority (HDUDA), said, “HDUDA is carrying out the entire process of handing over sites to eligible beneficiaries in a transparent manner.” On the proposed construction of a flyover at Rani Channamma Circle, which has triggered a controversy, Joshi said, “This is not a political issue, but a project aimed at ensuring smooth flow of traffic at the busy junction. We have invited objections from the public, and even constituted a committee comprising engineers from the Indian Institute of Technology, BVB College of Engineering and other prestigious institutions. This committee will submit its report, after carefully weighing the pros and cons of the proposed project.” Dharwad district in-charge minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, also present on the occasion, pointed to the various development projects currently under way in the twin cities. Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar, meanwhile, suggested that HDUDA officials must consider naming the new layout after PM Narendra Modi. MLA Arvind Bellad and MLC Pradeep Shettar were among those present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cities-must-align-with-pm-modis-vision-of-india-says-joshi/articleshow/87573251.cms||---

The Kerala government froze the principal chief forest conservator’s order and clarified that it was issued at the bureaucratic level without obtaining the consent of the ministers concerned or the chief minister and action would be taken against the officials responsible. Reacting to the development, Tamil Nadu minister for water resources, irrigation, minerals and mines S Duraimurugan questioned the Kerala government’s stand that its ministers and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan were kept in the dark regarding the issue. “It is hard to believe that the principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Kerala, could pass such an order (permitting the felling of 15 trees by Tamil Nadu) without the knowledge of the concerned ministers,” Durai Murugan told TOI. “What kind of administration is that,” he wondered.“In the order, the principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Kerala, has not only permitted Tamil Nadu to fell 15 trees, he has also attached a list of trees marked for felling and even named them. How can such a detailed order be issued, without the consent of the concerned ministers?” asked Durai Murugan while attributing the sudden change in the Kerala stand to pressure from the opposition parties.A report submitted by the forest department to Kerala forest minister A K Saseendran, however, said the sanction was given based on decisions taken at a meeting convened by the additional chief secretary (water resources) on November 1. Saseendran, who had a discussion with Kerala CM on Sunday, urged the forest secretary to freeze the sanction given to cut the trees and informed Tamil Nadu authorities about it through a fresh order, even as opposition parties blamed the LDF government for hiding facts. “The development came to the notice of my office when the statement from the Tamil Nadu chief minister (M K Stalin) came. From discussions, I have come to understand that neither the chief minister nor the water resources minister was informed about this crucial decision. Action would be taken against officials responsible,” Saseendran said. On Saturday, Stalin wrote to Pinarayi Vijayan and thanked him for the permission to Tamil Nadu for felling 15 trees to strengthen the Baby dam. The content of the “order”, by the principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Kerala was conveyed by A P Sunil Babu, deputy director (Project Tiger), Thekkady to J Sam Erwin, executive engineer, WRD, Periyar Dam Special Division, Cumbum on November 6, 2021, in a letter, a copy of which is with TOI. The order recalls the request from executive engineer, WRD, Cumbum in Tamil Nadu for felling 23 trees over an extent of 0.25 hectares as part of the process of strengthening the Baby dam. It also cited the recommendation of deputy director, Periyar Tiger Reserve East Division recommending removal of 15 trees within an approximate area of 40 cents. Passing the order, Bennichan Thomas, principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Kerala ordered the deputy director, Periyar Tiger Reserve, East Division to receive the “timber and firewood” from the dam authorities and use it for formation of brushwood gully plugging / brushwood check dam at suitable nearby locations, outside the leased area. The trees identified for felling include Unnam (3 nos), Kattu Rubber (2), Porivetti (3), Mulakunari (2) and , Vazhana (2), besides one number each of Thanni Poomaram, Naikumbill and Njaval.

On the other day Sulfi had handed over Rs 2.40 lakh to double the money. When he reached the lodge they gave him some bundles of currencies telling him that it was worth Rs 4.80 lakh. When Sulfi examined the bundles he found that it was a mix of genuine notes and plain papers. They followed the gang's vehicle and stopped them at Kaippallimukku. As they clashed over, local people alerted the police. They took the TN natives and their car into custody and also seized Rs 6.45 lakh worth currency notes from their car.

---||Mumbai||Vaccine wastage up in some districts; Maharashtra's average under 1%||MUMBAI: The shortage of auto-disable syringes has “marginally” pushed up vaccine wastage rates in several districts in the last two months. Even if the state’s cumulative wastage rate continues to be under 1%, a handful of districts have reported wastage in the range of 3% to 12%. The rates are higher for Covaxin compared to Covishield.According to the last available data, India’s vaccine wastage rate was 6.3% in June. Recent numbers compiled by the state government showed that the state’s wastage rate for Covaxin was 0.72%, while that for Covishield was negative (-1.09%). However, at least a dozen districts have a higher wastage rate than the state average for Covaxin. Among them, Nandurbar touched a staggering 12% this month. In 14 districts, including Mumbai, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Jalgaon, the Covaxin wastage is negative.  Raigad saw a Covishield wastage rate of (2. 7%) and Yavatmal (2.6%). In nine other districts, it has remained between 1-2%, while in a dozen districts, the wastage is less than 1%. Mumbai, Palghar Ratnagiri are some of the districts that have a negative wastage rate (see box) for Covishield. A senior state official said the shortage in the supply of 0.5ml syringes was responsible for the increase in the wastage rate. “We have been receiving 1ml and 2ml syringes in place of 0.5ml, which doesn’t allow the same level of precision,” the official said. A Covishield vial, the official said, usually contains an additional dose which is given to make up for any spillage or misdraw. “Vaccinators were easily able to draw the eleventh dose and administer it as well, which is not happening at the same rate now,” the official said, adding that the supply of 0.5ml syringes has been streamlined to some extent now. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health for Pune circle, said syringe shortage was the primary reason for a jump in wastage rates. “A 10ml covaxin vial sometimes has 9.9ml. Without a 0.5ml syringe, it is challenging to extract ten doses,” he said. Another factor for the increased wastage, he said, was that the drive has been highly decentralised now. “It is carried out in multiple centres and taken almost door-to-door,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-wastage-up-in-some-dists-state-avg-under-1/articleshow/87573773.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Petrol price gap between Rajasthan and other states over Rs 15 per litre||JAIPUR: The petrol price difference between Rajasthan and other states has gone up by over Rs 15 a litre. Despite the difficulties faced by the people, the state government is unwilling to reduce VAT on auto fuels. After the Centre reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively, nearly two dozen states have brought down rates but the state government is urging the Centre to reduce rates further without bringing down its VAT, which is the highest in the country. In fact, the chief minister on Sunday wrote a letter to home minister Amit Shah to further bring down the excise duty on auto fuels. Sunit Bagai, the president of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association, asked, “Why is the state government not bringing down rates to give relief to its people. Most states are reducing rates pushing the price difference with us to over Rs 15 a litre.” According to industry sources, the demand for auto fuels has fallen by 20-25% in the state because vehicles entering Rajasthan skip refilling here. “Vehicles coming to Rajasthan or passing through it avoid refuelling in the state because of the high rates. The state government is not only losing business to other states but making its people suffer,” said a source. A senior official in the commercial taxes said the state government thinks that since Rajasthan is a big state geographically and that at some point vehicles passing through the state would have to refill here. “That is the reason why the government thinks that the fuel offtake will not get affected because of high rates,” he said.While the industry people say that the government could earn the same revenue by reducing rates from the resultant increase in sale of auto fuels, the government has not bought the logic, so far. In his letter, the chief minister said, “Since 2014, the Centre has increased the special excise duty and additional excise duty on petrol from Rs 6 to 11 and Rs 2 to Rs 18, respectively. Similarly, the special excise duty and additional excise duty on diesel has been hiked from zero to Rs 8 and Rs 2 to Rs 18.” Petrol and diesel attract 36% and 26% VAT in Rajasthan, which is the highest in the country. The main reason why the people in the state are paying the highest auto fuel rates. Bagai said that besides common folk, the industries are also worst hit by the high auto fuel rates. He said if the rates are not brought down, investors would not come to the state. “Besides high fuel prices, the state also charges the highest rates for electricity. In this circumstance, it would be difficult for companies to remain competitive. They will look for states where the cost of doing business is lower, not Rajasthan,” added Bagai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-price-gap-between-raj-and-other-states-over-rs-15/l/articleshow/87573771.cms||---

Senior inspector Manohar Awhad at the Kalwa police station said the incident occurred around 5.30am when the tempo carrying poultry was on its way to Mumbai from Nashik. The driver, Salman Khan (34), allegedly failed to notice the container parked midway on the Thane-bound lane and rammed into it before he could apply the brakes. The impact of the collision was such that the driver’s cabin was mangled trapping Khan and his assistant Feroz Khan inside. The duo succumbed to their injuries before they could be rescued. The mishap led to a traffic jam on the stretch which was cleared nearly two hours later, police informed. “Prima facie, it seems the container driver was at fault as he parked the vehicle on the highway without switching on the indicators. The container driver fled after the mishap. We have registered a case against him for the deaths,” said Awhad. In another incident, reported around 2am on Sunday, a food delivery boy identified as Shivraj Rathod (34) was riding a bike and was on his way home when he was hit by an unidentified vehicle near the Patlipada bridge. “The vehicle sped off while injured Rathod, who suffered major injuries to his limbs, was rushed to a private hospital,” informed rescue officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tempo-rams-into-parked-vehicle-driver-helper-crushed-to-death/articleshow/87574061.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Delhi||Delhi: While Covid-19 loosens grip, economic offences spike||NEW DELHI: Cases of economic offences and arrests increased in the city this year compared with 2020. Investigators claimed that when the pandemic was at its peak, fewer economic offences were reported. Data accessed by TOI revealed that from January to August this year, 143 cases were registered with Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police. About 130 cases were solved and 175 people involved in white-collar crimes were nabbed. During the same period last year, 118 cases were reported of which 105 were solved and 92 people arrested. People absconding in cases reported in the past years were also arrested this year. “We focused on breaking the chain of fraudsters by arresting all members involved in such cases,” said an officer. The data showed an increase in realtor-related fraud cases. In the current year, 52 such cases were reported, while there were 31 cases last year. “The builders launched different projects for sale of plots and flats. They convinced investors showing a rosy picture about the projects and later duped them of their money,” the officer said. Special Commissioner (Crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastava said, “A person investing money should be prudent. He should check all credentials of a company, firm and project where he is investing to avoid getting duped.” Meanwhile, 33 cases of fraud related to Ponzi schemes, property mortgage, banks, non-banking financial institutions (NBFC), share market, payment, forged documents and CBT were reported this year. Last year, 35 such cases were reported. During the pandemic, there was an increase in cases of Ponzi schemes, share market and NBFCs. “People were not able to go for holidays, buy new property or things, so they had cash. Fraudsters lured them to invest in Ponzi schemes and the share market and duped them. We also probed several cases of Demat account fraud,” said the officer. Srivastava said they had taken several steps to raise awareness among people. “We have been using educational videos in which our policemen create awareness among people on various kinds of frauds,” he added. Around nine cases of fake DDA land pooling policy cases were reported this year, whereas it was only six till August 2020. This year, there was a decrease in business-related fraud as 14 cases were reported. In 2020, 17 such cases were registered. Police registered 35 cases of cheating related to misappropriation, property, personal dispute, job rackets and other frauds this year. Last year, 29 such cases were lodged with EOW. Additional Commissioner (EOW) RK Singh said before investing money, people should check on the RBI and SEBI websites whether the person and firm had a licence or was authorised to run the scheme. “People should avoid schemes that promise high returns within a short period,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/while-covid-loosens-grip-economic-offences-spike/articleshow/87573291.cms||Abhay Singh

The major objective of the study is to prepare a detailed project report with designs and estimates to link these sewers to the nearby sewage treatment plants or the proposed plants as part of the study. A suitable site near the STP will be identified for construction of pump houses and for possible route alignment of transmission mains to divert the dry weather flow. The study will also look into the possibility of recycling and supplying the treated water to the industries. Based on the projected recycled water requirement of different industries at various tapping points belonging to the GVMC, the designs for the alignment of pipelines will be prepared. The project will also identify Industries, who are willing to take the treated water in the project area and also assess their demand. Despite Vizag city emerging as a noted tourism destination, wastewater from several sewers on the beach road is directly being discharged into the sea. This continues to be the dark underbelly of the city. The untreated dry weather flow from about 10 to 15 sources is entering the sea in areas like RK beach, Jalaripeta, Appughar, Sagar Nagar, and Rushikonda. These areas in fact experience a huge tourist inflow, particularly during the peak tourism season. Meanwhile, the GVMC is working on upgrading two sewage treatment plants, one located near Appu Ghar and the other one at Lakshmi Talkies with about Rs 50 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gvmc-soon-to-launch-study-to-divert-sewers-save-sea/articleshow/87572765.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Nagpur division, having a higher target than Amravati, has relatively lower backlog of 17 lakh. It needs to jab 32,000 per day to complete the remaining 19% targeted beneficiaries with first dose by November 30 deadline. Over 75% of unvaccinated population is from Amravati, Yavatmal and Buldhana. All districts in Amravati division, including Akola and Washim, have nearly 40% to 45% eligible beneficiaries yet to take their first dose. The division’s overall backlog is at 44%, nearly double Nagpur’s. Amravati, Akola and Buldhana are among the five poor performers out of 36 districts in the state. Over 10 lakh are yet to receive their first dose in Amravati. Over 6.6 lakh unvaccinated beneficiaires — the highest in terms of percentage at 46% in Vidarbha — belong to Akola. Amravati had been the epicentre of the second wave. Alleged official apathy lead to the rapid spread of Covid-19 from February onwards in the division. The administration once again seems to have been caught napping as it failed to convince people about vaccination. Deputy director of health services (Akola circle) Dr Rajkumar Chauhan did not answer any query on these issues. Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh told TOI that they have charted an extensive social outreach initiative to increase vaccination coverage from November 10. Singh said, “We plan to complete first dose by November 30. Teams have been deputed in every taluka in election-like mode. Anganwadi and Asha workers would be tracked to monitor their reach house-wise. School children would be involved in motivating families to take vaccination. It would be a homework activity in all ZP schools. We will involve Covid survivors as ambassadors to motivate people to take the jab. Muslim community will be targeted by calling meetings of maulavis at district level.” He claimed Washim district’s first dose is 61% complete and second dose is 35%. As per Cowin system, the district had just over 39% first dose on November 7. The division has also taken measures like deploying more manpower, incentivizing vaccinated people in shopping areas, office premises, ration shops and other services, camps inside mosques on Fridays, and ‘near to home vaccination’ for Banjara community. Singh added that in Yavatmal they are telling village field staff to prepare list of people whose first dose is pending, and people eligible for second dose, with plans to cover this number during the vaccination session in villages, among other measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amravati-div-has-huge-first-dose-backlog-needs-to-jab-75k-a-day-to-achieve-nov-end-target/articleshow/87573297.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Police arrested Korada Govindu (30), a native of Venkatapuram village under Anandapuram mandal in Vizag city in connection with the case. Cops suspect financial dealings to be the motive behind the murder. Bangarraju, a lineman by profession and a native of Nammivanipeta Colony at Bheemili in Vizag city, left his house on October 31 and was found dead under suspicious circumstances near Yenugulapalem under Padmanabham mandal in Vizag city. The body was found near the compound wall of a guest house belonging to Korda Lakshmana Kumar, a family member of a YSRC leader. The kin of the victim alleged Govindu and his friend Lakshmana murdered Bangarraju following financial disputes. The investigation revealed that Korada Govindu collected Rs 30 lakh through Bangarraju claiming he has political influence and will provide employment to some youngsters. But he could not provide jobs to anyone. As Bangarraju wanted Govindu to pay back the money, the latter decided to eliminate Bangarraju. He called the victim to the guest house. When Bangarraju reached the guest house he was told to switch off the transformer with an intention to disable the CCTV cameras at the guest house. Later, Govindu thrashed Bangarraju to death using an iron pipe. Investigation showed location of Lakshmana and Venkatesh elsewhere at the time of commission of the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/lineman-murder-case-cracked-1-held/articleshow/87572789.cms||---

As per the phase 1 figures, the computer science engineering course at the National Institute of Technology, Warangal opened at 703 and closed at 2,622. Last year, the institute opened at 541 and closed at 1,739. “This year, the number of seats in many Indian Institute of Technologies (IIT) have increased following addition of seats in the economically weaker sections. Therefore, many top rankers might have chosen IITs over NITs,” said Ramana Rao, director, NIT, Warangal, adding that it is not the opening rank but the closing rank that determines the quality of students in these institutions. He further added that it is not the opening ranks but the closing ranks that defines the quality of students in these coveted institutions. “In many cases, if a student is not securing a CSE seat in an IIT than he/she prefers other disciplines such as electrical engineering, civil engineering etc. The brand of IIT is what matters to most of the students,” said Rao. Similarly, computer science course at University of Hyderabad opened at 8,384 and closed at 16,597. Last year, it opened at 7,080 and closed at 13,991.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opening-rank-for-many-institutions-dips/articleshow/87573320.cms||---

Of the total applicants, 1,634 are women. Nine differently-abled will also test their literacy skills at the exam. Janaki Thayyathuparambil (75) of Eloor municipality and Thankamma Azhakan (75) of Kadungalloor are the eldest candidates in the district. The examination will be conducted following Covid protocols at 141 centres. The examination will be for three hours and one needs 30 marks out of 100 to pass. The questions will contain reading, writing and mathematics. Total marks for each subject is 30. The candidate should also give profile details for 10 marks. The basic literacy class is conducted for illiterate people who could not attend school or who attended only for one or two years and are illiterate. “More than a teaching session at the literacy class for the elderly, it provides a platform for them to interact with others of their age and share their worries. Many lead an isolated life in their homes despite living with their children. Even though daycare centres for elderly are there, their children do not allow them to go there. But they allow the elderly to attend class,” says Deepa James, district coordinator of the mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/over-2000-people-to-take-literacy-test/articleshow/87572810.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s TB-Covid co-infection rate pegged at a low 0.5%, shows report||MUMBAI: Despite screening every newly-diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) patient for Covid, TB-Covid co-infection rate has remained under 1% in Maharashtra. The state health department’s latest report said 709 of 1.36 lakh patients with underlying TB — subjected to compulsory Covid screening between January-September — tested positive for coronavirus, pegging the state’s TB-Covid co-infection rate at 0.5%. The co-infection rate is very low compared to Covid infection rate among the general population, which at a minimum is up to 3%. Experts stressed on extensive studies to gauge TB patients’ exact vulnerability by expanding Covid diagnosis. Currently, TB patients are screened for Covid only once. Despite TB being chronic, the status of Covid infection is not captured periodically unless the patient exhibits worsening symptoms, experts underlined. “When TB is chronic, screening a patient only once will lead to a misleading picture. A TB patient should be evaluated for Covid during TB treatment when s/he shows symptoms. Free Covid testing should be done at least once in two to three months depending on virus transmission activity in the community at the time,” said health activist and medical practitioner Sanjay Dabhadhe. Government must prioritize Covid screening among TB patients in terms of improved coverage, quality of screening, supervision and monitoring, he added. Experts drew attention to ensuring compulsory Covid screening among TB patients seeking care from private medical practitioners. “Compulsory Covid screening norm is being implemented at state and civic health centres/TB units, but it is unclear if private doctors are following the norm,” a state health official said. “Figures show co-infection is not uncommon. One has to be extremely careful to not miss coexistence of these diseases,” chest physician Mahavir Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-states-tb-covid-co-infection-rate-pegged-at-a-low-0-5-shows-report/articleshow/87573805.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Please tell us what is there to stop 20,000 vendors from walking into CP and saying we will start vending? It can’t be haphazard, you can’t say we have been sitting there for 20 years so I have a right,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked, while stressing on the need for proper implementation of the Street Vendors’ Act. It directed the local authorities designated under the Act— in this case New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the corporations— to start the process of preparing the statutory street vending plan, asking the local bodies to “get down to planning.” It advised them to take help from specialised bodies, such as IIT, Delhi School of Architecture, etc, and, to “come out with a good plan where CP retains its original character and gets a vending plan.” The court was hearing a plea by New Delhi Traders’ Association, which sought directions to the authorities to ensure that illegal hawking and squatting or vending activities in ‘No Hawking’ and ‘No Vending’ areas of CP and Connaught Circus stop permanently. The petitioner, represented through senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, sought that the authorities be directed to ensure the areas are kept free from encroachments by illegal hawkers and vendors. DCP (New Delhi), SHO of Connaught Place police station, and NDMC chairperson were present in the court. The court was informed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi Police, that drives have been carried out by NDMC and police for removal of illegal encroachers and five FIRs have been registered, and that goods have also been confiscated. Ralli informed the court that due to its intervention, squatters and hawkers have also been cleared from the Regal Cinema building. During the hearing, advocate Kamlesh Mishra, representing a woman who claimed to be vending in the CP area since the 1980s, said the court was hearing everyone except the vendors. But the court pointed out that hawking activity is happening all over the world and even foreigners buy goods from fleece markets. “We also go and buy handicrafts and books and other items from these vendors,” the bench said, adding, “we don’t want to take away anyone’s fundamental right but no fundamental right is absolute.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-allow-jungle-raj-where-anyone-starts-hawking-hc/articleshow/87593485.cms||Abhinav Garg

This year, there are a total 470 seats available at IIT-H of which 376 are gender neutral seats and 94 are female supernumerary seats.  In the academic year 2019-20, IIT-H had become the first institute to offer an exclusive BTech in AI course with an intake of 20 students. While the CSE course opened at 191 this year, the AI course opened at a close 330. “The awareness of the opportunities and excitement around AI in all technology sectors has enthused incoming students to prefer AI over many other disciplines -- including computer science in some cases,” said Vineeth N Balasubramanian, head – department of AI at IIT-H. The department of AI at IIT-H has close to 30 faculty specializing in various areas of AI, providing a rich variety of teaching and research options to the undergraduate students. “The curriculum includes a healthy and holistic combination of mathematical foundations, basic AI/ML courses early in the programme, basic CS courses, many electives in applied AI, as well as opportunities to carry out semester-long internships and research projects -- which we believe the students find attractive and useful,” he added. In the first round of Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA), apart from CSE and AI, mathematics computing engineering was a hot pick with most of the top rankers opting for it. According to figures, mathematics and computing opened at 642 and closed at 970.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-rises-at-iit-h-cse-math-computing-remain-hot-picks/articleshow/87573321.cms||Preeti Biswas

While five of these high-mast flags have already been installed in Delhi, the rest are expected to be erected by the time the capital celebrates Republic Day next year. The 500 high-mast national flags were announced by the Delhi government as part of its ‘Deshbhakti Budget’ on March 12 this year. The installation of the flags is part of the celebrations of 75 years of India’s independence and Rs 45 crore was set aside in the Budget for the initiative. During his budget speech, deputy chief minister and finance minister Manish Sisodia had said that high-mast flags — like the monumental flag at Connaught Place — would be installed in a way that at least one of them is visible to every Delhiite at every two kilometres. A circular issued on October 25 stated that an amount of Rs 104.34 crore had been given “administrative approval and expenditure sanction” by the Expenditure Finance Committee of the Delhi government’s finance department, based on the proposal submitted by the engineer-in-chief of the Public Works Department. While giving the approval, the committee has said that PWD must observe all ‘codal formalities’, including general financial rules, CPWD works manual, finance department’s instructions, etc. The committee has instructed that the project be completed in accordance with the approved scope of work at the sanctioned cost within the stipulated period and no cost escalation will be considered in the future. It has also clearly directed that no diversion of funds would be allowed and any deviation from the terms and conditions of works or funds will be liable for strict action. While the project was announced earlier this year, the work got affected due to the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases during the second wave. However, five out of the total 500 flags at East Kidwai Nagar, East Vinod Nagar, Rani Bagh, Kalkaji and Dwarka were installed in time for the Independence Day celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-sanctions-rs-104cr-for-high-mast-national-flags/articleshow/87573322.cms||---

He, however, admitted that the state government has to take the burden of network charges which are beyond the price offered by the SECI.  Speaking to the media here on Sunday, Dr Srikanth said the government will be saving money immensely thanks to the purchases from the SECI. “I can’t comment on the latest prices offered in the bids of SECI. I can tell you only the price offered to the state government,” responded Srikanth when asked about the steep fall in the prices of solar power since the SECI sent its offer letter to the state government. He said the cabinet approved the SECI proposal as the price was same as the lowest bid quoted in the tenders called by the government for setting up of solar plants.  He said the state government has agreed to purchase about 7000 mw of solar power from SECI at a price of Rs 2.49 per unit which is lowest till the date. He said Tamil Nadu purchased power from SECI at Rs 2.65 per unit in last September. He added the proposal to purchase the power from SECI would go to the APERC only after it is cleared by the state government. He said they would sign on Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) only after getting the green signal from ERC. He rejected the allegations that they were purchasing power from Adani group. “We are purchasing power from a Central government PSU-SECI. We are not concerned about who are supplying power to SECI,” he explained.  The energy secretary admitted that network charges would be in addition to the purchase price and it would be borne by the government without levying the burden on discoms.

---||Kochi||Maharaja’s College students on strike over poor facilities||Kochi: Students of Maharaja’s College are in the course of agitation demanding the authorities to ensure various infrastructure facilities on the campus. The strike by SFI, which was started 26 days ago, highlights various issues plaguing an institution which holds a good track record.  According to the students, the hostels face the issue of African snails, the toilets are not disabled-friendly and water coolers are not functioning properly. “Though we had brought such issues to the notice of the college management several times, they didn’t sort the issues out. This forced us to enter the strike path. A few days ago, college governing council had held talks with us and promised to execute all our demands. We were not ready to go by just promises,” K Raju, secretary, SFI, Maharaja’s College unit. “Now, they have taken measures as per our demands. They have constructed ramps for physically disabled students. Still, some more things are to be done. The authorities are expected to take the remaining steps within a few days. Once all our demands are met, we will call off the strike,” Raju said. Women students who come from distant areas find it difficult to get accommodation in the college hostel. So, they are forced to find alternatives like paying guest facilities. The existing women’s hostel is a dilapidated structure and there are facilities to accommodate less than 75 students. This creates problems for the students hailing from districts like Wayanad. The strike, at a time when admissions to PG and degree courses are on, has badly affected the reputation of the college. College authorities said that academic as well as infrastructure facilities in the college have been up to the mark for the past few years. “We stand at 92nd position in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking. We are improving our infrastructure facilities as well. Construction of a hostel for women is under progress near the men’s hostel. More than 300 students can be accommodated there. The hostel would be ready by the next academic year. Work on library and auditorium also are on,” principal Mathew George. “We have 175 new seats for PG courses. I am unaware of the strike by the students as I have been on leave,” George said. As per internal sources, feud between the governing council and principal has led to the current standoff. Leader of Old Students Association of the college CICC Jayachandran said that the academic standards of the college have improved in the past five or six years. “Being a prominent college in the state, the principal would be a senior one. So, the person would either superannuate within a couple of years or he or she will be promoted as deputy director of collegiate education. The government should appoint principals who can hold the post for a minimum of five years. Then only, the principal can learn the issues here, plan accordingly and implement the projects,” Jayachandran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maharajas-college-students-on-strike-over-poor-facilities/articleshow/87572818.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Illegal construction of Rs 9 crore at Lansdowne forest division||DEHRADUN: A site inspection by a team of the regional office of the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) at the Lansdowne forest division, adjoining Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has revealed the extent of illegal construction happening in and around the premier tiger reserve. The area lies next to the Pakhro range of CTR, where a tiger safari is proposed. The team’s report, exclusively accessed by TOI, reveals that construction work was being carried out without the MoEF’s nod at an eco-park spread across 0.5 hectares of land in the forest division. The inspection revealed that the eco-park, which was supposed to be managed with the help of a local village eco-development committee, was taken over by the DFO of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve, Kishen Chandra, who did not have jurisdiction over the Lansdowne forest division, with permission for the same being granted by Sushant Patnaik, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Garhwal. The buildings being constructed on almost double the area of the eco-park included a tourist complex comprising four deluxe rooms, dining halls, kitchens, dormitories, ornamental fountains and other external developmental work, all worth an estimated Rs 9 crore. Notably, illegal construction was also found by a National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) team in the Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division of Corbett at Morghatti, Pakhro, and Kugadda areas – all of which fall under the jurisdiction of DFO Chandra. All the construction, the inspection team noted, violated the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. When the MoEF team queried from DFO, Lansdowne division, who was present during the inspection, as to how such massive civil construction could be carried out in his area, he referred to the CCF, Garhwal’s letter, adding that he had himself raised objections regarding the construction in a letter sent to his controlling officer, conservator of forests, Shiwalik Circle. He added that thereafter gave orders to stop the construction. Meanwhile, chief conservator of Garhwal, Sushant Patnaik, when asked about the matter, claimed, “The permission for developing the park was sanctioned only after receiving a proposal from the DFO of Lansdowne. However, due to scanty funds at the Lansdowne division and availability of funds with the Corbett Foundation, the DFO of the Kalagarh Tiger Reserve division was asked to develop that park.” A former senior forest official, closely observing the entire case said that “the idea behind the illegal constructions seems to be to make the Pauri side of Corbett as profitable and alluring at the cost of our rich wildlife and biodiversity as the Ramnagar side, which is why these brazen violations of laws and building activities are happening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/site-inspection-by-moef-team-reveals-rs-9-cr-construction-at-lansdowne-forest-division-without-ministry-nod/articleshow/87572812.cms||Shivani Azad

The champions from India started brightly and stunned the hosts with a goal from Elshaddai Acheampong in the 33rd minute. Amman, however, turned the match on its head after the change of ends with goals from Maysa Jbarah and Samia Ouni. It was a disappointing night for Gokulam Kerala, who will face Shahrdari Sirjan (Iran) in their next game on Thursday. “It’s very tough to lose the first match,” said Gokulam Kerala coach PV Priya. “We did our best, but it was not enough to get the win. We tried and pushed for a win, but couldn’t get the goal in the end. Our focus now is on the next game.” The debutants matched the unbeaten Jordanian champions in the opening half an hour. They needed saves from goalkeeper Aditi Chauhan and some wayward shooting early in the game, until Elshaddai produced a stunning goal. It happened just after the half an hour mark when Aditi collected a ball from the corner-kick and sent it long for Elshaddai. The Ghanaian striker left her marker behind, and then nicely lobbed it past the onrushing goalkeeper. Elshaddai had a chance to make it 2-0 in the second session, but mistimed her shot from close range. That miss proved as Amman won a penalty after VAR adjudged Michel Castanha to have handled the ball inside the danger zone. Jbarah stepped up and made no mistake from the spot. With scores level, Amman upped the tempo and surged ahead for the first time in the 67th minute when Samia Ouni curled a free-kick straight into the goal. “Gokulam are a very formidable side, but our players coped with the situations well. With their determination, they overcame a very tough opponent,” said Amman coach Khaled Nemer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amman-fight-back-to-edge-past-gokulam-kerala/articleshow/87593494.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Pragati Maidan to host mega drone event in December||NEW DELHI: Next month, Pragati Maidan will be hosting India’s biggest-ever drone event. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is learnt to have directed the aviation ministry to upscale a programme on unmanned aircraft system (UAS) scheduled on November 13. A source said now a two-day mega event would be organised and the public would be allowed inside on the second day to witness the wide variety of uses for drones in India. Modi plans to make India a global drone hub before the end of this decade. He got the aviation ministry to junk an archaic policy enacted earlier this year that tied down UAS in a plethora of red tape and clearances. Following adverse industry reaction, the policy was junked and replaced with a simple set of rules. “Drones have an immense potential for being used in all imaginable walks of life. The PM reviewed the upcoming Drone Festival of India, 2021 with top officials and directed that the event be held on a much grander scale at Pragati Maidan within 30 days of the programme planned on November 13,” said the source. Now, there will be over 2,000 participants and more than 100 exhibitors. “We plan to invite people from all walks of life, like students, self-help groups and farmers on the second day to showcase the wide variety of uses of drones. This is just the beginning. Our aim is to bring about transformation in peoples’ lives with drones,” said an official. Currently, drones are being used for transporting vaccines, spraying pesticides, fighting locusts and inspecting assets like oil pipelines and transmission lines. They would soon be used for e-commerce. The aviation ministry recently allowed domestic flyers to take small to medium-size drones. Drones (without battery) would mostly need to be in check-in bags and batteries (of up to certain wattage) only in cabin bags. For international trips, rules of destination countries would apply. The drone fest would be organised at Pragati Maidan after November 27, when the annual trade fair ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pragati-maidan-to-host-mega-drone-event-in-december/articleshow/87573326.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Hyderabad||No adverse side effects of Covid-19 vaccine: Study||Hyderabad: Vaccines administered in the city so far for prevention of Covid-19 did not show any major adverse reaction. All the side-effects reported after Covid-19 vaccination are in terms of the manufacturer’s data and the doses administered are safe, says a research study conducted by a city-based medical college and hospital. Most of the people, who reported minor side-effects after vaccination, are in the age group of 18 to 28 years. Pain in injection site was reported in 45 per cent and fever in 31 per cent of the vaccinated population. But all side-effects were normal and subsided soon afterwards, the study revealed. “The overall results found the occurrence of side-effects are in the terms of the manufacturer’s data and it has been noticed in young age. The presence of local side-effects should not hamper the vaccination drive to protect against the pandemic. This study imparts the confidence for taking vaccination and further studies are required to strengthen the will of public to boost confidence to take vaccine in the present vaccination drive,” said the researchers from the Kamineni Academy of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Hyderabad. The research team comprised Sunil Pal Singh Chajhlana, Anjaiah Kanusali, Guru Prasad Manderwad, Vineesh Allenki and Shashidhar Kamineni. The results of the research study were published in the latest issue of the science journal, International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health. The research team studied Covishield vaccine. The cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2021 and February 2021 among healthcare workers vaccinated using a validated questionnaire. Study subjects were contacted to know about any adverse events following immunization for 0-24 hours, 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours. “As many as 1,364 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority of the symptoms following immunization were highest in age group of 18-28 years. Reported symptoms were pain at the site of injection in 45.4%, fever in 31%, body pains in 23.3%, headache in 13.9%, tiredness in 10.4%, swelling at the site of injection in 2.9%, dizziness in 2.2%, redness at the site of injection in 1.8%, joint pains in 1.7%, rash in 0.4%, breathlessness in 0.2%,” the study said. The study found that in the next 24-48 hours after vaccination, there was a major decline in the symptoms reported compared to the symptoms reported in the first 24 hours after vaccination. “The symptoms in the vaccination population a day after the jab were pain at the site of injection 5.7%, fever 2.8%, body pains 2.8%, headache 2.3%, and tiredness 1.8%. In the 48-72 hours post vaccination, almost all the symptoms reported showed decreasing trends like pain 4.2%, fever 2.1%, body pains 1.9%, headache 1.1% and tiredness 1.3% in comparison with the previous two days. There were no cases reported with joint pains, rash and breathlessness on the third day”, the study added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-adverse-side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccine-study/articleshow/87573329.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Pune||Cracker under can explodes, shrapnel cuts man’s neck||Pune: A 20-year-old man died after a tin shrapnel cut his throat while he was bursting firecrackers at Shirur in rural Pune on November 4 An officer from the Shirur police said Rohan Mallav, a resident of Kachi Ali, was bursting firecrackers with his friends on Thursday night. “Mallav lit a cracker bomb and covered it with a tin jar. The cracker, however, took time to explode,” the officer said. He said Mallav went near the jar to see why it had not exploded. “As soon as he bent down, the cracker went off, shredding the tin jar into pieces. A shrapnel hit Mallav on the throat,” the officer said. He said Mallav sustained a severe cut on his throat and was bleeding profusely. “He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors,” the officer said. Police registered a case of accidental death, he said. 14 incidents of fire on Thursday & Friday nights As many as 14 fire incidents were reported in different parts of the city on Thursday and Friday nights due to the bursting of firecrackers. Pune city fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise told TOI, “No one was injured in any of these incidents and there was no major damage to property.” The city fire brigade received emergency calls from Market Yard, Hadapsar, Koregaon Park, Bhawani Peth, Gurunanaknagar, Yerawada, Balajinagar, Vishrantwadi among other parts of the city. “The fire tenders extinguished all fire within five minutes,” Ranpise said. “In Market Yard, a tree was gutted after a burning cracker fell on its trunk,” he said. 11 calls from PCMC areas, 3 because of crackers The Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade on Thursday received 11 calls of fire incidents, of which three were due to fire crackers.

---||Nagpur||Imposing curbs, not threat of paid jab, will up vax nos: Doctors||Nagpur: The recent measures adopted by the district administration and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to achieve complete vaccination coverage are likely to increase the pace but those “really hesitant” may still try to skip the jab, say doctors. Some of the doctors feel that while the NMC’s threat of discontinuing the free first dose at its centres after November 30 may not evoke a desired response from unvaccinated people, imposing restrictions on their movement will certainly compel them to take the jab. The district collector has prohibited entry of unvaccinated eligible people in government offices from Monday. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospital Association, stresses on conducting door-to-door survey seriously to check correlation between theoretical and realistic statistics. “Unless this is done, one cannot firmly state any reason for the disparity between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons,” he said. Authorities need to reach out to unvaccinated persons, as per Dr Marar. “Combine the available logistics with both government and private centres so as to optimize the resources. Even private centre should be permitted to conduct door-to-door vaccination across the district with government bearing the costs,” he said. Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani feels people genuinely concerned about Covid would have taken the jab by now. “The thought of having to pay for the jab may change the mind of financially weaker section but those from well to do families may still skip it,” he said. According to Dr Virani, though fear of disease is subsiding, the threat of losing free movement will work. “The ban on entry at government offices will certainly yield better results. I too have warned of not allowing unvaccinated persons in my clinic. The private sector must help government in this drive,” he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde supports the “carrot and stick policy” which shall be “effective on the group delaying jab on flimsy grounds”. “But the really hesitant group which believes in all sorts of rumours may still remain away. Incentives like discount in property tax, electricity or water bills might motivate them,” he said. He said the trend of drive losing pace at later stages is seen in all immunization programmes. Vaccine hesitancy still exists. Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration), Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said that unless administration strictly implements these measures, people will not opt for vaccination. “If free vaccination is discontinued at all government centres, there may be marginal increase in demand for jabs at private centres,” he said. Should private hospitals stop entry of unvaccinated persons, excluding emergencies? Dr Marar said that it will be clear only after going through the administrative order in detail. “In such situation, help of police authorities will be required to handle unruly patients and relatives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/imposing-curbs-not-threat-of-paid-jab-will-up-vax-nos-doctors/articleshow/87573328.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Telangana State Road Transport Corporation to hike bus fares for all categories||HYDERABAD: Staring at additional losses due to the hike in diesel prices, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) will hike bus fares for all categories of bus services. As per the plan, the hike will be 20 paise per kilometre for Pallevelugu and city buses, while for express buses and higher categories it will be 30 paise per kilometre. A discussion to this effect was held by TSRTC authorities on Sunday with state transport minister P Ajay Kumar. TSRTC chairman Bajireddy Goverdhan told reporters that a previous proposal for a fare hike has been revised due to the Rs 10 waiver of excise duty in diesel prices. The proposal has been reworked to ensure that the average bus commuter is not overburdened by the hike, lowering it from 40 paise per kilometre to 25-30 paise now. After a review by the chief minister, the proposal will be placed before the state cabinet at its next meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tsrtc-to-hike-bus-fares/articleshow/87573327.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rebuffed man throws acid at woman, held||NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old woman suffered serious burn injuries after a man threw acid on her for refusing his marriage proposal in Outer-North district’s Bawana. The accused was arrested from Bihar on Saturday. The victim, who is married and also has a child, received third-degree burn injuries and was being treated at a hospital. On November 3, police got information that a stalker had thrown acid on a woman and fled. “The victim was admitted to a hospital and a case was registered on her statement,” said DCP (Outer-North) Brijendra Kumar Yadav. The accused, Montu, was a native of Bihar and worked in a factory. He was known to the victim as they lived in the same neighbourhood in Samaypur Badli. The woman was also from Bihar. “Montu started pestering the woman to marry him despite knowing that she was married. He kept telling her to leave her husband, but the woman refused his proposal. The woman and her husband then shifted to Pooth Khurd,” said an officer. “Montu followed them to Pooth Khurd and started living in the same area. One day, he called the woman to his room on some pretext and asked her to leave her husband and live with him, but she refused,” added the officer. Infuriated at her reply, Montu tied her hands, threw acid on her and fled the spot. The woman ran out of the house crying in pain and sought help from people. Someone informed her husband about the incident. “Her face started turning black and she was taking only Montu’s name. Soon, we found that he was absconding and had fled to his native place,” said the officer. When cops reached Bihar to arrest Montu, they came to know that he would come to his home only at night to sleep and leave early in the morning. “We waited for him and then caught him,” the officer said. After being brought to Delhi, the accused was questioned. Montu told the investigators that he threw acid on the woman as she refused to marry him. He had also planned to shoot the woman’s husband with a country-made pistol. He had hidden the gun somewhere in Outer-North district. The cops took one-day police custody from court and took him to the area where he had allegedly hidden the weapon. However, he misguided them about the exact location. Suddenly, he took out the pistol from someplace and opened fire on the cops. In retaliatory firing, Montu was hit in the right leg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rebuffed-man-throws-acid-at-woman-held/articleshow/87593502.cms||---
---||Nashik||50% MSRTC operations affected in Nashik district||Nashik: The agitation of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, belonging to various employees’ associations, has now spread across almost the entire state with operations from Nashik district also being hampered by 50%. The employees from Sinnar, Peth, Satana depots closed their operations after 2pm from Sunday even as the employees from Nashik and other seven depots out of the total 13 later joined the agitation. “Our joint action committee has clearly stated that it would be following statewide agitation on the most important demand of merger of the MSRTC with the state government for the security of every employee. This agitation is not initiated by us, but it seems the employees themselves have decided to agitate for their demands,” Vijay Pawar, office-bearer of ST Kamgar Sena, said. Since 4am on Sunday, the senior officials of MSRTC Nashik division have been camping at various bus stands and depots to appeal to the employees to get back to work. “In the first half of the day we could persuade at least 80% of the employees to get back to work, but since afternoon the employees did not turn up and the ones who had completed their schedules locked their buses in the depots,” a senior officer said. This has had a telling effect on the passengers as they found it difficult to get access to the buses to travel to the destinations despite having reservations. “I had reservation for a 12.30 pm bus for Borivali (Mumbai), but since it did not turn up the officials arranged for another bus and I could reach Thane. From there I hired a cab,” Shraddha Pendse, a resident of Borivali, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/50-msrtc-operations-affected-in-nashik-district/articleshow/87572239.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The game was designed by three school students after areas near Golconda got affected in the 2020 flash floods. The three — Kirtana V, Raasi M and Aditi K, pursuing science stream of grade 11 at Suchitra Academy — were in grade 10 at the time of planning the project, ‘Climate Action by Hyderabad Children’. “After the fortress town of Golconda suffered major damage from flash flooding in 2020, local students set out to understand for themselves the problems and see how they and their mates could help tackle the climate emergency,” the report says. They developed the game for children, ‘Climate Action by Hyderabad Children’, in which participants are encouraged to learn good ‘green deeds’ and get involved in climate action. The entire game, including the game board and cards, are based on the local heritage. Through this lens, gamers were encouraged to embrace sustainable building materials and practice the 4Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle and repurpose) in daily life, including working to save built heritage and to stand against demolition of existing buildings. The game helps to create awareness among different age-groups about climate change and empower children to gear up for climate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/board-game-by-city-students-makes-it-to-cop-26-report/articleshow/87573333.cms||---

They have been accused of garlanding the statue of Lord Parshuram on Diwali day before its inauguration. Accusing the SP leader and others of trying to disturb peace, Rishikant Sharma, SHO of Shikarpur police station, said, “The statue was built by the government and is to be formally inaugurated by a minister later this month. One cannot just go and garland it before its formal inauguration. Their act has the potential to disturb law and order in the area.” He said Sharma and the others were booked on the complaint of a police constable posted in Shikarpur. As news of the FIR spread, hundreds of members of the Brahmin community, farmers and social activists gathered at Shikarpur on Sunday to protest against Anil Sharma, state minister for forest, environment and climate change, who is supposed to inaugurate the statue later this month. “Even if the government has installed the statue, Parshuram belongs to all. All they did was to clean up the statue on Diwali day,” claimed Vimal Mishra, a trader who participated in the protest. Farmer leader Poonam Pandit, who joined the protest, said everyone has equal right to worship a statue. “Just because a UP minister wants to inaugurate the statue, should a common man be debarred from worshiping the same? It was Diwali and all those who have been booked only wanted to clean the statue, which had been waiting for the inauguration for a long time,” said Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sp-leader-others-booked-for-garlanding-parshurams-statue-before-formal-inauguration/articleshow/87572828.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mosque clinic treats 569 dengue, typhoid-hit children in 30 days||HYDERABAD: With dengue, typhoid and malaria becoming endemic to Shaheen Nagar in Old City, scores of cases are reported from the area daily. The mosque clinic in Shaheen Nagar has in the last 30 days treated 569 children suffering from vector-borne ailments from 20 slums. A survey by the mosque clinic has shown that 51% of total typhoid cases, 22% of dengue cases and 2% of malaria cases were reported in a cluster of 20 slums in Shaheen Nagar catchment while 15% of typhoid cases and 11% of dengue cases were reported in slums of Rajendra Nagar and Hasanagar catchment area in Old Hyderabad. Of the 569 children, who received free treatment including medicines and blood tests in the past one month, 421 cases related to typhoid, 133 cases to dengue and 15 cases to malaria. The mosque clinic is managed by Helping Hand Foundation in collaboration with SEED, an NGO based in the USA, and American Muslim Physicians of Indian Origin (AMPI). The mosque clinic caters to the health needs of people living in about 20 slums spread over Shaheen Nagar, Hasanagar, Rajendranagar and Achi Reddy Nagar. The survey revealed that 72% of the cases of typhoid were children between five and 15 years while 85% of dengue cases were children between 10 and 18 years of age. “Poor sanitation, overflowing drains, uncleared garbage, and frequent inundation due to heavy rains are the primary cause of high incidence of vector-borne diseases. All cases of typhoid were treated in outpatient mode. However, almost all the cases required IV injections for a period of 5 to 7 days. Additional beds were laid in the available space in the mosque for treatment of typhoid cases,” said HHP managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. Tests for typhoid and dengue were done free of cost. Owing to the in-house lab facility the tests were done in shorter window and treatment could be initiated on timely basis, he said. He said that 60% of dengue positive cases required hospitalization after diagnosis due to a low platelet count. All dengue cases were treated in OGH and Niloufer hospital. As many as 15 patients required admission in private hospitals and the hospitalisation charges were borne by the NGO. Each patient of typhoid would have spent a minimum Rs 3000 for medicines, lab tests and consultation and dengue patients would have spent at least Rs 2000 for tests and medicine. By providing free tests and treatment, the mosque clinic has helped the poor save over Rs 20 lakh out-of-pocket expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mosque-clinic-treats-569-dengue-typhoid-hit-children-in-30-days/articleshow/87573330.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Mumbai||Patients, care-givers can now find relief on palliative care helpline||MUMBAI: In a country where basic medical intervention is a luxury, the idea of palliative care for long-term degenerative illness scarcely finds space. To bridge that gap, a national helpline, Saath-Saath, was launched last month to offer respite to patients and their care-givers. In just two weeks, it has received 200-odd anguished calls from across the country, with queries ranging from “Where can I find a wig?” to “Can I leave my Alzheimer’s-afflicted father at home when I go to work?” to “I just cannot cope…” The helpline (1-800-202-7777) first reassures the callers that they are not alone, hears them out, and then connects them to the relevant palliative organisation in their area. A man who was feeling isolated after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s was referred to a support group in Hyderabad; a poor, uneducated cancer patient camping in a gurudwara in Mumbai, was suddenly surrounded by loving volunteers who helped alleviate her acute pain. Some call seeking information on home care, some are in financial distress. Many just want to hear a kind voice. “We have seen broken families come together because they suddenly have that additional layer of support,” says Rumana Hamied, managing trustee of the Cipla Foundation, which runs the helpline. Palliative care, which was originally associated with end-stage cancer, is now increasingly being viewed as a much-needed integrated approach to any chronic and progressive illness, right from the point of diagnosis. It takes care of the physical comfort, as well as the psycho-social and spiritual support, that patients and their families crave as they come to terms with near-certain mortality. And care-givers often need more support than patients. “When you are suffering, you need the comfort of people, not only the beeps of machines around you,” says Dr M R Rajagopal, who pioneered palliative care in India and has been an inspiration backing Saath-Saath. “When people feel that no one cares, which can happen even within a family, we are able to convey that we do care. Such a helpline will be able to say, you are clearly depressed, let’s set a time to talk every week. It could direct people to existing support programmes which they may not know of.” The helpline essentially connects the caller to the already existing free support groups for paediatrics or geriatrics, home care services and hospices that are working miracles across the country. One such, Romila Palliative Care started in 2017 by Armida and Rui Fernandez, a doctor couple who lost their daughter Romila to cancer offers free home care across Mumbai’s slums, chawls and high-rises with a small army of nutritionists, counsellors and occupational therapists. “Sometimes the patient might need assistance on something as simple as how to prevent bed sores, other times they might need diapers,” says Dr Armida. “Sometimes, the patient or a family member just needs to talk and be counselled.” Another organisation on the helpline network, Sukoon Nilaya, also in Mumbai, supports families with geriatric neuro-degenerative disorders like dementia and Parkinson’s. “When patients and families are given any distressing diagnosis, they initially just need hand-holding, because it draws up so many complex emotions from decisions to be made, to making sense of the financial costs,” says Dr Leena Gangolli of Sukoon Nilaya. Nair Hospital is the first Mumbai municipal hospital to start an integrated paediatric palliative care out-patient department. Oncologists point out that the drop-out rate for treatment in paediatric cancer tends to be very high, but it falls significantly as soon as a palliative support group comes in to give explanations, answer doubts and offer support. Now, Chennai has started its first paediatric palliative care centre; and Cipla Foundation has been asked to set up something in Lucknow, Srinagar, and at NIMHANS, Bangalore, which will help those with chronic neurological issues. “Our directory of palliative and home care services across the country is fast growing,” says Prakash Fernandes, who runs the helpline out of Pune. He adds, “Everyone has a realised that together we can make a far bigger impact.” Former school teacher Aban Mukherji recently heard about the Saath-Saath helpline. “For ten years, I suffered from chronic stress, wondering whether my domestic helper would turn up to look after my bed-ridden mother who was afflicted with Alzheimer’s. I would not know whether or not I could leave for work and the fate of my students if I didn’t show up. If I had access to a helpline like this, and could find a home care service on stand-by, I would have been in a better place.” Saath-Saath can be reached on 1-800-202-7777, from Monday to Saturday, between 10am and 6pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-patients-care-givers-can-now-find-relief-on-palliative-care-helpline/articleshow/87573815.cms||Namita Devidayal

---||Goa||South American challenge for India women in Brazil||Panaji: The Indian women’s football team will play three high-profile games in Manaus, including one against hosts Brazil, ranked seventh in the world. Manaus is not one of the traditional hotbeds of Brazilian football, but gained prominence during the 2014 World Cup when the city -- in the middle of the Amazon rainforest – hosted four World Cup games, including England’s group opener against Italy. Now the city will welcome India (ranked 57), Chile (37) and Venezuela (56) for the Torneio Internacional de Futebol Feminino or international women’s football tournament. According to the official Twitter account of the Brazilian women’s football team, India -- preparing for the Asian Cup 2022 at home in January -- will face Brazil on November 25. Chile (November 28) and Venezuela (December 1) are the other opponents. All three South American opponents are higher ranked than the visitors from Asia with the hosts enjoying the highest profile. Brazil have made it to the final of the Olympics twice and World Cup once. India were initially scheduled to travel to Turkey for a four-nation tournament this month but changed plans after two of the teams – Morocco and Cameroon – opted out. “We have not made any official announcement because there are still some formalities, including obtaining visas, that need to be completed,” said a senior AIFF official. “We want to give the team the best preparation ahead of the Asian Cup. Brazil will be the toughest challenge, but it’s important that the team tackles the best before the Asian competition.” India have been handed a tough draw for the Asian Cup, clubbed alongside eight-time champions China, two-time winners Chinese Taipei and Iran, who they face in the opener on January 20 in Mumbai. AIFF will organise another four-nation international tournament in December in Kerala. Thailand, who qualified for the World Cup in 2019, are likely to be one of the participants. “We will either play a friendly against Thailand or have them at the four-nation tournament,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-american-challenge-for-india-women-in-brazil/articleshow/87593521.cms||---
---||Delhi||Illegal detention? Let no one have to repeat ‘I can’t breathe’, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: “Let no one have to repeat the tragic words like George Perry Floyd, Jr: ‘I can’t breathe'”, Delhi high court observed on Monday while hearing a plea by two men who were allegedly illegally detained and mercilessly beaten up by Delhi Police officers. The high court noted that law does not permit people to be beaten up in police custody or during interrogation, as the punishment for a criminal act was to be determined by a court of law. Justice Najmi Waziri, who examined the photographs of the alleged incident, took a grim view of the incident. “One can never be too vigilant about the rights of citizens being violated or any callousness or over-reaction by law-enforcers, which may lead to an unfortunate incident or tragedy... punishment for an assault or a criminal act is to be determined by a court of law. Police cannot be a judge in its own cause. The law does not permit people to be beaten up in police custody or during interrogation,” it said. The court directed an inquiry by the deputy commissioner of police (Vigilance) and the petition be treated as a complaint to police. It also sought a report in action taken. The petition by two men claimed that they, along with two others, were “mercilessly beaten, illegally detained, tortured by the police personnel of police post Turkman Gate, police station Chandni Mahal, Central district, at the behest of certain private individuals at the aforesaid police post.” On their part, police claimed the duo had indulged in fracas outside the police station after leaving the premises moments earlier. It was also captured on CCTV, police submitted, saying the cops rushed there to break up the melee, which could have led to a law-and-order situation, especially on the eve of the Republic Day function. The high court said, to inspire confidence, a fresh inquiry was warranted because the photographs and the video showed the two men (the petitioner and his well-wisher) being assaulted repeatedly by a posse of policemen, who were in uniform and in civilian attire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/illegal-detention-let-no-one-have-to-repeat-i-cant-breathe-says-hc/articleshow/87593517.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: PWD repairs on two key flyovers smoothen traffic flow towards IGI||NEW DELHI: Providing relief to commuters in southeast Delhi, PWD recently completed repair work on Ber Sarai and Munirka flyovers by re-carpeting them with bitumen. A senior PWD official said both the flyovers on Outer Ring Road, the first running from IGL Station to Ber Sarai and the second from Ekta Market to Munirka, were 2.2km in length. The traffic flow between IGI Airport and IIT Gate was now expected to be smooth. Commuters told TOI that travelling on these stretches had become much easier compared with the days when the two flyovers were being repaired. Sushant, a commuter, said, “I’m a working professional. I cross IIT Gate each day while travelling to and from my workplace. I have been using this route since my student days. Traffic was obstructed while the flyovers were being repaired. Before that, it was a bumpy ride. Now, there is much relief.” Another daily commuter, Satish M, shared a similar experience. A traffic police source at Munirka and Vasant Vihar said, “The repaired roads have considerably reduced traffic issues of commuters. The flyovers have been strengthened and vehicles can run on them smoothly now.” The flyovers connect several south Delhi colonies with IGI Airport and are also used by foreigners and dignitaries visiting the capital. Earlier, when the 2.7-km Rao Tula Ram Marg flyover — which branches from the Munirka flyover and ends before Army Research and Referral Hospital near Subroto Park close to National Highway-8 — was opened after a seemingly endless wait, it was expected to transform the lives of commuters. However, as the macadam layer on the Munirka carriageway had come undone at various places, it had become a bumpy ride. Potholes on the flyover had added to the chaos, with motorists having to slow down to avoid them.

Before Diwali, the coriander prices were Rs 60 per bunch due to a shortage in supply. The untimely rains had ruined the coriander which caused a rise in prices. As expected, the supply increased immediately after Diwali. The consumers were relieved as after relishing the Diwali snacks, they will turn to the regular food and coriander is required in almost every dish made at home and the hotels. Rafiq Mullani, a vendor from Kasba Bawda mandi said, “The large-sized bunch is being sold at Rs 10 and regular-sized bunch at Rs 5. Usually, the supply increases in the 2nd or 3rd week of November but it has increased early this time. Most of the produce has arrived from the rural parts of the district.” As the trade at Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) was closed due to holiday, the farmers brought the produce directly to the mandis. All the mandis in Kolhapur city were full on Sunday. The APMC will open on Monday and more produce is likely to arrive from far-flung areas. The supply is once again likely to soar and thereby causing a slash in the prices further. Meanwhile, tomatoes continue to be sold at higher rates. The price before and after Diwali is Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg. The fresh produce which is half ripen, known as green tomatoes, have started arriving and are much sought after as they are less tangy and more crunchy. “The prices of tomatoes will come down subsequently in a week. Other green leafy vegetables have become cheaper. Spinach is being sold at Rs 15 per bunch and ridge gourd at Rs 40 per kg,” said Tushar Powar, another vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/coriander-price-down-to-rs-5-tomatoes-still-expensive/articleshow/87572268.cms||---
---||Goa||Mapping of state’s groundwater on for better mgmt||Panaji: The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), South Western Region, Bengaluru is in the process of mapping Goa’s aquifers to prepare taluka-wise management plans. Once ready, these will give an accurate idea of the state’s water availability and quality at the micro-level. Regional director of CGWB, V Kunhambu told TOI that the data will help Goa better plan utilisation of its groundwater for domestic, industrial and commercial use. “Aquifer planning and management reports for five talukas of North Goa are ready and the same work needs to be carried out for seven talukas in South Goa. The report will provide status of water availability, quality, impact of rain water recharge, etc. The information will be useful to farmers, industries and state departments in planning,” he said. Kunhambu said that the central government has brought in revised rules to be able to better manage groundwater resources in the country. The data, he said, will help in gradually implementing these new groundwater extraction guidelines. Once all the 12 taluka-wise reports are ready, an advisory will be issued based on the reports to help judiciously utilise water resources as per availability in a particular area. “Based on the report, restrictions can be placed on pumping groundwater in areas where there is less water available. As per the new central government norms, one will have to take approval and pay the WRD for pumping water, even on private land. All water extracted will be metered. Charges will be significant only for commercial or industrial use and will be nominal for other uses like domestic, etc,” a WRD official said. Guidelines will be in place even for agricultural use. For instance, recommending sprinkler irrigation rather than flood irrigation, the official said. The plan is being prepared in collaboration with the Goa water resources department. A district-level interaction was carried out by the CGWB in North Goa recently, where 41 people participated, including 14 women. WRD Goa chief engineer Pramod Badami emphasised the need for managing groundwater resources at the micro-level. Officer incharge of the CGWB, J Davithuraj made the technical presentations at the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapping-of-states-groundwater-on-for-better-mgmt/articleshow/87573838.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Marathwada: 40 out of 47 depots participate in strike||Aurangabad: As many as 109 MSRTC depots out of the 250 across Maharashtra were affected by the ongoing strike of the state transport utility employees, causing huge inconvenience to passengers during the current festive season on Sunday. In Marathwada, as many as 40 out of 47 depots participated in the strike, affecting services both short-distance and long-distance buses. The main bus stand and CIDCO bus stand witnessed scenes of chaos and confusion as passengers remained stranded while waiting for buses. The crippled functioning of MSRTC during the festive season saw a large number of tourists turning to private buses to undertake necessary journeys among other alternative options. Supriya Kale, a homemaker who had plans to reach to her mother’s place at Majalgaon from Aurangabad, said she lost hours waiting for the bus before taking a private bus. “We were clueless that the strike of MSRTC staffer has been intensified. It is wrong to held public at ransom to fulfil any demand,” she said. MSRTC divisional controller for Aurangabad Arun Siya said around 60% bus services witnessed cancellation due to the strike on Sunday. “The strike has affected our daily operations. The festive season invites huge rush of passengers who had to face inconvenience,” he said. The strike, which is being observed to press for merger of MSRTC into the state government, has been witnessing more response from Marathwada as compared to other areas since past few days. On Saturday, in Marathwada alone had 30 out of the total 65 depots that were affected due to the strike. Shrirang Barge, general secretary of Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress, said workers unions have faith in the system. “We hope that the demand for merging MSRTC with the state government gets official attention. Over 93,000 MSRTC staffers have been facing hardships that have only aggravated since outbreak of Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-40-out-of-47-depots-participate-in-strike/articleshow/87572256.cms||---

The IMD observatories at Shivajinagar, which covers the central parts of the city, and Lohegaon which covers the eastern fringes, recorded nil rainfall during this period. Cloudy conditions and morning chill prevailed on Sunday and IMD has forecast similar conditions to prevail for the next two days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division of the IMD, told TOI on Sunday, “There is a small chance of getting rainfall over the state and Pune district as well for the next few days due to the formation of a depression over the Arabian Sea. It will not have any impact on the weather conditions of the Indian subcontinent.” The night temperature of the city may fall marginally in the coming days, he said, “The sky conditions mainly clear. So, there is a chance of increasing day temperature and it will hover between 33-34 degrees Celsius while the night temperature will be between 17 degrees Celsius and 19 degrees Celsius.” Light to very light rainfall may occur in the southern region of the Konkan in the next few days, Kashyapi said, adding, “The rainfall is likely to take place in the Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-to-see-overcast-skies-for-2-more-days/articleshow/87572860.cms||---

The family of the deceased alleged that he was murdered by his former business partner who was asking for more share in the business which Sharma had refused to give. According to the family, he had received a phone call following which he left home. A few minutes later, the family was informed that Sharma was shot by miscreants. “My son got married in Delhi and was visiting home for Diwali.

---||Mumbai||Raut slams BJP, wonders if ‘jails, probe agencies privatised too’||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said that just like public sector enterprises, the BJP-led central government has privatised central investigating agencies and jails, too. In his weekly column ‘Rok Thok’ in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Raut has said that Modi government privatised many public enterprises in the country. Many government companies were sold to industrialists of their choice. “The two sit down to sell and the two buy,” Raut said. “Every day, the BJP promises to send some more ministers from Maharashtra to jail after Diwali. The way the ED, CBI and NCB are working, one wonders whether the country’s investigative machinery and prisons have been privatised,” said Raut. “Everything from Railways to Air India has become private. BJP leaders in Maharashtra wake up every morning saying they will put this one in jail and that one in jail. Have the country’s prisons been privatised then? But we know that if it is Modi, then this is also possible!. We will have to bear this till 2024. The whole country is slowly becoming a prison,” Raut said. Raut also slammed the Centre over fuel price cuts. “The Centre has reduced the price of petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10. This made the people of BJP happy and they are now saying how big-hearted the PM is. Reducing Rs 5 to Rs 10 after crossing the Rs 100 mark is not a relief. Prices were reduced after BJP lost by-elections in 13 states,” Raut said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-slams-bjp-wonders-if-jails-probe-agencies-privatised-too/articleshow/87573832.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||India||Unprovoked Pakistani firing kills Indian fisherman; 1 hurt||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: In a fresh flare-up of tensions between India and Pakistan, a fisherman from Maharashtra on a trawler near international waters off Kutch was shot dead and another injured in firing by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency on Saturday. India is lodging a strong protest against the firing, which was described as “unprovoked”. Sridhar Chamre, 32, belonged to Palghar district. His injured mate is being treated at a hospital in Okha, Gujarat. Fishermen along the coast in Palghar, including Vadrai village from where Chamre hailed, have called a bandh on Monday. The Pakistan coast guard forces are being accused of being increasingly trigger-happy against Indian fishermen. This is the second incident involving a fatality since September 2015 when a 40-year-old worker on a fishing boat was shot dead by PMSA for allegedly crossing Indian waters. In September 2020, PMSA personnel fired at five Indian fishermen near the maritime boundary line off Jakhau coast in Kutch. One was injured. In February this year, Pakistan arrested 17 Indian fishermen and confiscated their boats for allegedly straying into its territorial waters. Pakistan holds over 600 Indian fishermen in custody and over 1,100 boats. Officials and fishermen bodies have often complained that even when Pakistan releases the fishermen, they keep their boats. The latest incident, officials said, is still under investigation. MEA added India would take it up diplomatically with the Pakistani side. Manish Lodhari, president of the Marine Fisheries Co-op Ltd, Porbandar, said the firing happened near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) at Jakhau in Kutch. The boat with seven crew members had set sail on October 26 from Okha port. On Saturday around 4 pm, PMSA personnel fired at the trawler. Unconfirmed reports said Chamre was hit by three bullets and died on the spot. A bullet pierced through the cheek of another labourer Dilip Tandel, who was piloting the boat. Victim’s father Ramesh said the family was informed about the incident by the owner of the boat Jalpari, Jayantilal Rathod. “My son went to work on the boat in mid-September. We are told he was in Indian waters and was hit on the chest.” The five other crew members escaped unhurt. The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) in a statement said the case is under investigation by police and the crew is being interviewed jointly. “Details can be shared only after completion of the investigation,” it said. At least four to five fishing boats were believed to be in the vicinity when the firing took place. The body was brought to the Okha port and a case has been registered with the Porbandar Navi Bandar police, said Devbhumi Dwarka Superintendent of Police Sunil Joshi. Chamre is survived by his parents, wife and two daughters, aged 8 and 6. His father Ramesh works as a labourer on fishing boats in their village. His mother Anysiya said, “I have lost my elder son, he was the one who took care of us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unprovoked-pakistani-firing-kills-indian-fisherman-1-hurt/articleshow/87574539.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Single-window facility to install EV chargers||NEW DELHI: Charging electric vehicles (EVs) is set to become easier with Delhi government launching a single-window facility that aims to make the process of installing private EV charging points at commercial, institutional or residential locations a hassle-free experience. On Monday, transport minister Kailash Gahlot launched the facility, which would be available both online and through phone calls. Gahlot said, on the directions of Delhi government, power discoms had empanelled 12 vendors to facilitate the installation of slow and moderate chargers. The installation and operationalisation of the chargers will be completed within seven working days of submitting a request, he added. “I am happy to share that Delhi now hosts the cheapest EV charging facility you can find anywhere in the country. Apart from the 100+ public charging locations that are coming up, one can now install private EV chargers at a connection cost of Rs 2,500,” Gahlot said. Delhi government is providing a subsidy of Rs 6,000 to the first 30,000 applicants for installation of EV chargers in Delhi. “We have created an enabling environment that will in the coming times ensure more EVs will run on the city roads,” he said, adding that by increasing accessibility to charging infrastructure, all doubts or uncertainty in the minds of people about buying an EV will be done away with. “Today’s launch of a single window facility for installation of private chargers in malls, offices, residential societies, colleges is happening for the first time anywhere in India,” said Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, Dialogue and Development Commission. “It marks the completion of a year-long exercise initiated by the charging infrastructure working group of Delhi government,” Shah added. The tariff rate fixed by the government for the electricity consumed through these EV charging points is Rs 4.5 per unit, Gahlot said. Such a facilitative process for installing EV chargers has been developed for the first time in the country, he added. A consumer can apply through the single-window facility by either going to the respective discom’s portal or calling 7011931880 or 19123 (BRPL), 19124 (TPDDL) and 011-35999808 (BYPL). The applicant can visit the portal and view EV chargers empanelled by the government, compare prices and order online or call. Applications can choose to opt for a new electrical connection, including pre-paid meter, to get reduced EV tariff or can continue with the existing connection. After the subsidy of up to Rs 6,000 for light EV chargers, the cost will be reduced to Rs 2,500, which can be paid upfront or through a monthly subscription payment model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/single-window-facility-to-install-ev-chargers/articleshow/87593544.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Police had allowed the sale, purchase and bursting of only green crackers between 8pm and 10pm during Diwali. Some 23 offences were registered at different police stations against fire-cracker traders and other citizens violating the norms for crackers. In two days, city police control room received 44 calls related to crackers, with the callers sharing complaints regarding a number of issues, ranging from violations of time limit, sale of prohibited crackers, disputes over bursting and noise. Police, who had allowed only green crackers for sale and bursting, went ahead to enforce the rule at multiple levels involving local police stations, crime branch and special squads. CP Amitesh Kumar issued a notification under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) prohibiting any crackers without ‘green label’ and also allowing to burst them only between 8pm and 10pm. “We had repeated meetings with stakeholders alerting them about the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines regarding green crackers, norms of restricted decibels, and also timing regulations. Our stand was clear about taking action. Whoever did not follow the norms faced action,” he said. The top cop said commando beat marshals were rushed to any location from where citizens alerted police through 112 emergency number regarding cracker-related issues. “Prompt reaction and timely intervention helped police avoid several untoward incidents related to crackers,” he said adding several police vehicles were sent on patrolling and also were asked to remain alert regarding sale, stocking and bursting of crackers in violation of time frame. “Separate teams of assistant CPs and zonal and crime DCPs were keeping surveillance too,” said the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-remove-polluting-crackers-worth-rs4-lakh-from-market/articleshow/87573367.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Delhi: Women construction workers bear ailments as occupational hazards||NEW DELHI: From breathing difficulty to skin diseases — most women construction workers put up with these ailments as “occupational hazards” with no access to regular health checkups on work sites. In a study that profiles 390 women construction workers in Delhi, to understand their perceptions about pollution, 87% indicated they could suffer from lung disease and coughs due to their occupation. Apart from this, the respondents were of the view that air pollution at construction sites could cause redness in the eyes (52%), breathing issues (49%), skin problems (45%) and heart problems (4%). Nearly 75% respondents reported feeling sick or uncomfortable when the air quality is bad. Several women participants during the ‘focus group discussions’ stated that they suffered from skin diseases and had to consult doctors. Some of them also complained about breathing issues and body aches due to carrying heavy loads at construction sites. In construction, most women are involved in unskilled manual jobs like carrying cement, sand and bricks, helping in preparing cement mortar and carrying it, digging, breaking stones etc. A few women do brick laying (17%) and plastering of walls (8%). These findings are part of a first of its kind study that highlights the sheer lack of focus on the impact of environmental pollution on women construction workers. It brings out the gender perspective from three resettlement colonies — Sawda Ghevra, Bakkarwala and Gokulpuri — in Delhi. The study makes a case for more studies and awareness building on the subject. Serious environmental problems flagged by the women included the problem of open drainage in the colonies where they lived (60%), supply of contaminated water and irregular water supply (55%), open defecation (40%), unsanitary conditions (38%) and air pollution from various sources (37%). People are generally unaware of PM2.5, PM10 particles and Air Quality Index. Majority of the respondents (83%) were aware about the importance of sprinkling water to control construction dust. Slightly less than 50% reported such measures being practiced at the place of their work. Nearly 68% women felt that focusing on air pollution on work sites may negatively influence growth and employment. Around 40% of the respondents reported that there is fear among women construction workers to talk about the issue of air pollution at the sites. Amongst them around, 80% of the women feared losing their jobs if they voiced concerns. This fear was evident in focused group discussions too. “This study was aimed at understanding ground realities to develop a strategic plan to build, increase and strengthen construction workers’ voices on the issue of air pollution in Delhi,” explained Roshini Suparna Diwakar from civil society organisation Mahila Housing Trust that conducted the study with Purpose and CMSR Consultants. MHT has now started a campaign to create a group of AQI ambassadors within the community in these resettlements to build awareness on pollution. Majority of the women workers surveyed for the study were poor — nearly 30% had annual income less than Rs 25,000 and slightly less than 50% had an annual income in the range of Rs 25,000-50,000. “As part of the awareness building exercise, women construction workers and community leaders have been trained in how to use portable AQI monitors and collect data on air quality,” Diwakar said. “With real-time, site-specific air quality data, women construction workers can take precautions to protect themselves and their families,” she added. The air quality data collected will be assessed by MHT to identify patterns and solution for them contextually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/women-construction-workers-bear-ailments-as-occupational-hazards/articleshow/87573647.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Delhi||Take action against principals of 12 colleges: Govt to Delhi University VC||NEW DELHI: Amid a tussle between Delhi government and the 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges over non-disbursal of grants, Directorate of Training and Technical Education has written to the DU vice-chancellor seeking disciplinary action against the principals of these institutions. Over the past few days, several teachers’ bodies have held protests against the delay in the release of the grants and stated that salaries of staff members had been pending for a couple of months. In the letter sent to DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh, Delhi government said, “The grant is released in four instalments based on utilisation certificates (UC) provided by the colleges. Instead of providing UCs on time, adhering to the conditions of pattern of assistance, managing accounts properly and evolving mechanisms for generation of internal resources, the principals have been inciting teachers and staff and creating a hostile educational environment.” The letter added, “The principals have been leading adverse critical and embarrassing chants. It is requested to take suitable disciplinary action against them under applicable rules.” Speaking to TOI, Singh said a response had been sought from the principals concerned. “If there is any substance in the government’s statement, we will act accordingly. This is an administrative matter and principals cannot be inciting staff members, if that is the case at all. We will wait for their responses,” he added. Criticising the government’s letter, Manoj Sinha, secretary of DU Principals’ Association, said, “DUPA condemns the attitude of Delhi government towards its own constituent colleges. Delhi government is reneging from its financial responsibilities and putting the blame on all those who are giving good counsel.” AK Bhagi, president of National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), said the letter had “strong ramifications”. “Instead of releasing funds, the government is indulging in blame-game and hurting the very fabric of DU. The letter mentions the colleges as affiliated, whereas they are actually constituent,” he added. Responding to queries, Atishi, chairperson, Delhi Vidhan Sabha standing committee on education, said, “According to the terms and conditions of the grant, it is necessary for college principals to submit UCs to get funds. However, the colleges delay this process every quarter. On one hand, the colleges do not fulfil the basic process, but on the other they say Delhi government is not giving funds.” “There is a lack of transparency in these colleges and they do not want to explain where the funds have been utilised. It is concerning that the principals incite teachers by spreading lies that Delhi government is not releasing funds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/take-action-against-principals-of-12-colleges-govt-to-du-vc/articleshow/87573372.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Meerut||UP: For 25 years, man fight against land grab by ex-MLA, vindicated||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Master Vijay Singh, 59 now, has spent the past 25 years protesting against the alleged grabbing of more than a thousand bighas of public land by a former MLA demanding its return. Some in Muzaffarnagar claim they've seen him sit outside the district magistrate (DM) office every single day during this time in his quest for justice. With patience and determination, he has sought to make an example of himself for many of his students, despite having lost his job as a teacher. An RTI reply has now proved that his cause was right all along. Singh started his protest when Shamli was part of Muzaffarnagar district, which is why he protested in front of the district's collectorate. In 2011, Shamli became a separate district and Singh was asked to protest at different premises. He responded by resuming his sit-in right in the middle of Muzaffarnagar, at Shiv Chowk. "Shamli was a new zila, with new offices and officers I didn't know. I was unaware of the system and also felt that my life was in danger there back then, as I was up against powerful people who maintained a stronghold in that area," he said. It was in April 2019 that Singh complained to the Shamli administration during chief minister Yogi Adityanath's rally in Kairana, after which an inquiry was set up. He says he was protesting at the rally site, where the DM of Shamli, who was also in attendance, came up to him and asked him to elaborate on the issue he was facing. Singh then handed over to him his complaint. After submission, he says he ran from pillar to post, asking authorities about the result of the inquiry. "I filed a right to information (RTI) query in October 2019, asking for a report of the inquiry. I received a response to the RTI request only a few days ago," he said. The reply, a copy of which has been exclusively accessed by TOI, and which included the report, proved that he was right all along. The report, which was finalised in October 2019 itself, reveals that the former MLA along with several of his associates, had illegal possession of the government land in Chausana village. The 17-page report states that several government records belonging to these farming lands were forged. Sources say that the report was sent to Lucknow long back, but no action was taken by authorities. When asked, the district magistrate of Shamli, Jasjeet Kaur, said, "It is an old matter and after it came to my notice, I instructed the sub-divisional magistrate of Oon to dig the details out. Action will be taken accordingly." Incidentally, Singh has been a silent agitator, credited with the release of many such encroached-upon lands, ever since he was 24-years-old. His crusade against the land mafia has earned him a place in the Limca Book of Records for the longest protest against illegal possession of public land by private actors. In 2012, he walked 600 km to Lucknow over 19 days to meet former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to create awareness about land encroachment. He has so far been able to secure the release of 300 bighas of land in different areas of Shamli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/25-yrs-on-rti-reply-vindicates-mans-fight-against-mla-on-govt-land-seize/articleshow/87572872.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Union road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari will attend the event to be held at railway ground in Pandharpur. The 220km stretch of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Palkhi Marg — from Hadapsar-Diveghat to Mohol — will be four-laned . The 130km stretch of the Sant Tukaram Palkhi Marg from Patas to Tondale-Bondale will also be four-laned. The highways will have a dedicated walkway for the safe passage of saint Dnyaneshwar and saint Tukaram 'Palkhi’ heading towards Pandharpur. The Palkhi routes have not been majorly altered. At some places where large eviction is needed especially across the villages, the ring roads bypassing the villages have been proposed. Modi will also dedicate several newly-built stretches and upgrade the existing ones at an expense of Rs 1,180 crore, which are total 223 km. These stretches connect to Pandharpur from different directions such as Mhaswad, Tembhuri, Sangola, Umadi and Kurduwadi. Temple opens for devotees The state government has allowed the authorities to reopen the Vitthal-Rukhmini temple for devotees ahead of the Kartiki Ekadashi, which falls on November 15 this year. The temple devotees will get Vitthal-Rukhmini darshan the whole day. The temple was shut for the past 20 months owing to Covid. Every year, 4 yatras takes place in Pandharpur on Ashadi Ekadashi, Magh Ekadashi, Chaitra Ekadashi and Kartiki Ekadashi. During Ashadi and Kartiki Ekadashi 8 to 10 lakh devotees termed as ‘warkaris’ visit the temple town from far-flung areas. During Covid last year, limited ‘warkaris’ were allowed to enter Pandharpur and curfew was imposed, which will not be the case this time. The temple town located on the banks of the Chandrabhaga river is witnessing the arrival of thousands of devotees every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pm-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-palkhi-marg-in-pandharpur/articleshow/87572283.cms||---

---||Agra||Fertilizer DAP being black marketed due to shortage, say Agra farmers||Agra: Short supply of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), second most consumed fertilizer in the country, has forced farmers in Agra region to delay sowing of potato, wheat, mustard and pulses. this Rabi season. The worst-affected are potato growers. Every day, farmers can be seen waiting for hours in long queues outside cooperative societies for the fertilizer. They have alleged largescale black marketing of DAP. The DAP requirement per acre is 100 kg, say farmers. As a result of the shortage, a sack of DAP weighing 50 kg with an MRP of Rs 1,210 is being sold for Rs 1,800 per bag, the farmers alleged. They have staged protests and blocked roads across the region, but to no avail. On their part, the agriculture department officials have assured farmers adequate supply of DAP by next week. They attribute the shortage to drop in import in the wake of a spurt in the global prices of DAP. Rajveer Lawaniya, Agra district president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said, “Being a basic nutrient for Rabi crops, the DAP fertilizer has to be sprinkled at the time of sowing crops like potato, wheat, mustard and pulses. Potato is a major rabi crop in the region. Running out of time, farmers have started sowing potatoes without DAP. This will reduce the yield by 60%.” He warned, “We will be launching an indefinite strike if the required supply of DAP is not ensured by the local authorities.’ Somveer Chahar of Malpura village said, “I have been coming to the local cooperative society to get DAP for the last eight days. Today (Sunday), I came at 4 am and even after waiting for the whole day, I was not able to get a single bag of DAP. Hundreds of farmers are facing the same situation.” He said the secretary of the cooperative society claimed that the point-of-sale machine is not working due to a network error and the DAP cannot be distributed. “I have to sow potatoes across 40 acres and need at least 80 bags. Sowing time is running out. We will permanently block the highway if the DAP is not provided to us.” Ravi Solanki, a Fatehpur Sikri-based farmer, claimed, “Traders in connivence with the government officials are selling the DAP at Rs 1,800 per bag as against Rs 1,200. We have complained to the local authorities, but no action has been taken”. When contacted, Vinod Kumar, deputy director, agriculture, Agra division, said, “Following the festive season, there has been some delay in distribution of DAP to the cooperative societies. Adequate supply of DAP will be ensured at all the purchase centres in the next one week. In case of non functioning of the point-of-sale machines or other technical glitches, the cooperative societies have been directed to provide DAP to the farmers by taking a copy of their Aadhaar card. We are taking action in cases of black marketing of DAP. So far, four FIRs have been registered and two shops have been sealed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fertilizer-dap-being-black-marketed-due-to-shortage-say-agra-farmers/articleshow/87572891.cms||Deepak Lavania

According to the data shared by the district authorities, more than 10 lakh vaccines were administered in October, while there were 12.2 lakh vaccine doses administered in September. “In September, not only the 10 lakh vaccination mark was crossed but also more than double the vaccines were administered than the previous month,” Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and district coordinator for vaccination said. In August, 5.93 lakh doses were administered. There are multiple reasons for the drop in the number of vaccines in October, which include the easing of the Covid restrictions and change in priorities of the people. The festival time and harvest seasons were other reasons. “The change in priorities was one of the most important reasons for the drop in the vaccination. The harvesting also takes place in October and it was the time just before Diwali, as a result of which the farmers neglected the vaccination campaign completely,” said Dr Shailesh Nikam, the district vaccination incharge of Nashik Zilla Parishad. The people wanted to avoid a break due to temperature and other health reasons associated with the vaccine as they wanted to perform harvesting in the field.Another important factor behind the negligence was a drop in the covid cases to a new low. “The people told our health activists and employees that they were not keen on taking vaccinations as the covid has now reduced to nothing. But this is a wrong assumption as the cases are creating havoc in a significant number of countries and we need to take all the steps to ensure the third wave is not as serious as the second wave,” Nikam added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-in-nashik-dist-drops-by-15-in-october/articleshow/87572289.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Agra||Agra: Activist works to gracefully dispose of old idols after Diwali||AGRA: A social activist began his campaign by driving a tempo loader on the roads of Agra during Diwali to collect old idols of Goddess Laxmi and Lord Ganesh, in order to take them to the ghats of the Yamuna river for respectful disposal. Supported by an organisation called Brahmin Parishad, social worker Sunil Dubey, 42, aims to dispose of at least 20,000 such idols near Hathi Ghat on Monday. “It is time for new clothes, gift items, and new idols of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Laxmi on Diwali. However, people do not respectfully dispose of the older idols. We find them placed under Sacred Fig (Peepal) trees, on footpaths, or worse, on garbage piles and even alongside drains," says Sunil. “Last year, I decided to do my bit and ensure a graceful disposal of these old idols, but due to a lack of public awareness and Covid-19, results were not as satisfactory. This year, we planned it in advance and discussed the idea at a meeting of Brahmin Parishad in Agra. Designated centers were chosen, asking citizens to place their old idols at these centers numbering 101 in the city" said Sunil, who was made convenor of this exercise. "The results were encouraging and we began collecting old idols from Saturday onward. We did not confine ourselves to centers but picked up old idols lying everywhere. We collected four tempos full of load by Sunday," he said. General secretary of Brahmin Parishad, Brahmadutt Sharma, said, “Nagar Nigam of Agra has extended us support and has dug the ‘kund’ (well) on Hathi Ghat of the Yamuna river, where we expect to dispose of at least 20,000 pairs of Ganesh and Laxmi idols by Monday afternoon. Twenty-one Brahmins would render mantras for a ceremonious visarjan of these idols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/activist-works-to-gracefully-dispose-of-old-idols-after-diwali/articleshow/87572886.cms||Deepak Lavania

In 2018, the then chief wildlife warden, Ishwar Singh, had prepared a three-year plan to sterilise monkeys of reproductive age to curb the simian menace in the national capital. The Centre sanctioned Rs 5.43 crore to forest department in January 2019 for sterilisation of 8,000 monkeys in the first year. In 2007, Delhi High Court had asked civic bodies to catch monkeys from human habitations and shift them to Asola sanctuary. It had directed the forest department to provide the animals food so that they do not venture out. Deputy conservator of forests (south division) Amit Anand said the department cannot conduct sterilisation on its own due to “shortage of manpower”. He added that sterilisation may not yield the desired results as “an alpha male captured will be replaced by another male”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-a-monkey-sterilised-in-city-since-jan-2019-officials/articleshow/87573392.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Vaxx drive resumes, but gets poor response||Aurangabad: The vaccination drive that resumed in Aurangabad district after a gap of three days saw hardly 1,394 inoculations till Sunday evening, as per official data on the Co-WIN portal. As many as 66 vaccination sites across the district were administering doses on Sunday, but lower turnout of beneficiaries was observed at different centres. The district administration has already appealed to the citizens to get vaccinated before November 30, failing to which curbs will be imposed on sale of fuel or undertaking travel among other restrictions. Health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr Paras Mandlecha said beneficiaries who are yet to get the first or the second dose of the vaccine should become fully vaccinated before the stipulated deadline. “The vaccine hesitancy among some people is irrational. As the vaccination drive has resumed now after a brief gap, we are taking efforts to enhance the vaccination coverage by reaching out to the left out beneficiaries by door-to-door drive and phone calls,” he said. “No spurt in fresh cases of Covid-19 in past few weeks may has made many people complacent in their approach towards the vaccination after taking the first dose. We must realize that the onset of the third-wave predicted by experts is delayed due to mass vaccination,” authorities said. As per official data, Aurangabad district has witnessed 25.16 lakh vaccinations against Covid-19 so far, including 17.83 lakh first does. Notably, Aurangabad has figured among the districts with low percentage of fully vaccinated individuals. The district administration, during a recent review meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, attributed heavy rainfall in the region and associated issues in slowed down pace of vaccination against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-vaxx-drive-resumes-but-gets-poor-response/articleshow/87572310.cms||---

---||Goa||Malfunctioning ACs put state library’s ancient texts at risk||Panaji: The airconditioners at the Krishnadas Shama state central library, which had malfunctioned nearly two years ago, are yet to be made fully functional on all floors. This has posed a risk to the centuries-old texts — some dating to the 16th century — housed here. The ancient texts and manuscripts require non-humid conditions for optimum preservation. “The building was built with air-conditioning to maintain a uniform temperature throughout the day for the preservation of books. Now, however, the ACs function only on a few floors. The last floor has books that date back to 400 years ago and yet there is no functional air-conditioning,” sources from the library said. When asked about it, minister for art and culture Govind Gaude downplayed the issue by saying that these are “technical problems” for which “work is going on”. Heritage activist, Sanjeev Sardesai had written to Gaude bringing to his attention how the fully glass-clad interiors of the library have become a furnace due to the non-functioning of ACs. Speaking to TOI, Sardesai said that the whole point of ACs being installed was to protect the books against the climatic conditions in Goa. “We have books that are worth their weight in gold and we cannot compromise on such inefficiencies when it comes to our priceless heritage. The decision makers have not taken any pains to understand the connection of these books to the land of Goa,” Sardesai said. Following Sardesai’s letter and reports in the media about the non-functioning ACs, cooling was restored on some floors of the building. The library was built by Digambar Kamat-led government and was ready for inaguration when Manohar Parrikar became chief minister in 2012 and as such the ACs are due to repairs or replacement. Problems first occurred in December 2019, on the fifth floor, owing to which the load factor was on the fourth floor. Soon after, the fourth floor lost air-conditioning leaving the burden of the load factor on the third floor. Needless to say, it wasn’t very long before the third floor also lost air-conditioning. The failure of the maintenance contractor to turn up to rectify the issue led to non-payment of dues amounting to the tune of Rs 12 lakh. Sources from the library said that the staff managed with fans, but that only cut the heat.. prior to this, even the motion sensors at the library’s entrance had got damaged and had been left unrepaired, which resulted in the sliding doors being left open for nearly six months. “Currently, the ACs on two floors are functioning — first and second — while work is going on to restore air-conditioning on the other floors. This is a phase-wise process of restoration. We intend to complete the works by December pending government approvals,” curator in-charge Ashok Parab said, adding that if the code of conduct is implemented for the upcoming state assembly elections, the process may get further delayed. Director of art and culture Sagun Velip, who holds responsibility for the library, said that the annual maintenance contractor is no longer handling the repair work “We are going to write to the PWD for a feasibility report and accordingly replace the entire system. Else, we will have to continue struggling with it the way we have been struggling from the past one year. Unless we get the report, we cannot replace the entire airconditioning system,” director of art and culture Velip told TOI. Despite the best efforts of the custodians of the building, the texts may continue to receive step-child treatment until the government intervenes to maintain the library and its books in the interest of the rare material. “The library is not a mall. There is a rich collection of books at the library, which need to be showcased and preserved for posterity. Instead, we are showing visitors what is on the outside: a tall building. The restoration of the ACs must be taken up on priority to preserve the texts. They represent not just the history of Goa, but world history,” said researcher and retired assistant state librarian, Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/malfunctioning-acs-put-state-librarys-ancient-texts-at-risk/articleshow/87573867.cms||Nida Sayed

Agitated about this, farmers gheraoed multiplexes and stopped the film screening again on Sunday. Farmers warned multiplex owners of “harsh action” leading to “disastrous results” if they screened the film again. Multiplex owners said tickets were sold online and they had stopped selling tickets at the window, because of which they had to screen the film. Farmers disrupted screening of the film at Dhillon Plaza and Cosmo Plaza. In August this year, farmers stopped screening of another Akshay Kumar starrer. Farmers from protest sites at Dappar toll plaza and Ajitpur toll plaza had reached outside the multiplex to stop the film screening. BKU (Sidhupur), Zirakpur president Hardeep Singh Baltana said, “On the one hand, Bollywood actors claim that they are supporting farmers but they are actually working at the behest of PM Narendra Modi. We will not allow any Bollywood film shooting in Punjab.” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), Mohali vice-president Kirpal Singh Siau said, “Narendra Modi has planned to ruin the future of farmers and actors like Akshay Kumar are blindly following his footsteps.

Addressing the second convocation of DRPCAU on the premises of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Horticulture and Forestry College here, Naidu stressed on the need to promote agro-based industries in rural areas to create employment opportunities for the rural youth. Referring to the phenomena of reverse migration from cities to villages during the Covid pandemic, he said entrepreneurship in agriculture could immensely benefit the Indian economy by creating jobs in areas where they are needed the most. Naidu said it was a pleasure for him to be part of the convocation in the “historically important land of Champaran” where Mahatma Gandhi had experimented his first satyagrah in support of poor farmers in 1917. The Vice-President thanked former Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh for transforming Piprakothi into a centre of agricultural education and research. “His efforts are in tune with Bapu’s vision of placing farmers’ interests above everything,” Naidu said. Piprakothi has become home to multiple farmer-centric institutes, such as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Horticulture and Forestry College and the Centre of Excellence in Embryo Transfer Technology. He appreciated DRPCAU for maintaining high educational standard. “In the past, Nalanda University and Vikramshila University had made Bihar a source of inspiration and enlightenment. These two universities had played a pivotal role in making India a ‘vishwaguru’,” Naidu said. He welcomed the decision of DRPCAU to start more technical and entrepreneurship-oriented courses in mushroom production. “The university’s startup incubation centre will help students start their own businesses,” Naidu added. He said the ‘Sukhet model’, an innovative idea of DRPCAU under which garbage and dung are collected from houses and then converted into vermicompost (organic manure), had been applauded by PM Narendra Modi in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Altogether 47 students of the university were awarded gold medals at the convocation, including six by Naidu. The Vice-President also inaugurated the administrative building of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Horticulture and Forestry College, two new hostels (one each for girls and boys) and Centre of Excellence on Indigenous Breeds and Conservation and Improvement Centre. He laid foundation for several buildings which will be constructed with an expenditure of Rs 100 crore. Addressing the convocation, CM Nitish Kumar said the state government has done a lot of work in the field of agriculture in the last 17 years. “Agriculture is the main pillar of the state’s economy. We are working on the agriculture road map of the state and production of wheat, paddy and maize has doubled,” the CM said. Others who attended the event included governor Phagu Chauhan, deputy CM Renu Devi, state agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh, law minister Pramod Kumar, former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh and director general of ICAR, New Delhi, Trilochan Mahapatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/naidu-calls-for-promotion-of-agro-based-industries/articleshow/87572933.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey
---||Kolkata||Darjeeling toy train logos registered, two decades after heritage tag||KOLKATA: Indian Railways has registered the historic logos of the iconic “toy train” of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) internationally as its intellectual property (IP), more than two decades after DHR was declared a World Heritage site by Unesco. While DHR plans to monetize the logos by using them on souvenirs, any use of the logo anywhere in the world would, from now on, require permission and the payment of a fee. DHR was declared a World Heritage Site on December 5, 1999 by Unesco. The toy train service was built between 1879 and 1881, and is about 88km long. The long leisurely climb up snaking, picture-postcard mountain roads, from 328ft above sea level at New Jalpaiguri to about 7,218ft at Darjeeling, through Ghum, India’s highest railway station (7,407 ft) has been a must-do for tourists over the years who want to soak in the hills, minus the hurry of a daily commute. And while the service has been modernised (six diesel locomotives handle most of the scheduled service), a large portion of the Raj-era’s quaint heritage has been preserved. The Red Panda service from Darjeeling to Kurseong, a short ride targeted at tourists, still uses vintage British-built B-Class steam locomotives, for instance. DHR was recently picked up by the United Nations Postal Administration for making it part of the World Heritage Site stamp series. Before applying for registering the logos, DHR worked hard to restore the original artwork on the walls of stations. “We mined archives to retrieve the oldest available artwork,” said DHR director A K Mishra, adding that some station buildings had the original logo intact. “Original documents and other items were retrieved. The logo is India’s national property. We need to protect it.” The century-old logos — DHR has two — have a lot of history behind them and are popular across the world. They were randomly used by different agencies on merchandise, both at home and abroad. They were found used in Europe, particularly in the UK, and even in the US. Since they were not registered internationally, nothing could be done about such usage. One of the two DHR logos is in bold black-and-white intertwined letters; the other, with a circular seal with a picture of mountains, forests and a river with “Darjeeling Himalayan Railway” written in white letters, is on a green background. The Railway Board in Delhi and the DHR office in Kurseong initiated the process of registering the logo with the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry in August. It was then sent to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a specialized agency of the United Nations based in Geneva, Switzerland. The documentations were made in accordance with the procedure laid down in WIPO’s Vienna Classification. There is a six-month window for registering counter-claims, following which the Indian government’s claim will receive international approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/darj-toy-train-logos-registered-two-decades-after-heritage-tag/articleshow/87573863.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The target set by the Kolhapur administration is 10 days ahead of the state government’s deadline of November 30. Currently, 84% beneficiaries above 18 years have received their first dose and 41% have been fully vaccinated. The district, which was among the top districts in the state for vaccination, has now slipped to ninth position due to less turnout of beneficiaries due to festival and misinformation spread through social media platforms. Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “We have planned according to the target set and expect the first dose vaccination to be completed by November 20. Several initiatives like vaccination of college youths, focus on villages with low turnout and counselling by the religious leaders have been planned.” So far, 145 villages have achieved 100% first dose vaccination in Kolhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-sets-nov-20-deadline-for-100-1st-dose-coverage/articleshow/87572321.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Exit Fairy Queen, enter Vande Bharat trainset at Rail Bhavan||NEW DELHI: Soon, a replica of the Vande Bharat trainset would replace the Fairy Queen steam locomotive at the Rail Bhavan in the capital. The proposed symbolic move gains importance in view of the government’s focus on the modernisation of Indian Railways and projection of the indigenous semi-high speed train as the sign of the changing face of the national transporter. Currently, the Fairy Queen is placed in front of the Rail Bhavan, headquarters of Indian Railways. It had made it to the Guiness Book of Records as the world’s oldest steam locomotive in regular service. Sources said the integral coach factory (ICF) at Chennai, which manufactured the first two Vande Bharats, is finalising the replica of the trainset that would be put in the Rail Bhavan complex. “The Vande Bharat trainsets signify the transformational changes happening in the railways in respect of quality ride, comfort, adoption of modern technology and speed of travel. So, there is more focus to manufacture and roll out more such trains,” said a senior official. Vande Bharat trains are equipped with upgraded amenities as well as better seating, security, and surveillance systems along with fire-proof features. The next generation of these trains will have more modern features. The government has prioritised the operation of 75 Vande Bharat trainsets, connecting major cities, by August 2023. Sources said even the trains that private operators would bring in future would be trainsets, which don’t require a separate locomotive to run the train as these are self-propelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exit-fairy-queen-enter-vande-bharat-trainset-at-rail-bhavan/articleshow/87573403.cms||Dipak K Dash

According to the inquiry report, the woman was due for delivery on December 21. She was advised to have an ultrasound to ascertain fetal well being. “The patient never reported back to the doctor or got an ultrasound done as per record,” said the director, health services, UT, Dr Suman Singh. In the report, the UT health department said that when the report of home delivery was received, a health team was sent to the woman’s house to check on her and the baby. They were both found to be in good condition. “The child had already been fully immunised as per protocol and the lady had already been prescribed necessary medication. Both the mother and the child are healthy and doing fine,” said the DHS. An enquiry was marked to the medical superintendent, GMSH-16, Chandigarh. The findings were to be reported in three days. “The sudden strike by some of the NHM staff and termination of their contractual appointment has no relation with the issue as alleged,” said Yashpal Garg, secretary health, UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/home-delivery-in-dhanas-mother-baby-doing-fine/articleshow/87572924.cms||---

---||Meerut||UP: At 84, retired engineer shows how to bridge the gap between village and fields||MEERUT: A Gandhi cap on his head and a walking cane in his hand, Iqbal Singh, 84, of Baghpat’s Bamnauli village can be found supervising at the site of an under-construction bridge across Krishni river, a tributary of the Hindon. The bridge is ready with a lintel on the top and will be operational in about 15 days, said Singh, a former senior engineer of the Bridge Corporation who retired in 1997 and returned to his roots at Bamnauli village. Speaking with TOI, he said nearly one fourth of the farmers of his village, with a population of 15,000, have their agricultural land across the Krishni, a trickle of a river with little water most of the year. They have to wade through the murky water and marshy land to go and tend to their fields every day due to the absence of a bridge, he added. Till recently, the residents had to make do with a makeshift wooden plank arrangement for crossing but not without frequent mishaps that left both man and cattle injured and caused destruction of harvested crops thrown off toppled carts. But the makeshift planks could not sustain because of heavy rains this monsoon, said Singh. Yashwant Singh, a resident of Bamnauli village, said, “This time, the rainfall was heavy during and post monsoon. The heavy flow of water submerged the planks completely, cutting off villagers from their fields. It was then the idea of constructing a bridge emerged as the authorities turned a deaf ear to our repeated requests and applications for a bridge.” With years of experience in building bridges, the octogenarian engineer chalked out a blueprint of a bridge that would endure. As Singh put it, “It can withstand a weight of up to three tons, good enough to ferry tractor trolleys and bullock carts. Heavy vehicles anyway cannot be used as the bridge doesn't connect to roads but farmlands.” Singh had played a major role in construction of seven bridges and flyovers in Delhi during Asiad ’82 and later, was instrumental in constructing a 1.25-km-long Chandi Ghat bridge in Haridwar. He motivated the farmers to crowdfund and now, the bridge is almost ready and that too, at a cost of Rs 5 lakh. Singh has personally supervised its construction. The administration too has recognized the combined achievement of the villagers. Raj Kamal Yadav, Baghpat district magistrate, said, "I really commend upon the will of the villagers in this regard in a positive way though I am not sure about the structural stability of the facility created there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/at-84-retd-engr-shows-how-to-bridge-the-gap-between-village-and-fields/articleshow/87572929.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bar association ex-president convicted for assaulting woman lawyer in 1994||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has convicted a former president of Delhi High Court Bar Association for assaulting a woman lawyer in 1994, saying the association is undisputedly a very strong and formidable body of lawyers and more often, police is very slow in taking any action when it comes to lawyers. Chief metropolitan magistrate Gajender Singh Nagar held Rajiv Khosla guilty for the offences under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(i) (criminal intimidation) of IPC. Complainant Sujata Kohli, who was a lawyer then, had alleged on July 29, 1994, that Khosla asked her to join a seminar on proposed ‘family courts’ but she said she was busy. The complaint further claimed that she was threatened with withdrawal of all facilities provided by the bar association. A civil suit was filed by Kohli, who retired as district and sessions judge last year, seeking appropriate injunction, but her table and chair was removed from the spot. She further alleged in her complaint that on August 5 Khosla, along with a mob of lawyers, came and assaulted her. The court said, “It is common knowledge that nowadays, people are becoming self-centred and they find it safe to keep mum even if they see injustice being done to any person. This is becoming a harsh reality these days.” It further noted that even prior to recording the statement of the complainant and registering the FIR, the police officer was more interested in inquiring from other lawyers present there and recording signed statements of the alleged accused and others who were stating that no such incident had taken place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bar-association-ex-prez-convicted-of-assaulting-woman-lawyer-in-1994/articleshow/87573404.cms||---

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: After March audit, Ahmednagar hospital was told to install fire-fighting gear||NASHIK: The fire brigade department had earlier this year advised the Ahmednagar civil hospital, where 11 Covid patients died in a blaze on Saturday, to set up proper fire-fighting equipment in the entire premises. The department gave this suggestion after conducting a fire audit at the hospital in March. The fire that broke out at 10.30am was due to a short-circuit in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital, which has more than 500 beds. Four women were among the 11 who died. The victims died either of suffocation or burn injuries. An eight-member committee has been formed to look into the cause of the fire. Shankar Misal, chief fire officer, Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade, told TOI, “There was no fire alarm system in the ICU, which is mandatory for any fire-related emergency. The ICU did not have water sprinklers and the water pipeline was not of the desired requirement. The ICU had no smoke detector or fire hydrant.” Misal said such equipment were absent not just in the ICU, but in the entire hospital. The ICU, located on the ground floor of the hospital, became operational last year after the Covid pandemic broke out. The block had been constructed to treat women and children but was converted into a Covid ward. District collector Rajendra Bhosale admitted that there were issues related to fire safety in the ICU. He said equipment like water hydrant and water sprinklers should have been in place at the time of construction itself. He said it becomes challenging to take up additional work when the wards are operational. As of Sunday, there were 25 patients admitted to the general ward of the hospital. Senior officials said the other 20-bed ICU of the hospital is intact. Seriously-ill patients can be shifted to this ICU if needed, they added. However, after Saturday’s fire incident, no new patient had been admitted to the ICU. Six patients in the ICU were shifted to other hospitals in the city. Those responsible will not be spared: Health minister Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Sunday said the eight-member team, headed by divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, investigating the cause of the fire, has been directed to submit its report within 8 days. “Anyone found responsible for the fire incident will not be spared. The committee comprising fire experts and health experts are working to find the reason behind the incident,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/post-audit-anagar-hosp-was-told-to-install-fire-fighting-gear/articleshow/87572938.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Rs 5-crore power theft in 5 years at Virar factory, 4 directors booked||MUMBAI: The MSEDCL has detected power theft to the tune of Rs 4.93 crore at an ice factory in Virar. An FIR was registered at Virar police station on November 4 against four directors of the firm, and a fifth person who helped them in the alleged pilferage. An official said: “An MSEDCL team carried out a surprise check at the premises on October 30-31. The officials came across a few remote controls and gadgets which were being used to tamper with the electricity meter and to fudge the [power usage] readings. During a detailed probe in the first week of November, the officials found that the firm had pilfered 27.8 lakh units of electricity between November 2016 and October 2021. The total theft was valued at Rs 4.93 crore and an FIR was subsequently registered at Virar police station on November 4.” Notices have been issued for recovery of this sum along with a penalty. The accused persons have been booked under section 138 (punishable action against the consumer when he has not himself broken the seal) and 150 (abetment of crime) under the Electricity Act, 2003. Power theft is a major issue in localities where MSEDCL supplies electricity. In September, 127 electricity theft cases had been registered against consumers across Mumbai region in a massive check conducted against rigging of meters and keeping them constant at 0-30 units of consumption for several months. “This was a new modus operandi to show that there is some consumption which is low. We are now checking all meters which have 0 to 30 unit consumption to ensure that there is no rigging,” an official added. Sources said that more than 3.3 lakh such meters with 0-30 units of reading have been checked by MSEDCL field staff so far. The power utility firm has also noticed that those facing temporary disconnections across Mumbai metropolitan region due to non-payment of bills since April 2020 are resorting to power pilferage. Officials have been directed to get FIRs registered in most cases so there is stringent punishment for the offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-5cr-power-theft-in-5-yrs-at-virar-factory-4-directors-booked/articleshow/87573873.cms||Somit Sen

---||Nagpur||NU move to rope in MKCL without tendering under scanner||Nagpur: Even after stiff opposition from statutory body members, Nagpur University has gone ahead and awarding a contract to Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL). NU has awarded the first semester examination work to the Pune-based company, as reported by TOI on October 27. However, the entire deal with the company has come under the scanner after members questioned NU administration led by vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari about the deal. They have asked how the work was allotted to a “blacklisted” company that too without floating any tender. Accusing VC and team of not maintaining transparency, the members have decided to strongly oppose the move to rope in MKCL without consulting statutory bodies like Academic Council, Senate and Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE). They warned that they would corner the VC over such “unilateral” decisions and also lodge a complaint with chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, and higher education director Dhanraj Mane in this regard. Senate member Mohan Bajpayee, who was opposing MKCL right from 2009, said they were shocked to hear the news that the university is reintroducing a company that had miserably failed to provide any of the e-services promised, despite charging Rs50 from each of the students. “How can they rope in the company on an old agreement of 2011-12 after it was ousted on account of its extremely poor performance. Moreover, no tender was floated before awarding the contract. And what was the urgency to bring MKCL at this stage? Obviously, the VC is under some political pressure. Else there is no other reason behind his move,” he said. Endorsing his stand, another Senate member Pravin Udapure said inclusion of a ‘blacklisted’ company puts a big question mark on the VC’s move. “Ideally, NU should have floated nationwide tenders, before awarding the sensitive work of examination, as the future of lakhs of students is directly associated with it. The administration also kept the statutory members in the dark before awarding the contract to MKCL. We will strongly raise the issue during the next Senate meeting scheduled after Diwali on November 11 or 12,” he told TOI. Box NU writes to MKCL MD for starting services A letter written by registrar Raju Hiwase to MKCL managing director has asked the company to restart its services as per an agreement between them in 2011-12, as early as possible. A copy of the letter, in possession of TOI, told the Pune based company to make suitable changes in its software as per current needs of the university’s students and administration. Surprisingly, the letter is addressed to Vivek Sawant, who has left the MD’s post, and is now operating as the company’s chief mentor. Currently, Veena Kamant is looking after MD’s charge as per MKCL’s website. Citing a decision taken by the NU Management Council during its emergent meeting on October 11, the registrar added that with VC’s permission, the administration has decided to award first semester exam work to MKCL and therefore, it should start taking charge for the forthcoming winter examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-move-to-rope-in-mkcl-without-tendering-under-scanner/articleshow/87572948.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Maintaining electronic health record new trend||Nagpur: “Dear Mr xxx, your follow-up consultation with Dr yyy is approaching in 2 days. Please call to schedule your appointment. Thanks.” Buzzing of such messages on mobile phones has become a part of life for many patients these days. SMSes not only remind about the follow-up consultation date but also about the periodic blood test and cardiac check-up, change in medicines and review of the ongoing prescription. Maintaining an electronic record of health is very much here, and many are already having their e-health record. The pandemic has given a never before boost to this trend. “I have observed that patients who have regular follow up don’t need emergency admission and neither do they suffer from any acute illness. I have kept the record of patients totally online. I can access this record from anywhere,” said cardiologist Dr Amar Amale. Like Amale, most tech-savvy doctors in Nagpur maintain their patients’ record electronically. Now, going a step forward, even patients are maintaining their e-health record. “Most of my medical records, right from blood reports to prescriptions, are in my mobile phone. I can share it with my doctor anytime. This is convenient for all of us,” said Suresh Patel, a retired government employee. Another evidence of more takers for the e-health record is the launch of a multinational health profile platform in Nagpur. “We have launched our platform ‘Linkedcare’ in Nagpur. It’s free for patients. One can maintain a full lifetime health record on this plarform,” said Hans-Ethard Reiter, president and CEO of the group. According to Reiter, patients can create a digitally secure Health ID which allows them to access and share their health data with healthcare providers. Even the national health authority of central government’s ministry of health and family welfare has made a digital health ecosystem available for the common man. “Health ID is the future of healthcare. You can make one for free on the NDHM website. This will allow you to access information, right from admission to treatment and discharge in a paperless manner. It’s an integral part of Ayushman Bharat,” said a senior official from the divisional health office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maintaining-electronic-health-record-new-trend/articleshow/87573414.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Enhanced constituency allowance to be taken up in house meet||Barinderjit.saluja Panchkula: The agenda for enhanced constituency allowance for Panchkula MC will be raised for approval in the house meeting scheduled for November 12. An announcement to the effect was made by mayor Kulbhushan Goyal. He said this would be one of the 21 agenda items to be brought for approval. The proposal is to increase councillors’ constituency allowance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month. It is also proposed to give an additional Rs 500 for monthly house meet. The mayor said that enhancement in constituency allowance comes in the wake of the demand made by councillors. In the case of Mohali, the Punjab local bodies department put the issue of increase in constituency allowance in the backburner saying that it could not be increased only for one municipal corporation. It was stated that this is a policy matter which is to be decided only by the cabinet for MC’s all over the state. Increase in constituency allowance for Panchkula is also uop to the Haryana cabinet to decide and then again, it cannot be done only for one MC. The other agendas are lake, coffee house and MC guest house, to come up near education city in Chandimandir. All the community centers are to be named after martyrs and monthly fee to be reduced from Rs 500 to Rs 200. The MC will also bring in the agenda of constructing a multi-level parking in every sector of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/enhanced-constituency-allowance-to-be-taken-up-in-house-meet/articleshow/87572947.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Pune||Maharashtra’s tuberculosis, Covid-19 coinfection rate 0.5%: Report||PUNE: Despite screening every newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) patient for Covid, the TB-Covid coinfection rate has remained under than 1% in Maharashtra. Going by the state health department’s latest report, 709 of 1.36 lakh patients with underlying TB — subjected to compulsory Covid screening between January and September this year — tested positive for coronavirus, pegging the state’s TB-Covid coinfection rate at 0.5%. The coinfection rate is very low compared to Covid infection rate among the general population, which at a minimum is up to 3%. Experts have, however, stressed on extensive studies to gauge TB patients’ exact vulnerability by expanding the Covid diagnosis. Currently, TB patients are screened compulsorily for Covid, but only once. Despite TB being a chronic disease, the status of Covid infection is not captured periodically unless the patient exhibits worsening symptoms, experts have underlined. “When TB is a chronic disease, screening a patient only once would only lead to a misleading picture. A TB patient should be evaluated for Covid also during TB treatment when s/he shows symptoms. Free Covid testing should be done at least once in two or three months depending upon the virus transmission activity in the community at the time,” said medical practitioner Sanjay Dabhadhe. Besides, the government needs to prioritize Covid screening among all TB patients in terms of improved coverage, quality of screening, supervision, and monitoring, he added. Experts have also drawn attention to ensuring compulsory Covid screening among TB patients seeking care from private medical practitioners. “The compulsory Covid screening norm is being implemented in state and municipal corporation-run health centres/TB units, but it is unclear whether private doctors are following the norm,” a state health department official, requesting anonymity, said. “The figures say that coinfection is not uncommon. One has to be extremely careful to not miss the coexistence of these diseases,” chest physician Mahavir Modi said. “There may be less prevalence of coinfection, but that is likely because TB patients were more careful and had more protective gear than the general population. Besides, we also need scientific studies to find if there is an immunogenic mechanism involved,” Modi said. A history of active as well as latent TB can also increase the risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nearly 2 lakh people are diagnosed with TB every year in India. In the state, nearly 20,000 are diagnosed per month. In 2018, an estimated 1 crore people contracted TB worldwide. Maharashtra started screening TB patients for Covid-19 the after Union government-issued bi-directional screening of Covid-19 and TB started in September 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-tuberculosis-covid-19-coinfection-rate-0-5-report/articleshow/87572941.cms||Umesh Isalkar

These repainted school buildings was undertaken by the Santosh Lad Foundation, which is headed by former minister Santosh Lad. The foundation launched an initiative, which entailed giving old government school buildings, houses and bus terminals a new splash of colour. Launched on October 2 to mark Gandhi Jayanti, the foundation has thus far repainted more than 2,000 schools, bus terminals and houses. The strained finances of a vast cross-section of society impelled the foundation to come forward to do its bit to improve the lot of those who were hit the hardest by the pandemic-induced crisis. While government school buildings in Kalghatagi and Alnavar taluks in Dharwad district now wear a new look, those in Kudligi, Sandur and Harpanhalli in Ballari don a bright new avatar that is certain to uplift the spirits of students. Santosh Lad was motivated to launch, through his foundation, such an initiative when, during a visit to Gollarahatti in Kudligi taluk, he saw an old woman living alone in a decrepit house. “When I offered to paint the house for her, she readily accepted, after which I decided to offer to repaint houses of those in need, regardless of caste, creed and community,” the former minister said. Santosh Lad was particularly impressed with the enthusiasm of the volunteers – more than a hundred of them threw themselves into the initiative with gusto. “Our objective, when we began, was to repaint at least 10,000 buildings – schools, bus terminals, houses, et al – and we have already reached a fifth of that target,” he added. Santosh Lad Foundation president Anand Kalal pointed out that it was the owners of the homes that decided on the shade of the paint that they wanted to adorn their houses. “As we travelled from one village to the other, we decided to give a facelift to old government school buildings and bus terminals, which were not in great shape,” said Kalal, adding that the foundation bore all the expenses for the paint. Former Dharwad zilla panchayat president SR Patil, a resident of Mukkal village, was all praise for the initiative undertaken by the Santosh Lad Foundation. “It was very difficult for the villagers to continue our tradition of painting houses afresh during the festive season owing to the financial crisis. Although work on painting of many houses in our village was scheduled to start, it was delayed owing to the rain,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/santosh-lads-foundation-gives-govt-schools-houses-a-new-look/articleshow/87573200.cms||J Abbas Mulla

It stated that in 20 private hospitals, the capacity is around 256 metric tonnes. The increased storage capacity will be useful in averting an oxygen crisis. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s hospital board of India, told TOI, “It is quite heartening to see that we have created better storage facilities for the liquid oxygen, but we also have to give importance to generation. The administration must make an assessment of how much oxygen generation capacity we have augmented in the government as well as the private sector. They should assess data from the distributors, which will help us in the event of any future unfortunate incidents.” According to Patil, the purity of the oxygen also remains an issue, which needs to be looked into. An official from the district health office said general guidelines from the state government were to have thrice the storage capacity of the liquid medical oxygen than what was the peak requirement during the second wave earlier this year. Oxygen consumption has gone down drastically in the district at present with the demand falling to around 120-125 metric tonnes per day, from 363 a day in April. Apart from the storage capacity, around 35 government-run hospitals in the district have also installed their own oxygen plants, that can produce 38,206 litres per minute (LPM) of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/o2-storage-capacity-in-dist-now-up-to-460mt/articleshow/87572946.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Nizam’s kin backs INTACH’s save OGH campaign||HYDERABAD: With the magnificent Osmania General Hospital (OGH) building left to its fate without any conservation efforts for decades, a member of the erstwhile royal family of Hyderabad has stepped in backing the demand of the Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) that it be permitted to re-study the structural stability of the nearly a century-old building on the banks of the river Musi. Himayat Ali Mirza, great grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last ruler of princely Hyderabad state, has joined the save Osmania General Hospital campaign with a warning that if the present state of neglect of the Asaf Jahi monuments continue, there will be no structure left by 2030. None of the monuments built by the Asaf Jahi Nizams, who ruled over Hyderabad for a little more than 200 years, is protected under law. Soon after separate Telangana was formed in 2014, ironically the Asaf Jahi structures were denotified from the heritage list. Osmania General Hospital is one such grand building that has been part of the city skyline since 1920s. Extending support to INTACH, Mirza, who is the grandson of Moazzam Jah, argues that Osmania Hospital building can be strengthened by taking up minor repairs. Incidentally, Moazzam Jah, second son of the Nizam, had headed the City Improvement Board, which was responsible for several Asaf Jahi grand structures in Hyderabad including MJ Market, named after him, Osmania General Hospital, High Court, Pattarghatti and Unani hospital. Mirza told TOI that if the government felt the OGH building is not suitable for a hospital, it can construct a new building and leave the grand old structure, the best example of Osmanian style of architecture, as a medical heritage museum. Osmania Hospital and its predecessor Afzalgunj Hospital had contributed richly to the advancement of modern medicine including several firsts to its credit like the chloroform commission in which it was successfully proved that chloroform can be given as an anaesthesia without causing death, producing world's first woman anaesthetist and the discovery that malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito. While structures built by Nizams till the Nizam VI, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, had followed one style of architecture that has come to be known as Asaf Jahi style of architecture, the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, adopted a unique style famous as Osmanian style of architecture. Mirza regretted that several grand structures had passed into history due to neglect. “Saving OGH building is not just protecting a structure. It is protection of the modern medical heritage of Hyderabad. As long as the OGH building stands tall, people will recall how the hospital and its predecessor Afzalgunj hospital had successfully fought many a pandemic including Spanish flu of 1918 to Swine flu in 2009. It also helped in the treatment of plague and cholera cases,” Mirza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizams-kin-backs-intachs-save-ogh-campaign/articleshow/87573409.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Pune||Hadapsar-Dive Ghat stretch up for repairs & widening||Pune: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said it will soon repair and widen the busy Hadapsar-Wadki-Saswad road, the surface of which was badly damaged during the recent rains. Regular commuters on this stretch have complained about the jarring ride, as well as frequent traffic snarls, on the stretch. They said the current carriageway was not wide enough to accommodate the increasing volume of traffic. The Hadapsar-Saswad road stretch is a part of the Dehu-Alandi-Pandharpur Palkhi Marg, which is being developed by NHAI. Local corporators said that they have been following up road-related issues with NHAI and the Public Works Department (PWD). NHAI officials said Rs2.5 crore was recently sanctioned for repairs to this road. The officials said the work would begin soon, upon completion of the necessary formalities. Corporator Ganesh Dhore said daily traffic volume on the road has increased as the city’s boundary has now been extended beyond Urali Devachi and Phursungi. “Residents are demanding an underpass or flyover to ease traffic congestion on this road. They also want the authorities to complete road-widening and repairs at earliest. Steps are being taken to allot money from PMC funds for road repairs,” Dhore said. Viraj Satav, who often travels on the road up to Saswad. said the stretch from Hadapsar up to Dive Ghat should be widened. “At least two more lanes must be added to ease the traffic flow as otherwise, commuters will continue to struggle in traffic jams. The road has been widened at some spots, but these patches lack proper tarring or concreting. Bikers cannot travel on these stretches,” he said. Rajesh Ovhal, another regular traveller, said road is also being used by heavy vehicles that travel from Solapur highway to Satara highway, as well as by many dumpers through the day because of increased construction activity in the area. Officials from NHAI said there was a plan to widen the road to four lanes. “Additional lanes will help ease traffic flow. The repairs and widening are expected to begin soon,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hadapsar-dive-ghat-stretch-up-for-repairs-widening/articleshow/87572957.cms||Sarang Dastane

As per Ranavare, this was even higher than the ridership before the pandemic hit in 2019 (75%) and a marked improvement over last year (60-65%). He said the transport utility will operate 350 additional buses to cater to the Diwali crowd which will now return after the holidays. Some routes which witnessed high traffic include Pune-Mumbai, Pune-Nagpur, Pune-Goa, and Pune-Nashik. Even private bus operators said they did decent business this Diwali. “This happened after a long time and we are satisfied. However, if diesel rates had been lowered a week or two before Diwali, it would have been an added relief. We want prices to further drop for real relief,” a private bus operator said. Authorities in redBus, a bus travel booking portal, said travel in buses this Diwali in Maharashtra was impressive. “There has been a marked increase in the number of passengers traveling in Maharashtra this year compared to Diwali last year – a 70% increase,” a spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrtcs-pune-division-sees-uptick-in-ridership-better-than-past-2-years/articleshow/87572958.cms||Joy Sengupta

The vaccination was closed for Diwali holidays in the district. However, some sites started inoculating beneficiaries from Sunday. The district health officials said apart from completing the 100% vaccination with the first dose, the speedy vaccination of second doses would be on their agenda across over 300 government-run sites. The special drives on educational campuses, in the slum areas and for the special categories too would pick up pace from Monday. Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director (medical) of Pune circle, said the completion of the first doses by November-end remained an important goal after the Diwali break. “Increasing the vaccination of the second dose beneficiaries via micro-planning was also equally important for the health department,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said, “There should be a vaccine mandate across all civic and private sectors to speed up the vaccination. There are still citizens, who have voluntarily opted out of taking the vaccine and this needs to be changed.” Meanwhile, daily vaccination on Sunday saw an average response of 4,814 beneficiaries across around 182 sites in the district.

The police have sent the details of the FIR and the victim’s latest statement for legal opinion. The complainant, who has been working as a domestic help, was a divorcee from Golconda area. Two days ago, she lodged a complaint with Golconda police alleging that a grocery store owner from her neighbourhood and two of his friends had sexually assaulted her a month ago after taking her out in a car on the pretext of showing a house for rent. “The complainant alleged that about a month ago, while she was looking for a house on rent, her neighbour and his two friends convinced her to accompany him in the car to see a house in Shaheen Nagar area. She alleged that the trio had tied her limbs and raped her in the car,” Golconda inspector K Chandrasekhar Reddy said. The complainant also alleged that her neighbour threatened her with a gun and warned her to not step out of the house, forcing her to remain indoors for a month. “They also took my pictures in the phone and threatened to show them to others if I inform anyone about the assault,” the complainant told police. Based on the complaint, police had registered a gang rape case under Section 376 (2) (g) of the IPC and sent the victim for medical examination. “On Sunday, the complainant came to the police station and gave a statement saying that she had lodged a false complaint against the neighbour as he refused to give her Rs 10,000 when she requested the amount for medical treatment. We have sent the details for legal opinion and based on the advise we will initiate appropriate legal action,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-says-she-had-lodged-false-gangrape-complaint/articleshow/87573418.cms||---
---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay students divided on hybrid exam, say it’s not ‘level-playing’||MUMBAI: Even as more departments at IIT-Bombay are giving their nod for the semester-end exam to be conducted in the hybrid mode (students on the campus will take the offline exam under teachers' physical vigilance and the ones at home will be giving the digitally-proctored exam), students on the campus have raised their concerns over not having a level-playing field.  An article in their campus magazine, Insight, mentioned that professors put in their best efforts, but no online examination system has proven to be completely cheat-proof and the ones giving the exams from home are at an advantage. The end-semester exams are scheduled to commence from Monday. In their article, the students pointed that the relative grading system has ‘pit student against student and mere margins of a few decimal points can cause a grade to drop’. The students mentioned that it is an accepted fact that varying degrees of cheating always take place. ‘With high weightages resting on the end semester exams, the outcome of this exam often determines the grade. In this context, the necessity of a level playing field is amplified further,’ they wrote. ‘The advantage to students giving exams online is no secret and the fact that making sets of students write the exams in different conditions, with the conditions having a direct impact on the outcome of the exams would lead to an imbalance of advantage,’ the article stated. A professor said that the idea of hybrid mode was floated before the mid-semester exams as it was suspected that students who are on the campus may collaborate to copy. “In-person exams were implemented with full Covid related precautions including distancing and good ventilation. Though we agree that no system is 100% foolproof, but we are trying to minimise cheating in online exams,” said the professor. He added that while students did get better grades on average in the online semesters last year compared to earlier semesters, that cannot be attributed to copying. Grading normalised subsequently, he added. Professor S Sudarshan, deputy director (academic and infrastructure affairs), said that cheating cases are not tolerated at the institute. "Our faculty members make all efforts to prevent online exam related malpractices, using video proctoring. Several students have in fact been caught, and stringent punishment has been given to ensure that it acts as a deterrent," he said. Barring the first-year undergraduate students, the institute is expecting a majority of students to be back on the campus in the next semester, though returning to campus will still be voluntary, based on current government guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-students-divided-on-hybrid-exam-say-its-not-level-playing/articleshow/87573883.cms||Yogita Rao

Sonam said that the initiative will be scaled up and they would also be tying up with government hospitals and primary health centres so that people from the socially and financially disadvantaged sections of the society can make use of this project. “We are using a material called poly lactic acid to make these prosthetics. Our students printed a set this week and currently, we are in the testing phase. We plan to first help children up to the age of 10-12 years.

From October 1 to November 6 this year, 14,721 two-wheelers and 6,305 cars were registered, the Pune RTO data stated. The registrations for two-wheelers and cars were 46% and 55% more, respectively, compared to last year. The figures of the PCMC RTO were still being compiled, officials said. Vehicle dealers said they had hoped to see more improvement. “This year, sales during Dasara were disappointing compared to last year, mainly due to the semi-conductor chip shortage. Registration figures from Dasara to Diwali were expected to be more than last year, but sales could have been even higher. We expected very high sales, which did not happen,” a four-wheeler dealer said. Shailesh Bhandari, the regional director of Federation of Automobile Associations, Pune, and director of BU Bhandari Auto, said constraints in the supply chain still remained. Dealers added that the car sales compared to last year’s festive season had improved slightly. “The increase looks impressive percentage-wise, but the numbers this year could have been much higher. If the supply chain would have been fine, the sales this year would have gone past 15,000 easily,” another vehicle dealer said. “We decided to buy a latest sedan car, but the dealer couldn’t get it. We had been delaying the purchase for two years, so we settled for a 2020 model,” a resident Rajat Awasthi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rto-registrations-up-during-festive-season/articleshow/87572968.cms||Joy Sengupta

The term of the existing contractors will end this December. The successful agencies will be given a five-year contract. One contractor would be appointed to clear trash from each division, Nashik Municipal Corporation said. The garbage collection contract for five years has been pegged at around Rs 354 crore. The contractors collect garbage from door-to-door in the city and transport it to the compost plant at Pathardi on the outskirts of the city. As per NMC officials, the six contractors together deploy 268 garbage collection vehicles, including 12 smaller vehicles.This number is set to grow under the new contract, as NMC expects the daily collection of the waste from the city to swell from present 318 tonnes a day to 822 tonnes a day. NMC officials further said additional vehicles would be needed to ramp up doorstep collection of garbage and picking up trash from all the “black spots” in the city. “We want to complete the tender process within a month and deploy new contractors from the beginning of the new calendar year. It depends on the response we get from the contractors,” an NMC official said. November 30 is the deadline to submit bids. These bids are to be opened on December 1. A meeting in this connection is to be held at NMC headquarters on November 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-floats-tenders-for-agencies-to-collect-trash/articleshow/87572988.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Hyderabad||New liquor policy: More applications likely from Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With the state government adopting a new liquor policy, enabling permit rooms attached to liquor outlets to operate, the move is likely to result in a high number of applications from the city. The current licence will be valid for another two years, and with local body and assembly elections coming up, many people are eager to register for permits. A draw of lots would be conducted on November 20, while the new shops would come into effect from December 1. Liquor sales during the Huzurabad by-poll indicate the prospects of more income in the next two years. The state government has earned more than Rs 1,000 crore through the sale of applications itself in the last auction. The windfall is also expected to be greater this time because there is no limit on the number of applications. Greater Hyderabad region has majority of the state’s liquor stores. “There are about 700 stores in the city and its surroundings, and these shops also depend on sale of eatables too. We expect more applications from the city,” officials said. . The rush is also expected to be even greater because there is no need to pay EMD and instead one has to pay the licence cost every two months. The commission is highly lucrative, with no annual turnover constraints. Other key features of the new policy include collecting Rs 5 lakh in cess for education, environment, and development. Following collection of GST and VAT, the state government earns the third-highest money from liquor sales. According to officials, there might be a good response as festive sales were also high and reservations were made on the issue of licence. “The new changes are better for new licence holders than earlier ones, so new entrants may bid for licences, but many may not retain the licence with them but sell it to others,” the sources said. As per the decision of the government, 15% of the total shops would be reserved for members of the Goud community, 10% for SCs, and 5% for STs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-liquor-policy-more-applications-likely-from-city/articleshow/87573428.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Temperature climbs, fans and ACs turn off. Thunder strikes, power snaps. Mercury drops, lights are out. Day in, day out, lakhs of people in Zirakpur, Kharar, Nayagaon and Derabassi are managing with unscheduled power cuts daily —a constant reminder of the failure of the authorities despite tall promises of the state being power surplus. “Officers of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) should have some pity on people living in Zirakpur. There are senior citizens and kids and people working from home. All cannot suffer long power cuts, that too unannounced,” says S K Dhiman, a resident of Zirakpur. He claims he had bought a flat in Zirakpur on the assurance that there is extra power in Punjab and there will not be any power cuts. “A delegation of Escon Arena in November 2019 was assured by executive engineer that there won’t be any power cuts. Two years down the line, nothing has changed,” he adds. Some of the areas that remain affected daily are Sunrise Complex, Lohgarh, Rishi Apartments, VIP Road, Savitry Tower, Sarvb Mangal, Green Park Colony, Sharma Estate, Golden Enclave, Astha Apartment, Chandigarh City Centre, Cosmo Plaza, Silver City Green, Motiya Royal City, Nirmal Chaya, Sunrise Agro, Friends Enclave, Om Apartment, Silver City Extension, Badal Colony, Sharma Estate, Silver City, some area of Patiala Road and adjacent areas. In many parts of Lohgarh, Dhakoli, Ghazipur, Baltana, Bhabat, VIP road and Chhat village, intermittent power cuts kept the residents awake during nights. On its part, PSPCL has unearthed 1090 power theft cases in Mohali in the past and imposed a fine of Rs 55.88 lakh. The department has made recoveries of Rs 103.26 lakh from defaulters, says additional chief engineer Mohit Sood. Diesel price stalls gen sets Residents having diesel power generator sets have stopped using them as the price of the fuel had hit new highs, making them unviable. As far as inverters are concerned, residents say power supply is needed to charge their batteries. Charanjit Singh of Dhakoli says, “We have a diesel generator set but as diesel had started costing more than Rs 92 per litre, it was not practical to use the set during the summer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-fails-to-shed-off-clinging-power-cuts/articleshow/87572991.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) collected on an average 670 tonne of garbage per day over the five days of Diwali. During the same period last year, 625 tonne of garbage was collected per day. The NMC officials said that last year there were certain Covid restrictions and people were not in a festive mood. Moreover, the sale of firecrackers was also badly affected. The officials further added that people celebrated Diwali this year with improvement in the Covid scenario and easing out of the restrictions. They also purchased firecrackers, which led to a rise in garbage collection. The civic administration had conducted a cleanliness drive in all the slum areas across six divisions of the municipal corporation ahead of the Diwali festival. “Our objective is to maintain the cleanliness in the city. During the Diwali festival, we had deployed the sanitary employees in two shifts for cleaning purposes and collecting garbage. Moreover, we also conducted a drive to clear all the black spots of garbage in the city,” said officials. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) conducted a drive to check the noise level at five locations - CBS, Dahipul, Bytco Point, Cidco residential area and Panchavati. The MPCB officials said they would release data on Diwali noise and air pollution in a day or two. As per NMC officials, the six contractors together deploy 268 garbage collection vehicles, including 12 smaller vehicles.This number is set to grow under the new contract, as NMC expects the daily collection of the waste from the city to swell from present 318 tonnes a day to 822 tonnes a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-sees-increase-in-garbage-collection-during-diwali-this-yr/articleshow/87572999.cms||Tushar Pawar

The police recovered 18 LMVs worth Rs 1.47 crore by arresting seven gang members from Ghatkopar, Surat in Gujarat, and Murshidabad, Kolkata and Asansol in Bengal. The arrested kingpin, Mohd Habibulla (40), a mechanic, stayed on rent in Ulwe and his aide Manoj Gupta (34) resided in Kalyan. They were arrested from Ulwe in July. Both hail from UP. The wanted mastermind Raje Soni, who lives in Chembur, had arranged the rental flat in Ulwe for Habibulla and Gupta by telling the flat owner that they were high-rank officials at JNPT, said senior inspector Sunil Shinde. Inspector Shinde said, “Habibulla first broke a vehicle’s window pane to enter the car and disconnected the DCM (direct communication module) socket by opening the tool box inside the car. Then, he would open the bonnet and disconnect the siren. He entered the vehicle and again connected the DCM circuit. He used external wire to connect battery and fuse box. Thereafter, he placed a hi-tech gadget on the ignition button and scanned the engine control module unit for decoding the vehicle key’s security code. Then, using duplicate key, he starts the vehicle. He took only three minutes to drive away with a vehicle.” He said, “After arresting Habibulla and Gupta, we recovered seven stolen cars worth Rs 64.50 lakh. They revealed the names and locations of their aides who replaced the engine and chassis numbers of stolen vehicles with those of scrapped vehicles. They made fake documents and sold them as second-hand vehicles. They led us to scrap dealers Sumit Jalan (40) and Rashid Ali (44), who were arrested from Kolkata in September. The other aides, N Ansari (44) and Manish Chovatiya (47), were arrested from Surat and Bengal, as they were receivers of stolen vehicles and printed discarded chassis and engine numbers while Jamaluddin Saha (47) was nabbed from Ghatkopar. From them, we recovered 11 of the 18 cars worth Rs 82 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-hi-tech-car-thieves-nabbed-18-vehicles-worth-rs-1-5cr-seized/articleshow/87573900.cms||George Mendonca

SGS Mall on MG Road recorded its highest footfalls on both weekends and also a considerable increase in sales. Vikas Ladhe, centre head, SGS Mall, said, “We saw a 120 per cent increase in sales, a record number since we reopened after the second wave. Sales and footfalls kept rising since last month. They were highest in the last weekend of October and first one of November.” Surjit Singh Purohit, COO of Amanora Mall, Magarpatta, said malls throughout the country have been noticing ‘revenge sales’ — customers overspending to make up for time lost in the pandemic. He added, “Post-Diwali, we expect multiplexes to bring in footfalls. They contribute to 15 per cent of total footfalls currently.” Vicky Kumar, a visitor at Phoenix Marketcity, said, “After being cooped up at home for 1.5 years, I could bring my teenage sons out for a movie this weekend. They were not allowed in the malls earlier due to not being able to get vaccinated.” Samiya Patel, a mall visitor in Pimpri-Chinchwad, said, “Watching people shop and dine together, with stores decorated with lights invokes festive spirit. I came to buy furnishings but lingered to indulge in this environment.” Restaurateur Sandy Singh shared, “We have been booked to capacity for two weekends and sales are at pre-Covid levels. Fears of a third wave have been taken over by the festive mood.” Baner resident Shilpi Mangaokar, “We have family visiting and the pandemic has taught us to seize the moment.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur hospitals under pressure as dengue cases soar||JAIPUR: With more and more dengue patients demanding immediate admission, hospitals are giving priority to those with warning signs such as involvement of liver and gallbladder leading to stomachache, vomiting, rashes and fall of blood pressure. City hospitals’ out-patient department are witnessing patients with dengue and dengue-like illness. Worried attendants of dengue and dengue-like patients are insisting that patients be admitted. Since hospitals are witnessing a rush, doctors are giving priority to those who are serious and showing “warning signs.” “Any patient with warning signs of dengue need to be hospitalised and be kept under observation. Management of dengue depends on warning signs and symptoms,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Dr Bhandari said, “In dengue, only thrombocytopenia is not an indicator of severity, but other warning signs also should be kept in mind to diagnose severe dengue.” Amid more patients willing to get admitted, SMS Medical College has divided dengue patients in three categories on the basis of WHO guidelines. Group A patient may be sent home as they are able to tolerate adequate volumes of oral fluids, pass urine at least once every six hours, do not have any of the warning signs, particularly when fever subsides. Group B patients who should be referred for in-hospital management include patient with warning signs and those with co-existing conditions that may make dengue or its management more complicated.Group C patients who require emergency treatment and urgent referral includes severe plasma leakage respiratory distress, severe hemorrhages and severe organ impairment. The hosptials are witnessing increased number of patients coming with warning signs such as persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, ascites or pleural effusion, peri gallbladder edema, hepatomegaly, raised hematocrit, deranged liver and renal function and defective coagulation profile. Not only adults but children are also badly affected due to dengue this year. “We are seeing more serious children having severe dengue this year. Microbiologists might talk about the reason for it. We are giving priority to those patients who are presented with warning signs. Their condition can deteriorate any time if not provided with proper treatment. Children are coming with nose bleeding, severe pain in abdomen, vomiting and deranged liver functions,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, head of the department (paediatric medicine), JK Lon Hospital. Hospital administration claimed that the OPD and IPD registrations have started taking adip as temperature has started going downwards. “Our OPD registration went upto 1,200 daily a few days ago, but now it has gone down to 700. Also, patients requiring admission has also taken a dip. Earlier, we were admitting more than 200 patients daily, but now it has come down to 150,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon hospital.

They then must carry out a special drive and issue notice to so people start declaring the exact load of power,” said S K Nayar, president, Citizen Welfare Association. He, however, said due to improper pruning of trees across the city, power outages happen, while on the other side, the department conveniently cuts the power whenever it rains. UHBVN executive engineer (operations)B S Wadhawan, while giving an overview of the power department infrastructure, said there are four divisions, including City-I, City-II, Madanpur and sub-urban division, having 80,000 consumers. The district also includes Kalka, Pinjore, Raipur Rani and Barwala divisions as well. So far, over 33,000 consumers have received smart meter facility and rest of the work would be completed as various teams were working on the installation, said Wadhawan. “The work of installation of smart meter in the rest of the district will be done after covering the city division. The power department will get to know about the load of each and every consumer and the changes will be made on ground level based on that,” Wadhawan said. To make residents understand the benefits of smart meters, special consumer awareness drives were carried out in the September with the help of various resident welfare associations. Wadhawan said, "Consumers must download smart meter mobile applications in their mobile phones and they would be able to monitor their daily electricity consumption and load on the meter not possible earlier." Besides this, it will also store records in the app. The UHBVN officials will also not be required to visit and read the meters, e-billing system and delivery of hard copies of bills would be done on its own, the XEN added. The XEN said a consumer will now get a prepaid payment facility along with the postpaid facility. The prepaid facility will give a rebate of 5% in the electricity bill to a consumer.

---||Goa||Pernem farmer harvests 1.5 tonne of hybrid, local rice varieties organically using ‘better yield’ tech||Panaji: Using a system of rice intensification (SRI), Pernem-based farmer Uday Prabhudesai has organically grown rice on 11 acres of land this season. However instead of limiting himself to the regular rice varieties, he has used a traditional Goan variety of rice and a hybrid variant for the first time, harvesting 1.5 tonne of paddy so far. SRI is a farming methodology to help increase the yield of rice produced in farming. “A single grain of rice is able to yield 100-200g of paddy when planted using the SRI technology. Each seedling is able to get good aeration when there is a distance of 25 centimeters between them. As a result one needs less seeds per hectare to grow the crop. This also translates to lesser amount of fertiliser, pesticide and labour to manage the crop,” Prabhudesai told TOI. The seedlings were planted manually by village locals instead of mechanised farming. In two installments, he has harvested the hybrid variant, Shubhangi rice and Tamgho, a traditional variety of rice used to prepare ‘pez’ (rice gruel). Prabhudesai has even flattened the rice to sell as ‘fov’. Though he claims to be growing chemical-free rice crops, Prabhudesai is yet to seek organic certification to market his crop. “I haven’t used chemical sprays, pesticides, weedicides nor any chemical fertilisers to grow this crop. It is difficult for people to accept the crop when it lacks organic certification but the people who are aware of the farm activity, purchase my crop merely based on word-of-mouth,” he said. He added that nearly 60-70 trucks of cow dung were sourced from a dairy farm to be converted into organic compost in a vermicompost unit at his farm. Similarly, Jeevamrut, a liquid organic manure is also used as a fertiliser, he said. For pest control, he swears by the benefits of cow urine and extracts of tobacco, chilli and garlic – a cocktail of which he sprays on the crops. Manual weeding system was used for weed control. “Management of water levels is also a must to ensure high success rate in the yield. If two inches of water is parallelly kept in an evenly levelled plot, then weeds can be avoided,” he said. Originally a sugarcane farmer, Prabhudesai started experimenting with rice following the shutdown of the sugar factory. Though he continues to grow sugarcane on the side and processes it into organic jaggery, the success of rice plantation has urged him to venture into growing leafy vegetables, okra, brinjal and long beans at the farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pernem-farmer-harvests-1-5-tonne-of-hybrid-local-rice-varieties-organically-using-better-yield-tech/articleshow/87573913.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nagpur||Schools’ association plans morcha to assembly over Rs1,700cr RTE dues||Nagpur: A state-level association of schools is planning a morcha during the upcoming winter session of state legislature in Nagpur, to press their demand for releasing pending RTE payments. RTE Foundation, an association representing various schools, claims that around claims totalling Rs1,700 crore are pending. According to Sachin Kalbande, founder-president of the association, the government has either made part payments or not paid at all to schools. “We have been giving free admissions under the RTE quota to students for a long time. As per RTE Act, state government has to pay the fee on behalf of such students. But in Maharashtra against fee demand of Rs1,800 crore, only Rs100 crore has been sanctioned,” said Kalbande. The morcha is planned on December 9. “Crucial points will be raised before the authorities. In Maharashtra the RTE reimbursement has been slashed to Rs8,000 from around Rs18,000 per year, citing Covid-19 induced financial crisis,” said Kalbande. He accused the state government of not passing full benefits of the RTE funds. “The central government contributes 65% to this corpus. In Maharashtra the funds coming from centre are not being passed on to schools,” he said. Through a Right To Information (RTI) query, Kalbande claimed to have found out that Rs500 crore was received only for uniforms and books, “of which only Rs100 crore has been distributed”. He added that based on that same RTI document, “it has become clear that no student has received benefits as per the list prepared by the central government”. The association will put forward a key set of demands in the morcha. “We want the scrapping of the GR in which RTE fee reimbursement rates were cut to half. That amount should be raised to just over Rs31,000. Also, all pending payments must be released immediately,” said Kalbande. He also demanded that schools facing financial difficulty be provided government aid. “Many parents have not paid fees and budget schools have borne the brunt. The state government should clear the financial deficit,” said Kalbande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-association-plans-morcha-to-assembly-over-rs1700cr-rte-dues/articleshow/87573448.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Organizations like Swatantra Railway Bahujan Karmachari Union (SRBKU), Employees & Pensioners’ Association of SC, ST, OBC and Minority (EPASSOM), and Dr Ambedkar Employees Association (DAEA) have requested the PM to direct all departments to start the recruitment process. According to SRBKU general secretary Vikas Gour, EPASSOM secretary BP Urade and DAEEA president Sanjay Thul, there were over 8.86 lakh posts vacant in several central departments out of 40.77 lakh sanctioned ones till March last year, as per the Department of Expenditure’s annual report on pay and allowances. It means 21.75% of total sanctioned posts are vacant in departments like railways, post department, GST, CPWD and others. “Till March 1, 2016, 4.12 lakh posts were vacant. This number jumped to 8.86 lakh in the corresponding period till March last year. It indicates that over 4.74 lakh vacant posts were added in the last four years, which is an increase of 114.8%. It means nearly one-fourth of total sanctioned posts are lying vacant today and the burden of extra work is being shouldered by the existing staff,” Gour, Urade and Thul said. The trio added that the vacancies may increase further if the PM did not pay attention. “The vacancies are severely affecting the employees’ morale and hampering their daily work due to the huge burden on their shoulders. As lakhs of qualified youths are unemployed, the government should recruit them to reduce these large number of vacancies,” they said. They added that the huge mental and physical stress on the employees had resulted in them suffering from various kinds of health and family problems, and even untimely deaths. “This is the root cause of destroying many families, increasing the trend of life-threatening diseases, and social insecurity,” they said.

The state’s housing authority, Mhada, gave the go-ahead on October 27 to redevelop Old Chikhalwadi at Tardeo. The 1.54-acre plot comprising a labyrinth of 12 chawls, in which over 200 people live, stands behind Bhatia Hospital. The go-ahead paves the way for a 36-storey tower that will now spring up on the plot. The redevelopment, held up since 2002, recently got an ‘all clear’ from a high-powered panel appointed by the state. Officials said one big hurdle in redeveloping the cluster was the rule to have a road of 18-metre width around the project. The builder had sought permission to redevelop as per old rules that allow a road width of 12 metres. This July, a state notification cleared the decks to redevelop clusters with a 12-metre road width, officials said. With Mhada’s nod, this project will be the city’s first under the Cluster Development Scheme cleared under the new rules. “The project has finally taken shape We’re glad Mhada has signed an agreement and issued an NOC to the developer,” said Suraj Shetty, joint secretary of an association of the residents. “All 228 tenants will get 583 sq ft usable carpet area with Rs 6 lakh corpus fund. To ensure timelines are met, we’ve asked the developer to keep a contingency fund... I hope work starts next month and all tenants support the development.” Rajendra Chaturvedi from the developer’s firm had said they would complete the project in four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1st-cluster-redevpt-gets-final-ok-100-yr-old-chawl-will-make-way-for-36-storey-tower-in-mumbai/articleshow/87573903.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Senior police inspector Bramhanand Naikwadi of the Mundhwa police, citing preliminary findings of their probe, said, “The deceased man was working with a tour operator in the NIBM Road area and the woman is a native of Nepal. We do not have any details about the woman yet.” Naikwadi added, “We are not ruling out the possibility of the two having died after inhaling some noxious gas fumes emanating from the five chemical containers kept in the house. The bodies had no injury marks, but blood was oozing out of their nose. A preliminary postmortem opinion is awaited and we are also investigating the purpose behind the storage of these chemical containers in the room.” According to the police officer, the five chemical containers have been seized and sent for chemical analysis to ascertain what their contents were, and whether these were lethal. Naikwadi said, “A gas stove and a television set were in the room; the TV was on. We suspect the two may have died in their sleep late on Saturday night. We took the victims to a nearby hospital where they were examined and declared dead by the medical authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cab-driver-woman-found-dead-in-keshavnagar-home/articleshow/87573020.cms||---

Singh participated in a consultative meeting on rejuvenating rivers on the premises of the Gandhi memorial museum premises in Madurai on Sunday. “Every river has three kinds of rights - right to land, environmental flow and cleanliness. As per the right of land, it should only be used by the rivers. Every river has three kinds of land parcels - river flow zone, flood zone and heavy flood zone. But all these land parcels are encroached. All the waterbodies in the state including rivers, tanks and ponds in the state are encroached with the help of the government,” Singh said while addressing the gathering. He said that not even a single river in the state has its right of environmental flow which is the natural right of the river. The rivers in the state also do not have its rights of cleanliness as they are polluted. “All municipalities are government bodies. However, the government bodies are polluting the river by discharging sewage water into the rivers. We can say that the government is polluting the rivers. If the government is serious, then the rivers cannot be polluted,” Singh said. He said that in an attempt to rejuvenate the rivers, he would undertake an yatra to several parts of the state to study their condition. The yatra with the slogan ‘We people of Tamil Nadu will give the Rights to the Rivers’ would be an entry point for the revival of rivers by creating awareness to the people. After the yatra, a white paper report with suggestive measures would be submitted to the state government to take steps for the rejuvenation of rivers. V Prakash Rao, chairperson of the Telangana State Water Resources Development Corporation said that the main objective of the yatra is to rejuvenate the rivers in the state and by identifying the boundaries of the rivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-rivers-in-icu-state-must-take-steps-for-revival-expert/articleshow/87573452.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Govt mulls relief for colonies in smaller cities sans zonal plans||Jaipur: The state government is mulling a proposal to issue the lease deed in smaller cities, which are having population of less than 1 lakh, without implementation of zonal plans during its ambitious six months campaign ‘Shahar-2021. The high court had recently ordered to ban the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without implementing zonal plans. Source said, “Relief will be asked from the court to allow regularisation in smaller cities (having population of less than 1 lakh) as the urban development and housing (UDH) do not have manpower to implement zonal plans in all the urban local bodies in short time.” There are 184 small cities and none of them have layout plans. “A legal advice will be sought and the process of regularisation will begin soon after presenting the case in the court,” a source said. The state government was aiming to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. The major attraction of the campaign was regularisation of colonies on agricultural land. It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses, partially or fully constructed on agricultural land, need title deeds. However, the High court ban on October 6, put a spoke in the state government’s ambitious campaign. Meanwhile, following the high court directions, the town planning department is all set to implement the zonal development plan in cities with a population of over 1 lakh, before November 15. With this, the plot owners in the 28 big cities can procure lease deeds under the campaign. As per the data, the zonal plans have already been implemented in Jaipur. Now plan will be implemented in remaining big cities including Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Udaipur, Bhilwara, Alwar, Bharatpur, Sikar, Ganganagar, Pali, Tonk, Kishangarh, Beawar, Hanumangarh, Dholpur, Sawai Madhopur, Churu, Gangapur City, Jhunjhunu, Baran, Chittorgarh, Makrana, Hindaun, Nagaur , Bhiwadi, Bundi, Sujangarh, Banswara before November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-mulls-relief-for-colonies-in-smaller-cities-sans-zonal-plans/articleshow/87573473.cms||---

The bench also dismissed the appeal filed by the commissioner. S Ganesan, a resident of Krishnapuram in Kadayanallur applied for a copy of the approved plan of his house on April 21, 2015, and filed an application and remitted Rs 300 for the same. The official had assured to provide the same in a week but did not do so for months. On November 10, 2016, Ganesan sent a legal notice to the authority but did not get a proper response. He then approached the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF), Tirunelveli. The Kadayanallur municipal authorities told the forum that the applicant did not provide the necessary documents along with the application and hence they could not provide the plan approval. After taking into account the evidences presented by both sides the forum passed the order on November 6, 2017, in favour of the complainant directing the opposite party to furnish the approved house plan within one month and pay Rs 8,000. The amount includes Rs 5,000 towards compensation for deficiency in service and for mental agony suffered by the complainant and Rs 3,000 as cost to the complaint. Challenging the order, the commissioner appealed before the commission in Madurai. The commission after hearing the final arguments pointed out that the municipal authorities should have pointed out the lack of proper documents to the petitioner if they found any fault when the amount of Rs 300 was remitted by the applicant. Stating that no steps were taken by the municipality, the commission said that it showed the lethargic attitude of the authorities. The allegation by the complainant for deficiency in service by not furnishing the approved plan after receiving the required fees remains unchallenged, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/circuit-bench-upholds-order-to-pay-relief-to-consumer/articleshow/87573489.cms||---

An 83-year-old woman from Bhumiputra 5 in Congress Nagar locality of the city was the 1566th Covid fatality in Amravati. On Saturday, a 60-year-old woman had died at a district Covid hospital. Before Saturday’s death, the region had not seen a Covid death for 10 days in a row. Civil surgeon Dr Shyam Sundar Nikam confirmed that both the Covid victims were unvaccinated but the health department and district administration are yet to ascertain why the elderly citizens didn’t take the jab. Amravati district has the highest number of unvaccinated people in Vidarbha at over 10 lakh. Amid such vaccination backlog, the back to back deaths of elderly citizens must ring alarm bells in the Amravati district administration but the daily vaccination and testing figures cut a sorry figure. The region reported 11 news cases, including five from Nagpur and four from Amravati. One each was detected in Chandrapur and Akola. The overall testing remained average at just 2,400 while the active cases have increased to 87. In Nagpur, the 5 new cases included 3 from the city and two from outside the district. No recoveries were reported in the district while 1060 tests were conducted. The district has 32 active cases. Washim: No case was recorded but one patient recovered while the toll remained unchanged in the district. Active case tally is 2. Gondia: The district didn’t report any case or discharge as it remained Covid free. Buldhana: The district didn’t report a new Covid case. According to official data, the district didn’t report recoveries either. This left 7 active cases. Akola: The district reported a new case but no recovered patient. The active cases are 10. Gadchiroli: The district didn’t record a new case while a patient recovered. It has two active patients. Yavatmal: There were no deaths on Sunday, keeping the toll unchanged at 1,787. Currently, there are 7 active positive patients under treatment. The administration received 47 reports and all of them were found negative. Of the 72,914 positive patients, 71,112 have recovered. The test positivity rate is 9.61 %, death rate 2.45 % and daily positivity rate zero. The administration has kept 2,160 beds exclusively for Covid patients in hospitals across the district. Amravati: Yet another death for the second day on the trot has brought the virus fear back even as four new cases spiked the district’s caseload to 96,159 on Sunday. The 83-year-old woman from Bhumiputra 5 in Congress Nagar locality of the city was the 1,566th fatality. Like Saturday’s woman, she too was unvaccinated, civil surgeon Dr Shyamsunder Nikam confirmed. Though only 129 samples were tested, four new cases emerged from them. They included two males, aged 52 and 27, from Rajapeth and Rathinagar locities respectively and two females, aged 51 and 21, both from Shrikrishnapeth locality of the city. Not a single case came from the rural belt, putting a question mark on sample collection. With no recovery recorded today, the number of active cases under treatment rose to nine. Chandrapur: There was a solitary detection and two recoveries registered on Sunday. This left 11 active Covid patients under treatment. The day again was casualty free and toll remained stable at 1,542. The Covid caseload and total recoveries have reached 88,819 and 87,266 respectively. Wardha: No new case, recovery or death was reported on Sunday, while caseload, recoveries and toll remained unchanged at 49,410, 48,075 and 1,326 respectively. 150 test reports were received of which 5 are active positive in district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-unvaxxed-elderly-woman-dies-in-amravati/articleshow/87573479.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

One of his legs was ripped off in the blast, while parts of his mouth and chest were shredded. The dog was found in a seriously injured state in sector 20 by animal feeders, who then rushed him to the BSPCA hospital in Parel, where his condition is said to be critical. “Raja had been abandoned around two months ago by an Ulwe-based man. Some feeders were taking care of him, but on Sunday we were shocked to see his injured state. The dog had somehow dragged himself from sector 5 to sector 20 after a fire cracker was burst on his body. As he was crying in pain, we managed to take him to BSPCA with the help of animal activist Seema Tank,” said Ulwe resident, Safa Meman, adding that they would file an FIR the next day.

---||Madurai||Curb begging, rehabilitate beggars, HC tells Tamil Nadu govt||MADURAI: Though the government is spending huge public money under various schemes to ensure that the needy get proper food, a large number of people are still indulging in begging using children as a shield for their activities, the Madras high has observed and asked the state to curb them. Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the right to life and to live with dignity is guaranteed under the Constitution. Therefore, it is the duty of the state to ensure that all its citizens live with dignity. The judge asked the state government allot either the department for differently-abled or social welfare specifically to ensure the strict implementation of the Beggars’ Rehabilitation Scheme and the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Begging Act, 1945. The judge observed that begging is an offence as per the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Begging Act. Whoever is found begging shall be punished with up to six months of imprisonment. The legislature thought it fit to enact this law considering it as an offence and to prevent begging in this state. However, it has not been curtailed effectively as a large number of people are indulging in begging using children in traffic signals, temples, bus stands and also in trains. The judge took note of a report which stated that a government care camp at Melpakkam in Chennai was established in 1954. It is one of its kind home run by the government with an objective to prevent begging and to rehabilitate the beggars as useful citizens by directing their energies towards learning useful trades to enhance their skills, so as to enable them to earn their livelihood independently. The judge also took note of the fact that the home is presently in a dilapidated condition and unfit for accommodation of inmates. Since 2016, there was no conviction and no legally declared beggars to be accommodated as inmates. “The central and the state governments are implementing various social security schemes, however, the scenario has not yet changed and the number of beggars are seemingly increasing. Even after 75 years of independence, we have not eradicated poverty totally,” observed the judge. The court made these observations while hearing the bail petition of R Pandiyan, who was arrested by the Trichy district police in July on charges of kidnapping a child and involved in begging. Taking into account the fact that the petitioner is in judicial custody for over 100 days and that final report is yet to be filed, the court granted statutory bail to the petitioner by imposing certain conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/curb-begging-rehabilitate-beggars-hc-tells-state-govt/articleshow/87573476.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Coimbatore||Surgery gives new lease of life to woman with rare disease||Coimbatore: Doctors in a private hospital in Mettupalayam diagnosed a 30-year-old woman with forme fruste type anomaly - a condition in which the bile duct needs to be replaced to avoid further medical complication.A rare surgery which would cost over Rs 3-4 lakh in advanced medical facilities, doctors in SGK hospital Mettupalayam performed the over 7-hour long surgery with limited resources and one-fourth of the cost.This condition is detected among one in a lakh people which could be detected only by MRCP scan which is a non-invasive MRI used to visualize the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts.Liver secretes bile which is conducted through the bile duct and pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which goes through pancreatic duct. Bile duct is meant for digestion of fat whereas pancreatic juice digests protein.“They both join through a common channel inside the pancreas and drain into the intestine for digestion of food. But pancreatic juice, which are powerful enzymes, should not return to the bile duct, but such a condition is called ‘Abnormal pancreatico - Biliary malunion’,” said Dr D Vijayagiri, paediatric surgeon from SGK hospital.This happens when the pancreatic duct opens up a little higher up into the bile duct because the common channel is a little longer. This is the abnormality which damages the inner wall of the bile duct.In this case, the patient suffered from a Forme-Fruste type Choledochal anomaly where the bile duct gets damaged and the bile passage gets blocked.This will lead to recurrent fever, abdominal pain, intermittent jaundice with decreased food intake. Moreover, it is a premalignant condition where if not operated upon at early stages it can become cancerous lesion (cholangiocarcinoma) in the due course.“Removing the bile duct and creating a bypass channel below the liver to drain the bail is the treatment through an intestinal bypass, which is called Roux En Y bypass,” said Dr Kannan, chief anaesthetist from the hospital.Doctors say that it is a premalignant condition where if not operated upon at early stages it can become a cancerous lesion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/surgery-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-woman-with-rare-disease/articleshow/87573494.cms||---

The rescue team lowered a wooden cot into the well to provide footing to the tiger and the feline jumped out and fled to the jungle after leaping over the well’s parapet wall. The matter came to light after a farmer Sarpate discovered the tiger in his farm well early morning. Forest officials were informed and Warora range forest officer (RFO) MP Rathod rushed to the spot with his team. Volunteers of NGO Eco-Pro and the rapid response unit (RRU) team of Chandrapur forest division were summoned. Rathod said it was not clear how the tiger fell into the well. “We suspect it might have been chasing a prey through the fields and fell into the well while leaping for the prey, sometime during the night,” he added. Rathod said the well’s water was just six feet below the brim and the tiger was found exhausted but swimming in the water. By the time foresters reached the spot, a large crowd of villagers had gathered to watch the big cat trapped inside the well. “Controlling the overenthusiastic crowd was the most difficult part. We had to take the help of Shegaon police to disperse the crowd before starting the rescue operation,” Rathod told TOI. Rescue workers tied a wooden cot with a rope, lowered it near the tiger and moved away from the well, waiting for its reaction.“The tiger soon climbed over the cot and relaxed a bit after hours of swimming. It sat on the cot for a while, jumped at the parapet and ran away,” Rathod said. The RFO added that the foresters’ experience of serving in the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve came in handy during the operation. The rescue team led by RFO Rathod included foresters Amol Neware, Kishor Deulkar, Nibuddhe, Ramteke, SD Watekar and Ishwar Ladke, members of RRU team and volunteers of Eco-Pro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-falls-in-chanda-well-rescued-after-3-5-hour-long-operation/articleshow/87586294.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Coimbatore||Student-teacher ratio skewed||Coimbatore: In many of the 780 government elementary schools in the district, teachers are forced to handle more than 90 students in a class, while the student-teacher ratio should be 30:1 from Class 1 to V and 35:1 from Class VI to VIII.While the government elementary school at Malumachampatti has 120 students in Class IV alone, it has only a teacher to handle them. Since only 20 students could be allowed in each class now, students are coming to the school only once in a week.The situation isn’t any different at the elementary school at JJ Nagar near Chettipalayam. M Thangamalai, a parent of a Class IV student, said there were more than 60 students in his daughter’s class. “The school has 370 students and more teachers are needed to care for them individually.”A source said uneven distribution of teachers had been affecting the academic activities in the elementary schools for a while. “While some schools have more than enough teachers to maintain the required 30:1 ratio, other schools are facing shortage of teachers. The school education department should ensure even distribution of teachers to facilitate a better learning experience for children.”Another source said the student-teacher ratio couldn’t be maintained in some schools as they had seen an unprecedented increase in the number of students. “Many parents have enrolled their children in government schools by pulling them out of private schools, as they could not afford high fees because of the pandemic situation.”V Manikandan, district president, Tamil Nadu Primary Teachers’ Federation, said the parents might readmit their wards to private schools, if adequate teachers were not deployed in the government schools. He urged the state government to carry out transfer counselling for teachers to address the shortage.Speaking to TOI, N Geetha, district chief education officer, said she had issued necessary instructions to the block education officers to redeploy teachers on deputation to schools based on the requirement. “Only willing teachers will be deployed on deputation. I have asked officials not to depute teachers in schools that are far away from their place of residence. It is a temporary measure to ensure academic activity in schools is not affected until transfer counselling is conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/student-teacher-ratio-skewed/articleshow/87573498.cms||Sampath Kumar

Mohinder Singh Bharaj, a 67-year-old cyclist from Nasik, has completed his lonely tour from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in 12 days, 18 hours and 57 minutes. Starting from Lal Chowk in Srinagar at 7.12am on October 25, he covered 3,652km and reached Kanyakumari at 2.09am on Sunday (November 7) where he was received by his wife, daughter-in-law and two granddaughters. “It was a challenging expedition. I pedalled with the theme ‘Race Against Age’ as I want to create awareness among the younger generation on setting fitness goals and leading a healthy lifestyle by exercising and having healthy food. Youth today are glued to gadgets and are not giving due importance to fitness,” he told TOI after reaching Kanyakumari and added that a fit and healthy lifestyle will help fight diseases like Covid-19 better. Bharaj, an engineer into manufacturing components, started cycling only when he turned 54-years-old. “I used to be an active athlete till then,” he said. Bharaj has been preparing for the K2K ride for about a year. Intensive workouts and sitting on the saddle for up to six hours a day and a strict diet were part of his daily routine. During the expedition, he started around 5am and pedalled for three hoursbefore stopping for the first break. He took breaks for about 10 minutes for every two hours, when his physiotherapist Mustafa helped him with stretches and ensured that his diet was balanced. He pedalled for 16 to 18 hours a day including breaks and spent only about four hours sleeping at night in lodges and hotels. Apart from fatigue and sleep deprivation due to pedalling an average of 286km a day, he faced saddle soreness and upper body pain from the sixth day. Among the other challenges was the tough weather. “It was extremely cold when I started from Srinagar and it continued till Delhi, the scorching sun drained my energy from Jhansi to Bengaluru,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/67-year-old-nasik-man-pedals-k2k-in-12-days/articleshow/87573496.cms||M K Ananth

---||Delhi||Most private schools set to reopen today in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Most private schools in the city will be reopening from Monday, with some even planning to call students in a phased manner. Officials said that regular sanitisation of classrooms, cafeterias and libraries had been done, with videos sent to parents to assure them of the safety protocols. Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools Conference, said, “Private schools will be reopening from Monday as even we want to reopen schools and see how it goes. Videos of the school premises being sanitised have been sent to parents as well to assure them. Everyone is looking forward to the children being back to schools and a lot of activities are being planned.” While stating that students will not be permitted to enter schools without a consent letter from parents, Acharya said, “Just in case a student forgets to carry it, parents will have to either email or inform the school over the phone. Several steps have been taken, including plans like a particular flight of steps will only be used for climbing up while another can be used for climbing down. We even asked two parents from each section to visit the schools and look at the arrangements. They were all satisfied.” Acharya also said that steps to resume transport facilities are also being taken. “We have already sent the relevant forms to parents and most likely, the buses will begin plying from November 15. There are several parents, especially of younger children, who are working and hence are not able to drop their children to the school each day. So it is essential that transport services resume. For those who are still concerned can continue coming in their private transport,” Acharya said. Bharat Arora, general secretary of the Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, added that some of the schools were still under the process of taking consent from the parents. “Most of the private schools are reopening from November 8, though few schools are in the process of taking consents and are likely to open after Chhath Puja holiday. Majorly, the consent for transportation is awaited. I am certain that schools have initiated processes for safe and smooth school reopening and we seek full cooperation from parents as well,” Arora said. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “From Tuesday, offline classes will resume for students from class 6 to 8 while the junior classes might start next week. We have already ensured that sanitisation, thermo-scans and other protocols are in place and everything is being implemented strictly. We even called parents’ representatives to the school and shared the details with them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-private-schools-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/87573132.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Heavy rain throws life out of gear||COIMBATORE: There was a let up in heavy rain throughout the day on Sunday, but only to resume later at night. Normalcy was hit in some parts of the district. At Mettupalayam, where flood water engulfed an entire village, cutting road transportation between Lingapuram and Gandhiayur, a motor boat was deployed to ferry people. Revenue officials at Mettupalayam and Sirumugai town panchayats said the motor boat would be operated till the water subsides and people could use the overbridge that remains submerged now. “Public can utilize the boat for travelling to and from the village.” There was sporadic rain at Valparai, keeping most of the residents, particularly those in the tea estates, indoors during the day. In a rain-related calamity, a tiled roof house collapsed on Bazaar Street at Puliakulam. The house, which belonged to Arokiya Mary, was more than four decades old. Fortunately, no one was inside the house when the wall collapsed, bringing down the whole structure. Most of the roads in the city are damaged because of the incessant rain for the past several weeks. Some of them, including Sanganur-Nallampalayam stretch, are totally unmotorable, forcing the residents to stage a novel protest to draw the attention of officials. The residents, led by Kannappa Nagar Traders’ Association president P Lingam, planted saplings in the water stagnating potholes on the road. If the weather forecast is anything to go by, there would be cloudbursts on Monday as well. Santhosh Krishnan, an independent weather blogger, said moderate to heavy rain was expected on Monday too over most parts of Kongu belt. “Rain will reduce a bit on Tuesday and Wednesday,” he said in a social media post. He suggested that farmers could use Wednesday for spraying pesticides. “Heavy rain will return again by Thursday and continue for next 10 days.” He has also requested people, who are planning to return to Chennai after Diwali from their hometowns, to avoid the travel for a week if possible, as the rain situation was worsening there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rain-throws-life-out-of-gear/articleshow/87573495.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Interventional radiology has potential to be complete therapeutic option||HYDERABAD: Interventional radiology (IR), which has emerged as a third line of treatment in addition to its supportive role in surgical procedures, can work wonders in treatment of certain cases of brain tumours, bulging of eyeballs due to head injury, liver cancers, varicose veins and uterine bleeding.  In such cases it can be a complete therapeutic option reaching places in the liver, brain or uterus which are not accessible for surgery and can replace the need for surgery. Despite its increasing role in the healthcare sector and prominent hospitals setting up these specialities, awareness about this third line of treatment is very small. For instance, in case of an excessive uterine bleeding or post-partum bleeding, removal of the entire uterus is the only option. “However, with interventional radiology, we can access the exact place of rupture and close it off. There are certain cases in which radiology has an edge and can prevent the need for a big surgery, although not in all cases. However, even as interventional radiology has a very important role and is prominent world over, awareness among doctors and medical professionals is very little. Plugging a leaking blood vessel, opening blocked vessel or dilating narrowed vessel, repair of rupture, narrowing and blockage of the aorta, bursting of clot in brain stroke etc are parts of this speciality,” said Dr S Rammurti, senior professor of Radiology and Dean of Faculty at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad. Awareness needs to be created among clinicians and patients for better outcomes. Speaking about the role it plays in treatment, Dr Jagadesh R Singh, director of interventional radiology, AIG Hospitals, who has done a lot of gastroenterological procedures by this method, said, “Currently due to low awareness interventional radiologists are involved in the later stages but once the awareness among clinicians and patients increases, the patient outcome will be better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ir-has-potential-to-be-complete-therapeutic-option/articleshow/87573930.cms||Amrita Didyala

In order to check voltage fluctuation, 8,905 new transformers were announced by the CM. Of them, more than 4,500 have been installed,” the minister said at a Makkal Sabai event. The DMK government will extend the duration of three-phase power supplied to farmers from the existing 16 hours a day wherever the required infrastructure is available, Senthil Balaji said. . Answering a question on implementation of 24-hour three-phase power supply scheme announced by the AIADMK government, Balaji said that the previous government announced the scheme at the fag end of the rule. “It was announced just before the election to mislead farmers and get their votes. The announcement for the scheme came at the end of February and the government order came at the end of March. But the infrastructure required to implement the scheme were not created. An estimated Rs 1,800 crore is required to create them. The number of hours will be extended wherever facilities are available,” he said. There are 56,000 vacancies in the electricity department and recruitment process will be initiated after getting approval from the chief minister, Balaji said. “Keeping the financial position of the board in mind, vacancies required on an urgent basis will be given priority. The department has Rs 1.59 lakh crore loan and Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000 crore is being paid as interest towards the loan every year,” he said. “Of the proposed 150 places, Makkal Sabai events were held at 30 places. As many as 15,127 petitions were received. Most of them were related to the old-age pension scheme. Immediate action will be taken on the petitions. Senior officials from departments will meet the petitioners and solve their issues at the earliest,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/216-new-sub-stations-will-be-set-up-soon-says-electricity-minister/articleshow/87573500.cms||---

Parents are being told the regimen is shifting from online to offline for their wards and they should ensure arrears are cleared. The Calcutta High Court has asked schools not to debar kids from classes for now and city schools said they will not stop anyone from entering the campus. But they appealed to defaulters to pay since the school was reopening physically and sanitisation expenses would be huge.“We have done our calculations till October 31 and are connecting with parents of classes IX-XII who have defaulted on fees. We have created a separate account where parents, who feel there is a disputed amount, can deposit that. This was done under the court’s direction,” said major general V N Chaturvedi, spokesperson for Birla High School.Shri Shikshayatan School is also sending letters to defaulters. “We have defaulters with arrears at different stages and are making a list for classes IX-XII to email them,” said Bratati Bhattacharya, secretary general of the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fee-reminder-ahead-of-offline-classes/articleshow/87573084.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Schools seek clarity on achievement survey from CBSE, state & parents||Kolkata: Faced with a CBSE mandate to compulsorily hold the offline National Achievement Survey in 3,165 schools in Bengal across boards in classes III, V, VIII and X on November 12 to find out how the children have fared academically and reluctance by parents to send their children to school immediately, city schools have sought clarity from CBSE, the Bengal government and have also asked parents to respond to consent forms by Monday. Over the weekend, CBSE issued two directives to schools which have been selected for NAS. On Saturday, schools were told if they refuse to hold the examinations, they will face action. On Sunday, CBSE told school principals to ensure that all their teachers who have been given duty as observers should report to duty on time on Friday and cannot give excuses of absence. There is no exemption from this duty, the circular reiterated.Compounding the problems, the Bengal government has only allowed children from classes IX to XII to come to school from November 16, prompting the schools to seek clarity on whether this bars them from calling junior classes earlier for the NAS examinations. Most schools in the city that have been selected for the survey have been flooded with calls from agitated parents who have told the schools they will not send their children for the survey. Most schools are sending out consent forms to parents on Monday to put this on record.Some schools, like South Point, have decided not to hold the survey for children of classes III and V at all and have assured parents about that. The school is not affiliated to CBSE till Class V and is not bound to follow orders up to that standard. The authorities have written to the board and the Sarva Shiksha Mission about the difficulty it is facing in bringing the children of Class VIII in for the survey. Krishna Damani, trustee, South Point School, said, “Parents have to consent by Monday. We will get clarity on the number of attendees then.”“We have written to the board and are in the process of writing to the state school education department. Parents are unwilling, but we will send out a consent form on Monday for our records,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School.Shri Shikshayatan School and Rammohan Mission are sending out consent forms on Monday as well. “We will ask our parents to fill in the forms and send it to us within a day. In our case, there will be more than 900 students to handle. Parents have been calling to say they will not send kids. Now we will have the actual numbers in hand,” said secretary general of the school Bratati Bhattacharya. Bibhas Sanyal, principal of Scottish Church Collegiate School, said, “We have noticed that very few parents are interested in sending their children for the offline exams. We will again issue a notice to inform them, but we can’t force them. So we don’t know how many will actually come for the exam.”St Xavier’s School principal M Thamacin Arulappan said, “We are yet to receive any communication from the board.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-seek-clarity-on-achievement-survey-from-cbse-state-parents/articleshow/87573087.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

There are 96 families in the locality.The residents said they were finding it difficult to even step out of their houses as the rainwater that was mixed with sewage was stagnating in the area.Talking to TOI, K Chandra Gounder, president, Sai Baba Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association, said the situation had been the same for the past two decades. “Initially, the plots were not approved by the government and hence Kannankurichi town panchayat hadn’t set up drainage channels in our area. We, however, had obtained approval from the concerned department while constructing houses.”The residents said they were facing various health issues because of sewage water stagnation. “The entire area stinks and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” said P Chinnasamy, secretary of the residents’ welfare association. He said two residents had tested positive for dengue in their area recently and they were getting treatment in a private hospital.While the residents had taken up the issue with town panchayat officials, there was no response from them so far. The residents also urged the officials to install streetlights in the area to prevent anti-social elements from using the locality for consuming liquor and gambling at night hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/set-up-drainage-to-end-waterlogging-woes-salem-residents-tell-officials/articleshow/87573510.cms||---

The state has not registered a single fresh case since 2011-12. It had recorded 96 chronic cases a decade ago. “The certificate of elimination is awaited from the Centre,” health officer in charge of the national vector-borne disease control programme in Goa, Dr Kalpana Mahatme said. The directorate of health services (DHS) has also completed a mass drug administration (MDA) programme. This was conducted from 2004 to 2011 in the state. “We also did a transmission assessment survey three times — in 2013, 2016, and 2019 — and tested children born after the completion of the MDA to determine if there was the presence of microfilaria in their blood samples. All test results were negative. Since no new cases have been recorded, we submitted our details to the centre,” Mahatme said. Though no new cases have been recorded, post MDA monitoring and surveillance has not ceased, she said. “In post-MDA surveillance, a night blood survey is done wherein samples are drawn between 8pm and 12pm. The night survey becomes imminent since filaria parasites are seen in the bloodstream at night. During the day, it remains hidden in the lungs,” Mahatme said. Night surveillance, she said, becomes difficult due to non-cooperation of the target population. Health centres choose a sub-center every month for a survey. The sample composition includes 50% migrants and 50% local population. She said that they test migrants as they come from states that are yet to reach an elimination stage. “Many states are still reporting filaria cases. It takes almost 10 years for symptoms to be seen after microfilariae infection. That’s why tests are repeated. We want people to co-operate when our staff approaches them,” she said. She said that last they had found filaria cases in Cortalim among migrant workers, and one case at Colvale in a migrant worker who was employed for sand extraction work. The labourers had come from areas having filaria cases. “They were immediately treated. While it takes ten years for symptoms to be prominently seen, some do have a fever, but only a blood test can confirm it,” she said. Besides, the 96 chronic filarial patients are monitored by respective health centres. A doctor visits them every two years and they are given a free mobility management kit,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-filaria-cases-since-2011-12-state-to-receive-elimination-cert-from-centre/articleshow/87573948.cms||Bindiya Chari

Rajesh Tope was in Ahmednagar to take stock of the fire incident at the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital that claimed lives of 11 people, including four women. Speaking to reporters Tope said, “CM Uddhav Thackeray held a 90-minute video conference with me and other senior health officials following the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital fire. Fire safety audit of all the 500-plus government-run hospitals has been done, and the PWD has been approached for further works.” “However, the process of getting the technical sanctions, administrative approval and the final funding takes time,” he added. Tope said Thackeray has taken serious note of the matter and has assured that the required funds for setting up the fire-fighting equipment will be provided.The meeting also discussed the appointment of a fire officer for every district. This officer would look after the things necessary for fire safety at the government hospitals. Further, it was also decided that other remedial measures — like using fire-resistant material in the ICUs, 24x7 screening of ICUs and effective training on disaster management for the staff — will be taken. Talking of the ICU patients who died in the fire, Tope said most of the victims died due to ‘suffocation’ and some succumbed to burns. The ex gratia announced by the state government would be given to the victims’ relatives by Monday, Tope added. The health minister visited the ward where the incident took place and spoke to the officials and employees to understand what had happened. He said the nurses in the ward had tried their best to douse the fire. The fire extinguishers were used, but as the volume smok increased, the visibility reduced and the staffers became helpless until the fire brigade arrived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-run-hosps-to-get-rs-217cr-fire-safety-gear/articleshow/87573085.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Turning up the heat on his appointing authority, Sidhu asked Deol: “Are you acting at the behest of those who appointed you in this constitutional office and fulfilling their political gains? Did you advise the government to challenge the blanket bail order procured by you or any other adverse order in sacrilege cases in Supreme Court?” Mr. AG-PUNJAB, Justice is blind but people of Punjab are not. Our Congress party came in power with a promise to gi… https://t.co/Q1OkDscr76— Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) 1636268265000He questioned the stand taken by Deol in the Punjab and Haryana high court on the issue of acting on STF report on drugs and accused him of “shielding the inaction of the government under the guise of your own unknown ethics” and of his “earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it”. A month after announcing his resignation as state Congress chief, Sidhu withdrew it on Friday, but said he would resume charge only after AG is replaced and a new panel (with the name of the new DGP) named. But, on Saturday, not only did chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi sound assertive, saying justice would be done and that he was not a weak CM, even Deol issued a statement, unprecedented from an AG office, attacking Sidhu. “Mr AG-Punjab, justice is blind but people of Punjab are not. Our party came in power with a promise to give justice in sacrilege cases, in which you appeared before the high court for main conspirators/accused persons and made serious allegations against our gov(ernmen)t. You specifically prayed for transferring the investigation to CBI as you were afraid of their false implication in sacrilege cases on accounts of malafide, malice and ulterior motives on the part of political party in power in Punjab,” he said. “Today, you are representing the same government of same political party in power and accusing me of spreading misinformation, whereas I am fighting for justice in sacrilege cases and you were procuring blanket bails for accused persons. May I know which interest (vested or otherwise) were you acting for when you appeared for the main conspirators and procured blanket bail for them and which interest, you are acting now? “You appeared for the accused, now representing the state and very soon you will seek elevation as a judge so that you can decide this case. Being the highest law officer, your focus is on politics and political gains. Leave politics to politicians and focus on your personal conscience, integrity and professional ethics, which your job requires,” tweeted Sidhu. On the drugs case, Sidhu tweeted: “In the hearing of drugs case in high court on 05.10.2021, upon being asked what is stopping govt from taking action on the basis of STF report filed in HC, you replied: ‘It would be ethically wrong to proceed without court’s nod’. May I know what is unethical in proceeding against the accused persons on the basis of STF report who are responsible for narcotics-terrorism in Punjab and have put the state in danger of losing an entire generation to drug abuse? Did hon’ble high court stop you? Hon’ble high court itself gave a copy of the STF report to our government for consideration and you are shielding the inaction of the government under the guise of your own unknown ethics.” Sidhu ended: “I believe that ethics is about the way things ought to be, not about the way things are. Ethical people often do more than law requires and less than it allows. When it comes to ethics, motive is very important. A person of character does the right thing for right reason with right motive... Your earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice... than ensuring it.” In his statement against Sidhu on Saturday Deol had also said, “His repeated utterances seek to derail the earnest efforts of the state government to ensure justice in the ‘dugs matter’ and the ‘sacrilege cases’, Shri Navjot Singh Sidhu is spreading misinformation to gain political advantage over his political colleagues. There is concerted attempt by vested interests to malign the functioning of the Congress party in view of coming elections in Punjab for their selfish political gain by politicising the constitutional office of the Advocate General of Punjab.” However, on Saturday not only did chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi sound assertive, saying justice would be done and that he was not a weak CM, but even Deol issued a statement, unprecedented from an AG office, attacking Sidhu. “Mr AG-Punjab, Justice is blind but people of Punjab are not. Our Congress party came in power with a promise to give justice in Sacrilege Cases, in which you appeared before the High Court for main conspirators/accused persons and made serious allegations against our Govt. Further, You specifically prayed for transferring the investigation to CBI as you were afraid of their false implication in Sacrilege cases on accounts of malafide, malice and ulterior motives on the part of political party in power in the state of Punjab,” he said. “Today, you are representing the same Government of same political party in power and accusing me of spreading misinformation, whereas, I am fighting for justice in Sacrilege cases and you were procuring blanket bails for the accused persons. May I know which interest (vested or otherwise) were you acting for when you appeared for the main conspirators and procured blanket bail for them and which interest, you are acting now? “You appeared for the accused, now representing the state and very soon you will seek elevation as a judge so that you can decide this case. Being the highest law officer, your focus is on politics and political gains. Leave the politics to the politicians and focus on your personal conscience, integrity and professional ethics, which your job requires,” tweeted the Punjab Congress president. On the drugs case, Sidhu tweeted: “In the hearing of Drugs case in High Court on 05.10.2021, upon being asked that what is stopping Govt. for taking action on the basis of STF Report filed in High Court, you replied that “It would be ethically wrong to proceed in the matter without the Court’s Nod.” May I know what is unethical in proceeding against the accused persons on the basis of STF Report who are responsible for narcotics-terrorism in Punjab and has put India’s most prosperous state in danger of losing an entire generation to drug abuse? Did Hon’ble High Court stop you? Hon’ble High Court itself gave a copy of the STF report to our Government for consideration and you are shielding the inaction of the Government under the guise of your own unknown Ethics.” Sidhu concluded his attack, saying: “I believe that Ethics is about the way things ought to be, not about the way things are. Ethical people often do more than law requires and less than it allows. When it comes to ethics, motive is very important. A person of character does the right thing for right reason with right motive. Your earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it.” In his statement against Sidhu on Saturday Deol had also said, “His repeated utterances seek to derail the earnest efforts of the state government to ensure justice in the ‘dugs matter’ and the ‘sacrilege cases’, Shri Navjot Singh Sidhu is spreading misinformation to gain political advantage over his political colleagues. There is concerted attempt by vested interests to malign the functioning of the Congress party in view of coming elections in Punjab for their selfish political gain by politicising the constitutional office of the Advocate General of Punjab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-questions-ag-stand-in-hc-on-stf-drug-report/articleshow/87573512.cms||---

Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is now forced to draw nearly 18 million gallons of water a day (MGD) from Osmansagar reservoir for the past one week and another seven MGD from Himayatsagar to serve a lakh consumers. Till October last week, the water board used to draw 12 MGD from Osmansagar to meet the demand. Water board officials had opened floodgates of the twin reservoirs five times between September and October due to heavy inflows. “In the coming days, we may draw additional quantities of water from the twin reservoirs,” HMWS&SB sources told TOI. The water board was supposed to draw 40 MGD (Osmansagar:25 and Himayatsagar 15), but drawing only 25 MGD now, the sources added. Meanwhile, supply of free water tankers to the Old City dipped after HMWS&SB’s vigilance wing exposed a scam in October. Before the scam came to light, nearly 700 trips a day were being made to the Old City, but it fell to 250 trips, a vigilance official said. The water board has been keeping a vigil on free water tankers by following certain decisions like installing CCTVs at filling stations, installing automatic vehicle tracking (AVT) devices to tankers and checking the misuse of free water tanker system, the official added. Meanwhile, the water board officials have started providing new water connections to people getting free water tankers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-to-draw-more-water-from-twin-reservoirs/articleshow/87573931.cms||---

Bengal has reduced the male-female gender gap in vaccination to only 7.5 lakh. Incidentally, rural Bengal is leading the drive in women’s vaccination, unlike Kolkata, North 24 Parganas, Howrah and South 24 Parganas, which have more urban density. According to the CoWin Dashboard real-time vaccination data, though UP has vaccinated 6.2 crore women and Maharashtra has vaccinated 5.3 crore women, the gender-gap in vaccination in these states is over 70 lakh, nearly 10 times more than in Bengal. South Indian states, like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh, have already bridged the gender divide, vaccinating more women than men. Bihar is a new entrant on this list. In almost all other states with higher density and population, male vaccination has been more. In India, 55.7 crore men have received at least one vaccine dose compared to 52.5 crore women. “Vaccination of women was a priority given the prospect of a third wave, in which unvaccinated children were believed to be at risk given the emergence of mutant Covid strains. This also gains importance in the backdrop of schools reopening. Children also spend a larger proportion of time with their mothers, who, if unvaccinated, will pose a risk,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of Bengal’s Global Advisory Board, which assists the government in formulating its pandemic policy. In end July, CM Mamata Banerjee had announced that all women who have children aged between one and 12 will be included on the priority vaccination list in all government vaccination sites. However, Bengal is also throwing up an urban-rural gender divide in its vaccination drive. After Alipurduar, Darjeeling, South Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Malda and Murshidabad started taking the lead in vaccinating more women then men, several south Bengal districts have lately stepped on to this list. Bankura, Bishnupur, Jhargram, Hooghly, West and East Midnapore and Nadia, along with the health districts of Diamond Harbour, Nandigram and Rampurhat, have now vaccinated more women than men. While in most of these districts it is of a few thousands, the gap — more women being vaccinated than men — has stretched beyond a lakh in East Midnapore. In Kolkata, this trend is exactly the reverse. Compared to 43.9 lakh men being vaccinated in the city, 35.3 lakh women have received the shots. In North 24 Parganas, 39.7 lakh men have been vaccinated compared to 37.4 lakh women. In Howrah, 22 lakh men have been vaccinated compared to 20.9 lakh women. The gap is slightly less in South 24 Parganas. “In rural Bengal, a small amount of vaccine hesitancy among men is being reported. Compared to them, women in rural Bengal have shown vaccine eagerness. Community medicine studies have shown that women have a better compliance rate than men for any health mandates,” a senior health department official said. “Life expectancy indicators among women are better and Covid fatality rate among women is also less than in men, indicating an enhanced resilience. These factors, coupled with vaccination, will ensure children and the elderly — the most vulnerable groups who spend a lot of time with women in households — are safe,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-crore-women-jabbed-in-bengal/articleshow/87573081.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: ‘Impotence-post-jab’ rumour keeps some away from getting vaccinated||NAGPUR: While the state government recently pushed vaccination in college going youth through a special drive, some, it seems, are still hesitant to get jabbed. Academics told TOI that baseless rumours, amplified through social media and peer level gossip, have led to some youths refusing to take the vaccine. A senior lecturer at a city college said, “There is a rumour among students that taking the vaccination may make a person impotent. While there’s no truth in this, what happens is that 5% of the students get influenced by all this talk and adopt a wait-and-watch policy.” TOI tried to find and speak with students who had not taken the vaccine yet, but only one agreed, that too on condition of anonymity. The engineering final semester student said, “The truth is not shown by the media in India but the fact is that there are many people across the world who oppose vaccination. Even in an advanced country like the US, where the education level is high, there are multiple groups that are opposing vaccination. All vaccines have got emergency approval, which means they were rushed and thus we may never know the long-term side effects.” The student, however, denied that he was specifically concerned about impotency. “I don’t know what the side effect will be. It can be cancer or what you just asked about. Only in three to four years can we get to know the truth. I’m not opposed to the vaccine, I’m just exercising my right not to take it because the medical information is incomplete,” said the student. As of now, vaccination is not mandatory. It can be a pre-condition to travel, enter classrooms or specified areas and buildings, but there is no outright mandate for every citizen to take the jab. Dr Nitin Shinde, an infectious disease specialist, said, “Vaccine hesitancy is high in the US and that’s mostly because there’s a high level of freedom for individuals and they in turn want to take the decision and not let the government decide for them. And that’s why US is still witnessing high number of cases because of the vaccine roll out not being proper.” He said that impotency rumours have always been linked to vaccination roll outs. “For decades, rumour mongers have been associating impotency with every new vaccine or treatment. But there is no medical evidence to suggest that this causes any impotency,” said Dr Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/impotence-post-jab-rumour-keeps-some-away-from-getting-vaxxed/articleshow/87573514.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The woman was into 34 weeks of pregnancy. GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel told TOI that the woman was referred to the hospital from the Virudhunagar Government Medical College Hospital on November 2 with severe Covid-19 symptoms. Hospital sources said the patient was admitted with 40% lung involvement and saturation level of 84%. Despite multi-disciplinary management and treatment with remdesivir injection, antibiotics and steroids, the patient died on Saturday afternoon after a four-day battle. The cause of death of the woman was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe clinical Covid-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure. The woman was partially vaccinated. Data from the GRH showed that in August and September, there have been no Covid-19 deaths at all among patients who were fully-vaccinated for Covid-19. The district has reported 14 Covid-19 deaths in October and November so far, whereas 693 fresh cases have been reported in the same period. Almost all recent Covid-19 deaths have been only of those who had comorbid conditions or those who are above 70-80 years of age. “With rains, more fever cases and recent crowding due to Diwali festival, there is a need to be alert for any possible rise in cases post Diwali. Public must cooperate in following all safety measures as schools have also now reopened,” said a health official. “We are still getting Covid-19 cases but the symptoms are not so significant and even the oxygen saturation levels don’t drop so much. Public needs to be aware that the fight against Covid-19 is not over. They must get fully-vaccinated as soon as possible. Despite repeated insistence by healthcare professionals, many are still hesitant or ignoring calls to follow safety measures and get vaccinated. This needs to change,” said a senior GRH doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/20-yr-old-pregnant-woman-dies-of-covid-in-madurai/articleshow/87573509.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Coimbatore||Public toilets lack basic amenities, remain dirty||COIMBATORE: Without proper water supply, doors and buckets, public washrooms in the city are of hardly any use to the public. It’s high time the city corporation took steps to rectify the issues and ensure their proper maintenance. A recent audit conducted by corporation officials revealed that 42 of the 371 washrooms and 1,009 of the 4,628 toilets in the city were not functional at all. They are either directly maintained by the civic body or through self-help groups. The audit also found that 1,646 taps and 1,505 doors were not functional at the toilets and there was immediate need to replace pipelines and carry out plumbing work. “Many toilets do not have doors and in some cases latches are not functional. We need to place 3,046 buckets, 2,748 lights, 264 washbasins and 482 dustbins at these toilets,” said a source with the city corporation. There are 91 toilets in the east zone, 79 in west zone, 64 in north zone, 65 in south zone and 72 in central zone. As most of these toilets lack basic amenities, people are forced to urinate and defecate in the open. P Saravanan, a commuter, said the toilets at Ukkadam bus terminal were in a pathetic condition. “The area stinks and as such people can’t even go near them. People could be spotted urinating in the open space nearby.” A Shahjahan, a resident of Karumbukadai, said free toilets were the worst maintained ones. “Comparatively, those maintained by the self-help groups are in a better condition. There is nothing wrong in increasing the fee for providing cleaner toilets for users.” An official with the corporation’s engineering wing said the audit was conducted to assess the real situation and identify the areas to be improved. “We have already sought help from various organizations, corporates and residents to develop them under the ‘Namakku Naame Thittam’ initiative. And many of them have come forward to do their bit for the cause. The overall situation will improve soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/public-toilets-lack-basic-amenities-remain-dirty/articleshow/87573503.cms||---

K Kumarasamy, who was the principal between 2002 and 2014, had misappropriated UGC funds to the tune of Rs 14 lakh. A committee of the director of collegiate education had verified the misappropriation. Seven years down the line, the state government has not taken any step to refund the money to UGC or any action against the retired principal, said P Juswanth Mohana Sen, who retired as principal from the college this year.  “This has resulted in UGC stopping funding to the college. It has asked the college to refund the money before seeking more grants. This has also affected teachers, who cannot approach UGC seeking research grants,” he said. The college administration had sent several reminders to the director of collegiate education, but there was no response, said principal in-charge P Parthiban. “The University Grants Commission has threatened to withdraw 2 (f), 12B status granted to the college under the UGC Act 1956. This will adversely affect the prospects of students and teachers,” he said. “The college has been facing severe staff shortage. Out of the 65 sanctioned teacher posts, 48 remain vacant. Similarly, 29 of the 32 non-teaching posts are vacant. The college has a sweeper, watchman and a library assistant, but no clerical staff.” Director of collegiate education C Poornachandran refused to comment on the issue when TOI contacted him over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cbm-college-on-verge-of-losing-aided-status/articleshow/87573513.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||In Patiala, Cong’s Pb incharge hails CM, slams Capt||Patiala: Congress Punjab affairs incharge and AICC general secretary Harish Chaudhary along with senior Congress leaders on Sunday held a meeting with party workers and cadre at circuit house here, turning it into a show of strength in the home town of party’s former Punjab CM, Capt Amarinder Singh, who recently launched his own political party. “Anyone who tried to finish Punjab and Punjabiyat was finished. Look at history: Mughals and Britishers also tried to finish Punjab, but they were shown the door. Now, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah want to end Punjab and Punjabis, but I would tell them that they both are making a mistake by doing the politics of ‘tod-marod’.” Hitting out at Amarinder, Chaudhary, without taking any names, said, “Everyone in Punjab knows your soft behaviour towards Akali Dal leaders that ruined the state for 10 years during their rule, but as a government head you had remained in alliance with them during the last 4.5 years. A number of legislators and Congress workers told me they wanted their CM changed. They wanted the Punjab CM to be replaced by a Congress leader who had struggled. The incumbent CM is a leader of Congress workers and who struggled while sitting at the last post in the society. Punjab CM, during his childhood and adolescence, had sold crackers. Channi has not become CM because of controversy in the state, but because of the kind thoughts of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. “In 2022, the Congress government will be of common man and not of any royal persons who have houses bigger than marriage palaces. In the elections of 2022, people of Punjab will decide whether the country will be ruled by farmers, youth and women or Ambani-Adani. People of Punjab are wise and know who is original Aam Aadmi or duplicate Aam Aadmi.” Chaudhary, while replying to a media query, said this is not the Channi government, but the government of common man and Channi himself says this. “The government under Channi is working efficiently and doing work on all the projects,” he said, adding that the sole purpose of his visit to Patiala was to meet Congress workers. Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Singh Nagra said the time when leaders used to meet senior leaders in Chandigarh only has gone as today senior leaders of the party had come to Patiala to meet party workers. He said now there were no barriers and leaders would stay with workers and workers would stay with leaders. Congress leader Lal Singh claimed that Amarinder’s motive was not to win elections by forming his party, but only he wanted to defeat the Congress and make the BJP happy. “In return, Capt Amarinder wants to all cases of Enforcement Directorate against his family members cancelled. Under his rule, there was no saying of Congress leaders, legislators or workers.” Amarinder’s wife and Congress MP from Patiala, Preneet Kaur, did not attend the event. Also, 43 Congress councillors marked their presence to meet Chaudhary on Sunday, including 17 from Patiala City 1, 24 from Patiala II, and two councillors from Sanaur. Patiala senior deputy mayor YS Yogi raised the demand to change the city mayor, who was recently caught in a controversy after his pictures with Capt Amarinder were seen on flex boards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-patiala-congs-pb-incharge-hails-cm-slams-capt/articleshow/87573537.cms||---

The protesters observed that the Kerala government is wrongfully claiming that the dam is weak and unable to hold up to 144 feet of water. “The Tamil Nadu government should ensure that the dam is rightfully under their control. The dam water level affects TN farmers the most. Further, due to tension created in Kerala, central forces must be deployed to ensure security of the dam especially with state public works department (PWD) authorities also being present there,” said Murugan of Periyar single crop farmers’ association, Melur. The protesters also demanded the state government to ensure efforts to strengthen the dam for it to hold up to 152 feet of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/deploy-central-forces-at-mullaperiyar-dam/articleshow/87573516.cms||---

He was declared brought dead at Calcutta National Medical College Hospital. ID found on him showed his name was Jhantu Das and he was a resident of Raja Manindra Road. According to police, Das parked between pillars 16 and 17 and jumped, falling close to the Pragati Maidan police station. This is the fourth such incident on Maa flyover since 2018. The last incident was reported on September 20 when a Lake Town realtor in his 50s stopped his car on the same flank and jumped to his death. The other incidents took place in 2018 and 2019. Police sources said they have found an electric bill and an ID card from Das’s car. Cops are checking all details. They have seized the car and contacted the transport department’s pool car wing for further leads. A senior officer said a post-mortem will be conducted and the police will speak to the victim’s family. Late-night reports suggested that the car was used for office work by a senior transport official and Das was his driver. This, however, could not be verified. Police said the Garia-bound ramp is the highest stretch of the Maa flyover. The repeated suicide attempts, police said, may necessitate additional measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-jumps-to-death-from-maa/articleshow/87573090.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt to outsource evaluation of schemes for women, senior citizens||KOLKATA: The Bengal government will outsource field evaluations of its social schemes for the elderly and women to international consultancy majors. The World Bank has recently sanctioned a 125 million USD soft loan to Bengal for its women’s empowerment and Inclusive Social Protection programmes. The state wants to utilise these funds to knit its existing social schemes to address two primary concerns — an ageing population and increase women’s labour force participation. Sources said the shortlisted consultants include PWC, Ernst & Young, Grant Thronton, Sutra Consulting, Ipos Research, GVK, Lochan & Co and Mazars Advisory. The consultants will act as independent verification agencies and will verify documents at the field level and hold discussions with stakeholders. They will audit and verify data and documents from 2021 till 2023 and will also give feedback to the state through social researchers who will interview the beneficiaries. The concept note shared with the consultancy majors (a copy of which is with TOI), said, “Demographically, the state’s population is ageing rapidly with the elderly growing at an annual average of 2.6%, creating higher levels of dependency burden on households and in turn adversely impacting state expenditures and future fiscal consolidation.” The state says the proportion of elderly was nearly 10%, compared to 9.6% for India in 2019, and by 2041, 15% of the state will be senior citizens. The other issue which the Bengal government is keen to address is the fact that women’s labour force participation (LFP) at 16% is much below the national average of 23%. The note said, “There is an urgent need to focus on increasing old-age care, pension and health costs on one hand, and, on the other hand, improve the female workforce participation.” Initially, the social schemes will focus on widows due to no inheritance rights and high levels of dependence on their children, disability pensions to reduce the need for expensive institutional care, and low labour force participation of women. Bengal’s concerns are shared by central data, which said that in 2001, the elderly population in Bengal was 7.1% and in 2011 it was 8.5%, while in 2021 it is considered to be 11.3%. The projection for 2031 is 15.7%. The data said life expectancy is gradually on the rise in Bengal and women have a higher life expectancy. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already started several pension schemes for various vulnerable groups, like the elderly, widows, disabled and SC & ST categories. An officer said central data showed 80% of the elderly women population in Bengal is entirely dependent on others. The officer said that while old-age dependency was 11.9% in 2001 and 13.2% in 2011, in 2021 it is 16.6 %. The projection for 2031 is 18.9%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-outsource-evaluation-of-schemes-for-women-sr-citizens/articleshow/87573089.cms||Debasis Konar

The nalas including Chotapul, Ganganagar Nala, Kandigal Gate, Railway Bridge and Bahadurpura Mecca Colony have heap of garbage and overflowing sewage water, mainly due to poor desilting carried out by civic contractors. Likewise, Dabeerpura Nala has been a huge problem for the residents in the locality as it is open with no fencing around it. While the matter was brought to the notice of the authorities, no action has been taken yet to put up any fencing around. Debris, mud and wastage being dumped into it has not been cleared for the past three months. Presently, the temporarily erected bamboos have turned weak in the recent rains and it overflows in case of heavy rains, causing much inconvenience to the residents. Mohammed Ahmed, TTDP, GHMC, Minority vice president, told TOI that nala has not been cleaned for the last several weeks despite several complaints. The officials asked concerned authorities to look into the matter and inspect the condition around the nala but the authorities reportedly failed to resolve the issue. “It is a matter of concern for everyone passing through this route. The matter was taken up with GHMC higher-ups who asked the officials to inspect and address the issue but nothing has been done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-open-nalas-and-lack-of-cleanliness-irk-residents/articleshow/87573932.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Nagpur||4 years after engagement, Pakistan bride allowed to enter India for marriage with Nagpurian||NAGPUR: Vandana Keswani, of Sukkur town of Pakistan’s Sindh province, was 25 years old when she got engaged to Nagpur’s Anil Jhamnani, then 26. They are set to marry after a four year wait, as strained ties between the two countries followed by Covid kept the couple away from each other. Now 29 years old, Vandana crossed the border last week as part of special crossovers arranged from time to time. In the meantime, Anil, who was a Pakistani citizen living in India on a long-term visa (LTV), has become an Indian citizen. The marriage has been fixed for December 13. The couple may set an example of unflinching love and patience, but their story also points to continuing people to people interaction between the two countries. This goes on even as curbs on cross border travel continue following Covid. During the pandemic, the borders were closed, leaving people on both sides stranded for nearly a year. The ban on movement has only been partially eased. Rajesh Jhambia, leader of Sindhi-Hindi Panchayat, an organization of migrants from India took up the couple’s case. Amid tense moments, both families had decided to wait. The couple was engaged in May 2018, and after the marriage date was fixed a year later, the girl’s family applied for a visa to India. In that time the surgical strikes took place and visas for Pakistanis trying to enter India were denied. This continued for nearly a year. In their second attempt, the visa was rejected due to technical reasons, and then Covid shut down the borders. Recently, the boy’s family obtained Indian citizenship. This bolstered the case to push for her visa on the grounds that she was getting married to an Indian citizen, said Jhambia. Vandana got a spouse visa early this year but movement across the border remained restricted. In July, Vandana and her family were finally allowed to cross over by air. Due to the high cost involved, they chose to wait till the land borders opened. This happened only on November 3, when Vandana crossed over with 140 odd persons. Vandana is, however, coming all the way alone. “The list of persons crossing over on November 3 also had names of my parents. However, my sister’s marriage has been fixed and they had to stay back,” she told TOI. Vandana is now staying with her relatives, and hopes her parents are able to reach India to attend her marriage. “The government should consider my case and my parents should be included in next crossover, so that they can be in India to attend my marriage,” she said. During the four-year-long wait, the couple decided to hold on to the relationship. “I have only seen her during the video call at engagement. We were introduced by a relative. Over the last four years, we have been talking regularly and I find her to be compatible. So I decided to wait,” says Ajit. “There were moments when I spoke of breaking the marriage, but that was only out of frustration and did not really mean it,” he says. It was a tough time, especially for the girl’s family, added Jhambia. It’s time the situation on the borders is normalised, he said. The 144 persons who crossed on November 3 includes stranded Indian nationals in Pakistan, as well as Pakistani nationals coming here on fresh visa. There is a third category of Pakistani citizens living in India, who had gone there for a visit and are now returning. More such persons have also gone recently for brief visits to Pakistan on no-objection return to India (NORI) visas. Ajit’s family had come to India in 1991 and settled in Amravati. They returned in 2006 after their passport expired and came back a year later, after which they have been living in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-yrs-after-engagement-pak-bride-allowed-to-enter-india-for-marriage-with-nagpurian/articleshow/87573526.cms||Shishir Arya

Doctors also urged people to achieve a healthy lifestyle as many lacked proper physical exercise during Covid-19 lockdown. M P Sankarapandian, founder, Neervala Atharangal Paathukappu and Makkal Pothunala Arakattalai, on Sunday, carried the model on his two-wheeler on National Cancer Day observed every year on November 7, to create awareness on avoiding smoking in various public places across Madurai city. “Last year, I decided to do this for National Cancer Day every year. Smoking cigarettes is the leading cause of cancer and that is why it is important to highlight the importance of quitting smoking. Pamphlets and pens with causes of cancer and its prevention mentioned were also distributed to the public,” he said. The activist interacted with public at Mattuthavani bus stand, Goripalayam junction, Town hall road, Periyar bus stand, Gandhi Museum and Simmakkal. Dr Krishnakumar Rathnam, a senior medical oncologist, observed that the food intake had increased whereas physical exercise was lacking. “Maintaining a healthy lifestyle plays a key role in preventing any immune related disease like various types of cancer. Exercise is important to have good immunity,” he said. He added that while cancer patients have come out of the fear of going to the hospital during the pandemic for treatment, many are still not coming forward for general check-up. “Though fear of Covid-19 has come down now, many cancer survivors are still hesitant of taking the vaccine. There is no reason for them to not take the Covid-19 vaccine,” said Rathnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/spreading-awareness-on-the-need-to-maintain-a-healthy-lifestyle/articleshow/87573531.cms||---

The opposition has made it clear that such an order cannot be issued at the bureaucratic level without the knowledge of the chief minister’s office. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said the chief minister’s office is behind this order and “the claim that they were unaware of it is unbelievable”. The government cannot run away from the responsibility of this order by putting the entire blame on bureaucrats, he said. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said that the chief minister is responsible for issuing such a controversial order. “No one believes that the government was kept in the dark while issuing such an order. If a minister claims that he was unaware, it is possible. But such a crucial decision will have been taken with the consent of the chief minister. There is a need for a judicial probe behind such a controversial order,” said Sudhakaran. Former irrigation and water resources minister NK Premachandran said such a decision cannot be taken without the consent of the chief minister and it will have to be understood that a political decision was also behind taking such a crucial decision. “This decision would only weaken all the claims made by the state when the case comes before the Supreme Court on November 11. The state has totally surrendered before Tamil Nadu by taking such a decision,” said Premachandran. If the forest department has taken such a decision then it has to be understood that they were forced to take such a decision under the influence of someone. It has to be believed that the state government tried to hide such an order and it was due to the statement released by Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin that we could know about such a decision, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-lashes-out-at-govt-for-tree-felling-permission/articleshow/87573116.cms||---

---||Madurai||An uphill task to get kids physically fit again||MADURAI: The reopening of schools for classes I to VIII is bringing to the fore concerns about the physical health of students in addition to the challenges in psychologically and emotionally adjusting back to classroom learning. “Most of the children have become obese or have shown significant weight gain during the last one year. Parents have largely pampered children and got them whatever they wanted to eat, including junk food. With lack of physical exercise as well, it has affected physical and mental health of students,” said Dr B Kannan, paediatrician, adding that it can also lead to obese kids getting bullied on their return to school. Parents said that the school routine has been integral in keeping students healthy. “Since my husband and I are both working, we cannot monitor children at home all the time. When we were at home during the lockdown, my daughter and son got used to eating whenever they wanted and sleeping later than usual at night. They also didn’t go out for sports or other outdoor extra-curricular activities,” said K Thangam Meenakshi, a parent. Another parent, S Sathya said that her eight-year-old son is refusing to eat healthy food at home and prefers junk. “We can only compel to some extent as we don’t want to be harsh on him. But, if it was school, teachers always asked them to bring one vegetable every day for lunch and they ensure children finish eating it too,” she added. K Saravanan, a primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF), said that he had made efforts over the last three months to provide noon meal with egg for students of his school at their residences. “Physical health condition is just as important to be paid attention to when children come to school. With both parents working in many families, they are not able to take care of children in the afternoon. In school children sit together and eat and share which is also an important activity,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/an-uphill-task-to-get-kids-physically-fit-again/articleshow/87573539.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Secretary of the association, S Vimalnathan, filed a petition to the DVAC, Chennai condemning the practice of collecting commission from farmers for procuring their paddy in the DPCs run by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC). “It is a well-known fact that farmers had to shell out Rs 40 for every 40kg of paddy they supplied to the DPCs. Now, it has been increased to Rs 52 per 40 kg of paddy at the DPCs. It came into effect during the kuruvai paddy harvest that ended recently,” said Vimalnathan. The farmers’ association leader raised apprehension over the possibilities of collecting bribes up to Rs 500 crore in the upcoming samba paddy harvest that is likely to commence in the third week of November. Stressing on the need for carrying out searches at the DPCs and the offices of the TNCSC, Vimalanathan expressed his displeasure over the response from the DVAC in July to his petition dated June 24. He also shared the copy of the reply from the DVAC, which stated that the petition filed by him was forwarded to the managing director of the TNCSC. “When I reported an issue to the law enforcing agency, they forwarded the complaint to the department, which is steeped in corruption,” said Vimalanathan. He said that around 2,500 DPCs will be functioning during the samba. “DVAC should be given a free hand to act against corruption in the DPCs,” he said, adding that CBI should also conduct searches as the funds for procuring paddy is issued by the Food Corporation of India (FCI). tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-body-seeks-dvac-to-act-against-graft-at-dpcs/articleshow/87573551.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the official hooch toll was 33 as authorities confirmed only 13 deaths in Gopalganj, instead of 21 reported, and 14 in West Champaran, instead of 16 so far. Overall, at least 181 people have been arrested since Wednesday when four persons died at Mohammadpur village in Gopalganj after consuming spurious liquor. Ranjeet Kumar Singh and Dhananjay Sao of Hassanpur Surat village under the Patori police station area in Samastipur died on late Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, respectively. The village is around 4km from Rupauli Chaksima from where spurious liquor was bought. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon told TOI over phone on Sunday that Singh was clandestinely undergoing treatment at a private hospital after consuming poisonous liquor. “His family members cremated his body in a hurry. Police reached his house on Sunday after getting information and the family members admitted that Singh had fallen ill after consuming liquor,” Dhillon said. The SP said Sao had also consumed liquor with Singh and was undergoing treatment at home. When police came to know, he was rushed to Samastipur Sadar hospital but died in the course of treatment, he said. Sao told the police before death that he had purchased two small bottles of IMLF from one Rahul Mahto on November 3 night. “They had consumed two bottles and, later, fell ill,” he said. He said overall 15 persons, including three directly linked with the hooch deaths, were arrested in the last 24 hours. Those arrested included liquor smuggler Abhilash Rai’s wife Kusum Devi (35), Yaduvash Rai, who was undergoing treatment, and Vicky Mahto. “Mahto had purchased spurious IMFL bottles from one Bhagwan Ram, who is evading arrest. Mahto had also sold liquor to Singh and Sao. More than 700 litres of IMFL and country liquor have been seized in Samastipur in the last 24 hours,” he said. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said police arrested altogether 51 people and seized several hundred litres of illicit liquor in the district in the last 24 hours. “Total 81 people have been arrested in the last three days,” he said. “Two liquor manufacturing factories with sealing and stamping equipment at Manjhagarh and one in town area were busted. Earlier, one such factory was busted in the riverine belt after hooch deaths,” Anand said. West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar said more than 100 people involved in liquor manufacturing and smuggling were arrested in the last three days. “We also had a meeting with all the SHOs and chowkidars to strengthen the system more for curbing illicit liquor manufacturing and smuggling in the district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/98-more-arrested-as-samastipur-hooch-death-toll-rises-to-six/articleshow/87572901.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Hyderabad||Fuel price cut an eyewash, Centre must remove cess: Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday tore into the BJP-led Union government by terming the slash in fuel prices an “eyewash”, and charging the Centre of lying to the people of the country on fuel prices. Also, the BJP government reduced prices marginally against a mountain of hikes it affected on fuel rates in the past one year. “The BJP government reduced prices marginally after adverse results in by-polls in the country,” KCR said. The CM demanded the BJP government at the Centre withdraw the entire cess on petrol and diesel and bring down the prices to the level of 2014. Making it clear that Telangana state will not reduce its tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel, he demanded the Centre to bring the price of petrol to Rs 78 by totally withdrawing the cess levied by it. The CM demanded that the Centre immediately withdraw the cess on petrol and diesel, and reduce the financial burden on the citizens. Escalating fuel prices had resulted in drastic increase in prices of essential commodities, including pulses and edible oils. This was burning holes in the pockets of middle class people, he said on Sunday. “If the Centre is seriously concerned about general public welfare, all cess should be immediately withdrawn. Petrol prices will automatically come down to Rs 78 per litre,” KCR said. In 2014, when BJP came to power, crude oil price was $105 per barrel, which has come down to $83 today. Citing crude oil prices in international market, the Centre had blatantly lied and increased fuel prices drastically and deceived the people, the CM pointed out. “See the double standards of the BJP government in levying cess on fuel. The state governments get a share in excise duty as part of tax devolution due to the Finance Commission’s recommendations. But they do not get any share in cess and surcharges collected by the Centre.” In the past six years, the Telangana government has not revised VAT on petrol and diesel, while neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government is collecting road tax of Rs 1 per litre. “The Central government should roll back the prices by removing cess,” KCR demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fuel-price-cut-an-eyewash-centre-must-remove-cess-kcr/articleshow/87573560.cms||Roushan Ali

The accused used interactive voice response system, impersonated officials of various US departments and convinced the victims to pay money in the form of gift cards, target cards and Google Pay, in the form of electronic currency (Paxful App/bitcoin/crypto wallet) by telling them that they had committed illegal acts like fraud, drugs peddling or had defaulted in payment of tax and to settle the same, police inspector cyber crime Vishwesh Karpe told the court during the anticipatory bail hearing of a 35-year-old Gujarat resident. The man had claimed to be a property broker and that he wasn’t involved in the racket. The accused used to then withdraw money in Indian currency at Ahmedabad, thus cheating the US citizens. “…in the case at hand, I find that the statements of most of the witnesses indicate that it is Digvijay Rajput who is the mastermind of the entire offence of setting up a fake call centre to lure the victims. It was Digvijay who had employed most of the accused employees, all of whom have, admittedly, been released on bail,” the court stated while granting the anticipatory bail. “The only involvement of the applicant in this case, as indicated by the leave and license agreement produced by him before the IO, appears to be that he identified the hotel Eden Garden and had executed the leave and licence agreement with said Digvijay”. Karpe said that his presence is required in custody to trace the money extorted from US nationals. Public prosecutor Ralston Barreto said the applicant procured the premises on leave and licence basis and was running an illegal call centre and without his presence, it will be unable to detect the money trail as money is in the form of bitcoins, cryptocurrency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fake-call-centre-accused-imitated-us-officials-cops-tell-court/articleshow/87573954.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He said that Mullaperiyar is a serious issue for the state and the officials alone shouldn’t have taken a decision on such matters. The political leadership should take note of the attitude of such officials seriously, he said. A political decision by the state government is needed on such issues and the decisions at the official-level is not sufficient, Rajendran added. Speaking to the media in Alappuzha on Sunday, Rajendran said that there is no need for the state government to slash tax on fuel. Kerala government has not hiked the tax on fuel for the past six years. Moreover, the tax charged in the state is 1% less than what was in force during the tenure of the Oommen Chandy government, he said. Referring to other states that slashed fuel tax, he said that those who hiked the tax in the past few years should cut down the same. The senior CPI leader refused to comment on CPM taking disciplinary action against its senior leader G Sudhakaran. He said that the matter was an internal issue of CPM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/take-strict-action-against-erring-officials-kanam/articleshow/87573129.cms||---

A stormwater drain collapsed near Cantonment and a tiled house caved in at Marsingpet locality in the city leaving a senior citizen injured. Anna Nagar Road near science park, Bharathidasan Road near Mutharaiyar statue and EVR Road near MGMGH were inundated even after dry weather prevailed throughout the day. Heber Road was completely flooded with two-wheelers struggling to pass. The stormwater drain in the locality had failed to dissipate the run-off water. Residents expressed their apprehension over the inundation of roads after a moderate rain. A stormwater drain collapsed in the SBI officers’ colony locality near Major Saravanan Road. “Even with the presence of the drain, our roads were getting inundated. Now as the drain has collapsed, the inundation threat has doubled,” P Ranjan, a resident said. As the locality has only one access way abutting the broken stormwater drain, residents urged Trichy Corporation to study the stability of the road and compound walls near the road in the wake of the rain. Trichy city received an average rain of 19 mm to 38 mm till Sunday morning. As per the IMD prediction, the district will witness thunderstorms in the coming days. “We are gradually redeveloping the drains in the Cantonment vicinity.

The CM said this decision would benefit nearly 40,000 families under various schemes of improvement trusts across Punjab. He added that the decision had been taken after considering repeated requests received from various improvement trusts either to waive off or reduce the rate of interest to be charged on the enhancement amount to be recovered from the allottees. Vidhan Sabha session extended for another day In view of varied legislative business, the cabinet decided to extend the 16 special session of 15th Punjab Vidhan Sabha by another day on November 11 (Thursday). Earlier, the session was only convened for one day on November 8 (Monday). Approval to tissue culture-based seed potato rules The cabinet also gave its nod to ‘The Punjab Tissue Culture-Based Seed Potato Rules-2021’ to develop Punjab as a standard potato seed centre. This would help in achieving the target of agriculture diversification by increasing the potato acreage with production of four lakh metric tonne (LMT) of potato from one lakh hectare. Now Punjab has become the first state in the country to have the facility of tissue culture based certification, which would further lead to develop Jalandhar-Kapurthala belt as the export hub of potato. The council of ministers also approved to introduce the ‘Punjab Horticulture Nursery Bill-2021’ in special Vidhan Sabha session by amending ‘Punjab Fruit Nursery Act-1961’. Ex-post facto approval of enhanced pension The state government had enhanced the amount of old age pension from Rs 750 to Rs 1,500 per month with effect from July 1, 2021. Therefore, the council of ministers on Sunday gave ex-post approval for payment of enhanced pension through cheques under the old age pension and other financial schemes for the month of July, 2021 as one-time relaxation in the rules and thereafter disbursement would be done through direct benefit transfer as before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/soon-50-cut-in-interest-from-improvement-trust-allottees/articleshow/87573570.cms||---

In this regard, the panchayat recently launched the ‘Our village, our products and our market’ campaign to make the village self-reliant. Providing details of the campaign, panchayat development officer Mahesh K said: “Initially, we launched a survey in the panchayat to identify women who have been making traditional products, but not marketing them. We hoped to popularise such products and create a market in the village. In the first phase, we have identified nearly 30 women, including those from tribal families who are into making traditional products like baskets, brooms, pickles, cotton wicks (bathi), products from jackfruit seeds and other items. During the survey, we realised that there is a huge demand for the traditional recipes prepared for women during pregnancy and motherhood, not only locally, but also outside. However, our focus for the time being is to ensure that these products get sufficient buyers in the village, for which a WhatsApp group has been created, and a list of vendors has also been shared. Individual customers can also contact these women directly,” he said. The monetary transactions will be directly between the vendor or the customer, and the women selling products. The panchayat will only give the women a platform. Also, under the solid and liquid resource management, the panchayat collects door-to-door dry waste thrice a week. “We have decided to use this vehicle to collect the products from the women, and deliver them to the buyers in the village during the remaining three days,” Mahesh said. The panchayat is also considering launching a website for the products based on the response. The population of the Kadoor gram panchayat comprising Kadoor and Nadoor villages is around 5,000. There are about 1,061 families and nearly 583 people have registered under the Mgnrega. With regard to Covid vaccination, 100% of the population have been administered their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/panchayat-launches-campaign-to-empower-women/articleshow/87572520.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The locals and the hotel are already in a dispute over a concrete wall constructed by the latter on the beach. Residents said that they noticed the structure on November 5 and claimed that the hotel planned to host a party for its guests in the structure. They said that the structure is damaging to the sand dunes and its ecosystem. “The hotel wants to usurp the beach and has been making frantic attempts in this direction. They first erected the wall on the beach, claiming it to be a anti-sand erosion structure. But it is visible that there is sand erosion where the wall has been erected and there is no sand erosion where no wall stands,” local Pundalik Raiker alleged. The locals said they are angry with the inaction of the authorities like the Taleigao panchayat and the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) in the matter. Last month, the GCZMA ruled in favour of the hotel and withdrew a showcause notice which had been issued to the hotel based on a complaint filed by Vainguinim locals. “The state government and the hotel are hand-in-gloves,” Raiker alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vainguinim-locals-angry-over-temporary-structure-on-beach/articleshow/87573961.cms||---

The Congress MP told reporters in Thodupuzha on Sunday that it should be doubted whether Kerala was ruled by the ministers of other states. “Permission has been given to Tamil Nadu for cutting 15 trees near to the baby dam. The permission was given after Tamil Nadu ministers visited the Mullaperiyar dam on Friday and sought permission for cutting trees and the Kerala government immediately issued the order,” said Kuriakose. “Forest minister A K Saseendran had said that he was not aware of giving permission for cutting the trees and it has been revealed now as to who has the upper hand on state affairs. The government was hiding real facts regarding an important issue which will seriously affect the state. It was the Kerala government which stood for a new dam and strengthening the old dam is not a proper solution. The recent activities from the government showed that the Pinarayi government has no sincere stand on the issue,” the MP said. Kerala Congress chairman and former minister P J Joseph said that the chief minister should answer about the controversial tree felling order. “It was unbelievable that an official granted permission in such a controversial issue. New dam is the only possible solution to solve the issue and there is no need to strengthen the baby dam,” said Joseph. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dean-kuriakose-pj-joseph-decry-permission-to-remove-trees/articleshow/87573139.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede part of Aryan Khan kidnap plot, says NCP minister Nawab Malik; officer denies claim||MUMBAI: NCP cabinet minister Nawab Malik on Sunday alleged that NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede was part of a conspiracy to kidnap actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan for ransom and BJP functionary Mohit Bharatiya was the mastermind of the plan. Malik made it clear that his fight was neither against the BJP nor the NCB, but he will continue his campaign against the “wrongdoers in the system”. Both Wankhede and Bhartiya denied Malik’s charges, saying they are baseless and false. Calling them a “bunch of lies”, Wankhede said: “Malik is raising allegations without any basis. Aryan was produced before the magistrate’s court and sessions court, where he said he had no complaints against the NCB. In the Bombay high court too, during the bail hearing, neither Aryan nor his lawyer levelled any allegations against the NCB. The defence even filed an affidavit in the HC saying they are staying away from statements made by a politician.” But Malik said: “I am making the statement with full responsibility. Wankhede was the party of the kidnap plot in collaboration with Bharatiya, who is the part of his private army. Initially, the deal was fixed for Rs 25 crore. It was reduced to Rs 18 crore after negotiations, and Rs 50 lakh was given. Unfortunately, the deal did not work out owing to NCB witness Kiran Gosavi’s selfie with Aryan, which went viral.” Malik said he has confirmed information that Bharatiya met Wankhede near a graveyard in Oshiwara. “They were lucky that the CCTV camera near the kabarasatan has not been operational for a long time, otherwise the footage would show the meeting.” He further claimed that Kashiff Khan, the managing director of Fashion TV India and alleged organizer of the “rave party” on the cruise liner, had invited Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh and the children of the cabinet members in the MVA government on the ship. “But Shaikh refused his invitation,” Malik said. He also alleged that besides Bharatiya, his brother-in-law Rishabh Saachdeva, Pratik Gabba and Aamir Furniturewala were instrumental in taking Aryan to the cruise ship. “Why were they not arrested by Wankhede,” he asked. Bharatiya said Malik and Sunil Patil, who first gave a tip off to the NCB about the cruise party, were friends for 20 years. “When Patil used to party in The Lalit hotel, Malik would go too. Today, Malik has confirmed his relations with him; it’s a conspiracy set up by the NCP along with Patil,” he said. “I had earlier said that a cabinet minister, who has relations with drug peddlers, was involved in a cruise party. Today Malik has confirmed that Shaikh has relations with Khan and that the children of NCP leaders and ministers were in contact with peddlers and were invited to parties.” “I am open for any inquiry...Malik should prove his allegations,” said Bharatiya. “I will go to court on all the allegations. I have also filed cases in the court for defamation...The NCP must clarify its relations with Patil...” (Inputs by Chaitanya Marpakwar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malik-wankhede-part-of-aryan-kidnap-plot-officer-denies-claim-in-mumbai/articleshow/87574019.cms||---
---||Bareilly||UP: After buffaloes & pet dog, now police searching for neta’s mare||BAREILLY: In the headlines for being made to find missing buffaloes and a pet dog, now police in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur are searching for a politician's mare. Nazish Khan, the Congress district president of farmers’ cell, while sharing photographs of his favourite "black mare with a white face", registered a complaint with the cops after the four-year-old "family member" went missing on Friday. The Congress functionary took to his Twitter handle and tagged officials to expedite the case. ADG Bareilly zone Avinash Chandra was quick to take note of Khan's online complaint and a case was registered at Kotwali police station. In the complaint, Khan mentioned that he had bought the mare for Rs 80,000. It was tied behind a mill at Topkhana Gate near Hazratpur Square when it disappeared on the night of November 5, he added. Khan's confidence in the Rampur cops’ ability to trace missing animals seems to have surged after they successfully traced Samajwadi Party leader and former cabinet minister Azam Khan's seven buffaloes from Pasiyapur dairy in January 2014 and later a pet dog of the then district magistrate (DM) Amit Kishor in less than 24 hours. Three cops were also suspended in Azam's missing buffalo case. “We are all aware of the famous case in Rampur some years ago when Azam Khan's cattle went missing and were found in no time. I want the district administration and local police to show similar resolve and help find my missing mare,” Khan told the local media on Sunday. “It has been a part of my family and the children are very much attached to her,” he added. Krishna Autar, the SHO of Kotwali police station, said that all efforts are on to trace the animal and Rampur police will “soon get it home to her rightful owner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-buffaloes-pet-dog-now-rampur-police-searching-for-politicians-mare/articleshow/87571982.cms||Maria Khan
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand government must cut fuel prices on lines of Centre: BJP||RANCHI: Upping the ante against Hemant Soren government on fuel prices, opposition BJP and petroleum dealers association in Jharkhand demanded reduction in the state’s value added taxes (VAT) on petrol and diesel to further prune its prices and reduce financial burden on people after Narendra Modi government cut down the prices two days ago. Following the Centre’s appeal, many states largely governed by the BJP downed their taxes. The saffron camp is demanding equivalent slash in the state with immediate effect. Hours after BJP’s Ranchi unit staged a stir and submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan, state BJP president Deepak Prakash speaking at party office in the afternoon demanded a cut of Rs 5 and Rs 10 on petrol and diesel respectively at state level too. “After ensuring uninterrupted free vaccines to a billion people so far to fight the pandemic, Narendra Modi government has ensured cuts of Rs 5 and Rs 10 on petrol and diesel to unburden common people. Now, it’s time for the state government to also resort to similar slash so that fuel can become cheaper here,” said Prakash, accusing JMM-Congress-RJD alliance government of not doing so despite it was being done by many other states promptly. “Even Odisha, Sikkim, Rajasthan which have non-NDA rule have reduced the prices agreeing to the Centre’s appeal to cut down on state taxes. But Jharkhand government continues to remain defiant and unmoved by people’s woes. While it was doing politics all these while by staging protests on fuel hikes accusing the Centre of inflation, when it comes to real action, it continues to cry funds crunch,” he said. In Jharkhand, Rs 17 is charged on petrol and Rs 12.50 on diesel as state’s VAT. Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers Association too backed BJP’s demand stating that at least 5 % reduction in taxes will help the state to earn more revenues. “Compared to other states, VAT in Jharkhand has always been much higher as a result petrol pumps on bordering regions have suffered losses because buses, trucks and other vehicles tend to fill fuel in neighbouring states. It’s high time the state reduces at least 5% tax which will boost sales and help to generate more revenues,” said Ashok Singh, president of the petroleum outfit. State’s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon couldn’t be contacted for comments despite trying him several times. However, in the past, he said that decreasing prices on fuel is largely the onus of the Centre as after imposition of GST, states have limited option to generate own revenues. Congress spokesperson Abha Sinha, however, in a statement said that things will be sorted out following a meeting with chief minister soon. “The finance minister has maintained that he will consult with CM to take any call. We welcome his decision. Our government has been working for public welfare even amid peak of Covid-19 despite uncontrolled inflation by the Centre,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/hemant-government-must-cut-fuel-prices-on-lines-of-centre-bjp/articleshow/87563136.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Goa||‘Revoke nods to structure on Old Goa world heritage site’||Old Goa: A large number of people gathered at the Gandhi Circle, Old Goa, on Sunday to protest against the construction of a ground-plus-one bungalow within the protected world heritage site. The protesters demanded that the permissions granted to an influential BJP functionary for the bungalow be revoked. Citizens, along with members of the Save Old Goa Committee, alleged that former superintending archaeologist of ASI, Amarnath Ramakrishna, who was the first person to raise the issue of the construction, had been transferred and posted to Chennai as he didn’t support the government on the issue. One of the protesters, Aruna Wagh said, “Transfers of government officials usually take place in April and May. However, Ramakrishna was transferred in September and therefore, we feel the government has done this intentionally to protect the illegal structure which citizens have been protesting against for the past one-and-half-year. Old Goa is a holy place and also an international heritage site. We request chief minister Pramod Sawant to listen to the citizens and protect the heritage site.” Protesters speculated that Ramakrishna was transferred as ASI’s Goa office had to submit an affidavit in the court and it was expected that he would bring out the manner in which the permission had been granted by the state government. Tulio D’Souza, an architect, said, “The government transferred this officer because they do not want him to give the real position on the site. They want a pliable officer who will give an affidavit that will help these illegalities. We want the government to revoke the permission given to the illegal structure and demolish it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revoke-nods-to-structure-on-old-goa-world-heritage-site/articleshow/87573600.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Petro dealers seek 5% reduction in VAT||Sindri: The Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers Association on Saturday demanded the state government to reduce the VAT (Value-Added Tax) on petroleum products by at least 5 per cent. Association president Ashok Singh told reporters that if the Jharkhand government reduces VAT by 5 per cent, it would incur a loss of just Rs 3.61 per litre which amounts to Rs 38 crore a month, whereas it would earn more than Rs 95 crore in the same period owing to the increased sales of petroleum products. “The state government’s earning from petroleum products would increase by at least Rs 600 crore per annum,” he claimed. After the central government decided to reduce the excise duty on petroleum products, 14 states, including neighbouring ones like West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, have reduced VAT rates leading to a reduction in prices in those states. Jharkhand has not yet reduced the VAT on petroleum products. “As a result, the sale of petroleum products in Jharkhand has declined sharply,” Singh said and added that the sale of diesel in Jharkhand declined by nearly 20 per cent in October this year compared to the same period last year. “Sales of petroleum products in Jharkhand have declined from 1.45 lakh kilolitres to 1.05 lakh as drivers of long-running vehicles like trucks prefer purchasing petrol or diesel from the neighbouring states of Bihar and West Bengal due to higher taxes here,” he added. After the reduction in rates, Bihar charges 16.37 per cent VAT on petroleum products whereas the rate in Jharkhand still stands at 22 per cent plus Re 1 cess, which is the highest compared to all neighbouring states, Singh said and added that West Bengal has also reduced the VAT by Rs 3 on petroleum products. Singh alleged that the Narendra Modi government has made taxation on petroleum products a political issue making people suffer on account of increased prices of essential commodities. “Excise duty on petrol was Rs 9.60 during the UPA regime and Rs 3.60 on diesel. But the NDA government took it up to Rs 35 gradually. It reduced the excise duty in 2018 after adverse election results in some states and has again slashed it after the results in recently concluded polls in some states didn’t go in its favour,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/petro-dealers-seek-5-reduction-in-vat/articleshow/87560032.cms||---
---||Ranchi||State likely face fresh trouble for failing to define state locals, linked to 75% quota in pvt jobs||Ranchi: The JMM-led government is likely to face fresh trouble from socio-political outfits in the state for the delay in framing a state employment policy and not for coming up with a definition for state locals. It may be noted that the lack of a definition for state locals is delaying the implementation of the 75% quota in private jobs. A bill in this regard, the Jharkhand State Appointment of Local Candidates Bill, 2021, was passed by the assembly and is pending with the law department. The bill is similar to the gazette notification made by the Haryana government on Saturday. Under provisions of the bill, all private companies have to reserve 75% of the jobs of Rs 40,000 or less salaries for the local job seekers. The bill also provides for strict implementation and defaulters could face penalties and fines up to Rs 5 lakh for not adhering to it. On Saturday, the Haryana government notified that all private firms in the state must provide 75% quota for posts that carry salaries up to Rs 50,000 to the local job seekers. It will be implemented from January 15, 2022. Meanwhile, representatives of 54 different social outfits, comprising tribals and Moolvasis (non-tribal dwellers of the state) congregated here on Saturday and deliberated on the urgent need for defining local residents and the policy of the government to give them priority in employment opportunities. Convener of the session, educationist Dr Karma Oraon said the fight for a separate Jharkhand was aimed at giving due share to the locals that comprises Adivasis and Moolvaasis. “Somehow, the Moolvasis were left behind by all political parties, shattering their dreams and aspirations so far,” he said, cautioning the JMM led coalition government of a huge backlash if it failed to recognize the aspirations of people who played key roles in the formation of Jharkhand. Oraon added, “We still find outsiders adorning the seats in the power corridor and the locals are not getting employment for the want of a policy.” The deliberation was joined by people, cutting across political lines, who agreed on the need for defining locals. In his argument, the state’s first chief minister and BJP leader, Babulal Marandi, said his effort to introduce a locals’ policy during his stint as the CM was misunderstood by the people. “There was an urgent need for adopting an employment policy to give weightage to the locals and hence we had adopted the locals’ policy framed in erstwhile Bihar in 1982. That policy was based on the last land survey report,” he said, admitting that the policy defining locals and the one for employing people in state services are complementary to each other. Former Union minister and Congressman Subodh Kant Sahay claimed that the fight for a locals’ policy was more relevant to the Moolvasis than the tribals. “Both groups should understand that there is no fight between the Adivasi and the Moolvasis, rather the Moolvasis have a stronger claim to priority in the government’s employment policy,” he said. Apart from political representatives, a large number of civil society organisations and activists also addressed the gathering. Noted anti-displacement activist, Dayamani Barla, said they have been fighting to safeguard the ‘khatiyan’ (lands survey conducted and published by the British in 1932). “Locals cannot be defined without giving due credence to the khatiyan,” she said. However, the outfits failed to reach any consensus on the cut-off date for defining local residents despite agreeing on the need for a definitive policy. The gathering though agreed to suggestions that the 1952 voters’ list must be taken as the benchmark for defining locals and to adhere to the last land survey report. Representing the Muslim community, which also forms a huge chunk of the Moolvasis of the state, activist S Ali said the fight was not only for getting jobs. “The Moolvasis would feel being left out if they are not considered a Jharkhandi,” he said. Oraon said the objective of the gathering was to let the government know about the sentiments of the commoners. “Our 72-member core committee would sit for another meeting on November 16 and decide on a date for holding a march to the Raj Bhavan so that the government can be shaken up from its slumber on the matter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-likely-face-fresh-trouble-for-failing-to-define-state-locals-linked-to-75-quota-in-pvt-jobs/articleshow/87573002.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||TAC plans march to Raj Bhavan over Sarna code after Chhath||Ranchi: Members of the state Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) are planning a march to Raj Bhavan anytime after the Chhath festival to submit a memorandum to the President through the governor, demanding the inclusion of Sarna code in the upcoming nationwide census. The last TAC meeting held under the chairmanship of chief minister Hemant Soren had resolved to send a formal proposal for a separate Sarna code to President Ram Nath Kovind. A slew of several other decisions were taken at meeting amid the boycott by the opposition BJP. Over a month later, a few tribal lawmakers are upset with the delay demanding the ruling dispensation act fast. “The sooner a delegation gives a formal representation with the Sarna code demand, the better it is as this has been a long-pending demand of Adivasis. Since the Sarna code has been a major poll plank for the incumbent partners of the coalition, we shouldn’t delay any further after TAC too formally ratified it,” said an MLA, unwilling to be named. Earlier this week, Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey, who is also one of the co-working presidents of the ruling Congress party here, met chief minister Hemant Soren for an appointment with the governor. Talking to TOI on Sunday, Tirkey, who is a member of TAC, added, “CM gave me positive assurance and we are hoping that soon we will meet governor on this issue. Although no specific timeline has been communicated to me, the CM hinted that it could happen after Chhath.” Vice-chairman of TAC and JMM MLA from Seraikela, Champai Soren, too, assured that they were serious about this issue. “Whatever decisions we took in the TAC will certainly be fulfilled. About Sarna code, we will initiate the move after Chhath. Due to a series of festivals in last one month, we couldn’t seek time from Raj Bhavan,” he said over phone. Days before the last TAC meeting in September, the chief minister had also led an all-party delegation to home minister Amit Shah on this issue along with the demand for conducting the nationwide census based on caste lines. The Union home minister, however, has reportedly expressed the government’s inability to accept the demands. Thereafter, the Soren government convened the TAC meeting to chalk out further modalities on the issue. Last year, a resolution for inclusion of Sarna code was also passed by the state assembly for sending the proposal to the Centre. The demand for inclusion of Sarna code in the census, which tribals say is to retain their distinct identity, has been a long unfulfilled demand from Jharkhand. Champai said the state government wholeheartedly supports it and will do all that is necessary under its jurisdiction towards it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tac-plans-march-to-raj-bhavan-over-sarna-code-after-chhath/articleshow/87572996.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||State bill on 75% quota in pvt jobs in limbo, no definition provided for ‘local’ job seekers||Ranchi: Despite tabling a bill and managing to obtain the nod of the legislators, the Jharkhand government has fallen short of its Haryana counterpart in extending 75% reservation to locals in private jobs. The Haryana government on Saturday issued a gazette notification to declare enactment of the law with a provision that private companies must upload their employees' data on the state government portal by January 15, 2022. On the recommendations similar to the ones made by the Jananayak Janta Party (JJP), an ally of the ruling BJP in Haryana, the ruling tribal party here, JMM, had promised to provide 75% reservation to the state local in private jobs in its election manifesto. While the JJP-BJP alliance government in Haryana passed a job policy bill in November 2020 followed by the assent of the governor on February 26, 2021, along with the gazette notification on November 6, the JMM-led coalition government here tabled the bill in March 2021 but has not been able to notify it yet. The government here was forced to send it to the select committee of the House after 22 MLAs objected to one provision in the bill that allowed private companies a bypass from following the reservation norms in case of non-availability of suitable local candidates. The select committee submitted its report and the assembly finally passed it on September 7 during the last monsoon session. Officials in the labour department said a gazette notification to be issued by the law department is pending. “The bill is supposed to be sent to the governor for his assent by the law department and only after that, a notification can be issued,” said Anil Kumar Singh, the deputy secretary in the labour department. Opposition BJP is critical of the delay on the issue. The state’s party spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo, said the gazette notification delay was deliberate. “Even if the law is notified, how are the local candidates going to be appointed by private companies when the government has no policy in place to define locals,” he asked. Criticising the JMM-led government for “playing politics” in the name of helping out the locals, Shahdeo said a locals’ policy of the previous BJP government was cancelled by the current dispensation. “If they rejected our policy, they should have come up with their own. When they want to forge a vote bank in the name of locals, why shouldn’t they resolve the stalemate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-bill-on-75-quota-in-pvt-jobs-in-limbo-no-definition-provided-for-local-job-seekers/articleshow/87573015.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Ltd, (TSUISL) cleaned up Baroda Chhath ghat on the banks of Kharkhai river in Bagbera. The ghat will be decked up with lights, and arrangements for parking was done. Barricading of the danger area on banks will be done for the devotees from Monday to ensure prayers are offered in a safe and organised manner. Post Durga puja and Kali puja, Subernarekha and Kharkhai rivers at some places in the urban circle and pounds in the suburban and rural areas are littered with puja paraphernalia. "The urban civic bodies of Jamshedpur, Mango and Jugsalai, corporate companies such as Jusco (read TSUISL), Tata Motors, several social organisations' volunteers removed puja waste from the water bodies on Sunday," said Kendriya Durga Puja Samiti, secretary, Arun Singh. He said the samiti is coordinating with different organisations for the cleaning, sprucing up of the ghats. The managing committee president of Surya Mandir, Sidhgora, Sanjeev Singh said that the pond at the temple has been cleaned and Jusco will refill fresh water into it. Over 3,000 devotees besides hundreds of festive enthusiasts from the surroundings in Sidhgora and Baridih come to the Surya Mandir to offer prayers on Chhath. Several social outfits such as Disha Foundation, Pukare, Bhojpuria Manch, Bagbera Mahanagar Vikas Samiti have launched the cleaning drive across the ghats on the banks of Kharkhai and Subernarekha besides Domuhani in Sonari. "By Tuesday, ghats on the banks of Domuhani will be cleaned as the drive has been launched with force," said Gaurav Anand of Disha Foundation. JMM MLA from Jugsalai, Mangal Kalindi, who made inspection of the different ghats in his constituency said on Sunday that forest dam at Radhikanagar is being readied for the devotees. There are 80 plus chhath ghats in the two adjoining towns, of which 40 ghats that are situated on the banks of the three above mentioned rivers are largely patronised. As of now, 25 chhath ghats, including those situated on the river banks and ponds, are cleaned while the remaining are likely to get cleaned by Monday and all dedicated ghats would be decked up by Tuesday. Upset on seeing Kharkhai river banks littered with thermocol, polythene carry bags and puja waste, former MLA, Arvind Singh, said he would take up the matter with the administration. The former MLA, who is the patron of Praveen Singh Smriti Seva Sanstha, resumed the cleaning work at the aforesaid ghat on Sunday following the launch of the cleaning drive on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admin-races-against-time-to-clean-ghats-for-chhath/articleshow/87573032.cms||B Sridhar

---||Ranchi||Devotees prefer pools to ponds even as authorities prepare ghats for rituals||Ranchi/Bokaro: Even as the authorities are busy preparing the ghats for the devotees ahead of Chhath Puja, a section of the devotees will rather celebrate the festival within the comfort of their homes instead of going to the crowded ghats and exposing themselves to the virus. Even before the pandemic broke out, some devotees in recent years had stopped going to ghats as they are highly polluted and there not enough space. Some have constructed pools in their rooftops to offer arghya to the sun god. The four-day Chhath festivities will begin from Monday with “Nahay Khay” and conclude on November 11 with morning “arghya”. Nilam Kumari, a resident of Kokar area who has been celebrating Chhath for the last 10 years, finds it difficult to offer ‘arghya’ in the pond. “I used to go to a ghat for offering arghya but for the past two years, I have been doing it on my terrace where we have constructed a pool.” She added, “I started developing rashes on my skin after returning from the pond as the water was highly polluted. Now, with the fear of the virus looming large, I prefer not going to public ponds.” Besides the health scare, there is also the problem of space crunch at the ghats. The devotees often start grabbing space by writing their names on the steps of the ghats. “Some people occupy space two to three days prior to the festival and some locals also sell them to devotees at various ghats. I used to visit Kanke Dam regularly but due to space crunch, I decided to celebrate it at home,” CMPDI colony resident Arun Kumar said. “I have been celebrating the festival for more than 15 years and used to visit Hataniya for offering arghya. However, for the past three years I am celebrating the festival in a pool built at home as I feel uncomfortable because of the crowd at the ghats,” Kavita Sinha, a resident of Harmu housing colony, said. Similarly in Bokaro, many devotees prefer to offer the arghya at home by setting up temporary water bodies like last year. Even though he district administration and local civic bodies have prepared the ghats for the devotees to perform the rituals, they are afraid of contracting the disease. As of Sunday, Bokaro has only two active Covid-19 cases. However, Ashok Sahbadi, a resident of Chas, said, “We will perform Chhath Puja at home in a water tank. We are preparing it.” Another resident of Bokaro Township, Suresh Kumar, added, “Before the Covid-19 pandemic, we used to go to the ghat for Chhath Puja, but last year, we performed puja in a water tank at home. This year again, we decided to do the same.” Meanwhile, many residents were seen buying water tubs. Rahul Kumar, a vendor at the City Centre, said, “In comparison with last year when the government had banned performing puja at the ghats, the sale of water tubs is low this year. Still, several people are buying tubs this year, too.

---||Goa||Rasaim celebrates 100-year-old community Lakshmi puja||Margao: Hundred years ago, on the auspicious day of Kartik amavasya, the merchant community—Vaishya—got together at Rasaim in Loutolim, then a commercial hub, to celebrate Lakshmi puja amidst the atmosphere of religious persecution prevalent during the Portuguese regime. The five-day Diwali tradition steeped in bhakti continues till date. The Vaishya Lakshmi Poojan Samiti Trust organised the centenary celebration from November 4 to 9. While the main function will be held on Monday, the ‘visarjan’ of the idol will be held on Tuesday marking the culmination of the five-day event. Advocate general Devidas Pangam, Dr Suraj Kanekar and Jagannath Bhingi are the invitees for the event. Tracing the history of the traditional event, Shodhan Rajaram Govekar, a resident of Rassaim, told TOI that the event was born out of the emotional need of the trading community to worship the goddess of wealth to carry on with the Diwali tradition. “As Rassaim was a flourishing port town during that time, merchants who belonged to the Vaishya community from neighbouring villages of Ponda taluka began settling in the village,” Govekar said. “People from as far as from Belagavi also had then made the village their home. Rassaim was a part of the old conquests of the Portuguese regime and all the temples of the village had already been destroyed. From this arose the emotional need to worship Lakshmi.” The community, with the involvement of the locals, started Lakshmi puja in the house of Guno Sako Bhagat which then turned into an annual celebration. People from community, as well as from the Bahujan samaj would visit the Bhagat house to pay obeisance to the goddess of wealth. “Nearly 250 people from five families of Rassaim join in the celebration every year with much gusto and religious fervor,” said Raj Govekar from one of the five Vaishya families of the village. “The tradition that was started in 1921 continues without any major changes. This year being the centenary celebration, we have added some entertainment programmes and a felicitation function. We are proud of our ancestors for keeping the tradition alive even during the Portuguese rule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rasaim-celebrates-100-year-old-community-lakshmi-puja/articleshow/87573611.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The directorate of mines and geology is considering issuing reminder notices to the companies which have not paid as per recovery notices. The directorate has issued recovery notices to the tune of Rs 360 crore, but till date only Rs 100 crore has been recovered. A senior officer said that if a mining company does not pay the amount within 60 days from the issuance of the notice, then they have to pay 18% interest on the amount. The state government had issued notices to the mining companies in April. In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake a comprehensive audit of leaseholders and traders of mineral ore in Goa during the past five years, when exports touched peak figures. The accountants had submitted an audit report. Subsequently, the mines department analysed the report to ascertain the exact loss due to illegal mining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-cos-challenge-recovery-notices/articleshow/87573615.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||BJP meet: Punjab, UP polls bring Sikhs, farmers in focus||NEW DELHI: With assembly elections coming up in politically crucial Uttar Pradesh and Punjab in the backdrop of a robust farmers’ agitation, going on for the last one year in both the states, the BJP on Sunday devoted much of its national executive meeting to the farm sector and the Sikh community. The BJP is also preparing to go it alone in Punjab for the first time without its erstwhile ally Shiromani Akali Dal, which dropped out of the NDA over the contentious farm laws passed by the Centre last year. The executive meeting saw party chief J P Nadda comment on a political resolution, which was passed, that talked about how the Narendra Modi government has helped the agriculture sector and come out in support of the Sikh community, "like no other government before this". To woo the Sikhs, who are the majority voters in Punjab and constitute the majority of protesting farmer community, Nadda said the Modi government has removed FCRA restrictions in Gurudwaras getting foreign contributions, removed GST on langars served by the Gurudwaras, spent Rs 120 crore on development of the Kartarpur Corridor, and formed an SIT to find the guilty in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. On the issue of farmers’ welfare, Nadda said the Modi government has increased expenditure provisions in the budget on farmers from Rs 23,000 crore to Rs 1,23,000 crore, increased MSP on crops, and increased procurement under MSP from Rs 35,000 crore to Rs 85,000 crore. The party’s political resolution saw a whole section on the Centre’s policies for agricultural development and welfare of farmers. “In the last seven years, more work has been done than in these sectors than had been done in the last 70 years. Whether it was the improvement of the crop insurance scheme, MSP, farmer credit cards for small farmers, and controlling the prices of fertilizers by extending subsidies…,” listed the political resolution that was presented by the only BJP chief minister present at Sunday’s meet, Yogi Adityanath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-meet-punjab-up-polls-bring-sikhs-farmers-in-focus/articleshow/87574675.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Delhi||Gusty winds Delhi’s sole saviours, for now||NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR continued to suffer "air emergency" conditions with the air quality staying in the "severe" category for the third day in a row on Sunday even as weather conditions changed slightly in favour of dispersion of pollutants. However, moderate winds at 10kmph speed were not enough to provide the city breathable air, as the share of smoke in the city's PM2.5 levels from stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana spiked from 41% on Saturday to 48% on Sunday - the season's highest for the fourth successive day. Track the pollution level in your cityAs per the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi's AQI on Sunday remained "severe" at 428, a shade better than 437 a day earlier. Gusty Winds Delhi's Sole Saviours, For Now  Neighbouring NCR cities fared no better. Noida on Sunday recorded an overall AQI of 446 and Ghaziabad 455. Gurugram too was in the "severe" at 419. "Though, the farm fire count (in satellite images) dropped from 5,159 on Saturday to 4,189 on Sunday, a slight drop in local wind speed clubbed with consistent intrusion of excessive emissions increased the share of smoke from these blazes in the city's already polluted air. The winds were there but overburdened with consistent emissions, they were simply not enough to ventilate all of it," said Gufran Beig from SAFAR. While weather analysts and pollution monitoring agencies expect a little more improvement in air quality to the upper end of "very poor" or probably lower end of "severe". That's the kind of air quality Delhi can expect for the next few days as stubble burning continues in neighbouring states, experts said. Though northwesterly winds will continue carrying additional emissions from stubble burning into the city, the Met department however expects winds to gain pace and disperse pollutants to a greater extent. "The wind speed varied, though it was above 10kmph towards the afternoon on Sunday. We expect the wind speed to increase over next few days and improve the situation here. Sunday also saw improvement in the visibility and a drop in humidity levels by 10% to 20%. We expect better visibility and wind speed on Monday with further lowering of moisture that may further improve air quality and visibility," said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the CPCB, PM2.5, or particles in air with diameter of less than 2.5 microns, continues to be the dominant factor in air pollution. The PM2.5 on levels hovered between 306.9 and 322.1 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday against 323.3 and 413.7 micrograms per cubic metres a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metres. "The weather conditions would remain almost the same on Monday as on Sunday. So there won't be much change in the air quality as stubble burning is likely to continue. The maximum respite that the city can expect is AQI in the 'very poor' category," said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. "The wind is there and moisture is dropping, but had it not been for stubble burning smoke, the condition could have been slightly better," said Shambhavi Shukla, deputy program manager, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE). According to the SAFAR, the AQI is expected to improve but slowly and only over next two days. "In view of the favourable wind speed and direction and high fire counts since yesterday, the AQI recovery is extremely slow in spite of moderate wind speed. The stubble-fire related contribution simulated by the SAFAR model has risen to the highest level of 48% of this season with effective fire count at 4,189. AQI is forecasted to improve but stay in high end of very poor to severe category in next two days," said a statement from SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-air-severe-for-3rd-day-but-winds-bring-some-relief/articleshow/87574718.cms||---
---||India||Bengal in BJP focus, Nadda says ‘will chart a new story’||NEW DELHI: The BJP may have lost to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal assembly elections last May, but the party has refused to dilute its focus on the state that gave it 18 of the 42 MPs in an unprecedented show at the hustings in the 2019 parliamentary elections and established the party as the main opposition in the state. With an eye on 2024, the BJP on Sunday vowed to “improve its vote share after the successful performance that established BJP as the main opposition party for the first time in the state” even as the party’s vote share dropped drastically from 2019 and has been losing leaders and cadre migrating to TMC since its defeat last May. In fact, party leaders attending the national executive here on Sunday admitted that the continued focus on the state is “aimed at stalling the steady outflow” from the party to the ruling TMC. In his opening address at the executive meeting on Sunday, party chief J P Nadda highlighted the “attacks on its party workers by TMC in Bengal” since the elections got over and said that “the party will stand with every worker in the state”. On BJP's growth in Bengal, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan quoted Nadda as saying, “if one looks at its growth in the state from the political science perspective, then there will be very few parallels of it in Indian political history,” referring to the unprecedented rise of the saffron party in a state where it barely existed. Nadda said that if one looks at the BJP's vote share in the 2014 assembly elections and the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal, and compares them with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and 2021 assembly polls, it shows substantial growth for BJP in the state, according to Pradhan who briefed the media after the party chief’s address. In his address, Nadda accused the TMC of unleashing violence against BJP workers and warned the ruling TMC in Bengal that “BJP will not sit quietly and will fight a decisive and democratic battle in the state to ensure that lotus (party’s symbol) blooms in the state.” Nadda mentioned that “142 assembly seats witnessed violence, 53 people were killed, there were 7,000 plus cases registered, 123 cases of sexual assault took place and almost 90,000 people had to flee their homes because of which the party is running 93 home shelters for its workers in the states,” to substantiate on his accusation of post-poll violence on party’s people by the ruling TMC. Devoting a whole section to the political violence in Bengal in the party’s political resolution passed at the party’s executive on Sunday, BJP executive members paid their tribute to those party workers who lost their lives to violence in Bengal and vowed to ensure punishment for the culprits. Nadda inducted the highest number of national executive committee members from Bengal for the first time, during the last organisational reshuffle a couple of months back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-in-bjp-focus-nadda-says-will-chart-a-new-story/articleshow/87574737.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

The city registered 21.53cm of rainfall, on Saturday night; on Nov 16, 2015, the city received 24.6cm rainfall. The downpour inundated several areas and halted train services, while motorists and pedestrians faced a tough time as several interior roads were waterlogged. Chief minister M K Stalin announced a holiday for government offices in Chennai on Monday and asked private organisations to permit staff to work from home. He also urged PM Narendra Modi to grant funds for flood relief. The PM assured Stalin that enough funds will be allocated. Chennai is likely to experience heavy to very heavy rain over the next two days due to an upper air circulation and a low pressure area, the regional meteorological department said in its forecast. Velachery, T Nagar, Korattur, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and Kodungaiyur were the worst affected due to inundation. Six subways were shut due to waterlogging. Following the incessant rain, cabs and autorickshaw fares shot up as only 10% of government buses were operated. Meanwhile, the corporation said better preparedness, including state-of-the-art machinery to pump out water, helped reduce loss of life and property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/21cm-of-rain-in-a-night-floods-several-localities-of-chennai/articleshow/87574844.cms||---

He made this statement after trade union leader and well-known mining activist Puti Gaonkar joined AAP on Sunday. President of Goa Mining People’s Front, Gaonkar, is set to contest against Sawant in Sakhali. “Let it be a direct fight between the CM of Goa and Gaonkar. Let all other parties withdraw their candidates and support Gaonkar in that seat so that there is a one-to-one contest,” Kejriwal told reporters. He assured to “start mining in Goa within six months” of forming the government, under Gaonkar’s guidance. “We are going to meet mining dependent families and the families who have been fighting for their land rights for many decades,” Kejriwal said. Gaonkar told reporters that mining was stopped in Goa in 2012 by former CM Manohar Parrikar. “If BJP government has not started mining in the last 10 years, do you think that they will start now? They have vested interests,” he said, questioning the delay when there is a BJP government both at the centre and state. AAP’s legal team has already started studying how to restart mining, Gaonkar said, adding that he has provided them with the documents. Kejriwal on Sunday also visited the head office of the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj. President of the samaj, Ashok Naik said it was the first time a Delhi CM has met the people of the Gomantak Bhandari community. The samaj was established in Panaji in 1962. “We have to face some difficulties in availing some government schemes. Sometimes it gets more difficult because of restrictions. We have discussed with Kejriwal and he promised us that AAP will work for the betterment of the Bhandari community and OBCs,” Naik said. Kejriwal said the party will think over the issues and work towards them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/support-aap-against-cm-in-sakhali-kejriwal-to-oppn/articleshow/87573521.cms||---

A senior officer said that police have placed criminals under surveillance and history-sheeters have been arrested. The officer said that they are working with the collector to start externment of habitual criminals from either the state or district. “We will send a fresh proposal of externment,” the officer said, adding that police stations have identified the names of the criminals for this. Stating that most of these persons have been involved in cases of hurt, the officer said that police will approach the collectors, who will hear the accused on the issue, and, if satisfied with the police proposal, will issue the externment order, the officer said. Once the order is issued, the criminal has to leave the state for a certain period of time. In Goa, externment orders are issued under the Goa Maintenance of Public Order and Safety Act, 1988. District police have also identified 60 “budding criminals”. “We have identified budding criminals in the age group 18-21, and a case has been registered against them,” the officer said. To keep a check on habitual offenders and to ensure citizens’ safety, police have also started conducting round-the-clock patrolling in coastal as well as urban areas. Additional staff have been deployed for beat policing. The officer said that with tourism season commencing in the state, patrolling along the coastal belt has also been increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-to-start-externment-process-ahead-of-election/articleshow/87573549.cms||Murari Shetye

She accused the BJP government of turning Goa into a criminal hub and blamed the chief minister who is also the home minister for it. “CM Sawant has failed to create fear in the minds of criminals,” Naik said. The recent sexual assault case registered at the Porvorim police station has sent shock waves all around Goa, she said, appealing to Goa governor to dismiss the government over the complete collapse of law and order. Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba hit out at Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday for using Goa as an experimental lab for politics. She said Delhi had turned into a gas chamber with Kejriwal unable to control air pollution and crimes against women and accused him of playing politics of religion by offering free pilgrimages. Lamba accused BJP of fielding AAP as its B team in Goa, saying that wherever BJP faces difficulty, it has been sending its B team AAP to split secular votes for BJP to win. She said that while Kejriwal is promising jobs and dole to the unemployed youth in Goa, unemployment rate in Delhi is higher than the national average of 45.6%. While getting out of the airport all she could see on hoardings were pictures of the chief ministers of Delhi and Bengal, Lamba said, adding that there was no local face being projected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-turning-goa-into-crime-hub/articleshow/87573558.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||SC restores senior tag of Gujarat advocate for 2 years, with rider||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has temporarily restored senior gown to fiery bar leader Yatin Narendra Oza, whose senior designation was withdrawn by the Gujarat HC for adopting 'slap, say sorry and repeat the contemptuous act', and warned that if he breached the 'good behaviour promise', the HC would be free to permanently strip him of the senior designation. A battery of senior advocates led by A M Singhvi had pleaded with a bench of Justices Sanjay Kisan Kaul and R S Reddy to have mercy for Oza and contended that withdrawal of senior advocate designation is like a death warrant for the advocate's profession, apart from the ignominy he suffers at the bar and social life. The Gujarat HC had refused to accept Oza's apology after his scurrilous allegations against judges and the HC which were levelled at a press conference that was telecast live. The HC had termed Oza's apology ingenuine and its full court meeting unanimously resolved, even after SC's request for reconsideration, not to overlook the contemnor's acts which caused huge damage to the judiciary's image and people's faith in it. The HC had told the SC that the conferment of senior designation weighs not only on an advocate's legal acumen but a much higher standard of behaviour. "If such presupposition disappears, the authority is empowered to withdraw the privilege," the HC had said and told the SC that since conferment of 'senior' designation is a privilege, the petitioner cannot get relief under writ jurisdiction of the apex court. Singhvi pleaded that Oza had bona fidely raised issues within the institution regarding non-circulation of matters, based on a large number of complaints received from the members of the Bar by him by reason of his holding the position of the president of Gujarat HC Advocates Association. He said Oza's grievance was not one against the Judges, but against the manner of working of the HC Registry. Oza had decided to resign for not being able to solve the problem but withdrew the same on the urging of the Association. He said the Press Conference was the culmination of his inability to resolve the disputes, as a last resort. "Oza got emotionally overwhelmed during the Press Conference and made utterances of which he has been very apologetic from the very beginning. The emotional utterances were not preplanned, and therefore, parts of what he said are sought to be relied upon to substantiate that he was not making allegations against the Bench as a whole," he said. Oza told the court that he at times loses his balance while performing the role as the president of the Association and that "he is willing to give an undertaking that he will never contest elections to the Bar Association." The bench said that was a decision of his own to take and that the SC certainly would not like to inhibit his right to contest the elections. Striking a balance, Justices Kaul and Reddy said, "We are of the view that the ends of justice would be served by seeking to temporarily restore the designation of the petitioner for a period of two years from January 1, 2022. It is the HC which will watch and can best decide how the petitioner behaves and conducts himself as a senior counsel without any further opportunity." "It will be for the HC to take a final call on whether his behaviour is acceptable in which case the HC can decide to continue with his designation temporarily or restore it permanently. Needless to say that if there is any infraction in the conduct of the petitioner within this period of two years, the HC would be well within its rights to withdraw the indulgence which we have given for two years which in turn is predicated on the assurances given by Oza and his counsel for the immaculate behaviour without giving any cause to the HC to find fault with his conduct. In effect, the fate of the petitioner is dependent on his appropriate conduct as a senior counsel before his own HC, which will have the final say," the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-restores-senior-tag-of-gujarat-advocate-for-2-years-with-rider/articleshow/87574874.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Kolkata||Assembly bypolls over, Bengal cabinet shuffle likely this week||Kolkata: The Bengal cabinet is likely to be rejigged this week. State finance minister Amit Mitra, who was administered oath of office on May 10, will complete six months on Wednesday. Mitra didn’t contest the summer assembly polls for health reasons. Article 164(4) of the Constitution says a minister who is not a member of the state assembly can continue for six months. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, according to sources, is likely to retain Mitra — who has been her government’s finance minister since 2011 — as a special adviser to the state government with rank equivalent to a state cabinet minister’s. Sources hinted that the CM may keep the finance portfolio to herself or appoint a minister of state (MoS). Sources further said Chandrima Bhattacharya, who recently represented the state at GST council meetings, may be in the running for MoS (finance). Chandrima already has independent charge of the urban development and municipal affairs department. She is also MoS for health, land and land reforms along with refugee, relief and rehabilitation. CM Banerjee heads these two departments, in which Chandrima is MoS. The CM also has to fill Subrata Mukherjee’s place in the state cabinet. Mukherjee, like Mitra, was part of the cabinet since 2011, holding the panchayat portfolio. Later, Mukherjee was also tasked with the consumer affairs portfolio due to Sadhan Pandey’s continued ill-health. In addition, Mukherjee was a minister in the public enterprise and industrial reconstruction department and self-help group and self-employment department. Among the names doing the rounds, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay is likely to get a promotion after his victory in the Khardah bypoll. Sobhandeb, the agriculture minister, had resigned as Bhowanipore MLA to re-contest from Khardah. He won by a 93,000 margin. Also in the running is Dinhata MLA Udayan Guha, whose record-breaking 1.6 lakh margin win came in Union minister of state for home Nisith Pramanik’s backyard. With the first phase of municipal polls likely on December 19, the cabinet rejig may also have a bearing on Trinamool’s mayoral candidates for Kolkata, Howrah and Bidhannagar municipal corporations. Transport minister Firhad Hakim, for instance, is also chairperson of the KMC board of administrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/assembly-bypolls-over-bengal-cabinet-shuffle-likely-this-week/articleshow/87573533.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: BJP worker stabbed to death in east Midnapore||BHAGABANPUR (EAST MIDNAPORE): A 38-year-old BJP worker was found lying on the road with multiple stab wounds in Bhagabanpur Block-1’s Mohammadpur late on Saturday. Locals said Chandan Maity, also known as Sambhu, was taken to Bhagabanpur hospital, where he was treated. But he died while while being shifted to Tamluk hospital. BJP said Maity was a ‘shaktipramukh’ and threatened an agitation if the killers were not arrested. According to sources, Maity was at home on Saturday when unidentified persons barged in around 8pm and abducted him. His wife, who had gone out to celebrate ‘bhai phonta’, alerted neighbours when her calls to him went unanswered. The neighbours launched a search and Bhagabanpur police were also informed. Maity was found lying in a pool of blood hours later, several kilometres from home. Police said the body bore multiple stab wounds and he had died of excessive blood loss. Based on the hospital report, police have lodged a murder case. BJP immediately blamed Trinamool Congress for the killing. The party’s organisational district president, Nabarun Naik, said: “Chandan was an able organiser. He was being targeted ever since TMC lost the Bhagabanpur assembly seat to BJP by a huge margin. He was threatened and attacked repeatedly after the elections. The culprits need to be arrested immediately. If the police don’t, we will launch a larger agitation.” “Goons allegedly sheltered by Trinamool lynched him,” Bhagabanpur BJP MLA Rabindranath Maity claimed. Trinamool dismissed the allegations. The party’s Contai organisational district chairperson, Abhijit Das, said: “TMC has nothing to do with it. They (BJP) perhaps do not know the victim well. He had cordial relations with TMC local workers. He has been working with us closely in the gram panchayat. BJP here is beset by strong infighting and area domination struggle. We hope the police will unearth the truth.” Watch West Bengal: 38-year-old BJP worker stabbed to death in east Midnapore||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-worker-stabbed-to-death-in-e-midnapore/articleshow/87573755.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: BJP leaders trying to divert attention from losses, says TMC||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Sunday said BJP leaders in Delhi were trying to save their faces by terming their defeat as a victory in Bengal. The allegations of post-poll violence, TMC said, were to divert attention of workers from the crushing poll defeat.Saying that it will chart a new story in Bengal, BJP national president J P Nadda alleged that 53 party workers were killed in post-poll violence. TMC MP Saugata Roy termed them “baseless”. “We do not accept the allegations of post-poll violence. Mamata Banerjee was sworn in as CM on May 5, three days after the results. There was no post-poll violence. It is a narrative which BJP has been trying to give to people. But nobody is willing to trust them any more.” Roy said “just raising an allegation does not justify their stance”. “BJP had been instigating violence in the state and whatever has happened was a result of that. If there is any such violence, we will take steps against that.” Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said the BJP’s central leadership was trying to put up excuses to distract party workers. “The BJP is torn between allegations and counter-allegations. State leaders have pointed fingers at leaders in Delhi. Leaders have started to quit. Had they been a pro-people party, national executive member Rajiv Banerjee would have been attending the meeting today,” he said. Referring to former Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy’s allegations, Ghosh said the BJP central leadership had been coming to Bengal daily to strategise the course of action before the polls but unwilling to take the blame for the defeat. The BJP also alleged partisan attitude by the Bengal government in vaccinating people. Rebutting Nadda’s charges, Roy said: “It is true that TMC has control over municipalities and panchayats. But the allegation of partisanship during vaccination is baseless. We are ahead of any other state in terms of vaccination.” Roy has also written a letter to PM Narendra Modi requesting him to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana for the next six months. Roy’s letter comes a day after Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Modi requesting him to extend the government’s quota of free ration supply until May 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-leaders-trying-to-divert-attention-from-losses/articleshow/87573557.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||World||Lord Jagannath consecrated in London||LONDON: The vigrahas (embodiment) of sibling deities Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra, as well as the Sudarshan Chakra, the divine weapon of Lord Vishnu, have been consecrated as per the Shree Jagannatha Mandir, Puri, rituals, in London, for the first time, as plans are underway to build the first standalone temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath in Britain, which will also be the first in Europe. The three idols have taken up temporary residence at the Shree Ram Mandir in Southall, the oldest Hindu temple in Britain, while the Shree Jagannath Society UK (SJS UK), a charity, scouts for land in greater London to build a grand temple in London along the lines of the original Jagannath Temple at Puri in the Indian state of Odisha. The first phase of acquiring 10-30 acres of land, constructing the sanctum and installing the idols is planned to be completed by 2024 at a cost of £4 million (Rs 40 crore). The trust is in the process of raising the money and is looking for a large piece of land on the outskirts of London. Their vision is to build a grand temple on the lines of the Shri Jagannatha Mandir in Puri, Odisha, that will be a gateway of Lord Jagannath culture in UK and Europe. “This is the first time we have installed them in a large temple in Britain following rituals laid down by the Puri temple,” said SJS UK trustee Dr Chetan Shatapathy. The prana pratistha (hallowed consecration) rituals of the holy deities were performed over three days between November 1 and 3 at the Shree Ram Mandir in the presence of scores of devotees. The proceedings were shared live with thousands more across the world via Zoom. The idols were carved from the trunk of a holy neem tree in Odisha that bore all the sacred markings associated with Lord Jagannath as laid down in the scriptures. The trust has also recently facilitated the consecration of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra deities in Manchester and Bath. “When we construct our own temple, we will consecrate new idols for that temple and these idols will stay in Southall. Jagannath is considered to be the deity of Kali Yuga — the current age of strife, according to Hindu scriptures. He is worshiped in Puri, and is popular in Gujarat, Bengal and other parts of India. We want to popularise worship of Jagannath in Britain,” Shatapathy said. The plan to build a majestic standalone Shree Jagannatha Mandir in London has received the blessings of the Maharaja of Puri, the spiritual guide and first sevak (servitor) of the Shri Jagannatha Mandir in Puri, who is an advisor to the SJS Trust UK, and the support of several leaders of business and industrialists in the UK. In a video message, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik congratulated the SJS UK for establishing an abode for Lord Jagannath in London and complimented the trust for the medical supplies it provided for Covid-19 patients in rural Odisha during the second wave of the pandemic. Patnaik also thanked SJS UK for its efforts to support rural schools plant one lakh neem saplings across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/jagannath-idol-installed-in-london-for-1st-time/articleshow/87574995.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||World||Boris Johnson and Priti Patel visit Neasden Temple in London for Diwali||LONDON: UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Indian-origin British home secretary Priti Patel celebrated Diwali and the Hindu New Year with devotees at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London – popularly known as ‘Neasden Temple’ – on Sunday. During the visit Johnson was presented with a long-sleeved T shirt for his one-year-old son Wilfred by a seven-year-old girl Amisha Patel, on behalf of BAPS, as well as a ‘onesie’ with an image of the temple on for his second child which his wife Carrie is currently carrying. Johnson was greeted at the north London temple in traditional Hindu manner with auspicious marks of welcome and goodwill before being taken on a brief tour of the stone temple complex. The home secretary, dressed in a stunning salmon pink lehenga, was similarly welcomed upon her arrival and joined the prime minister to offer a fruit basket at the central shrine of the temple’s inner sanctum, where they spent several minutes absorbing the peace and intricate architecture. Here,they also observed the annakut – literally, ‘mountain of food’ – artistically arranged before the deities as the first meal of the New Year, offered in thanksgiving for God’s gracious providence and to be later shared among worshippers. They then performed the abhishek (an ancient Hindu practice of prayerfully pouring water over a sacred image) of Shri Nilkanth Varni, the youthful form of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, a popular Hindu deity. They then viewed the exhibits summarising Neasden Temple’s Covid-19 relief efforts – an initiative inspired by His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. The global Hindu leader had issued a call in March 2020 for all BAPS volunteers to serve the elderly, needy and vulnerable in local communities during the pandemic. They later met some of the Indian-origin BAPS devotees who had been key workers as well as those who had been volunteers, preparing and delivering food to the vulnerable, and the team keeping communities connected and informed through online services. Inspiring to see community spirit in action @NeasdenTemple today. @PritiPatel and I saw the incredible contribut… https://t.co/FMPCCTrjb0— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) 1636314333000Johnson said: “What His Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj has contributed to the United Kingdom has been incalculable. I see it here today at the Neasden Temple. I have been here many times, but I don’t think I have ever been here at a time when the Neasden Temple has been so central to the life of the whole of the London community. Happy Diwali and Happy New Year to everyone in the Hindu community here in the UK.” Patel was born in London to a Ugandan-Indian family. Her grandparents were born in Gujarat, India and then in the 1950s moved to Uganda. The family was expelled in the 1970s by Idi Amin, the former president of Uganda, and moved to Britain where Patel was born. Patel's parents, Sushil and Anjana, and her grandparents, Ranchodbhai Umedbhai Patel and Chanchelben Ranchodbhai Patel, were devotees at the BAPS Temple in Kampala, Uganda. Patel's grandfather, Ranchodbhai Umedbhai Patel, popularly known as R U Patel, was chairman of BAPS Uganda.

All government departments apart from essential services such as Aavin, Tangedco, local bodies, revenue, and public transport will be on leave for a day on Monday. The CM has requested all private offices to offer work from home for a few days starting Monday. After inspecting rain-affected areas such as Purasawalkam, Padi and Kolathur in Chennai, Stalin said men and machinery were kept ready for all emergency situations. He appealed to people to put their travel plans on hold for three days as more rainfall was forecast in the coming days. “The government is taking all measures to provide compensation to those affected by rain. About 50,000 food packets have been distributed since morning in about 44 rehabilitation centres in the city. In 500 locations, pumps have been kept ready.

By the time the rainwater subsided, household items were completely damaged in some households. “People who live on the lower floors began to shift important household items to upper floors. But heavier ones like furniture, refrigerator and washing machines could not be lifted. They are all damaged,” said Sathya, a resident of a police quarter in Kondithope.

---||Chennai||Fares of cabs, autos hit the roof in Chennai||CHENNAI: Fares of cabs and autorickshaws shot through the roof after heavy rain crippled the transport network of the city on Sunday. While suburban trains were not operated throughout the day, only 10% of government buses remained on the roads in the city. Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), Chennai, usually operates 3,100 buses daily, but on Sunday, only 400 buses were operational. Even those on the roads were unable to complete their trips due to traffic diversions and closure of subways. As a result, demand for auto and cabs shot up. The fare for longer trips was at least 200% higher than the usual rates. For instance, cabs demanded Rs.500 for travelling to Tambaram from Madipakkam. Usually, it costs less than Rs.300 even during peak hours, said R Raghu, a Madipakkam resident. Since the Southern Railway shifted the departure of certain long-distance trains from Central station to Thiruvallur, Avadi, Beach, Thiruvottiyur and Perambur, many passengers had no other option but to pay a bomb to autorickshaws and cabs. Departures of trains were delayed by at least three to four hours at Central. “Several commuters suffered because there was no reliable helpline to give info on status of suburban trains,” said T Sadagopan, a resident-activist from Avadi. The State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) and six other statetransport corporations managed to operate more than 16,000 buses to Chennai from other parts of the state. Chief Minister MK Stalin requested people not to rush back to Chennai due to a prediction of more rain for the next two days. At the airport, all flights were operated as scheduled, but many passengers missed flights as they were unable to reach the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fares-of-cabs-autos-hit-the-roof-in-chennai/articleshow/87575117.cms||Ram Sundaram

Yogi said, under PM Modi, nation's global reputation has improved and the Indian passport has earned its respect. "PM's vision of "one sun, one world, one grid" received overwhelming support at the climate change conference in Glasgow. AT G-20 meet, PM gave an important message of one world, one health giving a sense of direction to the world," he said. On the domestic front, he remarked PM Modi's timely decisions helped the country to successfully battle Covid-19 that brought the world to its knees, while continuing developmental activities and caring for the underprivileged. ‘UP 2nd largest economy in short time’PM Modi’s mantra of trace, test, treat and vaccinate helped Uttar Pradesh control Covid-19, the CM added. “Developing two vaccines in a short time and administering more than 100 crore doses is a historic achievement. In Uttar Pradesh, 13.28 crore doses have been given and 8.43 crore tests conducted. Fortyone districts of the state don’t have a single case of Covid infection and the state is capable of conducting 4lakh Covid tests daily even as UP braces up to tackle the third wave of the pandemic,” Yogi said. He said, medicine kits have been distributed to children of different age groups through vigilance committees, while booths have been set up to vaccinate parents of children below 12 years of age. Yogi also praised the prime minister for slashing excise duty on petrol and diesel on Diwali to bring relief to common people, adding UP has slashed prices of both by Rs 12 each. CM Yogi said, Uttar Pradesh is religiously following the motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas of the PM. “UP tops in implementation of 44 Central welfare schemes. Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 43lakh houses have been built in rural and urban areas, while 2.61crore toilets have been built under Swachh Bharat Mission. Similarly, 1.56crore free gas connections have been given under Ujjwala scheme, whereas 1.38crore people got free electricity connection under the Saubhagya Yojana. Besides, six crore people received insurance cover of up to Rs 5lakh under Ayushman Bharat scheme. More than seven lakh street vendors have got bank loans under PM SVANidhi scheme.” “Uttar Pradesh ranks second in ease of doing business in the country. The state has also emerged as the second largest economy of the country in a short time”, CM Yogi remarked. Also, due to rising investments, 1.61crore youths got jobs in private sector, more than lakh have bagged self-employment opportunities and 4.5lakh got government jobs in last four and a half years, the CM said. Yogi said, UP decided to extend Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana in the state till Holi in view of the pandemic, which will continue to benefit 15 crore people of the state. “Now Antyodaya card holders will not only get rice and wheat, but also 1litre of cooking oil and 1kg of salt and sugar,” he said. Asserting that law and order has been “restored in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath said, properties worth Rs1,800crore usurped by gangsters have been impounded or demolished in last four-andhalf year of BJP rule. Yogi said the Government was providing grants to farmers and making record foodgrain purchase from under MSP. Also, during the lockdown, 40 lakh migrant workers were brought home and provided ration and given Rs 1,000 each, he added.

Track the pollution level in your cityThe state agriculture department has, in fact, proposed funding carriage of stubble to shelter homes meant for stray cattle. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi in a communique sent to district authorities has said, funds would be availed from the state finance commission. As per an estimate, UP is the highest producer of agricultural residues (40 MT) followed by Maharashtra (31 MT) and Punjab (28 MT). UP government's move comes close on heels of the Punjab government's proposal last month to plough paddy crop residue into animal fodder, especially cattle. The agriculturally rich north Indian state reportedly produces around 20 million tonnes of paddy straw. According to a report prepared by ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare in 2019, stubble burning is rampant in Punjab, Haryana and UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-burn-stubble-use-as-cattle-fodder-to-curb-pollution-up-govt/articleshow/87575161.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Assessment survey in Maharashtra on November 12 divides educators||PUNE: National Achievement Survey (NAS) conducted in Std III, V, VIII and X to assess learning achievement of children in their respective classes will be held on November 12 across the country. However, many teachers feel that this year, it will be hard to assess the true result of the children as lower primary schools in the state have yet to open and even the ones that are open, may not have 100% attendance as the schools will reopen after Diwali break on November 11. Another group of teachers feels that such an examination is important as it will help in understanding the learning outcome of students which in turn will help plan the further action for the children, but they also feel that the state government must have planned better. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed the Assessment Framework for gauging the competencies attained by the students vis-a-vis learning outcomes. The Survey goes beyond the scorecard and includes the background variables to correlate student’s performance in different learning outcomes vis-a-vis contextual variables, the official NAS website says. “The schools will be closed till November 10 for Diwali break and will reopen the next day. Many students and their families visit their home towns during Diwali. Many do not turn up on day 1, especially when the next two days after November 12 and Saturday and Sunday, are holidays. Secondly, lower primary schools are still closed across the state. Conducting an online examination will not yield much of a result in rural areas, especially for such young children,” a Zilla Parishad teacher from Jalgaon said. However, another group of teachers say that this kind of assessment is always good. “They help the state identify where we are lacking, where we stand compared to the others and what needs to be done to improve. Especially after the pandemic, such a test is very important. One thing the state could have done was to better plan it. Earlier, they announced that the Diwali vacation would be from November 1 to November 20. This was circulated among all students. Then on October 27, they announced that the vacation will be from October 28 to November 10 because they realised that they have to conduct NAS on the November 12. This will create some confusion among students,” said Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of Maharashtra Headmasters’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assessment-survey-in-state-on-nov-12-divides-educators/articleshow/87572758.cms||Ardhra Nair

Excessive rainfall during this monsoon had wreaked damages on several master roads, officials said. While GMDA initiated repair works from early October, heavy showers during the monsoon withdrawal period led to further damage on some segments. On Sunday, Jaspal Singh, the chief engineer of the Infrastructure I division of GMDA, told TOI that the authority has stepped up efforts to repair all rain-damaged roads. “We have already started repair work post-monsoon and have now set a deadline of November 15. We seek to complete patchwork and fill up potholes during this period,” Singh said. Potholes, another senior official said, along most of the stretches have been repaired. “But some stretches that were affected again due to heavy rain during the monsoon withdrawal period will have to be repaired once more,” the official said. The Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and the link roads between Hero Honda Chowk and Umang Bhardwaj Chowk, and Hero Honda Chowk and Subhash Chowk, are among the stretches where repair work will be undertaken for the second time, the official added. In October, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during a video conference with divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners had directed all road construction agencies to prepare a schedule and ensure all roads damaged during to the rains were repaired by November 30. Of the approximately 1,200-kilometre road network in the district, around 250 km, including SPR, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, and Netaji Subhash Marg, comes under the GMDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-sets-nov-15-deadline-to-complete-post-monsoon-road-repair/articleshow/87442717.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The organisation, which has been demanding a ban on the offering of namaz at public places in the city, said its members will also distribute prasad on a large scale at the site. The decision was taken by SHSS during a meeting at Siddheswar temple on Saturday, a day after police detained 25 people for trying to disrupt Friday prayers in Sector 12. The organisation’s members said they were “disappointed” with the police action. “The namaz being held in public should stop immediately,” Mahavir Bhardawaj, who claims to be the state president of SHSS, said. The organisations said it is expecting a gathering of 5,000 people on November 5. “When namaz is allowed at a public place, why not a puja. Today, we have issued an alert and in the coming days, we will decide the course of the event,” Rajeev Mittal, a member of SHSS, said, adding that the organisation was resolute in its plan. Friday prayers have raked up controversy in the city in the backdrop of a section of residents and right-wing organisations opposing namaz being offered in public places. On Sunday, the station house officer of Sector 14, Satyendra, told TOI that police will strictly adhere to the instructions issued by the administration for the November 5 event. Last Friday, police had said they would not allow any disruption and prevented protesters from reaching namaz sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/local-outfits-say-will-perform-puja-at-namaz-site-on-nov-5/articleshow/87442851.cms||---

In the last budget session of the state assembly, Governor Anandiben Patel had said that in the financial year 2020-21, the Yogi Adityanath government transferred more than Rs 56,000 crore directly to the accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT. In this process, middlemen were eliminated and payments became transparent," a government spokesman said. 'UP set new dimensions by record buying on GeM portal'  While the DBT system was curbing corruption in the state, it was also proving to be a boon for farmers, labourers, daily wagers, students and pensioners, added the government spokesperson. "The scheme helped the government in taking quick and effective decisions during the unexpected Covid-19 lockdown in 2020," he further said. The state government also claimed to have set new dimensions of transparency in the procurement of government departments by making record purchases on the GeM portal.  For the third time in the financial year 2020-21, Uttar Pradesh was ranked number one for highest government procurement of Rs 5,471 crore through GeM portal. In the last four-and-a-half years, Uttar Pradesh government has made a total purchase of over Rs 14,878 crore through GeM portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-2-8-lakh-crore-disbursed-via-dbt-since-2017-in-up/articleshow/87575213.cms||---

---||Business||India, South Africa ask EU to break deadlock on Covid drugs, vaccine||NEW DELHI: After weeks of impasse, India and South Africa have asked the European Union to come up with a solution to break the deadlock on a TRIPS waiver for Covid drugs and vaccines, instead of merely blocking the proposal, aimed at ensuring people in the poor and developing countries are adequately protected from the pandemic. Indian officials told TOI that EU has come to the negotiating table in recent weeks to engage on a possible way out with sources in Geneva indicating that the trading bloc may come around to agreeing to limiting the flexibility to patent waiver only for vaccines. The India-South Africa proposal, which has now been backed by over 100 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), seeks to provide patent, copyright and other IPR waivers for medical devices, therapeutics as well as vaccines. At the moment, EU has suggested that vaccine manufacturers that are able and ready to produce shots may be allowed to start producing, without worrying about a patent. The WTO secretariat is keen that a solution is found ahead of this month’s ministerial meeting in Geneva, although details are unlikely to be finalised in the next three weeks. WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is keen to deliver a trade and health package at the ministerial meeting and is hoping that it would help get the support of countries such as India to back the fisheries agreement in return. The EU along with the UK, Switzerland and Japan are the only naysayers to the plan to even discuss the draft floated by India and South Africa. Even within the EU, it is only a handful of countries such as Germany, which are opposing the plan. While South Africa has got a “vaccine hub”, it is not seen to have benefited from it, leave alone the mRNA facility meeting the requirements of other African countries. On its part, India is keen that a solution to the vaccine issue is found at the earliest, although officials claimed that ratcheting up the demand has meant that developed countries at least stop blocking supply of key inputs and seek to address the massive vaccine inequality. Besides, it has got the EU to suggest the use of the compulsory licence route, which allows for patent waiver in case of national emergencies, something that the developed countries had always opposed. Government sources said various options are being looked at by several developing countries and some of them may resort to using the compulsory licensing option.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-s-africa-ask-eu-to-break-deadlock-on-covid-drugs-vax/articleshow/87575225.cms||Sidhartha

---||Business||CCI urged to revoke nod to Future’s deal with Amazon||NEW DELHI: Independent directors at Future Retail (FRL) have written to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) urging the antitrust watchdog to revoke the approval it had given to the deal between Amazon and unlisted Future Group entity, Future Coupons (FCPL) in November 2019. In the letter dated November 7, the independent directors alleged that Amazon, which is embroiled in a bitter legal battle with FRL over sale of the latter’s assets to Reliance Retail, has concealed information from CCI when it sought approval for the deal. TOI has reviewed a copy of the letter. Amazon had invested around Rs 1,400 crore in FCPL for a 49% stake. FCPL held around 10% stake in FRL, which gave Amazon an indirect stake in the flagship Future Group company. “Amazon sought and obtained the approval of the Commission on the basis that it was investing in the business of FCPL and not on the basis that it was acquiring strategic, material and special rights over FRL in preference to all the shareholders of FRL, which it has claimed with success in the arbitral tribunal now,” the independent directors said in the letter. FRL’s letter comes against the backdrop of Amazon scoring a series of victories in its legal tussle with the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, parent of supermarket chain, Big Bazaar. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) recently rejected Future Retail’s plea to lift the interim stay on its Rs 24,700-crore asset sale to Reliance Retail, the retail arm of the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate Reliance Industries. This followed the Singapore tribunal’s ruling to make Future Retail (FRL) party to the dispute arising out of the agreement between Future Coupons (FCPL), an unlisted Future Group entity and Amazon. FRL had argued before SIAC that it was not a party to the agreement signed between FCPL and Amazon. “The Commission should immediately confirm the revocation of the approval granted to Amazon for its investment in FCPL. Time is of the essence and the Commission should act immediately,” the independent FRL directors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cci-urged-to-revoke-nod-to-futures-deal-with-amazon/articleshow/87575262.cms||John Sarkar

The Kerala government clarified that the order had been issued at the bureaucratic level without taking the consent of the ministers concerned or the chief minister and action would be taken against officials responsible. A report submitted by the forest department to forest minister A K Saseendran, however, said the sanction was given based on decisions taken at a meeting convened by the additional chief secretary (water resources) on November 1, leading to charges that the government was hiding facts. The opposition sought to know how such a crucial decision can be taken without consulting the minister or the CM. “It's unbelievable that the order was issued without the knowledge of the state government. We demand a judicial probe in this matter. We have all the details with regard to this matter,” KPCC president K Sudhakaran said. Former minister and UDF MLA P J Joseph said it was unthinkable that a bureaucrat has issued such an order. "Then the minister has no right to remain in that post. The said order should be withdrawn." BJP state chief K Surendran also came out against the order and said the state government plans to make officials a scapegoat in the issue. Minister Saseendran, who had a discussion with Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday morning, urged the forest secretary to immediately freeze the sanction given to cut the trees and inform Tamil Nadu authorities about it through a fresh order. Will discuss with CM on action against IFS officer: SaseendranThe minister said the chief minister had asked him to initiate steps in this regard. It is learnt that the government had also gone in for a legal opinion before freezing the order. “The development came to the notice of my office when the statement from the Tamil Nadu chief minister came. I immediately sought a report from the principal chief conservator of forests and wildlife. If there is such a situation, the government should have been informed. From discussions, I have come to understand that neither the chief minister nor the water resources minister were informed about this crucial decision,” Saseendran said. Saseendran said action would be taken against officials responsible. “Since this official is an IFS officer, the minister cannot take action against him. The matter will be discussed with the chief minister and a decision taken soon,” he said. It has come to light that the principal chief conservator of forests and wildlife had informed the additional chief secretary (water resources) of the decision in a letter on November 5. Titled “application to strengthen the baby dam at Mullaperiyar dam site” and referring to the meeting held at the chamber of the additional chief secretary (water resources) on November 1, it said permission has been given “to fell 15 numbers of trees and clearing under woods and saplings within an approximate area of 40 cents in the leased area immediately downstream of Mullaperiyar baby dam”. Tamil Nadu water resources minister Duraimurugan had on Friday visited Mullaperiyar dam and said his state was looking to raise the water level to 152ft after strengthening the baby dam. Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin had thanked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for the tree-cutting decision on Saturday and said Tamil Nadu will “undertake all steps needed to further strengthen the Mullaperiyar dam and ensure the safety of people living downstream in Kerala”. Kerala has consistently claimed that the 126-year-old earthen dam structure is structurally weak and being in a seismic zone can imperil lives of hundreds of thousands of people downstream in the event of an accident, and supports the views of several expert studies that the dam be decommissioned and a new dam be built in its place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/accused-of-sellout-to-tamil-nadu-kerala-govt-freezes-tree-felling-order/articleshow/87575273.cms||---

The sudden and non-stop downpour since Saturday evening brought life to a complete standstill on Sunday as people preferred to remain indoors. According to the district administration, heavy to very heavy rainfall was reported particularly in the eastern mandals of Chittoor district and 65 out of 66 total mandals received normal to excess rainfall since Saturday. Streams and water bodies and rivers overflowed across the district as the northeast monsoon turned active thanks to the low pressure area. The highest rainfall in the district was reported at Varadaiahpalem mandal (145.4 mm), followed by Satyavedu (104.6 mm), KVB Puram mandal (75.8 mm), Yerpedu (65.2 mm), Renigunta (64.2 mm) and Tirupati (60.6 mm).

The Common Service Centre (CSC) — which operates around 4.5 lakh digital-enablement, retail and e-commerce shops across the hinterland that are privately managed by third-party non-government partners called ‘village-level entrepreneurs or VLEs — generated transactions worth nearly Rs 59,000 crore in 2020-21, and is on its way to cross Rs 70,000 crore this fiscal, CEO Dinesh Tyagi has said. Initially started as an outreach platform for furthering digital initiatives and rolling out government programmes across the rural belts and small towns, the CSC units are fast turning into a platform that is being accessed by top banking and insurance companies such as HDFC (a shareholder), FMCG companies such as Adani Wilmar, Pepsi and Coke, and even auto makers like Tata Motors and Renault. Buoyed by the rapid growth in transactions, CSC is now aiming to tap the capital markets and raise funds through the IPO route, Tyagi said, touting the company as a platform with the strongest reach across rural India. “While no confirmed valuations have been arrived at just yet, we should easily have a unicorn status, and be a billion-dollar-plus company,” Tyagi told TOI, adding that the fund-raise in likely to happen by March next year. “Funds would be used to support our expansion, set up a corporate office, and expand the CSC infrastructure.” CSC currently is a government-controlled unit under the IT ministry, according to Tyagi who adds that the central government has only one ‘golden share’ in the entity, giving it effective control. CSC was set up around 2006, and has expanded from 80,000 centres around the middle of 2014 to over 4.5 lakh units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/common-service-centre-eyes-ipo/articleshow/87575302.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: 29-km hanging power fence to deter jumbos from Karnataka||KOZHIKODE: Five panchayats under Karadka block in Kasaragod will construct a 29-km hanging electric fence, the longest such deterrent in the state, to ward off stray wild elephants coming from Karnataka forests and causing havoc in human habitations along the border. The Rs 5-crore wildlife conflict mitigation project will be funded from their plan funds and other sources. "The hanging fence is expected to provide a longterm solution for the wild elephant menace. The plan funds of the block panchayat and grama panchayats will be used for the purpose as addressing human wildlife conflict is as important as building roads and bridges. The project will be implemented by the Kerala Police Housing and Construction Corporation," Karadka block panchayat president Sigi Mathew said. The initiative comes close on the heels of the Karadka block panchayat raising a people's rapid response team (RRT) to drive stray wild elephants back to forests. Adopting a participatory approach, 21 local youths were trained and deputed as RRT members in September. They are paid around Rs 900 per day from panchayat funds and the project has been successful. Major portion of hanging fence in forest land, to cost Rs 6.5L/kmMathew said a significant stretch of the hanging fence will be installed within forest land. The fence, which will be powered by solar power for most part, will extend from Modiyar in Delampady panchayat to Kannadithodu in Kuttikkol panchayat. “The field survey will begin on November 11 and the construction in December. We hope to complete an eightkm stretch within a few months,” he said. Kasaragod divisional forest officer P Dhanesh Kumar said stray elephants causing trouble in the region were mostly from the Sullia range of Mangaluru forest division and Thalakkavery forests of Karnataka. “Traditional mitigation mechanisms like trenches and solar fencing have been found inadequate. Hanging fences are relatively cost efficient as they can be completed at Rs 6.5 lakh/km as opposed to around Rs 1.5 crore for rail fences and boundary walls. The maintenance cost will also be much less while it doesn’t hamper movement of non-target species,” he said. The fence will have 1.2mm thick steel wires hung in a row from a 1.5mm thick horizontal overhead wire supported by two 11-metre-high iron poles at each end. The wires will be connected to solar power systems or other low power sources where there is significant canopy. The wires will hang down like a curtain up to four metres from the ground and this will enable small wild animals to pass beneath it. “The forest stretches in Kasaragod had not seen much wild elephant menace till 2002 but from then onwards elephant herds from Karnataka forests started coming. While elephants have mastered how to stamp over traditional electric fences installed on the ground, we hope they will find it difficult to damage the dangling steel wires,” Kasaragod forest range officer Solomon Thomas George said. The project is expected to benefit over 10,200 people residing in these panchayats besides safeguarding crops in 1,200 acres. According to estimates, farmers have been suffering crop losses to the tune of Rs 35 crore in the area due to the human wildlife conflict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-29-km-hanging-power-fence-to-deter-jumbos-from-karnataka/articleshow/87575310.cms||K R Rajeev

Of the total 1,050 dengue cases in Ghaziabad this year, which is the district’s highest tally since 2014, 25% have been reported in these villages. Two of the villages, particularly, have been reporting worrying numbers — Manauli (55) and Didoli (30). These villages are located near the Muradnagar canal (Gang Nahar) and waterlogging in and around these areas because of the extended monsoon has become a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. A visit to the two villages, situated 10km apart, revealed that there was not a single house in the area that had not reported a fever case over the past few weeks. According to the villagers, the situation was quite worrying a couple of weeks ago, but cases are now on the decline. While Manauli has a population of around 2,500 people, there are around 5,000 residing in Didoli village. Satish Sani, a panchayat ward member and grandson of Manauli village pradhan Chandro Devi, said, “After a few people reported fever and some of them were found to have dengue in private hospitals, I approached doctors at the Muradnagar community health centre and sought their help. But they were indifferent. So, I lodged a complaint on the chief minister’s integrated grievance redress system portal and approached the chief medical officer too. It was then that the health department started taking measures to contain the spread of dengue.” According to Saini, it was the first time he had seen such an outbreak of any disease in the village. “There was no waterlogging inside the village, but in the surroundings. Though dengue cases had been rising rapidly, not many people contracted malaria,” he added. As the villages do not have a proper drainage system, sewer water discharged from households flows into the fields. This year, the prolonged rain ensured the water level remained high in such fields. “My elder brother’s 14-year-old daughter was the first to fall sick in the beginning of October. Soon after that, our father contracted dengue fever. My wife, a nephew and I were the next in line. Only my wife and I had to be admitted to ESIC Hospital in Sahibabad for five days. Even though our platelet count went down below 40,000, we did not require any sort of transfusion,” said Tinku Saini (33), a Manoli resident. Tinku raised questions on the health infrastructure. “There is a sub-centre. But the doctor posted there was busy with Covid vaccinations. He was hardly available. The nearest primary health centre is in Saunda, which is about 12km away. The CHC in Muradnagar is equally distant. Most people in the vicinity are dependent on private doctors and quacks,” he added. Villagers in Didoli had similar grievances about the health department. “The health department carried out a few camps here, but then left the people on their own. Most of us ran to Modinagar for treatment. Those who could not afford costly treatment remained at home and prayed to God. Fortunately, there was no casualty. But the situation was worse in October,” said Rahul Dhandwal (35), who had contracted the viral disease with his sister. District surveillance officer RK Gupta said, “The situation has now started to improve and cases are on the decline. As far as Muradnagar is concerned, some breeding spots were detected but we suspect that the first few cases might have come from outside and infected the Aedes mosquitoes, which in turn spread the disease in the villages.” Gupta said a series of steps were being taken to contain the spread of the disease. “Apart from fogging and anti-larvae sprays, a drive was started to bring all suspected dengue patients from villages to the nearest hospitals in ambulances.” “For this, the department, with the help of pradhans and other local representatives, identified the villages that had more fever cases. Five ambulances were deployed and we held dengue camps there,” said district malaria officer GK Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/flowing-drains-flooded-fields-why-muradnagar-is-dengue-hotspot/articleshow/87573718.cms||Aditya Dev

The state government on Sunday blamed the Centre for the steep rise in the fuel prices and have put the onus on the Centre to normalise prices. The state government is in no mood to cut down the taxes despite reports about alleged closure of fuel bunks in the districts bordering Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, where the prices are relatively lower than that of AP. "The Centre has amassed Rs.3.35 lakh crore by increased surcharges and additional cess in the last two years and shared only Rs 19,475 crore to the states. This is only 5.8 % of the total revenue pooled from the increase in the fuel surcharges and taxes," said finance minister Buggana Rajendranath in a statement. He said that the states used to get around 41% from the taxes on petroleum fuels in the past. However, the Centre excluded the states from the additional revenue bracket and took away the entire revenue of Rs 2,87,500 crore levied through surcharges and duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/onus-on-centre-to-keep-fuel-prices-low-says-andhra-pradesh-fm/articleshow/87575341.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||India's informal economy more than halved||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s digital payments index also captures the spread of digital, taking into account growth in the payments infrastructure. Of the four key objectives of demonetisation, India appears to have done well on three. There has been a rise in digital transactions. Besides this, there has also been a drop in fake currencies. Counterfeit notes detected continued to fall from 3.1 lakh in FY19 to 2.9 lakh in FY20 and 2 lakh in FY21. There are also indications that the economy is getting more formalised. According to SBI group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh, there are indicators that the informal economy has shrunk to 20% of GDP from 50% a few years ago. This is comparable to Europe and much better than Latin American countries where the size of the informal economy is estimated at 34%. “The rise in GST collections despite the GDP shrinking clearly shows that formalisation has ensured fiscal policy can be used as a counter-cyclical fiscal policy tool when revenue collapsed due to the pandemic. This is a clear break from the past as fiscal policy has always been used as a pro-cyclical fiscal policy tool in India,” said Ghosh. Recent data shows that although there has been a resurgence in economic activity, there has not been a proportionate increase in currency in circulation. The high level of digitisation has given the economy the capacity to grow without a corresponding increase in cash. “An increase in formalisation and the rise in currency under circulation are not mutually exclusive. The stakeholders in the formal economy are also consumers. While they may be having more cash in hand, more transactions are now being captured through digital footprints,” said Ghosh. According to Ghosh, even the post-pandemic surge in cash is an aberration. “If we compare currency/GDP ratio in FY20 (pre-pandemic) with FY11, the numbers are actually lower. For example, in FY20, it was at 12.1% and in FY11 it was at 12.4%. So indeed, we are becoming more digital and perhaps less cash intensive,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-informal-economy-more-than-halved/articleshow/87575336.cms||Mayur Shetty

It is learnt the SIT members will reach Rohtak early Monday morning. Ram Rahim is lodged in Sunaria jail from August 2017.

---||Jaipur||Satya Pal Malik backs farmers, says not scared to step down as governor||JAIPUR: Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik on Sunday attacked the Centre over the farmers’ issue and said he was not scared of stepping down from his post if asked. He made the comment while addressing the ‘Jat Global Summit’ here. Referring to his recent statements on farm laws, Malik said he was made the governor by a couple of people in Delhi and was fully aware that he was speaking against their will on farm issues. “The day they tell me that they have a problem (with my statements), I will not even wait for a minute to resign. On the very first day, I spoke for the farmers and was prepared to leave and to join the farm protest,” said Malik. Raising the silence of the central government on the deaths of farmers at the protest site, Malik said over 600 people have died in the country’s biggest farm movement but not a word of condolence from the top leaders was unfortunate. “Even when a puppy dies, leaders in Delhi express their condolences. But they are silent on the death of farmers,” said Malik. Making a startling claim, he recalled that during his meeting with PM Narendra Modi, he told him that neither Sikhs not Jats can be defeated over the farmers’ movement. “I told Modi that if you think that farmers will withdraw the protest without getting anything, that is not going to happen. I also told him that don’t do two things: Don’t use force and don’t send them without giving anything,” said Malik. “It is unfortunate that nobody is speaking about farmer deaths. Even those who belong to our category (OBC) have not initiated any proposal condemning the deaths in Lok Sabha,” said Malik. Defending farmers’ right to peaceful protest, he said farmers had not reacted and so far they had not even thrown a pebble. Mincing no words, he justified the hoisting of the national flag at Red Fort by farmers on January 26. He said, “Modi has the first right to hoist the national flag followed by farmers. Red Fort is part of collective memory and emotion. Our folk songs talk about taking over of Red Fort. Don’t our people have the right to hoist our flag at the Red Fort? Raising the Kargil issue, he said it was the failure of the government that intruders cross over in the country and the price was paid by sons of farmers. “Nowhere in history, a war took place in which our children took over the army sitting on the top of the hill and they died like birds,” said Malik.

We have noted a 10 to 20% hike of such patients (in the outpatient department),” said Dr Sant Ram senior physical at the District Hospital, Sector 30. Reporting a similar trend, doctors with the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, said that in-patient department dengue patients have been facing breathing issues. “Among the 40 dengue cases admitted per day, about 15-20 have been complaining about respiratory issues since the past few days," said Brigadier (retd) Dr RK Gupta, director, GIMS. Post Graduate Institute of Child Health (PGICH), Sector 30, also confirmed the trend. “We had a nearly 50% increase in patients reporting respiratory disorders. Out of that, at least 10% needed admission. Bronchitis, asthma and pneumonia cases have risen following increased levels of pollutants in the air. Meanwhile, dengue and typhoid cases are still prevalent in large numbers,” said,” Dr BP Singh emergency medical officer PGICH, Sector 30. Experts said that due to the bursting of firecrackers and dropping temperatures, there has been a spike in asthma and chronic inflammatory lung disease (COPD) patients with even non-asthmatic patients having to seek medical help. They also pointed at noiseless crackers such as phuljhadi, anar, chakri etc. as the main culprits. “People inhaling smoke coming from parks, courtyards, verandas, passages near their homes are complaining about increased respiratory problems,” said Dr Mayank Saxena, pulmonologist, Yatharth Hospital, Sector 110. He also confirmed that eight-nine patients reported respiratory problems every day. “There’s a tremendous increase in the number of cases visiting emergency wards and outpatient departments. Also, the number of inpatient department patients with breathing problems have increased after Diwali in comparison to pre-Diwali days. The main reason is the worsening air quality index and the decreasing airspeed which has led to pollutants remaining static,” said Dr Saxena. He added that patients who had no respiratory ailments are now complaining about the same. “One of my patients with no prior history of bronchitis or asthma suffered a breathlessness attack post-Diwali. The patient had to be admitted for two days and required oxygen. Inhalation injury can cause this kind of problems,” he said. While main symptoms such patients present include increasing cough, breathlessness and watering of the eyes, patients who already had COPD, asthma or any kind of respiratory ailment are also showing an increase in symptoms despite staying in controlled environments. Fortis Hospital, Sector 62, also reported a spike in patients. “There has been a sudden surge in respiratory illness post-Diwali. We are seeing almost 10 to 15 patients with respiratory issues in OPD every day and a few of them had to be admitted,” said Dr Ajay Agarwal, director and head of the department of internal medicine, Fortis Hospital. He advised continued use of masks for protection against pollutants. However, Dr Saxena said, “People are not wearing the correct type of masks. The soft green/blue ones won’t save them from pollution. Currently, people need to wear N95 masks, which helps against PM 2.5 particles." He also advised people to stay indoors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-sees-a-rise-in-patients-with-breathing-difficulties/articleshow/87573664.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Chandigarh||Price cut makes Punjab petrol rate only more than Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: In a much-needed respite, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday announced a reduction of Rs 10 and Rs 5 per litre, respectively, in prices of petrol and diesel from Sunday midnight. Now, petrol would cost Rs 95 per litre and diesel Rs 83.75 per litre in Punjab. The move follows the Centre’s decision to reduce excise duty, The Punjab government would now have to bear an overall loss of nearly Rs 4,151 crore per annum due to the reduction of excise duty by the central government and the value-added tax (VAT) by the state government. The chief minister said Punjab now has the lowest petrol rates in the region barring UT Chandigarh (Rs 94.21) and the rates of diesel in the state are also much lower than the neighbouring Haryana (Rs 86.53) and Rajasthan (Rs 100.46). The Punjab government has reduced the VAT on petrol from 27.27% (24.79% +10% surcharge) to 15.15% (13.77% +10% surcharge) and on diesel from 17.57 % (15.93% +10% surcharge) to 10.91% (9.92 % + 10% surcharge). Channi said the central government had slashed the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 per litre, respectively, with effect from November 4 by cutting down the excise duty, which adversely impacts the income of all states, including Punjab, as they have 42% share in the excise duty collected by central gover nment. VAT cut will lead to annual loss of Rs 3,295 croreThe annual consumption of petrol and diesel in Punjab as per financial year 2019-20 figures is 13,52,260 kilolitre (kl) and 3,886,897 kl, respectively. Therefore, the reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 10 and Rs 5, respectively, will result in annual loss of Rs1,352 crore and Rs 1,943 crore on petrol and diesel, respectively. But this is in addition to an estimated annual loss of over Rs 684 crore and over Rs 172 crore of VAT revenue for petrol and diesel, owing to reduction of excise duty by the central government. He added that the decision has brought parity in the rates of VAT on petrol and diesel with neighbouring states and UTs and will give a boost to the farmers of Punjab during the upcoming Rabi season and relief to consumers in general. The reduction in VAT rates on petrol and diesel will also boost consumption, decrease inflation for the poor and middle classes and boost the overall economic cycle. ‘Centre grabbed states’ share’State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the Punjab government wants to request the Centre to reduce duty components other than the excise duty on petrol and diesel. He added that in the last six years, there is no increase in the excise duty but other components like additional excise, special excise, surcharge and cess have increased because when these components are increased, the central government is not bound to share revenue out of these components with the states. "The Modi government has grabbed states’ share of Rs 6 lakh crore in the last six years," he added. Manpreet said that state governments are dutybound to look after the welfare of the people, be it providing them good education, health and law and order through police, old age pension or generation of power, construction and maintenance of canals or other social welfare activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/price-cut-makes-punjab-petrol-rate-only-more-than-chandigarh/articleshow/87575350.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida records five Covid-19 cases for second straight day||Noida: For the second day in a row, Gautam Budh Nagar reported five new Covid-19 cases on Sunday. With this, the district now has the maximum number of new and active cases in the state. On Sunday, the district and state capital Lucknow had 15 active cases — the highest in Uttar Pradesh. While Noida reported five new cases, two were recorded in Varanasi, and one each in Lucknow, Meerut, Prayagraj and Barabanki. According to official data, the cases had started reducing in GB Nagar and no new infections were reported for four consecutive days till Saturday when five cases were added to the district’s tally, taking the active cases to 10. While the rampant violation of social-distancing norms during the festivals could be behind the recent spike in infections, health officials said it was too early to see a trend or attribute the increase in cases to any reason. “The 10 cases recorded in the past two days are all separate incidents and there is no cluster. This is a relief and we cannot say that there has been a spread of infection from any particular source. The patients had come with different symptoms to various hospitals and were sent to a government facility for Covid-19 testing. Six of them were tested at Child PGI,” a senior health official said, adding that none of the patients was children and are not admitted to the hospital either. All active cases, health officials said, were in home isolation and none of the patients was serious. In several cases, the patients also do not have any symptoms. The positive report came only when these patients got tested before travelling, as a mandatory rule. Meanwhile, neighbouring Ghaziabad recorded no new cases over the last week. The district also has just one active case now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-records-five-covid-19-cases-for-second-straight-day/articleshow/87573689.cms||Snehil Sinha

However, standalone, neighbourhood preschools are in a dilemma whether to open now or watch for a while. A few standalone preschools who own their spaces are likely to start functioning on Monday. A large number of preschools that were operating out of rented spaces had left the place and moved their infrastructure to godowns after the lockdown forced them to down the shutters. Of these, some of them are looking for spaces again. “Challenges are many now. Preschools cannot have a small set-up in a house again.... While many houses had remained locked up for the past one and a half years, the owners are asking for higher rents... Getting the right place is becoming a tedious task,” said Pruthvi Banwasi, secretary, Karnataka Council of Pre-schools. Pruthvi, too, is on a space hunt to restart his schools. “We want to have a space first. Only then can the school have a face and admissions will come through. A school cannot be online forever. Once we find an ideal space, it is just a plug-in for us. Rents are high in non-residential areas and we also need a bigger place,” said Swati Krishnan of Ira Early Years. Some preschools hunt for spaceThe challenge is to read parents’ minds. We are on an active space hunt. Two of our landlords were considerate to allow us to continue for the past few months. In the other spaces, we had to vacate,” said Chirag Agarwal, founder director, EarlyVentions - Chain of Preschools. For a very large number of preschool owners, it is wait and watch. “First of all, we do not know how many parents will be willing to send their children. We need to do a survey for that. Additionally, we do not know whether another wave will hit us. For us, it will be starting from scratch and the investment will run into lakhs of rupees. We would rather wait for a few months,” said Ayesha Singh, director, CreativeKidz. “We have to hunt for a new space, rehire teachers and recruit more staff to ensure Covid protocols. Admissions have been only one-fourth of normal times. We held a survey among parents and saw that 60%-70% do not want to send children as many have migrated to their hometowns.

Many members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is spearheading the agitation at UP Gate, said the number of farmers protesting against the three agriculture laws of the Centre would increase after November 20. Many farmers from various districts of UP are likely to flock to UP Gate after having sown their wheat crop, they said. A meeting of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha is scheduled at the Singhu border on November 9 to discuss the course of the protest. Farmer leader Jagtar Singh Bajwa, who is also the spokesperson for the Kisan Morcha Ghazipur Border, told TOI: “About 1,000 farmers have been camping at the Ghazipur border at present. This number is expected to go up after November 20 because more farmers will join after completing their sowing process. We have started making arrangements for mattresses, blankets and other such things.” He added that the SKM would take a call on how the protest would be planned after November 26, when the farmers’ agitation will complete a year. “So many farmers have given their lives but the Centre has not taken any positive decision. The government has been busy hatching conspiracies against the movement, but the solidarity of the farmers and labourers of the country has thwarted every such conspiracy. The unity of the movement is the guarantee of our success,” he said. Last year, help had poured in from various quarters at the Ghazipur border during the winter, when the mercury dropped to single digits. Several students and farmers’ organisations from Punjab and Uttarakhand had distributed sweaters, shawls, blankets, shoes and slippers among the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/more-farmers-to-flock-to-up-gate-after-nov-20/articleshow/87573733.cms||Aditya Dev

DK deputy commissioner Dr KV Rajendra said the bus services between Mangaluru and Kasaragod will not resume until the test positivity rate in Kasaragod reduces below 3%. “The TPR is still more than 10%,” Rajendra said, adding that the restrictions will continue. Meanwhile, interstate daily commuters are hopeful that the Karnataka government will withdraw its border restrictions completely, considering the reduction in the number of fresh cases of Covid-19 in Kasaragod district. The average daily cases in the Kerala district have seen a drastic decline in the past few weeks — from150-200 to around 110. However, the number of daily cases is more compared to DK’s figure of 15. The district did not report more than 50 cases for more than a month after 55 cases were reported on October 5. As per an order issued by the district administration on October 27, border surveillance will continue till November 10. Interstate daily commuters from Kasaragod have been requesting the bus services be resumed immediately as they are forced to travel in two buses to reach Mangaluru. “Since there are no KSRTC shuttle buses, we have to travel in ordinary ones from Kasaragod to Talapady that halt at more than 50 bus stops. We have to hop on to city buses to reach Mangaluru from Talapady. It takes more than two hours to cover a distance of 50km from Kasaragod to Mangaluru,” said Surendra Nayak, a daily commuter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/no-interstate-ksrtc-buses-till-kasaragod-tpr-below-3-dc/articleshow/87575455.cms||Vinobha K T
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Sub-inspector arrested for ‘beating up’ dancers at Diwali party||GHAZIABAD: Ghaziabad Police arrested a Uttar Pradesh Police sub-inspector on Saturday for allegedly beating women dancers at a Diwali party on Thursday. His four friends, who were also at the party, are absconding, said police. The sub-inspector was produced before a magistrate later in the day and released on bail. The sub-inspector has been identified as Jitendra Kumar Gautam. He was deployed at Dasna Chowki under the jurisdiction of the Masuri police station. A complaint against the sub-inspector and his four friends was registered by Imraan, a cleaner at Dasna Chowki, on Saturday. According to Imraan's FIR, the sub-inspector organised a Diwali party on the tenth floor of Dev Heights, a residential society in Dasna. The house allegedly belonged to Kuldeep Sharma, a friend of the sub-inspector. Kuldeep and three others, Shakeel, Taja Mohmmad alias Tajji and Gulfaam, were allegedly attending the party. The sub-inspector had also hired two women dancers for the party, Imraan’s complaint said. "I received a phone call from the sub-inspector and he asked me to be at the party place for some work. Jitendra gave me Rs 1,000 and asked me to go and purchase beer for the guests. When I reached the flat after purchasing beer, one of the dancers came to me and asked me to drop her at her house. She also told me that the cop and his friends beat her and misbehaved with her," Imraan said in his complaint. Imraan also alleged that when he entered the flat, he found that the sub-inspector and his friends were misbehaving with another dancer. When he opposed, Jitendra and his friends allegedly beat him up and he had to flee from the spot. "The accused chased me and Jitendra shouted that he would kill me. Tajji, along with other people, came and threatened my parents, saying he will kill each one in my family," Imraan said. Iraj Raja, SP (Rural), told TOI that on the basis of Imraan's complaint, an FIR was registered against the sub-inspector and his four friends under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC. "His other friends are absconding at the moment. We have suspended him and a departmental enquiry has been set up against him. Further action will be taken on the basis of a departmental enquiry," Raja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/sub-inspector-arrested-for-beating-up-dancers-at-diwali-party-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/87573756.cms||---

This takes the tiger toll in Madhya Pradesh to 35 this year. The carcass was spotted around 4pm during routine patrolling near Pathor range of the tiger reserve, said forest officials. Wildlife experts reached the spot and concluded that the tiger -- aged around 5 years — was killed in a territorial fight with another tiger. All its body organs are said to be intact. Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey expressed strong concern on the growing toll. “If steps are not taken today, we will be back to tiger oblivion soon. What we need urgently is a proper management plan,” he told TOI, adding that MP now accounts for a fourth of all tiger deaths reported in the country. On October 31, Heera – of the Heera-Panna sibling fame – was found mutilated and skinned in an area near Panna reserve. Three men arrested for the crime have told forest officials that they had electrified the fence around their farm to protect their crop, and panicked when they saw a tiger had been electrocuted. They skinned it, believing it would be easier to dispose of the carcass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tiger-found-dead-in-bandhavgarh-madhya-pradeshs-toll-35-this-year/articleshow/87575532.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityAir quality monitoring data on October 28 in Bengaluru city showed that six of the seven locations had moderate AQI: namely City Railway Station (105), Hebbal (109), Jayanagar (123), Kavika (178) and Nimhans (106) and Silk Board (107). AQI is termed moderate if it’s between 101 and 200. Only SG Halli had satisfactory AQI at 79. AQI between 51 and 100 is termed satisfactory, while 0 to 50 is good. However, the AQI fell sharply during Deepavali days at six of seven stations. The spike in the lone station too was marginal. While City railway station saw average AQI duringDeepavaliincreaseto112, it fell at SG Halli (57), Hebbal (45), Jayanagar (74), Kavika (87), Nimhans (42) and Silk Board (54). During Deepavali, one station had moderate AQI, four had satisfactory AQI and two good AQI. The average decrease in AQI during Deepavali from October 28 was 42%, according to KSPCB. Air quality monitoring is carried out in Bengaluru as per Central Pollution Control Board guidelines. The average AQI in the city has been dropping during Deepavali since 2017 when it was 162. It fell to 111 in 2018, 81 in 2019 and 55 in 2020. Srinivasalu, member-secretary, KSPCB, said, “During Deepavali in 2020, the number of Covid cases was high and citizens were scared. Hence, AQI was much lower and that’s why it cannot be used as a benchmark during Deepavali.” Explaining how AQI on a normal day was higher than the Deepavali average, Srinivasalu said, "It is important to understand that AQI is hugely affected by rainfall. The particulars in the air are not there at least temporarily after a downpour and it cannot be considered. We should see if there is a downward trend showing decrease in AQI over the past five years."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/deepavali-bengalurus-air-quality-back-to-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/87575504.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Turning up the heat on his appointing authority, Sidhu asked Deol: “Are you acting at the behest of those who appointed you in this constitutional office and fulfilling their political gains? Did you advise the government to challenge the blanket bail order procured by you or any other adverse order in sacrilege cases in Supreme Court?” He questioned the stand taken by Deol in the Punjab and Haryana high court on the issue of acting on STF report on drugs and accused him of “shielding the inaction of the government under the guise of your own unknown ethics” and of his “earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it”. A month after announcing his resignation as state Congress chief, Sidhu withdrew it on Friday, but said he would resume charge only after AG is replaced and a new panel (with the name of the new DGP) named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhus-jibe-at-ag-acting-at-behest-of-those-who-appointed-you/articleshow/87575545.cms||---

They spent a sleepless night huddled together on a bed surrounded by water that had flooded their single-storeyed house at Rangarajapuram, Kodambakkam, till the fire and rescue personnel turned up around 7.30 on Sunday morning, The aged couple whose only son lives abroad didn’t even have a phone to call for help. But their son alerted a friend, when he learnt about the rain havoc in Chennai, who in turn alerted the authorities. On receiving the call for help, a group of six firemen including SFOs S Ramesh and Shanmugham and leading fireman Naresh Kumar rushed to the house in ten minutes. They had to carry the aged couple in chairs through the flood waters for nearly three km to reach a vehicle to take them to a relative’s house. Sabeshan is bedridden with a spinal problem and Gomathi moves around slowly with difficulty. Their rescuers said the couple was worried about the damage to their belongings, especially the carefully stacked piles of newspapers. “We had to first pacify them and reassure them that they were safe. We then carefully carried them in chairs,” said Naresh Kumar. The couple live by themselves in an individual house. A friend of their son’s visits them often to check on them and also lend them his phone to speak to their son.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: After slow vaccination, 50% slump in Covid tests too||BHOPAL: Less than six months after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered that at least 80,000 Covid tests should be done every day across Madhya Pradesh, not more than 35,000 tests are being done in the state now. Amid concerns of the poor pace of vaccination drive in the state, the drop in Covid-19 tests by half in the state has surprised health experts. The drop in sampling has been gradual as it has reduced month-onmonth since July. In the past two days (November 5 and 6), less than 35,000 samples were tested. So far in the month of November, only 2,57,535 tests for for Covid-19 have been done in Madhya Pradesh. Simply put, the state has conducted only 42,922 tests per day. In October, the numbers were as high as 17,39,580 tests or 56,115 tests per day. Current testing is far below the average number of tests that were to be done in the state everyday. The sampling and testing for Covid-19 has declined on a month-on-month basis in the state. In September, 19,67,378 tests were done, which was equivalent to 65,579 tests per day. In August, it rose marginally to 21,59,911 tests which was equivalent to 69,674 tests per day. Sources said that if seven people were found positive when 31,179 tests were done on November 6, numerically seeing, the figure of new cases may be actually 20 if 70,000 tests were done. Reducing tests at a time when attaining full vaccination by the year-end seems difficult with every passing day, may lead to slow identification of positive cases. It may result in in late isolation and hence the chances of the spread of the disease cannot be ruled out, experts warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-after-slow-vaccination-50-slump-in-covid-tests-too/articleshow/87575551.cms||Amarjeet Singh

However, there was a slight improvement in the air with the AQI dropping from 456 on Saturday to 419 on Sunday. With the wind speed increasing, the air will further improve from Monday but AQI will stay in the high end of the 'very poor' category the next two days, according to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). On Sunday, the average wind speed increased to 8km/hr from 6km/hr on Saturday. The wind speed was only 3km/hr on Friday. Officials said that roads are being watered across the district to reduce dust pollutants in the atmosphere. “Pollutants are already dispersing due to the continuous efforts of the civic bodies. Teams are ensuring mechanised sweeping and sprinkling of water on the roads. We are also conducting day and night patrolling to ensure that no bio-waste is burnt in the district,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB. On Sunday, three of the four air monitoring stations in Gurgaon recorded AQI in the 'severe' category. The AQIs at Vikas Sadan, Teri Gram and Gwal Pahari were 426, 449 and 433, respectively. Meanwhile, Sector 51 recorded an AQI of 368 in the 'very poor' category. The visibility was low throughout the morning and evening due to smog conditions. The PM2.5 and PM10 levels recorded at the four air monitoring stations were higher than the permissible limits of 60μg/m3 and 100μg/m3, respectively. Teri Gram recorded the highest PM2.5 level of 446μg/m3 whereas the PM10 level was 374μg/m3. Gwal Pahari was close on its heels with 432μg/m3 PM2.5 and 330μg/m3 PM10 levels. Meanwhile, at Vikas Sadan, the PM2.5 level was 415μg/m3 but the PM10 level was not recorded and at Sector 51, PM2.5 was 350μg/m3 and PM10 was 282μg/m3. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurgaon recorded a minimum temperature of 14.7 degrees Celsius and a maximum temperature of 26.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The low temperature prevented the dispersal of pollutants in the atmosphere, said air quality experts. The same trend was observed in Delhi which recorded an AQI of 428, Noida with an AQI of 446 and Ghaziabad with an AQI of 455, all in the 'severe' category. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), stubble burning spiked Delhi’s PM2.5 from 41% on Saturday to 48% on Sunday. Experts said that wind speed and direction and significantly high fire counts since Saturday have prevented any recovery in the AQI despite moderate wind speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-air-severe-for-third-straight-day-met-factors-may-provide-slight-relief/articleshow/87573375.cms||Ipsita Pati

The estate branch will study and take a call on them before the policy is finally notified. The administration had released the draft policy over a month back, giving enough time to people to file objections. Each objection will be studied and then a decision taken, sources said, adding the ball is now in the court of the estate branch. “We will now look into all the objections. Senior officers of the UT will be apprised and a decision taken before we think about the notification,” sources said. For allowing residential buildings as nursing homes, the authorities have put several conditions in the draft policy. A nursing home shall be allowed to function from a residential building only with the permission of the chief administrator, according to one of them. Another is that an application for permission will have to made by the allottee of the building. The policy also mentions that a maximum of four nursing homes will be permitted in a sector. Initially, the number of sites in the city will not be more than 30, excluding the existing ones.

---||Gurgaon||Haryana minister Anil Vij: Restrict religious activities to places of worship||GURUGRAM: Amid protests by local right-wing outfits against offering namaz in the open, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said on Sunday that everyone should hold religious events inside their places of worship. People belonging to any faith should avoid organising such events on roads or public places without the permission of the local administration, Vij added. “Everyone should organise their religious activities at their respective religious places. People should refrain from organising religious events on roads and public places without permission from the local administration, and it should be applicable to all,” the minister told reporters in Ambala. The comment comes on the heels of the recent protests by some local groups against namaz offered in the open. Right-wing groups in Gurgaon have been demanding that Muslims be allowed to offer namaz “only at mosques and idgahs”. Recently, the Gurgaon Police had also arrested around 25 people, including members of right-wing outfits, for trying to disrupt Friday prayers. On November 5, the Samyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, a conglomerate of local outfits, organised Govardhan puja at a ‘designated’ namaz site in Sector 12. The event was attended by BJP functionaries like Suraj Pal Amu and Kapil Mishra among others. Objecting to anyone occupying a public place to offer prayers, Mishra had said, “If people from different religions, faiths and sects keep occupying open public spaces on one day every week, it will result in blockade of all the roads and parks.” Meanwhile, citing “objections from local residents and resident welfare associations”, the district administration last week withdrew permission for namaz at eight of the 37 ‘designated’ sites in the city. The Muslim community has now urged the civic authorities to clear encroachment from around 19 properties of the Waqf Board. They have also formed a 21-member panel to open a dialogue with the local authorities and political leadership of the state in the matter. The community has maintained that they were forced to offer namaz in open areas as the number of mosques in Gurgaon was insufficient. “There are not enough mosques in Gurgaon and it is convenient to offer namaz close to workplaces. It hardly takes a few minutes,” Mohd Adeeb, chairman of the panel, said. Opposition to namaz in open areas, he added, was a recent development and the general public still had no issue with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/restrict-religious-activities-to-places-of-worship-says-anil-vij/articleshow/87573395.cms||Bagish Jha

"I was prepared to accept either outcome," said Musk, who regularly takes to Twitter to make unexpected announcements or surprising comments. He did not specify when or how he plans to sell the shares. The electric car maker's query on Saturday night follows a proposal by US Congressional Democrats to tax the super wealthy more heavily by targeting stocks, which are usually only taxed when sold. Musk had already criticized the proposal at the end of October, tweeting: "Eventually, they run out of other people's money and then they come for you." He broached the topic again on Saturday, writing on Twitter: "Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock." He also shared a poll asking followers whether they agree "yes" or "no." By Sunday, 57.9 percent of those who voted had picked "yes." Musk owned about 17 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares as of June 30, currently worth $208.37 billion, according to Bloomberg. The entrepreneur was also awarded a large package of stock options and convertible shares as compensation. By selling 10 percent of his shares, he could theoretically earn just under $21 billion. His wealth swelled with the recent surge in Tesla's stock price, from about $130 at the start of 2020 to $1,222.09 as of Friday. Taking into account his stakes in his other companies, such as neurotechnology firm Neuralink and SpaceX, Musk is, in theory, the richest man in the world, with an estimated fortune of some $338 billion, according to Bloomberg. "Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere," Musk tweeted Saturday. "I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/twitter-votes-elon-musk-should-sell-10-of-tesla-stock/articleshow/87575626.cms||---

The road will ease the movement of heavy vehicles in the area and make commuting easier for residents of sectors 79-79B. The road will start near the pond close to the Aravaleshwar Mahadev temple and end near Jai Bharti Public School, according to GMDA officials. The project includes a 1,400m-long roadside drain, the officials said. "The land demarcation and possession documents have been received. It will take six months to complete the work,” said Major Shaveta Sharma, executive engineer, Infra I, GMDA. At present, the GMDA is seeking online bids for the project through e-tendering. The defect liability and maintenance period of the project is four years. There is another road in the area from Rampura chowk to Naurangpur. "But this road is owned by the Public Works and Development (PWD) department and is only 5.5 metres wide. The new alignment will have a width of 84 metres,” said Sharma. GMDA has planned the project in line with the demands of residents and developers in the area, Sharma said. According to residents and developers of Naurangpur and sectors 79-79B, the PWD road is not sturdy enough for the heavy vehicles that pass through the area. "It is very bumpy and difficult to use. One option is to revamp the existing road but we have already acquired land for the new road. We decided there was no point in compromising on the width of the road. Our aim is to give maximum advantage to the commuter,” said Sharma. According to GMDA officials, the project includes the installation of road safety devices such as road studs, solar cat eyes, metal delineators, hazard markers, flexible median markers, and flexible spring posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2km-road-to-come-up-near-gurgaon-sectors-79-79b/articleshow/87573460.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) has recently issued notices to all the defaulters, giving them two-week time to take corrective steps for developing the required infra. The notice states that a facility for the partial load of 11 KV was a stopgap arrangement, and the developer was supposed to set up infra for 33 KV within a time-bound manner. “Shying away from your obligation and responsibilities, you have gone ahead with the sales of plots, flats and shops for possession without making adequate provision for the supply of electricity for the said project. We reiterate that you are bound under the license condition and electrification plan sanctioned to create external infrastructure within the specified time,” the notice reads. As per the notice, the cost of developing the infrastructure for 33 KV sub-station will be borne by the developer. According to DHBVN officials, the developers had already collected money for laying 33 KV internal and external infra from the vendees but still had not commenced its construction “Such a conduct amounts to a breach of faith for which DHBVN reserves their right to initiate appropriate regulatory proceedings,” a senior official said, adding that if the developers fail to comply with the notice, the power discom will initiate regulatory proceedings against the builder, seek cancellation of license from DTCP, disconnect electricity supply, stop new power connections and also declare the developer a defaulter. The developers who have received notices from DHBVN include Oasis Build Homes’ project in Sectors 88A and 89A; Magnum International Company project in Sector 84; Deepanshu Projects in Sector 86; Garden City Colony projects in Sectors 91 and 92; Regal Garden’s Sector 90 project; TS Realtech’s Sectors 85 and 86 projects; Crown Propbuild’s Sector 90 project; and Saphire Landcraft’s Sector 83 project. Recently, DHBVN had stopped issuing new electricity connections to property owners in colonies developed by 16 builders who were yet to pay the power discom infrastructure charges amounting to over Rs 317 crore. In October, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the state government was framing a policy to provide permanent electricity connections to the residents of private developer colonies of Gurgaon who have been denied permanent connection due to incomplete infrastructure works by their developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-power-sub-stations-8-builders-served-notices/articleshow/87573502.cms||Bagish Jha

A long-distance migrant, grey plovers are known to breed in Russia during the summer and along the shoreline in the winter months and are uncommon to the Delhi-NCR plains. “Grey plovers do not usually travel to this part, so their sighting was a real delight. A grey-headed lapwing, also rarely seen in this region, was spotted,” Nikhil Devasar of Delhi Bird Society (DBS) told TOI. On Sunday, a 15-odd group of birders from DBS also spotted 80 species of birds at Budhera and the areas adjoining Chandu. According to birder Ashima Kumar, the Budhera area is a low-lying agricultural field. “This time, due to the unprecedented rainfall in late October, the whole place is underwater and has become a haven for migratory birds,” Kumar, who was part of the DBS team, said. “Just a couple of minutes at the site and we spotted a grey-headed lapwing. These birds, more common in China, fly to the north-eastern part of India during winters. We were plain lucky to see one today. As the team took a single-track road that winds around the fields and goes further down, we saw the water was full of coots, greylag geese, shelduck, shovelers, spot-billed ducks, little grebes, avocets, black-winged stilts and black-tailed godwits, among others. Amid this massive congregation was a tiny bird — the grey plover,” Kumar added. According to the DBS team, Budhera was probably a pit stop for the grey plover. “Grey plovers have been known to land in freshwater wetlands though they cannot get by on them for long and have to find their way to the mudflats of the coastal regions,” Kumar said, adding that Budhera, an unprotected land which hosts thousands of winter birds, was an important home for the migrants. “Though birds still make their way here every winter, the area is dwindling steadily, a universal story around the globe.” Among other species that were spotted include scaly breasted munias, house sparrows, pied bush chat, black-breasted weavers, ashy prinia, warblers, red-headed buntings, shrikes, black drongo, common and pied starlings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/twitchers-cheer-sighting-of-rare-birds/articleshow/87573530.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Chennai||Chennai rain: Sunday brings back memories of 2015 floods, IMD predicts more downpour||CHENNAI: If the overnight spell of continuous rain flooding most parts of the city brought back memories of the past, there is more rain in the offing in the next three days. After the 2015 floods, every spell of heavy rain brought a sense of déjà vu among Chennai residents. Private weather bloggers said this was the ‘heaviest rain’ the city has experienced since 2015. If Sunday’s flooded roads and inundated neighbourhoods were anything to go by, the government machinery have their task cut out as heavier rain is predicted for the mid-week due to a low pressure that could move towards the city. The civic body’s underpreparedness were exposed as storm water drains maintained by the corporation and the highways department failed to handle the 21.53cm of rain that the city received. In several arterial stretches and interior roads, kneedeep water-logging was the norm. While government officials make grandiose plans of deploying motor pumps, rescue boats on standby in lowlying areas and health camps, Sunday’s situation was because of their own doing. According to official sources, the newly-laid storm water drains along arterial roads were of little use on Sunday. Inundation was reported at Poonamallee High Road, Velachery-Tambaram Road, Thoraipakkam Radial Road, GST Road and GNT Road. The highways department is spending around₹212 crore for flood prevention work and storm water drains and culverts across the city. They maintain a 303 km-long drain network and 1,041 bridges and culverts, according to official data. The corporation said that they have completed desilting and repair work in 88% of storm water drains in the corporation limit. The city has 697 km of SWD network, of which desilting has been done in 620 km of SWDs, according to official data. “We have also been using amphibian vehicles to desilt and excavate the 30 canals in Corporation limits,” an official said. ‘’Normally after such heavy rainfall events such as the recent rainfall in the State including Chennai, there is an impact phase between 0 to 4 days,’’ said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “Normally water borne infections, air borne, vector borne infections and injuries can be expected. We must stay vigilant now,” he said. Health workers will hold camps in low lying areas in the districts, the health department has announced. In addition, 416 mobile medical units and 770 jeep-borne medical units will provide preventive screening services to prevent any outbreak. Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services Joint Director Priya Ravichandran said that they are bringing in 300 more people from other districts to the city to tackle emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-rain-sunday-brings-back-memories-of-2015-floods-imd-predicts-more-downpour/articleshow/87575668.cms||---

The trekking community has begun to fondly acknowledge her as the ‘Alpine Girl’. Alpine lakes are located above 10,000 feet from sea-level. Namratha Nandish, who stays in Bellandur area, started with Tulian Lake, which is sandwiched between the Pir Panjal and the Zanskar mountain ranges in South Kashmir’s Pahalgam area. She concluded her trek with Shilsar Lake in the higher reaches of the Anantnag-Kishtwar area. The trek to the lakes was a natural progression of an earlier visit to Dal Lake. On January 26 this year, Namratha and her husband Abhishek checked into a Srinagar hotel with a plan. “I had done my homework. I decided to trek 33 lakes during the season as a birthday gift to myself, but then ended up doing 50 treks,” said Namratha, who turned 33 this year. Namratha’s guide Syed Tahir, who accompanied her to most of the lakes, said: “Tourists come here with a goal to do a long trek of three to four days but here was a woman, who had set a goal for herself, even before the start of the season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/this-alpine-girl-from-bengaluru-could-give-trekkers-a-goal-reset-in-kashmir/articleshow/87575846.cms||---

Six patients succumbed in the last 24 hours and all of them had comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes. The state's cumulative death toll is 36,220. The infection count too has continued to drop. A total of 850 people tested positive for the virus here on Sunday. But Chennai witnessed a marginal increase in fresh cases for the past two days. As many as 129 tested positive on Sunday. The district's test positivity rate (TPR) also climbed to 0.8%. At the start of the week, it was 0.6%. The TRP has increased even when the number of samples screened has dropped from 19,900 to 15,300 during this period.  TN's TPR has also increased by 0.1 percentage points even when there is a 18% decline in the number of samples tested at accredited labs now compared to the previous week. Experts, however, say that it was too early to attribute it to crowds at public places during the festival season.  Though Coimbatore, another disease hotspot in TN, has a slightly higher TPR of 1.2%, the actual number of new cases is reducing consistently. It has remained in two-digits since Friday. Similarly, the state's active cases are also decreasing. Currently, 10,474 patients are undergoing treatment and among them less than one-third needed hospitalisation. Rest with mild infection are treated at their homes. Attributing this to the vaccine coverage, Health Minister Ma Subramanian said the aim was to vaccinate all the eligible population with at least one dose before the end of the month. Door-to-door vaccination, inaugurated in Chennai last week, will help in achieving this.  At present, 71% of the eligible have got their first doses and 32% are fully vaccinated. Around 65 lakh people are due for their second dose and the Greater Chennai Corporation has prepared a list to find and vaccinate them soon. On Sunday, there was a sharp drop in vaccination figures due to the heavy rain in Chennai and few other districts. Only 35,491 got inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/covid-19-tamil-nadu-logs-lowest-single-day-deaths-in-second-wave/articleshow/87580005.cms||---

Water stagnation was reported from many areas, particularly in low-lying areas such as Velachery, Valasaravakkam and West Mambalam, but complaints were fewer, officials said. “In Velachery, the lake is already at sea level and leads to flooding even during a normal spell of rain. So connecting drains to the lake doesn’t make sense,” said an official, adding that all problems would be rectified. There were 164 water logging complaints. About 80 people were evacuated and 27 trees fell. On November 24-25, 2020, when 12.8cm of rain was recorded, 53 complaints were received and 26 trees fell. About 90 people had to be moved to the corporation’s makeshift shelters. This year, loss to life or property was nil, a senior storm water drain official said. Cleaning and widening of canals such as in Nolambur and Ambattur resulted in water stagnation being minimal. The situation was the same in the RBI subway and Gengu Reddy subway, he added. Nanganallur resident V Rama Rao said the official response system too had improved. “In our area, stagnant water was pumped out faster than usual.” As per Greater Chennai Corporation, there are at least 550 vulnerable locations, but cleaning of 30,000 silt catchpits and desilting of 900km of the 1,600km of drains helped. “The depth of stagnation didn’t cross 2feet in any area except Pulianthope. Drains are constructed to withstand 5cm of rain. Since it was around 20cm, there was water logging in some low-lying areas,” said commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-corporations-foresight-cut-down-loss-to-life-property/articleshow/87575527.cms||Komal Gautham

---||Chennai||Special trains cost more, but amenities missing||CHENNAI: More than 90% of trains may have resumed with full patronage, but railways continue to run them as specials, unreserved express specials and festival specials, charging high and varying fares without offering onboard amenities. Concessions for senior citizens have been suspended, blankets and pillows are not given and curtains removed from all AC classes but charges have not been reduced. Passengers say it is unfair to keep fares high under different classifications when reservation status is at waitlist and RAC for weekends and holidays. On Friday, Southern Railway announced around 11 unreserved specials with fares equivalent to express trains. This means people will have to spend double the money they had been spending for tickets on passenger trains to travel by these unreserved express specials between interior towns. S Vijayaraghavan, who used to travel by passenger trains, said a passenger had to pay 30 or more to travel by one of these trains from one station to another while it used to cost only 7 on a passenger train. "Railways should introduce passenger trains instead of running trains that charge more money from the people. It is of no help." The railways is also introducing festival specials which have fares that will cost 300-500 more than regular AC III tier class on scheduled trains on the route. However, these trains do not offer any additional facilities. Suresh Seshadri, a Kolkata resident who works in Chennai, said that on Coromandel Special and Howrah Mail special, the last few 2nd AC and 3rd AC tickets under premium tatkal category cost 4,000 and 2,500. "The actual fare is 2,500 and 1,750. A flight to Kolkata booked in advance will be cheaper than a 2nd AC seat." This, said consumer activist T Sadagopan, was fleecing in the name of pandemic. "There is no point in running the same express and mail trains by calling them specials and then cancelling all concessions for senior citizens and others. Curtains are removed, pillows and blankets are not given. Railways should be charging less from passengers who travel by AC class because half of the amenities are not provided on board. There is no justification to continue to charge the same fare." However, railways maintain that all passenger trains are not being operated because the pandemic is still on. The Railway Board has said that a decision on running of passenger trains and running scheduled trains will be taken only after the pandemic reduces considerably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/special-trains-cost-more-but-amenities-missing/articleshow/87576179.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Why parents in Delhi are in two minds about getting their kids vaccinated||NEW DELHI: Even if Covid vaccines are made available for children in India in near future, many parents seem to prefer to wait before getting them jabbed. Several parents TOI spoke to cited various reasons behind their decision - from the belief that young children have a low risk of catching severe Covid, lack of research data available in the public domain on vaccine trials to small trial sizes. In August, the Indian drug regulator granted an emergency approval use to Zydus Cadila's vaccine for children above 12 years. However, it is yet to become part of the vaccination programme. In the US, Food and Drug Administration has approved vaccination for children in the age group of 5-11 years. Tanya Aggarwal, a lawyer and a parent of a Class I child, said, "Many doctors have said that unlike adults, young children have a low risk of severe Covid. Given this risk profile, small trial sizes and lack of long-term safety data, it's difficult to definitively say yes to Covid-19 vaccines for children." Another parent, Mohit Goel, who has two children - one in Class X and the other in nursery, attributed his reluctance to lack of "reliable research data". "I will prefer not to vaccinate them now as reliable research data is not available about the efficiency of vaccine and its side-effects in the long run. Overall, two waves have passed, and children have shown considerable immunity against the virus with negligible cases," added Goel. Satya Prakash, who lives in Rohini, however, will go for it if sufficient data is made available in the public domain. Prakash, who is also the president of Delhi Parents' Association, said, "Let the government publish the raw research data, observation and findings. Let me be assured that the finding is compatible and safe for my children, then I am willing." Ravi Khatri, another parent, is also willing to vaccinate his children as he felt most people had taken a calculated risk and gone for the vaccine. "As far as the side-effects are concerned, this was also the case in adults' vaccination. I am willing to take the calculated risk of side-effects," he added. Even Sumit Kumar, a parent of two daughter studying at schools in Vasant Kunj, favoured it. "All of us got vaccinated, so why should we risk our children's life! Once they get vaccinated, we can send them to school without any fear," he pointed out. Another parent, who did not want to be named, however, would wait like many others. "Still studies are going on regarding the kids' vaccination and children have better immunity as compared to adults. I will wait for some more time before I get my children vaccinated."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-why-parents-in-delhi-are-in-two-minds-about-getting-their-kids-vaccinated/articleshow/87576201.cms||Shradha Chettri

Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) officials said that all the local clubs of Rabindra Sarobar have already been notified about the decision to keep the Sarobar gates shut from the intervening night of November 9 and November 10 till late afternoon of November 11. “The final notification in this regard is however yet to be published and is expected to be issued by Monday,” said a KMDA source. Both KMDA officials and the police are to conduct an inspection of the lakes on Monday to look into the security arrangements that are being set up, officials said. All the gates of Rabindra and Subhas Sarobar will have police patrolling. “Last year, the administration did a commendable job by not allowing Chhath on the Lake premises. I hope this year, too, the same measures and action will be taken,” said Sumita Banerjee, a lake crusader. Officials said that as for the alternative arrangements for Chhath Puja, devotees can perform the Puja rituals at 32 temporary ghats and seven permanent ghats. “The ghats were set up in water bodies off EM Bypass, at Golf Gardens, Patuli, Kasba, Nonadanga and other places. There will be police assistance booths and medical camps at all the ghats,” said a KMDA official, adding that around Rs 37 lakh has been spent for setting up the ghats and making alternative arrangements. Also, NDRF teams will be deployed at all locations to avoid any mishap. Officials said that at seven permanent ghats, the authorities were cleaning up the pond and have set up temporary gates along with lights, wash room, change room and bio-toilet facilities. At the temporary ghats, wooden platforms have been put up along with stairs, railings and view cutters with bamboo and clothes. The ponds will also be cleaned up for Chhath devotees. The administration managed to debar Chhath devotees from entering lake premises last year by making arrangements for alternative ghats. KMDA officials, the custodian of both Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar, said that last year’s protocols and security arrangements will be strictly adhered to at both the lakes. In 2018 National Green Tribunal had summarily dismissed Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar to keep the water pollution-free. But, the state had filed a review petition last year with an appeal to allow Chhath Puja to be observed at Sarobar and the matter went to the Supreme Court. The SC refused to grant a stay on the NGT order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-lakes-to-stay-shut-from-nov-10-morning-to-nov-11-late-afternoon/articleshow/87572995.cms||Suman Chakraborti

With World Health Organisation’s (WHO) emergency use listing for Covaxin going to lead to increased international travel, a senior aviation ministry official said “we are adding capacity depending on demand” for flights under air bubble agreements with various countries. International airfares have been very high during Covid — one-way fares to some destinations being higher than pre-pandemic return fares — and only increased capacity can lead to a lower fare, say airlines. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesForeign tourists will be allowed in from mid-November on non-charters and high fares will be an impediment in restarting inbound travel to India. The US is opening up for international travelers from Monday. “India has an open sky agreement with US (meaning no restriction on the number of flights Air India and US carriers can operate between the two places),” said the official. Before WHO-approved Covaxin, about 16 countries had accepted this vaccine for the purpose of allowing vaccinated travellers from India. Post WHO nod many countries, including UK and Canada, are evaluating Covaxin and could recognise it in coming days. UK — one of the biggest destinations for Indians — is expected to recognise Covaxin soon, say people in the know.

Delhi-based Dr Arvind Kumar, well known for his work during Covid times, told TOI: “Vaccines are medicines developed by scientists for the good of humanity. Their use should be above any political or geographical considerations. Denying the benefit of these vaccines as a means of restoring a semblance of normalcy in today’s pandemic-infested world, nullifies the great work being done by our scientists. This should be avoided. We in the fraternity look forward to a day when the world’s vaccine pool is used for the good of humanity without any bias.” A British High Commission spokesperson told TOI: “The UK will continue taking a phased approach to extending our vaccinated arrivals policy.

---||India||‘We the Women' move Supreme Court seeking infrastructure for abused women||NEW DELHI: An NGO 'We the Women of India" has moved the Supreme Court seeking to plug massive gaps in infrastructure under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act across the country for providing effective legal aid to females abused in matrimonial homes and creating shelter homes for them post lodging of complaints against husbands and inlaws. The unregistered organisation in its PIL, filed through advocate Shobha Gupta, said domestic violence continues to be the most common crime against females in India despite the DV Act coming into force more than 15 years back. "As per the National Crime Records Bureau) report for the year 2019, out of 4.05 lakh reported cases categorised under 'crimes against women', over 30% were domestic violence cases," it said. Terming this alarming figure as just the 'tip of the iceberg', the NGO said in general, Indian women refrain from complaining about the violence they routinely face at matrimonial homes in fear of loss of reputation of the family, the ensuing social stigma and also because of lack of awareness about the provisions of law and the remedies provided thereunder. Quoting National Family Health Survey, the PIL petitioner said "about 86% of the women victims of domestic violence never seek help, which means only 14% scout for help and a meagre 7% of them reach out to the relevant authorities under the DV Act." Making the Union government, all states and UTs parties in the PIL, the NGO requested the SC to direct all authorities, mandated to implement the DV Act in letter and spirit, for appointment of Protection Officers, enumeration of Service Providers (legal aid) and Shelter Homes as mandated under the law enacted to protect women from domestic violence. DV Act, 2005, which came into force in October 2006, provides for 'network assistance' to help women abused in matrimonial homes to seek advice, raise grievances, file complaints and pursue their remedies, including attending the magistrate's court. The Act also mandates the governments to set up shelter homes for those women who fear for their safety at matrimonial homes. The petitioner complained that most states sorely lack in providing these infrastructural assistance to women in distress. "Domestic violence is a societal issue and it requires dedicated awareness campaigns through various modes as was done through campaigns like 'Swacch Bharat', Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, injurious effects of tobacco etc," it said. The NGO said that most state websites do not list out protection officers, service providers and shelter homes, thus making it difficult for the distressed women to take protection under the DV Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/we-the-women-move-supreme-court-seeking-infrastructure-for-abused-women/articleshow/87576284.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Covid-19: US finally reopening borders after 20 months||WASHINGTON: The United States reopens its land and air borders Monday to foreign visitors fully vaccinated against Covid-19, ending 20 months of restrictions on travel from around the globe that separated families, hobbled tourism and strained diplomatic ties. The ban, imposed by former president Donald Trump in early 2020 and upheld by his successor Joe Biden, has been widely criticized and become emblematic of the upheavals caused by the pandemic. The restrictions were particularly unpopular in Europe and US neighbors Canada and Mexico. In an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, US borders were closed after March 2020 to travelers from large parts of the world, including the European Union, Britain and China, India and Brazil. Overland visitors from Mexico and Canada were also banned. The months of restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of people helped fuel both personal and economic suffering brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. "It's been so hard," Alison Henry, 63, told AFP. "I just want to see my son." The British woman plans to fly Monday to see her son in New York, after 20 months of separation. Families on both sides of the Atlantic are eager to finally reunite with their loved ones. Although travel from the United States to Europe has been possible since the summer, foreign US residents holding certain visas have had no guarantee of being able to reenter the country. To cope with surging demand, airlines have increased the number of transatlantic flights and plan to use larger planes, as they work their way out of the pandemic crisis. Along the border with Mexico, many cities in the US states of Texas and California have faced economic struggles due to anti-Covid trade restrictions. Meanwhile, Canadian seniors will be able to resume their annual car trips to Florida to escape the bitter northern winters. But the cost of the PCR tests Canada is requiring for cross-border travel -- up to $250 a pop -- can be prohibitive. Ann Patchett, an Ontario resident, told the Ottawa Citizen that it will cost $500 for her and her husband to go south to visit family. "Do you want to hug your children? Do you want to tuck your grandchildren into bed?... It's very frustrating," she said. New York congressman Brian Higgins, whose district touches the Canadian border and includes the US side of Niagara Falls, plans to hold a news conference Monday with mayors from both countries to urge Canada to drop its testing requirement. Lifting the travel ban will affect more than 30 countries. But entry into the United States will not be totally unregulated: US authorities plan to closely monitor travelers' vaccination status and will still require them to present negative Covid-19 tests. The United States, from Monday, will require air passengers to be fully vaccinated and be tested within three days before travel. Airlines will be required to put in place a contact tracing system. The land border opening will happen in two phases. Starting Monday, vaccines will be required for "non-essential" trips -- such as family visits or tourism -- although unvaccinated travelers will still be allowed into the country for "essential" trips, as they have been for the last year and a half. A second phase, beginning in early January, will require all visitors to be fully vaccinated to enter the United States by land, no matter the reason for their trip. US health authorities have said all vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization would be accepted for entry by air. At the moment, this includes the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Covaxin, Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The United States has not yet commented on the increase in Covid-19 cases in Europe. The WHO has expressed "grave concern" over the rising pace of infections in Europe, warning that the current trajectory could mean "another half a million Covid-19 deaths" by February. But speaking for the United States, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said Sunday on ABC that he's "cautiously optimistic about where we are," while adding: "We can't take our foot off the accelerator until we're at the finish line." But in Berlin, 51-year-old Elisabeth Zours is ready to hit the gas -- or as Mick Jagger would say, the "gas, gas, gas." A lifelong Rolling Stones fan, Zours had to miss a St. Louis show by the rock supergroup in September due to Covid-19 restrictions and was "frustrated" by the slow US reopening. Now she plans to make up for lost time. "I've got tickets for four (US) concerts," she said. "Their music," Zours added, "is like a good friend."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-us-finally-reopening-borders-after-20-months/articleshow/87576243.cms||---

In 2020, 31 people were prosecuted under this penal provision, which has a three-year prison term, if proved. Kolkata Police’s Bomb Disposal Squad will monitor the investigations of all these 92 cases from local police stations. Public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal said, “Ths section of the 9B (1) (2) of Explosives Act is slapped every time we find that there has been illegal stocking of firecrackers. This attracts a three-year term. In comparison, section 188 IPC, which is drawn up when a government order is violated, has lesser punishment, which can be for a few months and a fine of Rs 200.” The seizures of banned firecrackers, said sources, continued even on Sunday — the fifth successive day since Diwali. The total seizures have now gone up to 8,827 kg. “We have arrested a seller who was selling around 70 kg of fire crackers under Hare Street police station. He had come from Bongaon. And when we found four persons transporting 12 cartons of chocolate bombs at the Tarachand Dutta Street at Jorasanko, all of them hailing from Rajasthan, we instantly knew it was an organized racket and slapped the 9 (B) (1) (b) of the Explosives Act,” said an OC of a police station which has lodged three cases under the Explosives Act. In the past two years, complaints were reported at Shyampukur, Belghoria, Uttarpara, Lake Town, Golabari and Maheshtala. The police had detained at least 15 people. In none of the cases, the detained persons could be held back at the police stations for more than three hours, sources said. According to environmentalist Subhas Datta and others, the existing laws are inadequate to curb the bursting of firecrackers. “We have to run around so much to create awareness because our laws are weak,” a Sabuj Mancha representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-police-lodge-cases-against-92-under-explosives-act/articleshow/87576437.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

It has been illustrated by India-based guest artist Ibrahim Rayintakath. Ranadive is best known for her groundbreaking cancer research and devotion to creating a more equitable society through science and education. Kamal Samarath, better known as Kamal Ranadive, was born on this day in 1917 in Pune. Her father’s encouragement to pursue a medical education inspired Ranadive to excel academically, but she found her calling in biology instead. In 1949, she received a doctorate in cytology, the study of cells, while working as a researcher in the Indian Cancer Research Center (ICRC). After a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, she returned to Mumbai (then Bombay) and the ICRC, where she established the country’s first tissue culture laboratory. As the director of the ICRC and a pioneer in animal modeling of cancer development, Ranadive was among the first researchers in India to propose a link between breast cancer and heredity and to identify the links among cancers and certain viruses. Continuing this trailblazing work, Ranadive studied Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy, and aided in developing a vaccine. In 1973, Dr. Ranadive and 11 colleagues founded the Indian Women Scientists’ Association (IWSA) to support women in scientific fields. Ranadive fervently encouraged students and Indian scholars abroad to return to India and put their knowledge to work for their communities. After retiring in 1989, Dr. Ranadive worked in rural communities in Maharashtra, training women as healthcare workers and providing health and nutrition education. The IWSA now has 11 chapters in India and provides scholarships and childcare options for women in science. Dr. Ranadive’s dedication to health justice and education remains influential to her students who work as scientists today.

---||Kolkata||On last day, over 2,000 idols immersed at 8 major ghats, another 2k in ponds||Kolkata: With a majority of the city’s community Kali Puja idols being immersed at the ghats along the Hooghly on Sunday, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Kolkata Police had to struggle to ensure that the process remained smooth despite ramping up their infrastructure at the venues. Sunday being the last day of immersion, the KMC deployed extra manpower at major ghats to handle the additional pressure. Similarly, the police were extra vigilant trying to enforce Covid protocols at these ghats. According to a KMC parks and squares department official, since early afternoon there was a deluge of idols at some of the major ghats that include Bajekadamtolla (Babughat), Judges ghat, Mayer ghat (Bagbazar), Nimtolla ghat, Ahiritolla and Doighat (Kidderpore). By 7 pm, these major ghats recorded immersion of around 800 idols, said a civic official. Of them, Bajekadamtolla alone recorded immersion of 300 idols. However, the real challenge lay before the civic authorities and the cops later in the night when organizers of big-budget pujas started pouring into the ghats. “It was like a deluge of idols as darkness descended on immersion ghats. We had roped in extra porters for a smooth immersion process and check pollution of the river,” said a KMC parks and squares department senior official who was present at some of the ghats to oversee the immersion process. According to last report available from the immersion ghats, at least eight major ghats had recorded immersion of around 2,000 idols. The KMC had ramped up its infrastructure at ghats like Mayer ghat, Nimtolla ghat for Sunday for the big-ticket pujas like Phata Kestor puja at Keshab Sen Street and several others from Amherst Street, Beadon Street, Jorabagan, Kankurgachhi, Jorasanko, Burrabazar, Shyampukur, Hatibagan. Organizers of big-budget pujas from south and central Kolkata areas such as Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Chetla, Janbazar, Entally chose Bajekadamtolla ghat (Babughat) for immersion. This apart, several ponds in the Behala-Joka, Tollygunge-Behala belts and waterbodies along EM Bypass recorded around 1,800 idols by midnight. On the first day of immersion on Friday, around 1,000 idols were taken to different ghats along the Hooghly. Judges ghat and Bajekadamtolla ghat (Babughat) recorded the highest number of immersion. Several designated immersion ponds also recorded the presence of over 700 idols in Behala-Joka and Tollygunge-Jadavpur belts. But, Saturday recorded fewer immersions at the ghats along the Hooghly. Similarly, the ponds and waterbodies in Behala and Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt recorded negligible fewer immersions compared to Friday, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-last-day-over-2000-idols-immersed-at-8-major-ghats-another-2k-in-ponds/articleshow/87573006.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Fastest recovery of ambient air since ’18 Kali Puja-Diwali||Kolkata: The ban on conventional fireworks by the apex court has not gone entirely in vain. Two days after Diwali, the air quality index (AQI) in Kolkata appeared better than those of previous years. The extent of improvement in ambient air quality, experts felt, underlined significant reduction in lighting of fireworks in the city. The weather also played a significant role in dispersal of pollutants. “Our study reveals that this year, the spike in pollution was less compared to previous years and subsequent improvement of air quality was sharper. Despite fireworks in some parts of the city, overall reduction was significant. We are currently analysing the data to specify the trend,” said state Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra. In fact, a closer scrutiny of AQI since 2018 Diwali revealed that recovery of ambient air from the Diwali night pollution was the quickest and remained at the best possible state two days later. Even in 2020, when the Calcutta High Court had banned all categories of fireworks and people more or less complied with the order, the improvement after two days of Diwali was not that great. In 2020, Diwali was celebrated on November 14, but on November 17, the AQI stood at 170 at the Ballygunge Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS). But in 2021, two days after Diwali on November 7, AQI at the same station was 140. Across all the CAAQMS, the improvement of AQI in 2021 compared to even 2020 remained sharper. It must be factored in the analysis that Diwali happened quite late last year and thermal inversion was steeper reducing the vertical air movement. The general rejection of fireworks by majority of citizens was quite unmistakable. General secretary of Sabuj Mancha, Naba Dutta, who travelled across the city on Diwali night and ran a control room for receiving complaints, said, “People who are defying the apex court order are a miniscule minority. We need to identify them and treat them as miscreants as they are posing danger to public health.” Green crusader Subhas Datta felt that both the High Court and the apex court orders came a bit late, on the eve of the Diwali. “By the time orders came, people had stockpiled their stuff. However, the improvement was quite remarkable,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fastest-recovery-of-ambient-air-since-18-kali-puja-diwali/articleshow/87573000.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Major Tallah hurdle cleared, new bridge on track for May opening||Kolkata: A hurdle for the Rs 350 crore Tallah bridge reconstruction project is finally being cleared with Eastern Railway (ER) starting to shift its quarters that fell on the alignment of the ramp to link the new bridge with Cossipore Road. The north Kolkata lifeline is a road overbridge (ROB) under the ER’s ambit. The old bridge, which was a crucial link between Kolkata and the northern fringes, was pulled down last year because it had worn out beyond repair. Construction work for the ramp, as part of the new ROB, has been stuck for the last few months because of the 38 railway quarters that came in its way. ER officials said 12 families have been relocated in various railway quarters in the Chitpur area. “By November 15, the rest will be moved out and the entire staff quarters vacated for PWD to start its construction work,” an ER official said. The state public works department (PWD) is the implementing agency of the ROB reconstruction project. PWD needs the site to build a wider and longer ramp to connect Cossipore Road with the upcoming Tallah bridge for smooth movement of vehicles from Shyambazar to Dunlop. A narrow arm of the old Tallah bridge was used for movement of goods vehicles from Shyambazar to the Chitpur railway yard. Each time a loaded truck rolled along the two-lane structure, cars and buses on the old bridge came to a standstill. The new Tallah bridge, now in its last leg of construction, will address this crucial issue. A 240-metre section of the 750 m new bridge will stand over the Tallah tracks in the ER zone. ER needs the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) to give its approval to the crucial girder-launching across the railway tracks because the latter is the autonomous body under the ministry of civil aviation that must clear any new railway project across India. Since ER’s chief bridge engineer has already passed the design and drawings relating to the girder launching, PWD was expecting the girder-launching to start this month. Meanwhile, the agency is also in a hurry to complete the ramp. On October 8, PWD’s principal secretary, Onkar Singh Meena, and his department engineers met railway officials to facilitate shifting of the railway quarter occupants. The latter promised to complete the job in November to allow PWD to start the ramp construction by mid-December. “On September 15, we released Rs 11crore to ER for the staff quarter rehabilitation. Now that it has started, all hurdles for the project have been cleared,” a senior PWD official said. The new 9-m ramp will have a divided carriageway. Its construction will be done simultaneously with that of the main Tallah bridge, which is now chasing a May 2022 commissioning, officials said. “The CRS’s nod and subsequent launching of girders on the portion above the railway tracks should have started this month,” a PWD engineer said. “Post the girder-launching, the new bridge should take another seven months to be completed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/major-tallah-hurdle-cleared-new-bridge-on-track-for-may-opening/articleshow/87573012.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The eviction will be carried out on about 500 out of 1,410 hectares of encroached land of the forest on Monday and Tuesday. Acting on an order of the Gauhati high court, the state government will clear the 1,410 hectares of encroached land in a phased manner. Hojai deputy commissioner Anupam Choudhury told TOI that the situation in the area is normal at present and over 99% of the families have left after district administration counselled them to leave the place. “A total of 670 families had settled there and were engaged in cultivation. We have counselled the people for the last couple of days. Now, less than 1% of families are there, who too will leave the place by Monday,” Choudhury added. He said the settlers understood the order of the HC during counselling and left the place. “It is going to be a smooth eviction,” he added. On September 23, two civilians, including a 12-year-old child, were killed in police firing at Dholpur when the villagers attacked cops and district administration officials during eviction. Meanwhile, Hojai superintendent of police Barun Purkayastha told TOI that around 1,000 police and CRPF personnel have been deployed in Lumding reserve forest for three days from Sunday. “Deployment of police and CRPF personnel is a normal procedure. It is done to avoid any possible unwanted situation. However, the situation here in the forest is normal as maximum families have already left their occupied land,” he added. Witnesses stay away on day 1 of hearingInvestigators of the Dholpur incident in Assam’s Darrang district, where two civilians were killed in police firing during an eviction drive in September, held a public hearing on Sunday in Sipajhar to record statements of eyewitnesses or individuals and organisations on the incident, reports Mukut Das. The district development commissioner, Subhalaxmi Deka, who is the investigation officer, said no individual or organisation had gone to give a verbal statement or submitted a written statement on the incident before the authorities on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/1000-cops-crpf-jawans-deployed-for-another-assam-eviction/articleshow/87576783.cms||Mukut Das

The first two policies of Rs 5 lakh each were taken in the year 2003. In 2005, he took the third and fourth policies of Rs 12 lakh and Rs 4 lakh respectively. The total coverage under the four policies came to Rs 26 lakh. His father Vijay Pal Singh was the nominee in all the policies. Anil died in a road accident on July 31, 2006. His father Vijay lodged claims under the four policies, but not a single one was settled despite reminders and followup. So Vijay filed a complaint before the Uttar Pradesh consumer commission. LIC contested the case, stating that a thorough investigation was necessary as the claims were of high value. It agreed to settle claims of Rs 5 lakh each under the first two policies. However, two claims for the policies taken in 2005 were repudiated on the grounds that insurance coverage from HDFC Standard Life Insurance and TATA AIG Life Insurance were not disclosed while submitting the proposal form to LIC. The state commission partly allowed the complaint. Both Vijay, as well as LIC, appealed against the order. The national commission relied on the Supreme Court decision that insurance fraud would be determined on the basis of the definition under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act alone, and that the explanation under the Contract Act would be irrelevant.

Indian Air Force station Chakeri and its adjoining civilian pockets remain the Zika epicentre with all contracting the disease within 400m off the house of the first patient, a IAF warrant officer who tested positive on October 23. Meanwhile, one person was found to be infected in Kannauj district, which is first Zika virus case in the district, said chief medical officer Dr Vinod Kumar on Sunday. "A 45-year-old person has tested positive of Zika virus in Kapoorpur Katri village under Sadar tehsil of the district. Samples of 32 people were sent for testing, and one sample has come positive,” Kumar said, adding that as of now, the condition of the patient is stable, and he is being administered treatment at his home. The person who tested positive had recently travelled to Kanpur’s Shivrajpur area, official said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath expressed concern over rising Zika cases with his office tweeting that the infection is spreading rapidly in Kanpur and directed rapid testing and ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The district health department has intensified scanning and sample collection from Zika suspects in the Chakeri hinterland. On Saturday, 13 patients had tested positive for the disease. While confirming 10 more cases on Sunday, chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said, contact tracing teams were preparing reports on patients. “No patient is critical, but we are monitoring minor and pregnant patients round the clock,” he said. District Magistrate Visakh G Iyer said, health department officials have been ordered to conduct door-to-door sample collection for surveillance and virus testing. Also, the command and control centre of Kanpur Municipal Corporation was converted into Zika control room, he said. Expressing concern, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s office stated special caution was needed to curb Zika spread. “Testing should be intensified and hospitals should be geared up to treat patients. Health officials should ensure full cooperation of monitoring committees,” he stated. While reviewing the health infrastructure in hospitals, the district magistrate said, Zika patients would be called twice a day to ascertain their condition. Government hospitals have been put on high alert and the infectious disease control campaign has been intensified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-zika-count-89-yogi-adityanath-for-surveillance-rapid-sample-testing/articleshow/87577038.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
