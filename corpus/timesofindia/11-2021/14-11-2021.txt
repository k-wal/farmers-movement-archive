This is the first such move by the railways ticketing and catering subsidiary, IRCTC, which will ensure that the vegetarian food items provided by the agency and its vendors are certified. The IRCTC has collaborated with the Sattvik Council of India and trains to holy places will be “sattvik certified” and Vande Bharat will be the first such train. The newly launched theme-based train, Ramayan Express will also be another such certified train. “As such IRCTC serves only vegetarian food in the Vande Bharat train which runs between Delhi and Katra. The new initiative is only to ensure that people opting for vegetarian foods from us and our vendors can rest assured that it’s 100% vegetarian from the source to the table. There will also be an option for passengers to get Jain food,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. As per the plan, IRCTC base kitchens, executive lounges, budget hotels, food plazas, fast food units and platforms would also be Sattvik certified to ensure vegetarian-friendly travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coming-soon-certified-vegetarian-food-in-vande-bharat-trains/articleshow/87690576.cms||Dipak K Dash

Accompanied by his personal supporters of Anna movement and AAP volunteers, Naveen Jaihind started his procession of Bhole ki Baraat from a popular hotel of Panipat and led the procession to City police station of Panipat . After a brief questioning for some time, Jaihind was allowed to go back to his place, said Inspector Sunil Kumar, SHO of City police station. `` He was made to join the investigations.

SHO expressed inability to share the details of questioning of Naveen Jaihind. Meanwhile, interacting with media persons outside the police station, Jaihind maintained that he has been asked to go home after joining the probe. `` I had even asked him as if I am required to come in future or not. I had even offered to arrest. But, they have asked to go,’’ said Jaihind. Notably, Jaihind was booked under sections 420,467,471,120B, 183 and other sections of IPC when he had taken out the Kanwar yatra while wearing the trishul and barcha on his body.

In a press conference at BSF Punjab frontier headquarters here, she in the emerging national security threat, the challenges are becoming complex and complicated and drones have become one of the biggest challenges in the last two or three years. In this year so far, BSF troops had sighted 45 drones flying in from Pakistan side. The number of drones sighted in 2019 was 12 drones and 32 in 2020. The Punjab Frontier of the BSF is mandated to guard 553 km of the international border with Pakistan. IPS officer Mishra refused to say anything on the assembly resolution or the statements by Punjab CM and home minster. She said the increase in jurisdiction would only help to quick reaction from BSF whenever required and rest of the work would be done by Punjab Police as was the case so far. From the details given by her it appeared that BSF has been given some powers under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the first time. Since 1969, the force has powers of arrest, search and seizure under the Foreigners Act-1967, the Foreigners Act (Entry into India) Act-1920, the Customs Act, the NDPS Act and the Arms Act, up to 15 from the border. “Now, the central government has issued three notifications on October 11 under provisions of the CrPC, the Passport (Entry into India) Act-1920 and the Passport Act-1967, uniformly extending the jurisdiction of BSF within a belt of 50 km. The territorial jurisdiction of BSF under the NDPS Act-1985, the Arms Act-1959 and the Customs Act-1962 remain the same at 15 km as earlier in Punjab,” she said. “BSF has no policing powers. It does not have powers to register FIR or to carry out investigations. Any seizure or arrets have to be handed over to the state police or other law enforcement agency like NCB. The state police jurisdiction continues to be till border,” she said. About Pakistani drones, she said, their sighting started in 2019 and BSF troops could see and hear their noise and see their blinking lights. “Now, they fly at higher altitudes and sighting or hearing them is becoming difficult,” she said, adding, “anti-drone technological solutions are being worked out.” Asked to respond to Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s comment that if drones were able to fly across the border it was BSF failure, she said she would not respond to any statements but the force was not failing as they had been spotting drones and immediately informing police also. Punjab assembly had dubbed the Centre’s move of extending the BSF's jurisdiction as an “insult” to the state police. The resolution said the decision was an “expression of distrust” towards the state police and the people of Punjab. The Centre had last month amended the BSF Act to authorise the border guarding force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within 50 km from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Mishra said, “The Border Security Force is mandated to guard the border and our main role is to maintain the sanctity of the border, to create a sense of security among the border population and prevent trans-border crimes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bsf-to-compliment-and-assist-state-police-45-drones-sighted-in-this-year-says-bsf-punjab-frontier-ig/articleshow/87689744.cms||I P Singh

The value of the rupee is touching a record low. The BJP should not worry about 2024 (general elections) but answer people’s questions in 2022 (assembly elections),” the SP chief said while addressing people during his Vijay Rath Yatra near Koni Chauraha in the city. Yadav alleged that the BJP government is selling state’s institutes. “If the government sells all the institutes, the youth would be left with no jobs. Earlier, the BJP government was a ‘pheku sarkar’ (government that made false promises), but has now become a ‘bechu sarkar’ (government that sells),” Yadav said, claiming that the “BJP government is going and no one could stop it.” The SP chief also took up the issue of rising fuel prices. He claimed, “In three months, the profit of the oil companies went up 600 times. The BJP should tell people where the profit is going. It is burning a hole in the pocket of the poor and filling the pockets of the rich.” He also criticised the government for “not helping the labourers and the poor during the Covid-19 lockdown”. Speaking on farm laws, Akhilesh said, “The farmers are protesting for the last many months, but the government is not listening to them , instead it is crushing their protest. Protests are a way of making the government listen in a democracy, but this government is silencing their voice. It has insulted the farmers and will take their land.” The SP chief also ridiculed Chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “Baba ji (Yogi) laptop chalana nahi jante, isliye laptop nahin de rahe (He is not distributing laptops among the students because he can’t operate one himself),” Yadav said. Claiming of initiating various schemes during his government, Yadav said people of Gorakhpur are waiting to see development. “People of Azamgarh know who has done development work. Development has stopped in Gorakhpur during the BJP regime. Boats sailed on roads here. The BJP even deceived the Nishad community, the people who row boats. Now, the people of Gorakhpur will bring down the fever of arrogance of the BJP.” Watch Our support can turn the tables in UP polls 2022, says SBSP chief OP Rajbhar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-shouldnt-worry-about-2024-answer-peoples-queries-in-2022-says-akhilesh-yadav/articleshow/87689671.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Joint inspection of Panje wetland by Raigad officials and greens on Tuesday||NAVI MUMBAI: A joint inspection of Panje wetland will take place next Tuesday by the Raigad district officials and local citizen groups. The team will visit Panje in Uran to check and resolve certain pending issues such as the tidal choke points and a recent fire incident at the site. The Raigad district collector had recently stated to the National Green Tribunal that all the choke points and sluice gates at Panje have been reopened; but this has been contested by the greens. Hence, the joint inspection will also see if any choke points are still shut, and thereby try to resolve it. NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have been raising concern over the attempts to ``sabotage'' the wetland, rendering it dry to suit the needs of vested interests planning to convert the biodiversity property into a concrete jungle. ``It is important to protect the wetland not from an environmental point of view but from the safety angle of flights to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport,'' NatConnect informed the state chief minister, by quoting BNHS study reports. The revenue sub-divisional officer (SDO) Rahul Mundake said he would personally look into the environmental concerns and report to the district collector. “We appreciate this positive attitude, to carry out the joint inspection,” said NatConnect director BN Kumar and expressed the hope that this would lead to the protection and conservation of the wetland. Following NatConnect’s series of complaints to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the official team got into action with Raigad collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar asking his officials to check the ground realities. Some reportedly miscreants set fire to dry grass at the Panje Wetland earlier this week apparently to chase away hundreds of migratory birds. Earlier, two miscreants had exploded fire crackers making the birds fly helter-skelter. The forest department has served notices to concerned parties and the investigation is still incomplete. The culprits’ action was video-recorded from a distance. Kumar has requested Thackeray to scrap the lease deal done by Cidco allotting the wetland to Navi Mumbai SEZ and the CM asked the urban development to check this. “This is important to save the wetland as time is running out,” he said. Studies after studies by BNHS have clearly cautioned that the thousands of birds might fill up the skies if they miss their destinations - the wetlands that they are used to - and pose threat to the flights. NatConnect has also drawn the attention of the fresh fire incident to the High Court appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee. “These non-stop attempts to sabotage the wetland are alarming,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan. ``The authorities have been lethargic in implementing the Environment department’s orders, and also the NGT directive. This really a serious matter,” Pawar said. Recording the complaints from Shri Ekvira Aai Prartishtan and NatConnect Foundation, the collector has informed the NGT that now there is no blockage of water. The 70 sluice gates adjoining the wetland have also been lifted, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-joint-inspection-of-panje-wetland-by-raigad-officials-and-greens-on-tuesday/articleshow/87689635.cms||Vijay Singh
---||India||India strongly objects to coal and fossil fuel subsidies' phase-out references in Glasgow text as COP26 enters final hours||GLASGOW: As new draft text of the Glasgow (COP26) decision on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies created deep anguish among countries where fossil fuel use continues to be the mainstay of their economy and welfare measures, India on Saturday strongly opposed to the reference in the text asking the conference Presidency how can anyone expect that the developing countries make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they have still to deal with development agenda and poverty eradication. Highlighting gaps in issues of sections relating to finance and mitigation, the country said the Glasgow cover decision text lacks the balance and the consensus "remains elusive", saying those concerns must be addressed in the final decision -- hinting at a tough road ahead for compromise. "Fossil fuels and their use have enabled the path for the world to attain a high level of wealth and well being. The UNFCCC refers to the mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources. It has not been directed to any particular source. When we have taken the economy-wise targets, targeting any particular sector is uncalled for," said India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav. Yadav, while making an intervention during an informal stocktaking plenary by the UK COP26 president Alok Sharma, said, "Every country will arrive at 'net zero' as per their own national circumstances, strength and weaknesses. Developing countries have rights to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope". Underlining that the developing countries have to deal with their national development agenda and poverty eradication, the minister said the fossil fuel subsidies "provides much needed social security and support towards this end" and he cited India's example where the government under 'Ujjwala' scheme provides subsidised gas cylinders to poor households. He said, "We are giving subsidies to use LPG to low-income households. These subsidies have been a great help in almost eliminating biomass burning for cooking and improved health from the reduction in indoor air pollution." The minister's remarks come in view of a full paragraph on coal and fossil fuels in the text which the European Union and many other countries have been pitching for being included in the final decision. The text in the current form, released on Saturday morning after the Conference overstepped its schedule time of conclusion, calls upon countries "to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support towards a just transition." Though Yadav appreciated the COP26 presidency for making efforts to build consensus, he said, "I am afraid the consensus, however, remains elusive. India stands ready for constructive debate and equitable and just solution in this forum" and highlighted in his intervention the points on finance and the mitigation centric approach of the text. Clearly calling out affluent nations on their resistance to any monitoring mechanism on finance where they are supposed to contribute $100 billion per year for supporting developing countries, Yadav said, "Mitigation (emission cut) sections include annual minister-level roundtables, annual NDC synthesis reports and new long-term synthesis reports. It also requests for revisiting NDCs in 2022.. and work programmes for enhanced mitigation ambition in 2030 and so on. None of the same urgency in convening high-level meetings or commissioning annual reports or progress in meeting the financial needs is mentioned in the finance part." Referring to such references in the text, he said, "Covered decision should not overwrite or introduce extraneous elements in the Paris Agreement process that is already well established and agreed to. There is a well-defined cycle for the submission of NDCs. There is no need to deviate from it. We need to respect the (Paris) agreement and not overwrite it through the 'cover decisions' of the supreme bodies. These clear concerns in the cover decision must be addressed" The minister also narrated how India has been consistently focussing on clean power generation and energy efficiency and been not only aligned with those suggestions and references but also has taken initiatives such as International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the 'One Sun One World One Grid' (OSOWOG) initiative. "For the world, India proactively created ISA, CDRI (Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure) and OSOWOG initiatives as examples of international collaboration to combat climate change. We are walking the talk. We must see concrete action in this decisive decade and translation of commitment to action." He also said climate-friendly lifestyles and climate justice are enshrined in the Paris Agreement and these are the key to solving the climate crisis. Referring to the historical responsibility of affluent nations who emitted substantially in the past and indulged in overconsumption, Yadav said, "The (climate) crisis is caused by an unsustainable lifestyle and wasteful consumption pattern. The world needs to awaken to this reality."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-strongly-objects-to-coal-and-fossil-fuel-subsidies-phase-out-references-in-glasgow-text-as-cop26-enters-final-hours/articleshow/87690691.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Mehbooba asserted that the real Sanatan Dharma doesn't teach communalism and accused RSS-BJP combine of hijacking Hinduism and Hindutva, and making people fight against each other all over the country. “Those who make Hindus and Muslims fight in the name of religion can be compared with ISIS or any other (terror group) because both of them kill people in the name of religion," Mehbooba said. Referring to 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family, as taught by Hindu scriptures), she said: “Sanatan Dharma teaches us that the world is one family. What BJP and RSS are trying to teach us is neither Hindutva nor Hinduism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehbooba-mufti-backs-khurshids-hindutva-stance-in-new-book/articleshow/87690834.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Delhi||With COVID cases consistently low, the big fat wedding returns to NCR||From venues to caterers and bandwallahs, everyone says they have been double booked for the first time in two yearsEver since the pandemic hit, one of the major changes in our society has been the way we organise and approach weddings. Due to social distancing demands and restrictions on public gatherings, the big fat Indian weddings we were used to gave way to smaller, intimate dos, sometimes even at the houses of the groom or bride. This is all set to change this month. November 14-15 is the first saaya – the traditional auspicious date considered good for Hindu weddings – of this wedding season. Wedding industry insiders estimate that there will be over 20,000 weddings in Delhi-NCR alone over the two auspicious days, and a further one lakh over the next one month. This has finally brought some cheer to the beleaguered wedding industry in the capital. From venues to caterers and  bandwallahs, everyone says they have been double booked for the first time in two years. Manish Singh, who operates three wedding venues in Gurgaon, says, “The numbers of bookings are almost back to the same level as it was before the pandemic. Of course, with COVID-19 restrictions and protocols in place, our operating costs are a bit higher but it is still a welcome trend.” The increase in the number of weddings this season is also partly due to many people postponing their weddings earlier due to COVID-19. Akshay Rajput, a wedding planner, says, “In the last one-and-a-half year, a lot of people postponed their wedding due to lockdowns, restrictions and the second wave. They see this season as a good opportunity and don’t want to wait further. COVID-19 can be unpredictable, so people are taking advantage of cases being low right now.” Many, whose plans were on halt for months, have now decided to get married at the first available instance, which happens to be the first saaya. “Many people who had booked earlier in the year but cancelled when the second wave hit are also re-booking now. November14-15 this year is busier than some of the pre-pandemic years,” says Ranjit Kapoor, who looks after wedding decoration and catering services in multiple wedding venues in Gurgaon. Wedding Bands in NCR say they are fully bookedDuring all of last year and much of this year post the second wave, bands were absent in baraats because of rules and people’s unwillingness to spend on them for smaller weddings. But now, bands say they are fully booked for the season. Ashish Nassa of the Haryana Band Association says, “For November 14, many bands in Gurgaon have two-three bookings. This is very different from last year when we hardly had any work.” While there is still a cap on the number of guests at wedding functions in NCR, venue owners and wedding planners say the hosts are not limiting the scale of celebrations anymore. “It’s not as if there were no weddings last year but the numbers were down drastically. This year, even if people are limiting guest numbers, they are not compromising on the scale of the wedding. The bands are back for the baraats, even live music and other things are being requested,” says Ashish, a wedding planner. ‘This is the first time since the pandemic that an auspicious day has low COVID cases’The eleventh day after Diwali – known as the Dev Uthavani Ekadashi – is considered auspicious for weddings and other ceremonies, as per the Hindu calendar. It traditionally marks the beginning of the wedding season. This year, the date marks the first time in almost two years when such a saaya is coinciding with very few active cases and eased COVID-19 restrictions in Delhi-NCR. Sunil Singh, who operates wedding venues in south Delhi, tells us, “People in Delhi wait for saayas and mahurats. This is the first time since the pandemic that an auspicious day has relatively fewer active cases and very little restrictions. So, there is a huge rush for bookings. The first  saaya – November 14-15 – is particularly busy. Most people made their bookings months in advance.” Limits and guidelines for weddings in NCR Delhi: In October-end, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) increased the number of people allowed at weddings from 100 to 200.  Gurgaon: A gathering of only 50% of the venue capacity with a cap of gathering of 100 people in indoor spaces and 200 people in open area venues is allowed. This is for all social gatherings, including weddings. Noida: The cap is at 100 guests for both indoor and outdoor spaces. Many expect further relaxations from November 15 onwards.  In all three cities, venues have been asked to ensure sanitisation, thermal screening and adherence of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Most venues like lawns, banquet halls and farmhouses in the city say that they have made arrangements to comply with the administration’s guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-covid-cases-consistently-low-the-big-fat-wedding-returns-to-ncr/articleshow/87691255.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

The change from ‘phase-out’ to ‘phase-down was agreed upon during the last-minute change to build the consensus. India forced the Presidency to change the para by including points even on national circumstances in the para on coal and fossil fuel even as Switzerland and EU objected to it and then reluctantly agreed. Besides including a decision for the first time on accelerated ‘phasing down of unabated coal power and ‘phasing-out of “inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies in the final outcome, the Conference also agreed to further boost 2030 climate targets by next year and double adaptation finance by 2025.

Coupled with the “increasing inflow” of illegal Chinese-made weapons like AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns, anti-tank mines and grenades into Myanmar, which are also making their way to Indian insurgent groups with hideouts along the border, the ambush set alarms bells clanging in the Indian security establishment here.

Col Tripathi, his family and his quick-reaction team had gone in a convoy of four vehicles to his 46 Assam Rifles battalion’s forward operating base in the Behiang area, near the India-Myanmar border, on Friday. “There was also an event in a village in the area,” said another official. Col Tripathi’s convoy was ambushed while returning to the battalion headquarters at Khuga on Saturday morning. “Along with advance reconnaissance for the ambush, the insurgents must have kept a close watch on the convoy’s movement.

With the internal security situation improving in Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya and large parts of Assam over the last few years, the Army has gradually de-inducted over 14 infantry battalions, along with two division headquarters, from counter-insurgency operations to focus on the Line of Actual Control with China in the eastern sector. The counter-insurgency operations in these areas have been taken over by the Assam Rifles, which is under the Army’s operational control but administratively comes under the ministry of home affairs.

---||India||Army Colonel, his wife, son, 4 personnel killed in Manipur ambush||GUWAHATI: Militants of the banned People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Manipur Naga People’s Front (MNPF) on Saturday jointly carried out the deadliest ambush in the northeast in six years, killing an Army Colonel officiating as the commanding officer of 46 Assam Rifles, his wife and their six-year-old son along with four personnel of the paramilitary force near the India-Myanmar border in Churachandpur district. Col Viplav Tripathi’s convoy, comprising a quick-reaction team of the Assam Rifles, was passing by Sehken village in Singngat subdivision around 10.30am when an IED blast set them up for a volley of indiscriminate firing from the forested hillside that not only felled the Army officer from Chhattisgarh's Raigarh but also his wife Anuja and their son Abir. The four other Assam Rifles personnel killed in the ambush were identified as Suman Swargiari, Khatnei Konyak, RP Meena and Shyamal Das. Four personnel in the convoy were critically injured. "The blast was targeted at the CO’s vehicle and then the firing started. It was sudden and ferocious," a defence source said. PLA and MNPF issued a statement late in the evening claiming responsibility for the killings. The last such ambush on security forces in the militancy-ravaged region had also taken place in Manipur in 2015, when 18 soldiers were killed in Chandel district. Col Tripathi, on deputation from the Army's Kumaon Regiment, was returning along with his family to Churachandpur from a forward post at Behiang on the India-Myanmar border. He had attended a civic programme there on Friday. Behiang is about 120km from the state capital of Imphal. Churachandpur is the southern extension of the Manipur valley, with the ambush site having ample cover for the attackers to fire at the approaching convoy from camouflaged positions. The thinly populated area is mostly inhabited by the Zomi tribe. "Strongly condemn the attack on the Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur. I pay homage to those soldiers and family members who have been martyred today. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of sadness," PM Narendra Modi tweeted. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, took to Twitter to condemn the "cowardly attack" and term the deaths "extremely painful & condemnable". "The nation has lost 5 brave soldiers including CO 46 AR and two family members. My condolences to the bereaved families. The perpetrators will be brought to justice soon," he wrote. Sources said Col Tripathi’s convoy was possibly targeted because he had recently intensified patrolling of the area, making it harder for militants based in neighbouring Myanmar to move to and from the state. Another theory is that Manipur outfits are rattled by the state government's plan to develop the Imphal-Behiang road that is the state's link with Southeast Asia in preparation for a second border trading point like Moreh. According to the Assam Rifles, Col Tripathi had a successful stint in Mizoram before he was transferred to Manipur about four months ago. A defence source said Army Chief Gen M M Naravane had been briefed about the attack and operations launched in the area to trace the attackers. A close watch is being kept on the Myanmar border to prevent them from escaping into that country. The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force under the MHA, operates along the long porous India-Myanmar border in the hill ranges of Chandel, Ukhrul, and Churachandpur districts under the supervision of the inspector general (south), based in the Imphal headquarters. Manipur is due to go to the polls early next year. CM Biren Singh tweeted, "Strongly condemn the cowardly attack on a convoy of 46 AR which has reportedly killed few personnel including the CO & his family at CCpur today. The state forces & paramilitary are already on their job to track down the militants. The perpetrators will be brought to justice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-colonel-his-wife-son-4-personnel-killed-in-manipur-ambush/articleshow/87691512.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||India||Government concerned over crypto use for laundering, terror||NEW DELHI: The government is looking at “forward looking and progressive” regulation of cryptocurrency with government sources making it clear that an unregulated market for digital currency cannot be allowed to become avenues for money laundering and terror financing. Following a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, it emerged there was a strong view that attempts to mislead the youth through non-transparent advertising, that “over-promises”, needed to be stopped. While the government and the RBI have been discussing legislation for several months now, there has been a spurt in interest in cryptocurrency with many individuals, including senior citizens investing in private digital currencies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently maintained the need to ban private digital currency. The PM’s meeting comes in the backdrop of expectations that the government may soon pilot a Bill, something it had planned during the Budget session to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India”. Following the meeting, official sources said, the government will keep a close watch and take proactive steps as it was cognisant of the fact this is an evolving technology. While looking to engage with experts and other stakeholders, those who attended the meeting were also of the view that regulation will require global partnerships and collective strategies. The sources said that the PM held a comprehensive meeting on the way forward for cryptocurrency and related issues. This followed a consultative process as the RBI, finance ministry and the home ministry had carried out an elaborate exercise on the issues and consulted experts from across the country and the world. Global examples and best practices were also looked at. In 2019, the government had appointed an inter-ministerial panel headed by then economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg which had backed a ban on private cryptocurrencies. Since then there has been intense discussions on the issue while the sector has lobbied hard to prevent a complete ban. Earlier this year, the RBI had conveyed its decision to seek a ban on such instruments after having already expressed its serious concerns. While asserting that the technology of blockchain should be encouraged, the central bank has questioned the purpose of cryptocurrencies to be labelled as a currency. It has said that a currency is a sovereign right and cannot be assigned to any individual entity. The issue of these instruments being legal is also yet to be settled. Besides, there are concerns about volatility in their price apart from their impact on the economy. The central bank has also raised security risks linked to cryptocurrencies, saying it could give rise to money laundering and terror financing because of the anonymity of the transactions. The RBI has also pointed to the dangers to macroeconomic management if these instruments are allowed as they would pose “serious risks” to the financial system of the country. Earlier this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told a TV channel that not all windows for cryptocurrencies will be shut down and a cabinet note was being readied to formulate the next steps on the issue.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a high-level emergency meeting at Delhi secretariat on Saturday evening and announced a series of week-long measures to check the worsening air quality. All schools, colleges, and educational institutions will be closed for a week from Monday, all construction activities will be banned for three days from Sunday and all government offices, excluding those engaged in emergency services, will switch to work-from-home mode while private offices have also been advised to opt for work from home. The measures may be extended if the capital continues to be in an air emergency. While schools will be closed, virtual classes will continue so that the students do not suffer any further learning loss. Physical classes in schools had resumed only earlier this month after nearly a year-and-a-half due to the Covid pandemic. 'This is becoming a nightmare': Smog engulfs Delhi-NCR, pollution board issues advisoryAbout the possibility of Delhi going into another lockdown, CM said the government was working on a “lockdown proposal” but it would be implemented only after taking into account all the aspects of such an extreme step. “We are not imposing a lockdown at this moment, as assessing the impact of such a move first is paramount. We are drafting a proposal about this prospect and will place it in the court in the next hearing. This will be the most extreme step, if it is taken, so all agencies concerned will be consulted at length. The Centre, along with the CPCB and SAFAR, will be taken into confidence prior to such a decision. If a lockdown-like situation comes into place, then all vehicular, industrial and construction activity may be shut. This is still in the proposal stage and would be placed in front of the court first,” Kejriwal said.

The SC made the observations while hearing a case in this matter.

Virtual classes would continue for students in the meantime. This measure would particularly protect children from inhaling toxic air while outside the confines of their homes,” Kejriwal said, adding that the government wants to overcome the emergency-like situation that has fallen upon Delhi due to rising pollution. “Our goal at this moment is to protect this family of the two crore Delhi residents, especially our children, who need utmost care and prevention right now,” CM said. A view of the Supreme Court of India, shrouded in smog, in New Delhi on Saturday (Photo: PTI)CM said that a three-day construction ban was necessary because the weather forecast has indicated the situation during this period will be worse than the present situation. “Winds are not really being expected during the 14-17, and we all know that stubble burning pollution would, in any case, penetrate into Delhi, creating a fatal situation. Thus, we have taken the hard step of having to pull the plug on construction activities for now,” CM said. #Delhi | Air Quality Index (AQI) at 499 (overall) in the 'severe' category, as per SAFAR-India(Visuals from Conna… https://t.co/PsXooJHNkm— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1636788092000Kerjriwal said, “All Delhi government offices will function in a work-from-home manner for a week. All the government offices will be shut, but it is important to state that it is not a holiday. The entire workforce will continue to work remotely for this week. The officers will have to be available in the situation of an emergency call. An advisory on similar lines would be issued for the private offices to work from home as much as they can.” The CM stated that the pollution levels had significantly risen in the past few days. “The data clearly states that the air was not as polluted in Delhi before September 30 and was within the ‘satisfactory’ level, even on the bad days. Until then, the AQI was around 100, but since then, the AQI has been steeply rising. This is taking place primarily because farmers in our neighbouring states have been forced into a situation where they had to helplessly burn their stubble. However, the Delhi government does not intend to waste crucial time in this situation by entering into a blame game,” Kejriwal stated, adding that the sole motive of the Delhi government at this juncture was to overcome the air emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-schools-shut-for-a-week-construction-ban-for-3-days/articleshow/87691681.cms||Alok KN Mishra

These new jehadists are distinguished by their even more extreme ideology and apparently undermine the Taliban. A new report in Foreign Policy says the Islamic Invitation Alliance (IIA) has been funded by the ISI and was created in 2020, and has been on the radar of US intelligence for over a year. At the time, the idea was to ensure the Taliban’s victory. But now, this alliance is apparently being used to undermine the Taliban. Read AlsoIslamic State violence dents Taliban claims of safer AfghanistanThe Islamic State violence has fuelled fears that Afghanistan could collapse into anarchy and even return to a new phase of civil war, creating a haven for militant groups to launch attacks in neighbouring countries and the West.The intensification of internal factional fights within the Taliban may be coming to a head in the coming weeks as per assessment shared by the group of national security czars who were in Delhi this week for the NSAs’ dialogue.

In fact, the seriousness of the situation is believed to be much more grave than is being publicly reported or acknowledged.

Despite many of the participants remaining engaged with the Taliban, there is little trust in the regime at present. “There was a consensus that the Taliban would have to gain internal legitimacy first before external recognition,” said a participant. It's unlikely that would happen peacefully. There is an expectation of a power struggle between the Doha group led by Mullah Baradar and the more extreme Haqqani group — one perceived to be close to the US and the other considered to be close to Pakistan. The top concerns shared by the NSAs were first, refugee flows from Afghanistan, which could export the Taliban ideologies into their countries as well as rampant proliferation of weapons left behind after the US withdrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/isi-backing-small-jihadi-outfits-in-afghanistan-to-hinder-taliban-says-report/articleshow/87691765.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Four commandos suffered gunshot wounds. Sources said that Milind Teltumbde, a central committee (CC) member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) in charge of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh zones, had also been killed in the gunfight. Teltumbde was considered a pioneer of the concept of “urban Maoism”. Sources also claimed that divisional committee members (DVC) Shuklal Parcheki and Prabhakar of the Maoists’ Company No. 4 formation were among the ones slain. Between April 22 and 24, 2018, commandos had gunned down 37 Naxalites, including 19 women. Saturday’s encounter is the second-biggest in terms of slain Naxals. “The number could be higher and among those killed could be some women too,” Gadchiroli SP Ankit Goyal said. The CC is the apex body of the rebel movement in which Teltumbde occupied a top post as far as the Maoist movement in central India is concerned. Observers say Saturday’s encounter was a big blow to the three-decade-old Naxalite movement. Sources said Teltumbde was being escorted to the Maharashtra border by the Chhattisgarh-based Vistar “dalam” and was received by Korchi dalam members and Company No. 4. “There were at least 40-45 Naxalites camping at the site,” they added. Around 16 C60 teams cordoned off the camp. The commandos formed layers and attacked. Maoist sentries opened fire and the C60 retaliated. Outnumbered, the Maoists tried to flee into Chhattisgarh but were trapped as their escape routes had been plugged by the commandos. The injured jawans were first brought to Dhanora and then airlifted to Nagpur where they are being treated at a private hospital. “All four are stable but two jawans have critical injuries,” said Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute. Goyal said the bodies need to be identified “following standard operating procedures”. “We have heard that Teltumbde is dead but the information is yet to be confirmed as the jawans are yet to return,” he said. Once the bodies are brought to the district headquarters, surrendered Naxalites will be called in to identify the corpses. It is learnt that the encounter started at 6.30am and went on till 4.30pm. When it ended, the commandos launched search operations in the forest as the Maoists are known to take away their dead and injured to nearby villages. Sources said this could not continue for long as darkness had set in. Early reports said a large quantity of arms and ammunition was seized after the encounter, considered one of the longest in the history of the state’s fight against Maoist insurgency. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil congratulated the Gadchiroli police in a tweet. Naxal range DIG Sandip Patil, who is also in charge of state anti-Naxal operations, couldn’t go to Gadchiroli as the state government had rushed him to Amravati city to tackle the law and order situation that arose there on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/26-maoists-gunned-down-by-cops-in-10-hour-operation-near-maharashtra-chhattisgarh-border/articleshow/87691824.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Bengaluru||Hacker misled us, no bitcoins seized: Bengaluru cops||BENGALURU: Under fire for the way it has handled the alleged bitcoin scam, Bengaluru city police on Saturday admitted to being taken for a ride by hacker Srikrishna alias Sriki while recovering stolen bitcoins from him. The U-turn comes 11 months after joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil announced they had seized 31 bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore from Sriki, who had allegedly hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, online gaming sites and the state e-procurement portal. Patil had told media that “we opened a new account and transferred the 31 bitcoins to that account”. But on Saturday, the police said though a government order was obtained to transfer the bitcoins, they were not touched. “The account, claimed by accused Srikrishna as his, was actually a live wallet and he did not have a key to it.” Account opened for investigation: CopsSriki was first arrested by city police on November 18, 2020 in connection with a drug trafficking case. With opposition parties training their guns at chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as the hacking-related arrests and seizures happened when he was home minister, city police on Saturday issued a statement describing how they were outsmarted. The statement read: “Neither any bitcoins were transferred from the account of hacker Srikrishna nor any bitcoin was lost. For the purpose of investigation of cryptocurrency, it was felt necessary to open a bitcoin account. Accordingly, the government order (dated December 8, 2020) to open bitcoin account was obtained. During the process of identifying and seizure of bitcoins, accused Srikrishna showed a BTC (bitcoin) wallet, which contained 31.8 bitcoins. The wallet password was changed in the presence of cyber experts and government panchas (witnesses), and entire procedure was recorded under mahzer and submitted to the court. The court’s permission was obtained to use the password to transfer the said bitcoins to the police wallet account. On reaching the said wallet shown by the accused Srikrishna, it showed 186.811 bitcoins. Cyber experts opined the account, claimed by Srikrishna as his personal account, was actually a live wallet of an exchange and he did not have a private key for this. Hence, the said account was left untouched and, as a result, no bitcoins were transferred to police wallet.” ‘FSL tests showed no traces of drugs’ Countering Congress’ allegations that ‘mind-altering drugs’ were administered to Sriki, city police said he tested negative for drug consumption during the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) tests conducted during his custody with the Central Crime Branch in January. Sriki’s father had earlier approached the court with similar accusations and the Ist Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court had directed cops to conduct a test . The blood and urine samples were taken on January 13. The FSL dispatched the report on May 3, stating no drugs were found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hacker-misled-us-no-bitcoins-seized-cops/articleshow/87691877.cms||---

Tomatoes, which were available for Rs 30 per kg a fortnight ago, now cost Rs 80. Their supply to Bengaluru is from Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara and Chikkaballapur, but tomato-growing areas in these districts have been witnessing heavy rain. While the produce is beginning to rot on fields because of excess water, what has compounded the problem is non-availability of labourers to work during rain, farmers said. The retail price of beans has increased from Rs 40 a kg to Rs 80, while that of brinjal from Rs 30 a kg to Rs 90 in the past week. The likes of KR Market, Malleswaram, KR Puram, Yeshwantpur and Gandhi Bazaar are barely finding customers because of exorbitant prices. BL Shankarappa, president of APMC Varthakara Sangha, said, “We are getting only half the actual produce. This is the primary reason for increasing prices. This is usual during monsoon, but we have crossed that period. Frequent cyclones are affecting the market.” Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur, Tamil Nadu, Salem and Ballari are among the places from where Bengaluru gets most greens. Ramesh Babu, a vendor from Gandhi Bazaar, told TOI, “There are veggies in markets but we can’t purchase them because of high price. A quintal of tomato costs Rs 6,000, when earlier it was Rs 2,000.” With the impact of the pandemic reducing in recent times, weddings and festive occasions have become more frequent, and with it the purchase of bulk vegetables has gone up, said T Vanajakshi, a vegetable and flower vendor at Gandhi Bazaar. “When vegetables are purchased in large quantities, prices generally go up and the common man has to bear the brunt of that,” she said. Supriya Soman, a resident of Chickpet, said it is best to grow vegetables in one’s own terrace garden. “Growing vegetables in your home works out cheaper considering these fluctuating costs,” she felt. Malini Prathap of Malleswaram said she would wait for a week before going out to buy vegetables. “It is better to buy after a week rather than spending thousands of rupees now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rain-pushes-up-veggie-prices/articleshow/87691880.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Shrayana Bhattacharya, economist with the World Bank and an author with extensive work spread over 15 years to her credit, says love for an icon like Shah Rukh Khan was the common thread that inspired many to share with her their economic struggles, expectations from men, and strife with the patriarchal system when she tried to collect data on wages and women’s participation in the job market as a young research assistant.  Shrayana BhattacharyaBhattacharya said women across the country related to Khan in diverse ways – from looking at him as a masculine ideal, to providing escape and comfort from daily struggles. “The project was with agarbatti workers and I had designed a questionnaire. But when I asked questions, they stared blankly at me,” she recalls. Those women were in fact fighting for their labour rights and were aware of their realities, but did not want an outside researcher to come and tell them what they already knew. Keeping aside her formal questions, Bhattacharya slipped into a ‘survey recess’ and began chatting with them. Soon enough, their talks veered into a discussion on their favourite actors and a man most women seemed to adore – from rural Uttar Pradesh to the tribes of Jharkhand – Shah Rukh Khan. Suddenly, the tone changed, opening up conversations that revealed how even fandom is economic, she says. “The women told me how none of them had watched a film of Khan. They knew of him from snippets of his interviews, songs, etc. They neither had the money nor the leisure to watch his movie. According to the National Family Health Survey, only 8 percent of women in India watch a film every month,” she says, adding conversations around Khan offered a sneak peak at their economic struggles too. It also helped in finding paths to discuss the idea of masculinity and women’s idea of an ideal man. “Women in rural UP complained that men around them are like Salman Khan and they preferred Shah Rukh Khan,” Bhattacharya says, adding that in addition to the crisis of a job, women faced a crisis of love and they wished men in their lives spoke to them as Khan does. “The word that they kept repeating was ‘Tameez’ (mannered).” “When women step outside their home and do what society prefers them to not do, they face isolation. They are lonely in the workforce and also in the kitchen,” she says. India, along with South Korea and Pakistan, is in the bottom-five list globally in women getting help from men in doing household chores, she adds. Author Manu Pillai who was in conversation with Bhattacharaya at an event at Bangalore International Centre, says: “Women who manage to get out of home, work and occupy space in economic areas juggle dignity, deadlines and dishes.” Khan’s imagery of helping women in the kitchen or even his wife off screen makes him widely popular, he adds. Bhattacharya is sure that for the current generation the Shah Rukh-equivalent would be a woman. “They no longer want a Shah Rukh in their lives. They want to be him with his opportunities, earning capacity and potential. Increasingly, the women today look at a Priyanka Chopra or a Deepika Padukone,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/srkwomens-quest-for-independence-escape-from-patriarchy/articleshow/87691882.cms||Farheen Hussain

---||Bengaluru||‘Ward panels must handle more than basic issues’||Bengaluru: Lalitha Mohan from Radhakrishna Temple ward is disappointed that ward committee meetings have become grievance-redressal platforms. “They are used for firefighting basic issues. Things need to move to the next level. Awareness about ward committees is limited to WhatsApp groups now,” she said.Lalitha was one of 400 citizens who attended a Janaagraha workshop on Saturday and shared their views on ward committee meetings held in the city.Wards are supposed to conduct two meetings a month (on the first and third Saturdays) at 10am at the ward committee office. Over 4,219 meetings were held across 198 wards in the past year. Janaagraha, a city-based NGO, had undertaken a study to evaluate how Bengaluru’s ward committees performed between August 1, 2020, and September 4, 2021. The key insights were revealed at the workshop. (See box)Kochu Shankar from Ramamurthy Nagar said in his ward, the meetings were mainly for grievance redressal in pre-pandemic times. But after that, the meetings helped citizens bond and communicate with BBMP. “The bonding got better with vaccination drives, humanitarian assistance and other problem-solving activities,” Shankar said.However, Savita from RR Nagar said their meetings were not even good enough for grievance redressal. At the beginning, they were at least compulsory but now the problems remain unsolved, she said.Ramamani, deputy commissioner (IT), BBMP, and nodal officer of Gottigere ward, credited the active participation of resident welfare associations and citizen groups for making ward committee meetings effective. She said meetings should be held regularly and before each one, an agenda should be drawn up.Thulasi Maddineni, special commissioner (finance), said, “BBMP allotted Rs 60 lakh to each ward committee in Bengaluru. This is not a big amount, but it is a start. If we see success, we can work towards increasing funds,” Maddineni said, adding that the money is for three core areas – fixing potholes, borewells and footpaths. “Janaagraha has conducted a walkability index and we are working towards repairing footpaths. I request all citizens to partake in ward committee meetings,” Maddineni said.Srinivas Alavilli, head of civic participation at Janaagraha, said to revive non-functional ward committees, likeminded citizens and civic groups must be identified, groups on WhatsApp formed for interaction and social media activity increased, while citizens should meet nodal officers in groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ward-panels-must-handle-more-than-basic-issues/articleshow/87691889.cms||---

The theft occurred on October 3 when the complainant, P Aravind of Lingadeeranahalli, a businessman, had gone out with his family. “We found that one of the keys of the front door had gone missing a few months ago. Yogesh had frequented Aravind’s house during that period. We caught Yogesh on CCTV footage of a neighbouring area.

The accused, Aryan Khan, is from Sakleshpur and lives in Kattigenahalli, near Yelahanka. KG Halli police said they detained Khan when he was trying to sell antiques behind the BDA Complex at KG Halli. Among the seized items were an elephant paw, a book, milk jug, teapot, Bhutanese showpiece, Irish tea maker, sugar pot, small milk jug, German silver scoop, two German silver ashtrays, five mustard trays, two small machetes, two African wooden spoons, and spoons made of animal bone. Khan told police he used to work for an Anglo-Indian family earlier settled in Sakleshpur. When the head of the family died, his wife moved to Bengaluru as her daughter was settled in England. Khan and his family also shifted to the city. According to Khan, the elderly woman went to England last year and gave the antique items to him before she left. Renowned taxidermist Edwin Joubert Van Ingen had given them to her as a gift in 1934, she had said. Khan’s claimed the elderly woman died in England during the second wave of Covid-19. “I realised I could make a lot of money by selling the items. I needed the money for the medical expenses of my nephew and for paying house rent and clearing loans,” Khan told police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-arrested-with-antiques-worth-1-crore/articleshow/87691892.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bitcoin scam gets murkier, Congress demands SC-monitored SIT probe||BENGALURU: Continuing its tirade against the ruling BJP, the Congress on Saturday alleged attempts to cover up the alleged bitcoin scam and sought an independent probe by the Supreme Court-monitored special investigation team (SIT). “The scam has international ramifications as several bitcoin exchanges across many parts of the world were allegedly hacked. The state police are not equipped to investigate such a case. Only an SIT probe monitored by an SC sitting judge involving Interpol agencies will reveal the truth,” Congress general secretary Karnataka in-charge Randeep Surjewala said in Delhi. He alleged that Sri Krishna was involved in the alleged hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges and websites that include Bitfinex, registered in a noted tax haven, the British Virgin Islands, and reports suggest that it was hacked on August 2, 2016, and 1,20,000 bitcoins were stolen. “In his voluntary statement, he admits to having taken 2,000 bitcoins. Sriki was arrested in November and released on bail on April 17. But the Interpol wing of CBI was informed 10 days after his release. Why did police remain silent for five months after the arrest? Why were NIA, ED and SFIO not involved? What was the role of Basavaraj Bommai since he was the home minister between August 20, 2019, and July 28, 2021?” he asked. Quoting Whale Alerts (a twitter account that tracks largescale cryptocurrency transactions), he said on December 1, 2020 and on April 14, 2021, the stolen bitcoins worth Rs 5,200 crore were transferred to another account. “There is a need to verify these transactions since Sriki was in the custody of Bengaluru police during this period. Only on April 24, 2021, more than five months after the initial arrest, did the commissioner of police, Bengaluru, write to the Interpol Liaison Officer (CBI),” Surjewala alleged. Surjewala also claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi was told by the FBI about the hacking and sought a probe during his recent visit to the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bitcoin-scam-gets-murkier-cong-demands-sc-monitored-sit-probe/articleshow/87691894.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Money bags set to rule the roost in MLC polls||BENGALURU: Political parties are facing a dearth of potential candidates for the legislative council polls from local bodies as many are hesitating to enter the fray owing to the growing poll expenditure. Elected members of local bodies across the state, barring zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat whose tenure expired in June, will vote to elect 25 MLCs from 31 districts on December 10. A common complaint is that electioneering has become too expensive, with voters expecting huge amounts of money, costly gifts and liquor parties from the candidates. The functionaries in-charge of poll campaigns said the tough competition among parties to lure voters has resulted in the rising demand and there are constituencies where candidates have to shell out a whopping Rs 1.25 lakh per vote. Each district on average has 4,000 voters, of which members of gram panchayats, who technically have no political affiliation, form a major chunk. For instance, there are 3,385 members across 250 gram panchayats in Hassan district and 196 cumulatively from other local bodies, including corporations, city municipal councils and town panchayats. “Many competent candidates are refraining from contesting elections because they cannot spend so much money and this is why we can’t expect people like MC Nanaiah (former MLC known for his oratorial skills) in the upper house in future,” said senior BJP MLC Lahar Singh Siroya. “What’s most disheartening is that the voters seeking money are elected representatives themselves.” He said major political parties should sit together to find a solution to this problem, adding that a few like-minded legislators have already started reaching out to BJP, Congress and JD (S) functionaries. The MLC polls are significant for the ruling BJP since they need to win 12 of the 25 seats to gain a majority in the upper house. Sources said senior MLCs from Congress, including N Narayanaswamy, C Raghu Achar and Gopalaswamy, have already made it clear that they don’t want to be part of the MLC elections since they are exploring the option of contesting assembly polls in 2023. “The kind of resources we spend in MLC elections are not worth it compared to the privileges we get. We can serve people better if we become members of the assembly since we will have more say in the administration,” said Raghu Achar, who is seeking the Congress ticket from Chitradurga assembly seat. BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath said the demand of voters is growing in terms of development as well, and MLCs with limited resources will find it difficult to fulfil them. “A solution to this is to increase the area development fund allocated to an MLC from Rs 2 crore to Rs 5 crore on the lines of MP grants,” said Kavatagimath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/money-bags-set-to-rule-the-roost-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87691895.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: ZP-TP members can’t vote in council elections||BENGALURU: For the first time, members of zilla and taluk panchayats will not vote in the December 10 legislative council elections to 25 seats. Reason: There are no elected representatives in 229 taluk and 30 zilla panchayats. All members of rural and urban local bodies are voters in these elections. Thanks to the government’s decision to set up a delimitation commission to redraw boundaries of wards of zilla and taluk panchayats, the power earlier was with the state election commission . By not holding taluk and zilla panchayat elections, around 5,000 elected representatives have been denied voting rights. The panchayat and urban local bodies elections are not being conducted on time for the past few years owing to political reasons. The tenure of the sitting members of zilla and taluk panchayats got over in May 2021 but owing to the pandemic, the election commission deferred the elections till September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/zp-tp-members-cant-vote-in-council-elections/articleshow/87691897.cms||---

However, a division bench comprising chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted the legislature by bringing in an amendment to rule 5 of the Karnataka Planning Authority Rules-1965, intended to include persons even from the field of social work. “Therefore, the appointment is at the government’s pleasure. Even otherwise, the material on record indicates the jurisdictional tahsildar and also experts of the authority have recommended to consider respondent no. 3 (Ravi) for the post,” the bench added, while pointing out as per records, the petitioner is a local resident and a social worker, fulfilling the required criteria.‘Close relative of min’The petitioner had contended that Ravi is a close relative of revenue minister R Ashoka and that the latter and SR Vishwanath, MLA and political secretary to the then chief minister had recommended his name. According to him, the appointment runs contrary to the procedure contemplated under the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act-1961. Also, Ravi does not possess the qualifications as contemplated under rule 5 of the Karnataka Planning Authority Rules-1965 and changed his residential address prior to the appointment, he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-planning-authority-chiefs-appointment-is-at-govts-pleasure/articleshow/87691898.cms||---

Citing the findings, experts have also ruled out any possibility of reducing the gap between two shots of Covishield. The findings will soon be submitted to the health ministry for further consideration for policy making, an official source said. “We have been reviewing the data on a regular basis and now since large scale data of vaccinated people is available, we have studied that too. Any decision will be driven by these scientific facts,” the source said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel memberDr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. ItAccording to the source, there is “no question of reducing the gap because the data shows that the immune response has improved with a gap of three months between two doses of Covishield”. Of the total more than 112 crore doses of Covid vaccine administered in the country so far, 88% are Covishield, a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZencea. The vaccine is manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India. India is currently administering the second dose of Covishield at 12-16 weeks gap. While more than 79% of the eligible adult population has received at least the first dose of a Covid vaccine, around 39% are fully vaccinated with two doses. Read Also5 reasons why India should allow a booster doseWith much of the population still waiting for the second Covid vaccine shot, should India be thinking of booster doses? It may make sense, at least for healthcare workers and others on the frontlines of the battle against the pandemicWhile there are around 12 crore people overdue for a second dose, a major reason for the slow progress of second-dose coverage is also the long gap between two jabs of Covishield, which constitutes the majority of vaccination. As the majority of eligible population is now covered with the first dose of the vaccines and there is also adequate stock, some states, as well as public health experts, have written to the Centre asking it to reduce the gap so that people have increased protection with two doses of Covishield. However, the government has maintained that any such decision will be driven by scientific recommendations from experts evaluating the same. Assessment of the sero-prevalence data also underlines no immediate requirement for booster dose, rather full vaccination is essential for long-lasting immunity, the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/extended-covishield-dosage-gap-more-potent-show-studies/articleshow/87691908.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Proposed after 26/11, India to finally get maritime coordinator||NEW DELHI: India will now finally have a national maritime security coordinator (NMSC) to ensure effective coordination and cohesive policy-making among the disparate central and state authorities dealing with maritime affairs from the coastline to the high seas. The Cabinet Committee on Security has approved the post of the NMSC, who will also act as the interface between military and civilian agencies to strengthen the country’s maritime security, energy and ‘blue economy’ needs, sources said on Saturday. A retired or serving Vice Admiral of the Navy (equivalent to a Lt-General in the Army) is likely to be appointed to the post. The NMSC will work in the National Security Council Secretariat and report to national security adviser Ajit Doval. TOI had in April reported that the government was working towards creating an apex federal body, the National Maritime Commission (NMC), and the post of the NMSC. While the NMC “is still a work in progress”, the NMSC post has now become a reality. “It’s a long overdue reform. The NMSC’s charter of duties will soon be notified,” said a source. “The basic charter will be ensuring coordination among the multiple authorities largely working in silos, and often at cross-purposes. They range from central ministries and departments (external affairs, defence, home, shipping, fisheries etc) and state governments to the Navy, Coast Guard, customs, intelligence agencies and port authorities. He will also look at some technology aspects,” he added. The urgent need for an effective federal maritime mechanism has been repeatedly stressed over the years. The 2001 Group of Ministers’ report on reforming the national security system after the Kargil conflict, for instance, underlined the need for “an apex body for management of maritime affairs for institutionalised linkages among the Navy, Coast Guard and ministries of central and state governments”. After the deadly 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, which exposed the lack of “critical connectivity”' between intelligence agencies and security forces, the creation of a maritime security advisory board (MSAB) with a maritime security adviser as its chief had also figured on the CCS agenda. But it could not take off due to turf wars and general politico-bureaucratic apathy. India has a long 7,516-km coastline including island territories and a two million sq km exclusive economic zone. “Moreover, with 90% of our trade by volume and 70% by value transiting through the seas, India is also looking at securing its ‘blue economy’ activities in the years ahead,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/proposed-after-26/11-india-to-finally-get-maritime-coordinator/articleshow/87691943.cms||Rajat Pandit

The deceased jawan, Rfn Rajendra Prasad Meena, hailed from Dilawarpur village in Dausa district. He has left behind his wife and two children.

---||Visakhapatnam||‘Is the kothimeera loaded?’ Code words run marijuana trade in Vizag Agency||VISAKHAPATNAM: An ever-changing lexicon of words is in use among ganja peddlers who procure and transport the weed from tribal pockets of Visakhapatnam district and the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB). Codenamed ‘kothimeera’ (coriander leaves), peddlers also shift between other names in a bid to throw enforcement agencies off track. In the more remote areas of Vizag Agency and AOB, code words such as ‘cereals,’ ‘millets’, ‘beans’, ‘rajma’, ‘chans’, ‘chawal’, and ‘turmeric’ are in vogue. Recently, peddlers have started using ‘dhaniya patta’ or ‘kothimeera’ (coriander leaves) to refer to ganja. Citing an example, officials of enforcement agencies say that if a peddler wants to know whether the ganja has been procured, he would ask, “Kothimeera loaded or not?”. Similarly, they would use the code word ‘cabbage’, instead of ganja, to know the status of a delivery of cannabis. In a few instances, drug peddlers have used also ‘grass’ as a code word. Apart from changing the vocabulary for the green drug, peddlers, particularly interstate smugglers, change their modus operandi from time to time in order to transport the weed from the hilly areas to various parts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, New Delhi, Kerala, as well as other parts of the country. But ganja cultivation and smuggling are not new to the Vizag Agency or along the AOB. Tonnes of dry ganja have been seized by enforcement officials in the past. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg, claim activists, pointing out that a majority of cases go undetected as the smugglers adopt new strategies to transport the contraband from the Agency. “As parts of Vizag Agency and AOB also grow a variety of green plants, cabbage, ginger and other vegetables, the ganja is kept hidden in goods vehicles along with sacks of fresh vegetables. Smugglers prefer some specific days for transportation of the weed, especially on the days of the weekly market (shandies) to give the impression to enforcement officials that the vehicle is transporting fresh vegetables,” said K Raja Rao, a resident of Vizag Agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/is-the-kothimeera-loaded-code-words-run-agencys-marijuana-trade/articleshow/87690160.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh to raise power dues from Telangana issue at zonal meeting||VISAKHAPATNAM: The AP government will apprise Union home minister Amit Shah of the outstanding dues to the tune of Rs 6,015 crore from Telangana power utilities during the 29th southern zonal council meeting in Tirupati on Sunday. It will also request the Union government to prevail on Telangana and facilitate payment of arrears to APGenco at the earliest. The state government also plans to pitch its proposal to the Centre to alternatively direct Telangana to include the generator dues to APGenco under tranche II loan of Atma Nirbhar scheme that is being availed by Telangana discoms. According to energy department sources, the Rs 6,015 crore outstanding is for electricity supplied to Telangana following the bifurcation of the state, up to June 10, 2017. As power generation in Telangana was not enough to meet the demand at the time of bifurcation, APGenco had supplied the deficit power to Telangana discoms. APGenco distributed 8,890 million units from June 2, 2014 to June 10, 2017 to Telangana as per AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. For the same, an undisputed due of Rs 3,441 crore and Rs 2,841 crore towards late payment surcharge, which is the cost of power supplied during that period, have remained unpaid. The two states agreed on payment of these dues on different occasions, including at a joint meeting between the power utilities of both states on August 19, 2019. The issue was also raked up during the meeting of chief secretaries of the two Telugu states on January 30, 2020. But the dues have remained unpaid. “It can be seen that such huge receivables turning into bad debts will not only affect the financial viability of APGenco, but will also have serious implications for the lenders — Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). Since the above power was supplied as per the directions of the Union government, it is requested that the dues receivable may be liquidated and paid to REC and PFC,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-raise-power-dues-from-t-issue-at-zonal-meeting/articleshow/87690179.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Raids are on to nab the assailants,” Purnia SP Daya Shankar told this reporter on Saturday. Sources said Rintu was also the deputy district president of the Congress. He was planning to contest the 2025 assembly election from Dhamdaha. An attempt on his life was made ten days ago, but he had escaped unhurt. An FIR was lodged against a hardcore criminal with the Sarsi police station in this connection, but he was not arrested. This region is infamous for political killings in the past several years. Meanwhile, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lashed out at the state police over the murder. The RJD leader said Rintu had lodged a written complaint to the police alleging that he had threat from the nephew of Bihar minister Lesi Singh. Calling the state police as JD(U) police, Tejashwi tweeted that in spite of a written complaint lodged by Rintu, police failed to react.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-zila-parishad-member-shot-dead-in-purnia-district/articleshow/87689634.cms||---

The authorities have initiated the process to engage an agency to take up the project. An estimated Rs 9.1 crore has been pegged for the proposed project which the selected agency will need to complete within 120 days or four months. NKDA officials said the project has been planned to further develop the use of solar energy in New Town. “Urban land has become costlier to install solar panels. Previously, we had installed solar panels and set up floating solar plants on water bodies and stress has been given on installing rooftop solar panels. Now we are exploring if the pavements could be used,” said an NKDA official. Officials said the plan is to use a small portion of the pavement to install solar paver blocks on the sides. “The technology is seen in many places abroad. Solar panels will be integrated with the paver blocks and will be covered with a kind of toughened glass that will not get damaged if one steps on it,” said an official. “The stretch in front of Rabindra Tirtha is one of the busiest intersections. The plan is to have a few EV charging units which will be integrated with the solar paver blocks for easy availability on the main arterial road,” an official said. NKDA has developed a 400m service road from Swapno Bhor park to New Town mela ground with internet hot spots, solar benches, solar trees, water ATMs and plastic-laid road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-plans-smart-footpath-with-solar-paver-blocks/articleshow/87690605.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Footfall may rise after dip in liquor prices||KOLKATA: Leading bar-cum-restaurants in the city are gearing up to change its menu card, trying to make it more pocket-friendly for customers following the news of a slash in liquor prices next week.  Liquor, for long, has been a major sales component for all bar-cum-restaurants in the city. In some cases, liquor constitutes more than 80% of the earning mix. According to Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar, liquor constitutes 55%-60% of sales of bars. “In case of my MS Bar and Lounge, almost 60% is liquor sales,” he said. “If there is a fall in liquor price, we shall pass on the benefit to customers. It will boost footfalls and there will be a positive impact on food sales as well,” he added. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city and its outskirts with a combined revenue of Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 crore annually. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata alone had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic. It employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone. Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu? owner Nitin Kothari also believes it will have a major impact for bars-cum-restaurants. “It will be win-win for all customers, government and the industry. For us, almost 80% is food and the rest is liquor but even then, liquor price slash will have a positive impact on us,” he said. Speciality Restaurants chairman Anjan Chatterjee welcomed the state government move. “It will be more pocket-friendly and we shall pass on the benefit in due time,” he said. T S Walia, the former national president of FHRAI and director of Xrong Place and Walson, agreed. “It is the peak season, so this price slash will have a real impact,” he said. Chapter 2 MD Debaditya Chowdhury was happy with the development. “We will surely pass on a part of this percentage to the customers as discounts. And further, we are looking forward to increase our liquor sales as well,” he said. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, and Rahul Khanna of Go Where in Sector V also decided to pass on the benefit. “Our selling price will come down,” Rozario said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-may-rise-after-dip-in-liquor-prices/articleshow/87690612.cms||---
---||Patna||Senior cops plan strategy to check liquor smuggling||PATNA: The hooch tragedies reportedly claiming over 40 lives in Gopalganj, West Champaran, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur since Diwali eve have put the state police and excise department on their toes as CM Nitish Kumar is scheduled to chair a high-level review meeting on Tuesday to make prohibition law more effective in the state. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad and DGP Sanjeev Kumar Singhal have held a series of high-level meetings with the DMs, SSP, SPs and public prosecutors via videoconferencing in the last few days, including the one at the state police headquarters on Friday. Prasad told TOI over phone on Saturday that directions have been given to arrest the accused and liquor smugglers from other states, increase conviction rate in courts and intensify raids in border areas. “We will have a meeting on the issue even on Sunday,” he said. A senior IPS officer said the figures were being compiled to present a clear picture of prohibition before the CM during his review meeting. A home department officer said the focus was now on intercepting trucks and vehicles carrying IMLF from outside the state. “Earlier, 65% of IMLF was smuggled through Uttar Pradesh border. Now, the situation has changed,” he said. The focus is also on country liquor manufacturing and smuggling as it is unorganised. “Micro-level action is required. Liquor seizure and arrests made this year are almost 1.5 times more than last year,” he said. At a meeting held by ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar and ADG (law and order) Vinay Kumar on Friday, the field officers were directed to conduct targeted raids and arrest repeat offenders. “The example of Gopalganj hooch incident was cited as the main accused was a repeat offender and had already been to jail twice in liquor smuggling cases,” a senior IPS officer said, adding installing GPS in police vehicles and landline phones in police stations were the other issues which were discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/senior-cops-plan-strategy-to-check-liquor-smuggling/articleshow/87689538.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The incident took place when the puja committee members insisted on taking out a procession before immersing the idol in a local pond. The police opposed it on the ground that no prior permission was sought by them for that. The police lodged an FIR against 20 named and 25 unknown persons and arrested Om Praksh Choudhary and Mithilesh Choudhary of Aayar village in this connection. Later, the villagers gheraoed the Aayar police station demanding immediate release of the arrested persons. They alleged high-handedness by the SHO and the local police. “The villagers perform Chhath puja at a local pond situated just behind Aayar police station. The SHO had cooperated with the committee members in the arrangements. They had installed an idol of Sun God. When the SHO asked them to seek permission and get a licence as is required by the law, they promised to immerse the idol in the pond itself without taking out any procession. But at around 11:30am on Friday, they took out a procession with loudspeakers blaring,” Jagdishpur SDPO Shyam Kishore Ranjan told this newspaper. “When the police tried to reason with the agitators, they turned violent and attacked the police with ‘dandas’ in which one jamadar and two constables sustained minor injuries,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-bhojpur-cops-injured-in-clash-with-puja-committee-members/articleshow/87689579.cms||---
---||Patna||Chirag to CM: Fix accountability for lapses in enforcing prohibition||PATNA: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Saturday urged CM Nitish Kumar to fix the accountability of the officers for their failure to check liquor smuggling in ‘dry’ Bihar. He demanded Rs25 lakh compensation and a government job to a family member of each victim of the hooch tragedies in the state. Talking to reporters after his return from Gopalganj, Bettiah and Muzaffarpur where more than 40 people died after consuming spurious liquor recently, Chirag said he was in favour of the prohibition, but the law should be enforced strictly. Referring to CM Nitish’s proposed November 16 meeting on the prohibition-related action, the LJP (Ram Vilas) chief said those who died in hooch incidents were the earning members of their families belonging to the lower strata of the society. The CM should extend the disbursement of free ration to the poor for the next six months. “We have written to the CM to think over the proposal in the larger interest of the people,” he said. Chirag said it was wrong to put the onus on those who consumed spurious alcohol and died. Referring to the CM’s statement that those who consume bad things are bound to suffer, Chirag said, “I differ from the CM. They would not have consumed liquor, if it were not available in the region. Innocent people are being sent to jail.” Taking a swipe at the action taken against the families of the deceased, he alleged that the children and women were spending nights in the open as their houses had been sealed by the officials concerned. “Biharis are being harassed and penalised in the name of prohibition law. I would like the CM to meet the affected families before his review meeting on prohibition,” he added. Chirag also alleged that the liquor smugglers were operating with the tacit support of the ruling party leaders. “We were in the opposition when prohibition was imposed in Bihar,” he said. Reacting to Chirag's allegations, JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said the Jamui MP should provide evidence before making such “baseless” allegations against the government. “I think he has no knowledge about the proceedings of the legislature. The prohibition law was passed with the support of all political parties,” he asserted. The JD(U) principal spokesperson said that the anti-dowry law or child marriage Act were enforced years back. Yet offences under these laws continue. Moreover, the government has taken strict action against the violators of prohibition law, he pointed out. ‘Confer Bharat Ratna on Ram Vilas’: Chirag said his party demanded from the Centre to confer Bharat Ratna on former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. He thanked PM Narendra Modi for giving Padma Bhushan (posthumously) to Ram Vilas for his contribution in public life for more than five decades. Chirag also said his party would launch a ‘ratri vishram’ programme in rural areas to listen to the grievances of the people. Around 250-300 villages have been identified for the purpose, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-to-cm-fix-accountability-for-lapses-in-enforcing-prohibition/articleshow/87689554.cms||Ramashankar

These include ‘Objectionable Articles in Al-Hilal’, ‘Proposal to Expel Azad from Bihar and Odisha (Part I)’, ‘Internment of Azad (Part II)’, ‘Papers Related to Azad’, ‘Release of Azad’, and ‘Request of Al-Hilal to be Placed on Approved List of Newspapers’. Mahendrapal Singh, the director of the BSAD, told this reporter on Saturday that many interesting documents and papers related to Azad had been digitized. “During World War I, Azad was accused of publishing several objectionable articles against the Britishers in the Al-Hilal. When he took a dig at the country’s situation, he was placed under house arrest in Ranchi which was part of undivided Bihar back then. He was not allowed to meet people or take part in political activities. His house was also searched by police and his belongings were confiscated. During his detention, Azad concentrated mostly on religious and educational activities,” Singh said. He added, “Azad also drew people’s attention towards the coherence of religion and science and was against any form of discrimination in society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bsad-digitizes-documents-related-to-abul-kalam-azad/articleshow/87689336.cms||Faryal Rumi

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said a proper notification in this connection was awaited. The ECR is running 274 mail and express besides 389 local passenger trains daily. According to sources, the ‘special’ word and the first ‘0’ of the train number will be withdrawn from all mail and express trains. Officials said the decision has been taken following overall improvement in the Covid-19 situation as well as record 100+ crore vaccinations across the country. The Bihar Daily Passengers’ Association (BDPA) has welcomed this decision. “A notification to this effect was issued by deputy director coaching (Railway Board), Rajesh Kumar, to all zonal railways on Friday to restore services of regular mail and express passenger trains with immediate effect and bring the fare tariff down to pre-Covid days,” BDPA secretary Shoaib Quraishi said. Railways had suspended all passenger trains from March 22, 2020 due to Covid-19. However, ECR had started running 22 pairs of long-distance trains as ‘special trains’ from July 1, 2020 by charging at least Rs300 more per ticket in the AC class and Rs150 per ticket in sleeper class. Railways has not made it clear whether it is going to restore the services like providing meals, bedsheets, blankets, mineral water bottles and other facilities to passengers. When contacted, IRCTC senior public relations officer (PRO) A K Jha said the Board guidelines lack clarity on the issue of providing services to passengers in regular mail and express passenger trains. “IRCTC is ready to serve passengers if it gets clear guidelines from the Railway Board,” he said. According to sources, the ECR was earning revenue about Rs9 to 10 crore per day in the passenger trains segment alone during the pre-Covid period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/decision-to-restore-regular-trains-to-benefit-passengers/articleshow/87689377.cms||Kumod Verma

Sources said the BJP’s central leadership had asked the JD(U) to submit the list of UP constituencies where it wanted to contest in the upcoming assembly polls. “Most of our identified 35 seats are located in the eastern and central UP.

Sources said the JD(U)’s central leadership would soon submit the list to the BJP’s central leadership for beginning the seat-sharing talks. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh had earlier made it clear that his party would contest the upcoming UP assembly polls alone, if the BJP was not interested in forming a pre-poll alliance with his party. On being asked to reveal the names of the assembly seats identified by the JD(U), Patel named a few like Barabanki Sadar, Badaun, Chunar, Prayagraj and a few other seats in Mirzapur, Balia, Kushinagar and Ghazipur districts. “Most of our identified seats are located alongside Bihar-UP border where people are influenced by the development works of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-identifies-35-seats-in-up-to-contest-with-bjp/articleshow/87689513.cms||Madan Kumar

Education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, told this newspaper on Saturday, “Since the educational institutions have started functioning in full swing due to a sharp decline in Covid-19 cases, efforts are being made to start catch-up courses in schools to compensate for the learning loss. The modalities of these courses are being finalized and will be notified by the department soon.” He continued, “The academic interest of the students will be safeguarded at all costs and their requirements fulfilled. It will also be ensured that schools function properly and teachers work with sincerity and dedication.” Talking about the 3.5 lakh contractual teachers appointed by the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies, Choudhary said, “They will get their salaries at an enhanced rate with effect from January 1, 2022.” The education department has already released a detailed guideline of pay fixation in the revised scale with a 15% hike in salary. The minister pointed out, “On August 19 last year, the state cabinet had decided to increase the salary of all the contractual teachers and librarians by 15%. The education department had also issued a notification in this regard. The pay hike was supposed to come into effect from April 1 2021, but it could not materialize due to the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/catch-up-courses-for-students-soon-bihar-education-minister/articleshow/87689323.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar BJP chief gives credit to RaGa for saffron victory||PATNA: State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal on Saturday said former Congress president Rahul Gandhi (RaGa) and others of his ilk had made a “significant” contribution to the victory of his party in the last two parliamentary elections by making “adverse” comments consistently against Hindus and Hindutva. “There has been an immense contribution of PM Narendra Modi and lakhs of the BJP workers in the party gaining absolute majority in the last two parliamentary elections, but the important contribution of Rahul Gandhi and others cannot be denied in making that victory possible,” Dr Jaiswal said. “Whenever he (Rahul) opens his mouth, he accomplishes the task and work for bringing together the people of Hindu ‘samaj,’ who recognize the forces with whom they have to align with (read the saffron BJP),” he added while indicating that the BJP would gain immensely from the repeat of what Rahul and others have done this week ahead of the assembly elections in UP, Punjab, Manipur and Goa early next year. As it is, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid got his new book ‘The Sunrise on Ayodhya’ released on Wednesday in which he has likened the RSS and its affiliated organisations to the Islamic State and Boko Haram. Subsequently, on Friday, Rahul Gandhi explained that Hinduism and Hindutva were two different things and concepts, inviting concerted attack from BJP. Calling Rahul “convener of the so-called national secular organization,” Dr Jaiswal grouped him with AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, calling the latter “its co-convener”. He also put Khurshid, Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal, all Congress leaders, in the same bracket of the “so-called national secular organization”. Dr Jaiswal fell short of calling Rahul a sick person, as he, quoting a dialogue from the film ‘Munna Bhai’, wished for him, “Get well soon,” besides getting personal in his attack. Jaiswal said he would send the Bhagavad Gita to Rahul, since the latter says that “he is a Hindu, his mother a Christian and his father a Parsi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-bjp-chief-gives-credit-to-raga-for-saffron-victory/articleshow/87689527.cms||Abhay Singh

Many, in fact, are not interested in switching to other crops because of poor marketing facilities and unremunerative prices. In the Vizag Agency and along the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB), cultivation of ganja dominates over more traditional crops such as rajma, turmeric, millets and cereals. Three varieties of cannabis are cultivated in Vizag Agency and the AOB belt—Raja Hamsa, Kala Pathri and Sheelavathi. Demand for the Sheelavathi variety is highest and has a booming market in the country. Some ganja growers on condition of anonymity said the input cost for cultivating ganja on one acre is around Rs 2 to Rs 4 lakh and the return on investment in a year is between five to six times. Traditional crops, on the other hand, would give a maximum profit of Rs 50,000 from one acre of land. Locals said some ganja farmers earn between Rs 2 to Rs 5 lakh from an acre, making the crop as much as three times profitable than a conventional crop like turmeric. Agents lend a helping hand by paying the input cost and supplying fertilizers to enhance production. “It is a fact that ganja crop gives more profits than any other conventional crop, but growing ganja is illegal and punishable under the law. We are educating the growers to lead a peaceful life by switching to alternative crops such as turmeric,” said DIG of Visakha Range, LKV Ranga Rao. Middlemen procure cannabis from growers by paying between Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per kilo, depending on the quality. The Sheelavathi variety has a market value that ranges anywhere between Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000 per kilo in cities and metros. “The weather condition in Vizag Agency and AOB is suitable for cultivation of exotic fruits such as dragonfruit, strawberry and avacado. These crops would give good returns, too. But the input cost is high. We have been holding discussions with officials of horticulture and agriculture departments to find out suitable crops for hilly areas that ganja farmers can switch to,” said ASP, Chintapalle, Tushar Dudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/high-returns-vs-illegal-biz-conundrum-in-agency/articleshow/87690123.cms||Nalla.Babu

State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said initially they will be carrying out mass awareness programme in the urban areas as model code was implemented in villages due to the panchayat elections. “We will interact with people on important issues like corruption and inflation. Apart from organising marches, we will hold talks with small groups of people and spend night at some places to make people aware of the problems the country was facing,” said Jha. When asked whether the Congress was trying to make some space in Bihar after its poor performance in the recent byelections, Jha replied, “This awareness programme has nothing to do with the byelection results. Our party is carrying it out across the country and we have always raised the issues of public interest.” When asked whether the bitterness with the RJD during the bypolls got over and the two would join hands again, he said, “Our relationship is the same as it was during the byelections. The gap is there.” However, he said, the future course of action will be decided by the Congress high command. Congress and RJD were in alliance in the 2020 assembly elections. However, in the recently concluded bypolls, both fielded candidates on the two seats and lost the elections to JD(U).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congs-mass-awareness-programme-from-today/articleshow/87689573.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The rain could be light to moderate over the next two days, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “The low-pressure trough moved into Bengal as expected and has resulted in clouds and rain. The rain will continue and could get moderate either on Sunday or Monday,” said RMC director GK Das. While the cloud cover is set to persist till Tuesday, the low-pressure trough will start weakening from Tuesday. “It will lose steam and should fizzle out,” added Das. The cloud cover has pushed the minimum temperature well above 20 degrees while it has pulled the maximum down.

---||Ahmedabad||In another age, silver had gold crown in value and exchange!||AHMEDABAD: On a day when gold price surged to nine-month record high of Rs 51,000 per 10 grams on Saturday, it may be difficult to imagine that once gold price was the same as that of silver! This dream scenario prevailed in Vedic and post-Vedic period (about 3,500 to 4,000 years ago) as documented by scriptures. By the time Alexander’s army returned home from the western borders of India circa 4th Century BCE, the ratio was 2 silvers to 1 gold. Seven centuries later, it increased to 6 silvers to 1 gold and today it is roughly 80 silvers to 1 gold. While the gold price slid from Rs 58,000 per 10 grams in August 2020 to slightly below Rs 50,000 ahead of Diwali 2021, for the past few days the gold prices are witnessing a steady rise due to the factors such as surge in international demand and strengthening of the US Dollar against Indian Rupee, said experts. In his latest paper titled ‘Gold is Old: Noble Metal in Indian Economy through Ages’ Prof Satish Deodhar teaching economics in IIM-Ahmedabad tracked the precious metal's history and obsession over it in India. “Written accounts indicate that gold was aplenty during the Vedic era and people would even get alluvial placer gold dust from rivers such as Sindhu, Saraswati, Jambu and Ganga. For a very long time, the non-corrosive and malleable nature of the metal made it the favourite medium of trade and exchange,” said Satish Deodhar, a professor of economics at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A). “But even as India’s own gold reserves depleted, our obsession with the Yellow Metal refused to subside. Today we buy gold as a store of value rather than use it as a medium of exchange.” Prof Deodhar has dug up some interesting nuggets from the past. “We have found more than 40 names for gold found in Sanskrit literature, mostly as adjectives. In Vedic and post-Vedic literature such as Brahmanas, we find mention of both unmarked button-gold (hiranya pinda) and punch-marked bullion named Nishka, Satamana, Suvarna and Krishnala as currency,” he said. In fact, the radiant yellow hue of the metal even evoked the concept of Hiranya-garbha (golden egg, womb or seed) as the starting point (Big Bang) of the universe in Hindu concept of creation. The connection between gold and Goddess Lakshmi is also as old as Vedas. The Shri Sukta hymn in Rig-Veda describes her as the one who shines with golden hue wearing golden garlands. Till date the earliest excavations of gold coins with the imagery of Goddess Lakshmi belong to the Gupta dynasty in 4th Century CE. But Prof Deodhar points at a larger issue. “Over the millennia, Indian households have accumulated an astounding stock of about 24,245 tonnes of gold. Since India does not produce any gold , about 9% of the value of our annual imports consist of this precious metal alone. We must devise ways to re-channel the idle gold stock through the gold monetization schemes (GMS) initiated by the government of India,” he said. “Today households don’t earn any interest on the gold they possess. In fact, they pay fees to keep it in bank lockers. Instead, GMS gold deposits can be used efficiently to recycle idle gold stocks, finance gold inventory of jewellers, and reduce imports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-another-age-silver-had-gold-crown-in-value-and-exchange/articleshow/87690764.cms||Parth Shastri

Vendors demonstrated outside the Ahmedabad collector’s office on Saturday, claiming they would launch a statewide agitation if Trivedi fails to apologize for his remarks. The vendors demanded that before branding them as ‘land grabbers’ and ‘illegal’, the revenue minister must explain why municipal corporations were dragging their feet on implementing provisions of the protection of livelihood and regulation of street vending Act, 2014. On Friday, Trivedi had told media in Vadodara that footpaths were meant for pedestrians and nobody should do business there.

His family members are consulting doctors in Singapore as well as in London. Lalu is suffering from multiple ailments, including kidney, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac issues. Because of kidney malfunction, he has been advised to limit the intake of liquid, including water and juice. The RJD founder was rushed back to Delhi from Patna on November 3, after his creatinine level had increased and his blood report showed some abnormalities. Sanjay Yadav, who is the political advisor of Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said, “Doctors in Singapore and London are being consulted for the transplant. We are sending them whatever reports they are asking for. The decision on transplant will be taken after going through the reports.” Sources said the Lalu’s family is in consultation with the same same hospital where former BJP Rajya Sabha member R K Sinha and former Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh had undergone treatment. Sinha had even met Lalu on October 29 to inquire about his health and suggested about the doctors who had treated him in Singapore. In India, noted nephrologist Dr Bhalla at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is closely monitoring Lalu’s kidney ailment and his cardiac issues are being taken care of by the unit led by Dr Rakesh Yadav at AIIMS-Delhi. Presently, Lalu is at the official residence of his elder daughter Misa Bharti. Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi is staying with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-may-undergo-kidney-transplant/articleshow/87689401.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Delhi||UP police takes Delhi YouTuber to Mathura for Vrindavan film||AGRA: Mathura police in UP on Saturday booked a YouTube content creator from Delhi, bringing him for “questioning” here, for uploading a film on the beliefs behind ‘Nidhivan’ in Vrindavan -- where Krishna and Radha are believed to still do 'raaslila' at night -- on his web channel three days ago. His Mathura-based friends have also been hauled up. The videographers, allegedly "with their shoes on", had entered the premises by climbing over the wall at midnight and had shot the film. Police said no one is allowed to enter there at night as people believe that Lord Krishna and Radha still perform raslila when the city sleeps. The purported video was deleted on Saturday. Though the YouTube channel is run by Gaurav Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Vihar in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, under the name of 'GauravZone' with 44.9 lakh subscribers, the FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station. In the FIR, complainant Rohit Krishna, who is a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, stated that some "anti-social elements violated limits of Nidhivan", which is considered the most prominent site dedicated to Lord Krishna-Radha and their 'gopis'. The complaint added that the men tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs. He demanded "exemplary deterrent". Superintendent of police (city) MP Singh told TOI that a police team was sent to Delhi to identify the suspects and the matter is under investigation. Civil judge (junior division) Archana Singh also directed police to ensure deletion of the video from all social media platforms after the priest approached the judge. She directed police to present a compliance report in court. A group of priests in Vrindavan staged a protest and later purified Nidhivan by sprinkling holy water. “We will launch an agitation if police fail to arrest the accused,” said Saurabh Gaur, president of Dharam Raksha Sangh. Sharma was arrested by Delhi police a few months ago for animal cruelty after he posted a video showing his dog floating in air with helium balloons strapped to its back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-police-takes-delhi-youtuber-to-mathura-for-vrindavan-film/articleshow/87691105.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Deadly virus on prowl, felines in Kolkata at risk||KOLKATA: A deadly feline parvovirus (FPV) has been raging among cats in the city, killing several domesticated cats, especially those that have a habit of going outdoors. According to vets and pet owners in the city, multiple cats have developed loss of appetite, severe lethargy and weakness, which in some cases have developed into vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and dehydration. Due to poor diagnosis, by the time the disease is discovered, many affected animals go into shock from dehydration and sepsis, often resulting in sudden death. “FPV attacks the cells that line the small intestine and causes severe immunosuppression among cats. Early diagnosis is very important for a proper cure of the disease. Several cats are facing casualties because of diagnostic ambiguity,” said veterinarian Subir Bhattacharya. FPV is highly contagious and is spread through the faeces of infected cats. Cats do not need to have direct contact to spread the virus. It can be transferred from anything that has come in contact with contaminated faeces, including shoes, clothing or other objects, such as toys, said feline experts. “Our seven-month old cat Simbu was perfectly fine until she suddenly stopped eating from November 1 and started passing blood mixed stool. We took her to a vet who got her tested and diagnosed her with haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and put her on drip. She was under treatment for almost a week but her condition continued to deteriorate and on November 7, she collapsed,” said Nishita Rakshit, a coding instructor from Garia. Doctors opined while no specific treatment is available for FPV, the treatment protocol varies from case to case depending on the kind of symptoms. It is also vital that any suspected cases are nursed in isolation. In absence of any specific treatment protocols, doctors stress that FPV can be much better prevented than treated and demanded all cats and kittens be vaccinated. “There is still reluctance among a large section of cat lovers to get the felines vaccinated. Every kitten should be vaccinated with CRP vaccine, which acts as a shield against diseases like calicivirus, rhinotracheitis virus and panleukopenia virus,” said doctor Krishanu Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deadly-virus-on-prowl-city-felines-at-risk/articleshow/87690608.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

DCP crime, Amrita Duhan said that city police had picked up a crucial intelligence input about suspicious people with criminal antecedents, who were living alongside city streets while posing as nomads to evade regular surveillance. The crime branch dispatched a team led by inspector Khalil Ahmad which kept a close eye on the accused and raided their hideouts. “The most violent member of the gang that has at least six murders under his belt becomes the gang’s chieftain. That is the reason why it’s called Chaimar gang,” Duhan told TOI. Kidnapping gang busted: Ram Nagariya police Saturday arrested three members of a loot and abduction gang.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Engineer shifts gears, hopes to be doctor at 35||MUMBAI: Twenty-nine-year-old Aakriti Goel completed her engineering from BITS Pilani in 2015 and dabbled into several projects and start-ups till she landed, what she believed was her dream job. Two years of devoting over 14 hours a day in this health-related start-up, Goel fell sick. Due to extreme stress, she suffered a hormonal imbalance forcing her to quit her job soon after the outbreak of the pandemic. A year after the health episode, Goel has bounced back into what she calls the 2.0 version of her career. She studied for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and bagged an enviable all-India rank of 1118 - a feat that many find unbelievable, including her parents. An official from the Directorate of Medical Education and Research claimed that in the state rank list, which is yet to be released, she could easily be in the top 100. Goel is all set to join a leading government institution and pursue a career in medicine. She will probably end up being a doctor at the age of 35 and a surgeon around 40, but she takes life as it comes and is not worried about her future right now. “Age should not be a bar to achieve anything in life. We tend to have more faith in the stereotypical belief that ‘what’s done is done’ and that ‘we cannot re-start our career again’. Or ‘we are too old’. Or ‘if you are a woman, it is still harder'. It is not true. People can still discover things they like at the age of 30, 40 or even 50 and pursue it. It is never too late to find the purpose of your life,” said the Thane resident. Goel never liked working in an MNC. She wanted to join smaller firms and make a significant difference. “I am not a 9 to 5 person,” she says. She opted out of her campus placements in 2015 and started looking for unconventional roles in start-ups. After working in a couple of them, she decided to experiment with something on her own. With little success, she looked for an operations job in another start-up in 2018 and made her way to the top in no time. “It was pretty hectic, but I learnt a lot. Toiling for 14-15 hours a day eventually took a toll on my health and I decided to quit in March last year,” said Goel. She relaxed at home for a few months, did yoga, painting and slowly bounced back. Once she fully recovered, the ‘what next?’ question troubled her. She could have easily gone back to her hefty-salaried job, but she realised it was not her calling. “Though I learnt a lot in that firm, it never gave me full satisfaction,” she said. Goel was always interested in women empowerment issues and wanted to start something on her own, like an NGO. But the pandemic-imposed lockdown, put a spoke in her wheel. She then decided to approach an old friend, a life coach, who asked her to take the Ikigai exercise, a Japanese concept to figure out the purpose of one’s life. On doing it for the second time, she figured medicine is where her heart is. “I wanted to become a doctor as a child. I was good at biology in school. But when the time came to choose between the two, I did not wish to lose the opportunity of being called a woman engineer. I do not regret that decision too. In fact, after being an engineer for over 10 years, I now know how passionately I want to become a doctor,” she said. Going back to studies was easier said than done. She had studied physics and chemistry in engineering but had lost touch with biology. She put in 10-12 hours every day in the last year and joined a coaching class. "Initially it was tough. I had no friends to discuss and classes were online too. But eventually, I managed. I gave over 100 mock tests. In the beginning, I was getting around 590, but towards the end, I breached the 700 mark," she said. In NEET-2021, Goel scored 676 out of 720. Her parents were initially surprised but were very supportive later. She is hoping to get into one of the peripheral AIIMS or a government college in Mumbai. She has no qualms about joining a bunch of youngsters in her MBBS pursuit. "I will never get old in their company. They will have fresh energy and vibe and I am sure I will be able to absorb and make use of it," she added. "I am in this for the next 12 years, including my PG and super speciality. I am ready to slog to become something worthwhile," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-engineer-shifts-gears-hopes-to-be-doctor-at-35/articleshow/87690646.cms||Yogita Rao

Justice Prateek Jalan said that the political outfit, which sought ‘Tractor Chalata Kisan’ as its election symbol, approached the court with “unclean hands” and directed that the cost be deposited with Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within two weeks. The petitioner party informed the court that it had applied to the Election Commission for allotment of a common symbol, stating that ‘Tractor Chalata Kisan’ and ‘Letter Box’ were its first and second preferences, respectively. The Election Commission, however, contended that the petitioner was suppressing material facts as the symbol in question was not a free symbol and the same had also been notified by it. The high court opined that “suppression in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be countenanced” and observed that the petitioner annexed “an older version” of the EC documents to support its claim that the symbol was a free symbol and refused to accept the petitioner’s submission that the omission was unintentional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-1-lakh-fine-on-party-that-challenged-its-poll-symbol/articleshow/87691121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government has allowed the temple management committee to melt the gold and silver offered to the temple. The temple has over 28 kg of gold and 996 kg of silver. The government has set standard operating procedure (SOPs) to melt these metal offerings. Gajanan Gurav, the executive officer of Shri Vitthal-Rukhmini Mandir Samiti, said, “The ornaments with the temple were transferred to the management committee after the government took over in 1985. The government has allowed the melting of these ornaments and it will be done at the refinery of the government mint at Mumbai. The sorting of the ornaments will be videographed. The ornaments will be covered by insurance. After removing impurity, the pure metal will be converted into bricks and as the necessity arises, fresh ornaments will be designed.” He added that some ornaments have historical value and need conservation. The temple management has the records of gold and silver offerings made in 18th and 19th centuries, including those by Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore and the Peshwas of Pune. Former head of the temple management committee Anna Dange has claimed that the temple has ornaments donated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as well and he has written to the committee to not melt such offerings and instead preserve them. Gurav said, “We have no record of ornaments offered by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or during his reign in 17th century. However, we don’t deny that the ornaments may have been donated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. We have decided to preserve the ornaments of historic value.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/govt-okays-melting-of-gold-silver-offerings-made-to-pandharpur-temple/articleshow/87689833.cms||---

---||Delhi||Stop farm fires, ban vehicles, declare lockdown for a few days: SC||NEW DELHI: “How will people breathe?” asked the Supreme Court on Saturday while pushing the central government and the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent measures to reduce the AQI levels in the National Capital Region from the dangerous current levels of 500 to 200-300. The court added that if needed, a lockdown could be imposed besides getting the farmers to stop stubble burning for a few days. Track the pollution level in your citySolicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that as per the India Meteorological Department forecasts, the situation wasn’t going to improve till November 18 and that the governments had to take urgent measures to tackle the issue as per the policy devised. “The Centre has called an urgent meeting of the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to discuss emergency measures to be taken in the next few days,” Mehta said. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said all it wanted was to ensure cleaner air for the citizens. “You must tell us on Monday what steps were taken and the result thereof,” the court told the Centre and the states concerned. The bench said Delhi government appeared to be doing little to address the alarming air crisis in the capital. The CJI asked Delhi government, “We heard you had installed some smog towers. Are those towers working?” Justice Chandrachud added, “Delhi government has opened the schools and is exposing little children to this severe weather. Are the schools still open?” Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra pointed out that the AQI in the city was in the ‘good’ category till September 30 but deteriorated alarmingly since then to ‘dangerous’ levels. “Stubble burning is the main reason for this,” he said, discounting the bench’s apprehension that stubble burning coupled with pollution from other sources had weaved a toxic cocktail of atmosphere over NCR. Justice Surya Kant, who said that he and the CJI were farmers, objected to Delhi government blaming the farmers for the mess. “Be it petitioner or Delhi government, it has become a fashion today to indulge in farmer bashing. Has Delhi government imposed any ban on factories and construction activities in the past seven days? What is Delhi Police doing?” he asked. The CJI said, “Without indulging in blame games or politics, the Centre and state government must work in tandem to provide relief to the citizens. We all must be able to breathe.” Addressing Delhi government, the bench asked, “Why don’t you think of banning plying of vehicles except emergency vehicles? You find a way and talk to the central government for implementing this across NCR.” The Centre responded through Mehta, “The colour of the political party does not matter. It is a joint responsibility. Implementation has to be at the state level. We are coordinating and every state is cooperating. We are focussing on emergency response with the chief secretaries of the states.” Detailing the multi-mode action plan to curb stubble burning, the solicitor general said Uttar Pradesh planned to use the IARI, Pusa, bio-decomposer over 10 lakh acres of rice fields, Haryana in around a lakh acres, Punjab in 7,413 acres and in Delhi, 4,000 acres. “The application has been used so far in around 6.6 lakh acres in UP, including 91,500 acres in NCR districts, 1,357 acres in Delhi and 34,000 acres in Haryana,” Mehta informed. “Besides, Nurture Farms, a subsidiary of United Phosphorus Ltd, as CSR initiative, has sprayed the bio-decomposer in 1,71,449 acres in Punjab and 2,36,109 in Haryana.” The solicitor general added that under the In-situ Crop Residue Management Scheme, 2,00,000 baling machines were available. “Statutory directions for utilisation of paddy straw pellets/briquettes for co-firing in thermal power plants have been issued to all 11 thermal power plants within 300 km of Delhi,” he said. The SC agreed the policy decisions were fine but the problem lay in implementation. “Who will collect the stubble? What is the mechanism to put the stubble together and transport it for use as fuel in power stations and other industries? What is the economic arrangement?” it asked. “Whatever mechanism you create for collecting and transporting stubble, it must reach the farmers within a short window of 20 days. The policy is there. The problem is how you are implementing it. You appear to be still in the process of inviting tenders and other things.” Justices Chandrachud and Kant said, “So far as farmers are concerned, the problem is not enforcement, but incentivising. If they are adequately incentivised, why would farmers not switch to stubble disposal? You cannot enforce these things.” They added, “Landholdings in Punjab and Haryana are less than three acres and you cannot force farmers to purchase machinery. Why can’t the Centre and states provide stubble management machines?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-stop-farm-fires-ban-vehicles-declare-lockdown-for-a-few-days/articleshow/87691543.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Ahmedabad||NEET SS delay: Senior residents bear juniors’ load||AHMEDABAD: Senior resident doctors pursuing super specialty courses at medical colleges in Gujarat are forced to handle duties assigned to first-year resident doctors for six more months due to delays in the admission process. “Students who joined the first year of super-specialty courses last year and are now in their second year, have to continue the medical duties of their juniors as the first-year resident doctors are yet to enroll for their courses,” said an MD doctor who has completed his PG medical studies this year and is waiting for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Super Specialty (NEET SS) 2021 exams to be held. The first-year students have to carry ward duties as part of their studies. There are about 100 seats for super-specialty courses in the state. The exam was earlier to be held on November 11 but it has been postponed to January 10, 2022. The MD doctor quoted earlier said he was offered a job at a corporate hospital in Ahmedabad but he could not join due to repeated delays in NEET SS exam. “The term for first-year students starts in September-October, but this time it is not likely to start before March next year. So, the second-year students will have handle duties of junior doctors for another six months,” he said. Another aspirant who wants to join the three-year super specialty course said his studies for a PG medical programme ended in July and he is waiting for the NEET SS exams. “For the last ten years there has been some issue or the other during exams,” said the PG qualified doctor. The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences had originally planned to conduct the NEET SS 2021 in a new pattern. Forty-one PG-qualified doctors moved the Supreme Court of India, stating that the last-minute changes will have an adverse effect on the candidates. The Supreme Court came down heavily stating that it cannot make last-minute changes to such an important exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neet-ss-delay-senior-residents-bear-juniors-load/articleshow/87690642.cms||---

UFERWAS has chosen a theme on ‘climate change’ and presented a paper titled ‘Pray for Hyderabad’ at the two-day annual NCRWA meet. “As Hyderabad had witnessed a massive flood in October 2020, we have focused on climate change. Floods in various parts of India, landslides, cloudburst in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, excessive rainfall in terrains collectively indicate the increasing intensity of the extreme weather events across the Indian landscape,” UFERWAS general secretary BT Srinivasan said. “Experts warn that we can no longer ignore the climate change footprint, as it is going to be a part of our daily routine. They say the monsoon rains would increase further with an increase in the global temperatures,” he explained. UFERWAS said residents must ask their elected representatives in Parliament and assembly constituencies as well as civic body councillors and city mayors to take measures against climate change. “A prosperous future depends on their decisions on environment, green spaces, roads, cycling infrastructure, waste and recycling, air quality and energy-efficient homes. Ultimately, steps to reduce carbon emissions will have a positive impact on local issues, like improving air quality and public health, creating jobs and reducing inequality,” a member of UFERWAS said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uferwas-to-take-part-in-up-meet-focus-on-climate-change/articleshow/87690643.cms||Sunil Mungara

If they don’t cough up their dues, the water board will disconnect their water and sewerage connections. The water board’s revenue dipped by Rs 80 crore per month post the launch of the 20-KL free water supply scheme. Though the board is unable to clear nearly Rs 1,500 crore power dues to TSSPDCL, it is paying regular monthly power bills to avoid interruption in the water supplies. To improve revenue collection, HMWS&SB management has asked general managers of 20 operation and maintenance (O&M) divisions to collect pending dues by December. “We are mounting pressure on the defaulters to pay up,” a senior HMWS&SB official, who tackled the revenue wing earlier, said. In O&M Division-III (Tolichowki & Gudimalkapur), the water board used to receive Rs 60 lakh revenue per month, now for the past couple of months, it has gone up to Rs 1-1.5 crore per month. “A reputed women’s college at Mehdipatnam had been paying Rs 700 per month under domestic category for more than three decades. Now, we have changed the water connection to commercial category and issuing Rs 60,000 bill per month,” deputy general manager (NRW), O&M Division-III, MA Kabir told TOI. A register was being maintained to receive complaints from consumers and resolve them, the official added. In this division, nearly Rs 300-500 crore worth dues were pending and now the water board staff started collecting them on a case to case basis, the deputy GM said, adding that they hope to collect it within three to six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-eyes-defaulters-to-fill-coffers-over-2l-under-lens/articleshow/87690653.cms||Sunil Mungara

This crucial link will connect Metro services from PCMC to Shivajinagar (between Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune).

---||Nashik||Chandrakant Patil: MVA govt unable to control violence||Nashik: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Saturday alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had failed to control the violence that took place at Malegaon, Nanded and Amravati on Friday. Patil was in Nashik city on Saturday to inaugurate a Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) school building in the Satpur area. Addressing a gathering, Patil claimed that when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra, no one dared to unleash any violence. “But the scenario has changed under the MVA. The present government was unable to act tough against the elements responsible for Friday’s violence due to vote bank politics. Patil also criticised Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who blamed BJP for the violence. “For every problem that the MVA government faces, it conveniently blames the BJP, and not resolve them. Be it the MSRTC employees strike or Friday’s violence, the MVA leaders hold BJP responsible. In fact, had Balasaheb Thackeray been alive, he would have been tough on Raut for making irresponsible statements,” said Patil. According to him, former CM Devendra Fadnavis, during his tenure, had done remarkable development work. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi could transform Gujarat as he was the chief minister of that state for 15 years and had adequate time. If Fadnavis gets such a long duration, he would surely transform Maharashtra. Shiv Sena, our alliance partner in the previous government, broke the trust and walked away from that alliance,” he added, Stating that the MVA government is unable to undertake any development work, Patil criticized the MVA for the alleged corruption by some ministers, rise in women’s harassment cases and youths being addicted to drugs. “BJP will come to power in the state. And our party will win the next parliamentary polls with a convincing margin,” he claimed. ‘BJP will win NMC polls’ Patil said that the BJP, which is in control of the Nashik Municipal Corporation, will win the civic polls next year. He claimed the party will win more than 100 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chandrakant-patil-mva-govt-unable-to-control-violence/articleshow/87689854.cms||Tushar Pawar

SMS Medical College doctors said obese people, who just got diabetes, can get rid of it by losing a lot of weight. "It is a general conception that diabetes is not reversible. But, it can be reversed in case of obese people. A recently diagnosed obese person can get rid of it after reducing 10-15 kgs. It can be done by controlling diet and working out," said Dr Prakash Keswani, a senior professor at SMS Medical College. "While doing so, the person has to keep in mind that he or she should not develop hypoglycemia, a condition in which blood glucose falls suddenly below the prescribed limits," said the doctor. "In patients, who did not have diabetes before they got infected with Covid-19, reversal of diabetes is possible. Such patients have transient diabetes and it gets reversed with time. Covid-19 affects the beta cells in the pancreas, which causes diabetes. Also, use of steroids can cause diabetes," said Dr Sailesh Lodha, senior endocrinologist at a private hospital.He said during the pandemic a lot of patients, who had borderline diabetes, got full-blown diabetes due to the Covid-19 infection and use of steroids. "Steroids stimulate glucose production by the liver and inhibit peripheral glucose uptake resulting in insulin resistance. There aren’t any studies yet, but there have been cases where the patient got diagnosed with diabetes recently after a Covid19 infection," said, Dr Manoj Khandelwal, consultant at a private hospital’s endocrinology department.Doctors appealed to the people not to lead a sedentary lifestyle as it increased the risk of lifestyle diseases. "Due to diabetes, there has been a rapid increase in heart-related diseases. High blood sugar is directly related to heart diseases. A diabetic patient always needs to be careful. Diabetic patients have to take care of routines and regular eating habits," said Dr Ankit Mathu, a senior cardiac surgeon at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-triggered-diabetes-can-be-reversed-considerably-say-docs/articleshow/87691552.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Pharma firms’ US revenues shrink again||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat-based top pharmaceutical companies’ revenues from the US market have remained under pressure for the third consecutive quarter in 2021. Increased competition and subsequent price erosion in existing products adversely impacted their sales in the US market for the quarter ended September. Vadodara-based Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited (APL)’s revenues from the US market declined40% to Rs 348 crore in September quarter from Rs 582 crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited’s revenues from the US eased 13% to Rs 284 crore in the quarter ended September 30 from Rs 327 crore in the same quarter last year. Another pharma major from Ahmedabad, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group, registered a 12% drop in revenues in the US, the world’s largest pharma market, at Rs 1,498 crore during the September quarter. The company had clocked a revenues of Rs 1,709 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year. These companies had also reported lower US market sales in the previous two quarters as well. These companies attributed heightened competition and tough pricing scenario to the muted sales from the US market. According to Alembic Pharma’s investor presentation, increased competition in the US market led to price erosion in some large products during the first six months of the current financial year. “Sales (from US market) were lower due to price erosion in the base business and lack of new approvals pending re-inspection of facilities,” Torrent Pharma had said while announcing its financial result for the quarter. According to industry players, the competition in the US market has intensified with more and more generic products being approved. The new players are pricing their products aggressively, which is exerting pressure on the existing players to reduce prices of their already approved products. The pharma firms, however, posted healthy growth in the domestic market, which helped them offset lower US revenues. Alembic Pharma’s India business revenues surged 23% to Rs 509 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal. Torrent Pharma’s India market revenues rose 13% to Rs 1,087 crore and Cadila Healthcare’s sales (human formulations and consumer wellness) rose 12% to Rs 1,591 crore during the quarter under review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pharma-firms-us-revenues-shrink-again/articleshow/87690702.cms||Kalpesh Damor

For instance, in a span of six months, the HMWS&SB has resolved 1,612 complaints on sewerage overflows on roads in Banjara Hills in operation and maintenance (O&M) division VI (SR Nagar). When this number is compared with three major areas like Jubilee Hills, Film Nagar and Somajiguda, the number of sewerage complaints resolved by the HMWS&SB is big in number. In Jubilee Hills, 956 complaints have been resolved between May and June. In Somajiguda where high-rise residential and commercial properties are located, the water board has resolved 1,259 complaints of overflowing of sewage water. “The existing sewerage network in Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Somajiguda was laid over three decades ago. We keep receiving sewerage overflowing and chokage complaints,” general manager, O&M division VI, S Hari Shankar, told STOI. All these complaints were received through water board’s 24/7 call centre ‘metro customer care’ (MCC) only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-working-to-reduce-sewage-plaints/articleshow/87690693.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Chennai||Mullaperiyar is a matter of continuous supervision: SC||NEW DELHI/CHENNAI: The issue pertaining to the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam is a matter of “continuous supervision,” the Supreme Court said on Saturday, and asked the Tamil Nadu government to keep the seepage data of the dam ready for the court’s perusal, if required. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar observed that there should not be any adversarial approach in the matter and it would look into the issues and then take a call. “You must appreciate that this is not a one-time consideration matter,” the bench told senior advocate Shekhar Naphade appearing for Tamil Nadu. Naphade told the bench that all the data and details were there before the supervisory committee which has considered them from time to time. “It does not matter. You keep it ready for our perusal, if required,” the bench told the senior advocate. “Our only difficulty is that your lordships will find that petitions after petitions are being filed only to keep us harassing,” Naphade said, adding, “This is one more attempt to keep the pot boiling.” “If there is some evolving situation, how it has been addressed or how it will be addressed, are matters which will be looked into,” the bench observed. “If there is some input available, we will have a look at it and then we will proceed,” the court said, adding, “Ultimately, we will go by the expert committee opinion.” Naphade said Tamil Nadu was not taking anything adversarial in the matter. “This is part of campaign in social media. This is nothing else,” he said. The counsel appearing for the petitioner Joe Joseph and others who has raised issues including on seepage data, said the matter relates to lives and properties of about 50 lakh people and while five districts of Tamil Nadu need water, five districts of Kerala need protection from the dam, which he claimed was not safe. Based on the request of Kerala government’s counsel, the court posted the matter for further hearing on November 22. Meanwhile, the interim arrangement would continue based on the water level notified by the expert committee, the court said. The Kerala government had recently told the apex court that “no amount of rejuvenation” can perpetuate the dam and there is a limit to the number of years one can keep dams in service through maintenance and strengthening measurers. It had said the only permanent solution for removing the “eternal threat owing to the safety concerns” of the dam and for protecting the safety of lakhs of people living in the downstream of Mullaperiyar dam is to build a new dam in the downstream reaches of the existing dam. Tamil Nadu, in its affidavit filed on Friday, said Kerala was giving scant regard to the directions of the Supreme Court’s supervisory committee. It said Kerala was continuing with its “obstructionist attitude” and preventing the state from carrying out activities related to the safety of Mullaperiyar dam. The state government said that it was regulating the reservoir as per the Upper Rule Level finalised by the Central Water Commission of the Union Jal Shakti ministry. It said that cutting of trees for enabling strengthening of the baby dam was not permitted by Kerala despite repeated directions of the supervisory committee. “The permission is eluding. In the minutes of the meeting held on October 26, Kerala government agreed to expedite all pending forest clearance for maintenance of approach road and carrying out the balance strengthening works,” Tamil Nadu said. It also recorded the receipt of the tree-felling order from Kerala’s principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden dated November 5. But it was subsequently cancelled by Kerala government. Tamil Nadu said that strengthening works at the Baby dam has been thwarted by Kerala for over 16 years since the apex court’s ruling in February 2006. Despite repeated follow up on power connection to Mullaperiyar dam since 2000, the same was restored only in 2021. While Kerala agreed in 2015 to install rain gauge stations in the catchment areas of the dam for inflow forecasting system, the state installed it only in 2020 but had not shared the data till date. Kerala did not allow collection of data regularly from Thanikodi and Mullaikodi rainfall stations installed by Tamil Nadu. Repeated assertion of Kerala and petitioners from the state filed from time to time, among other things, seek decommissioning of existing dam and construction of a new dam, which was “wholly impermissible” in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court on the safety of the dam. “The dam has been found to be hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe,” Tamil Nadu said, pointing to three apex court orders in 2006, 2014 and 2018. The supervisory committee had been regularly recommending strengthening measures to the Baby dam as per court orders. Tamil Nadu government said the dam was checked for seismic forces that would possibly occur in the zone, where the dam was situated and it was found to be safe by the Central Water Power and Research Station, Pune, a Central government agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mullaperiyar-is-a-matter-of-continuous-supervision-sc/articleshow/87691179.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Agra||'Unknown policemen' booked for murder as dad accuses 5 cops in complaint||Agra: Four days after the death of Mohammad Altaf, 22, in police custody, his father Chand Miyan met the superintendent of police (SP) of Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod, to file a complaint on the basis of which an FIR has now been lodged against "unknown policemen" who have been charged with murder under IPC section 302. Miyan has accused five policemen for killing his son. They are station house officer Virendra Singh Indolia, sub-inspector Chandresh Gautam, sub-inspector Vikas Kumar, head moharrir (clerk) Dhanendra Singh, and constable Saurabh Solanki. All five had earlier been suspended for “negligence on duty” after news of Altaf's death in custody spread. Altaf's uncle, who accompanied Miyan to the SP's office, alleged that they were not provided with a copy of the complaint and were told to "go home". "They said that a copy of the FIR will be provided to us soon," he added. Police claimed that the FIR was lodged on the basis of an "earlier complaint received from Altaf's father by post". The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, is dated November 11 and doesn't mention the names of any policeman. “We were not aware of the names of the policemen at the time the first complaint was sent by post,” said Altaf's uncle. The SP explained: "The fresh complaint will be included in the existing FIR. Following an investigation, the names of all the policemen involved in the matter will be added. A special team has been constituted to investigate the case.” Chand Miyan said, “It is now clear that the FIR against my son was registered after his death. If he was found hanging at 2:30 pm, as the police claim, why was he taken to the hospital after 90 minutes? The police proposed a wrong theory about him being depressed and committing suicide to hide their crimes. My son was brutally murdered in police custody. I have filed a police complaint and the SP has assured me that he will take suitable action.” According to the police, Altaf, accused of kidnapping a Hindu girl, was found hanging in the lock-up's bathroom at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead after roughly 15 minutes. The FIR against Altaf says that the case was registered on Tuesday at 4 pm, much later than his time of death. Earlier in the week, a letter with the thumb impression of Chand Miyan went viral on social media. It stated, “My son Altaf committed suicide when he was taken by the police for questioning in a case. He was depressed. The police took him to the hospital but he died there. I don’t have any complaints against the police, nor do my family or I want any investigation in the matter.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said he was "detained" at the Goraha police outpost after the death of his son. “The police made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by policemen. I was asked to give a thumb impression and was told that if I don't do it, the dead body of my son will not be handed over to me and I will not be allowed to leave. I had no idea what was written in it,” the complaint said. “I was pressured to put a thumb impression on the letter.” Miyan's complaint says Altaf's height was more than 5.5 feet. However, the FIR says that his height was "around 5 feet.” The police had earlier claimed that Altaf had “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." The tap was less than 3 feet in height. Azad Samaj Party (ASP) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who had accompanied the family along with a delegation of local leaders to file the complaint, said, “The case was registered after Altaf's father met the SP and handed over a fresh complaint letter. Not naming the accused policemen is highly condemnable." On the basis of a complaint by a Rampur-based RTI activist, Danish Khan, the National Human Rights Commission has registered a complaint into the custodial death. Taking suo motu cognizance, the National Commission for Minorities has also issued a notice to the UP government and state police chief, seeking a detailed response on the death of Altaf at the Sadar Kotwali Police Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/unknown-policemen-booked-for-murder-as-dad-accuses-5-cops-in-complaint/articleshow/87690699.cms||Deepak Lavania

Jha, who was also a web portal reporter, had been kidnapped by four men near his house at Lohia Chowk on November 9 night. His body was handed over to the family after autopsy on Saturday. His brother Chandra Shekhar had lodged an FIR suspecting that Jha was kidnapped by those illegal healthcare clinic owners whom he had exposed, the police said. Jha had filed RTI applications and reportedly written articles on his web portal against illegal and unauthorised clinics, hospitals and healthcare establishments in his area. He had even submitted several petitions to Madhubani DM against such establishments running without any licence after which many of them were either shut by the administration or fined, police sources said. When asked, Benipatti SDPO Arun Kumar Singh on Saturday told this newspaper that raids were on to nab those involved in Jha’s killing. A police officer from Madhubani said Jha was strangled. “It was revealed in the postmortem. The body was identified by family members on the basis of a ring he had in one of his fingers, a mole in his leg and charred remains of his red shirt which he had been wearing on November 9,” he said. The officer said it seems he was murdered somewhere else and the criminals burned his body there as the grass and bushes were also charred. The officer said two persons, including the one who runs a private clinic, had been detained for interrogation on Saturday. “Prima facie we suspect that Jha was murdered due to his RTI activities which had resulted in action against several private clinics in Benipatti,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rti-activist-killed-in-madhubani-dist/articleshow/87689908.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Increased pollution, weather causing serious illnesses among citizens: Doctors, weather experts||PRAYAGRAJ: With the onset of winters, the danger of pollution has increased in the city which are causing various ailments among the denizens. From breathing related problems, which are damaging heart and lungs, to heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory infections as well as infections of eye and skin, pollution coupled with the weather are causing serious health issues. In this backdrop, TOI spoke to number of medicos, officials of transport department and weather experts to bring out a clear picture on what harm the pollution can do to us. Dr MK Madnani, former president of AMA, says, “Asthma is a respiratory disease caused by environmental pollution wherein the person feels difficulty in breathing, a feeling of pressure in the chest and cough, causing phlegm. These are caused from allergies, quality of air being foremost of them.” Air pollution could be fatal for the eyes too. According to ophthalmologist, Dr Kamaljeet Singh, “Pollution affects the cells of the eyes, due to which the problem of dryness, redness and pain increases in the eyes. Due to the presence of elements like nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the polluted air, there is more damage to the eyes.” He says that it is very important to protect the eyes from poisonous air. Avoid stepping out of the house unnecessarily due to excessive pollution, he added. According to kidney specialist Dr Anurag Singh, “Environmental pollution is extremely dangerous for the kidney as well. Heavy metals floating in the air and reaching the body through food get trapped in the kidneys. In recent times, the prevalence of kidney diseases has increased due to pollution. If we start getting clean air and water, then not only the kidney but also the spread of many diseases will be reduced.” Senior dermatologist of the city, Dr KG Singh says, “Pollution in the air is dangerous for the skin as this devoids the skin of its moisture and leads to various problems including redness, rosacea and eczema. Due to this, fine lines, wrinkles and spots start appearing before time. There are also dark spots on the face.” Pollution from vehicles too is a major contributor to air pollution. “Vehicles are being checked regularly but still lot of awareness has to be spread. People should participate in the workshops conducted by us and understand how they can save the environment. The department is continuously taking action in collaboration with the Pollution Control Board,” says Regional Transport Officer (RTO), Prayagraj, RK Maurya. According to Regional Environment Officer RK Singh, “Weather too is deteriorating air quality index in the city as because of lack of a bit strong winds (blowing at a speed of 10-15 kmph) pollution could have been less. Firecrackers in Diwali too are responsible for this.” Still the situation is improving as incident of stubble burning has come down drastically in the district and we are monitoring the constructions sites too, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/increased-pollution-weather-causing-serious-illnesses-among-citizens-docs-weather-experts/articleshow/87689321.cms||---

Inaugurating the seminar, Justice Saral Srivastava, Allahabad High Court said, “The surveyor is an important link between the insurance company and the insurance holder. The insured can be satisfied only by their fair and quick loss assessment. For this, continuous organisation of training seminars is necessary.” Bipin Kumar Shukla, national treasurer of ISLA, while presiding over the function, said the Parliament has made a provision in the Insurance Act that only a member of ISLA can be an insurance surveyor and due to this responsibility, the institute has organised a seminar to give updated information to its members. He said even during the Corona period, ISLA conducted more than a hundred online trainings.

The teachers had begun their protest earlier this month but suspended it on Diwali eve after chief minister Pramod Sawant assured to hike their salaries. The teachers, however, state that their demands go beyond a hike in salary. The para-teachers said that besides their salaries being pending over the last six months, their jobs should be considered for regularisation given the long period for which they have rendered their services, albeit on contractual basis. The para-teachers’ spokesperson Smita Desai said that the chief minister had made a promise on the floor of the legislative assembly to resolve the teachers’ issues. However, nothing has changed in reality, she said. The teachers said that they have been working for the last 15 years, alternating between teaching in two schools, but the government has not considered regularisation of their services. “The CM had announced in the House in July this year that our salaries would be hiked and that we will be paid for 12 months a year, instead of just 10. It is, however, sad that we have not even been paid for the last six months,” said Desai. The para teachers are employed under the Goa Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, funded by the central government. The teachers said they have been appointed starting 2006 after successfully completing the directorate of education’s selection process, meeting the set criteria. They have later also undergone in-service training, said Desai. “As the para teachers are appointed under a Central government scheme, there should be sufficient funds available for payment of salaries, yet it is hard to understand why we have not been paid for six months,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/para-teachers-now-claim-last-6-months-salaries-not-paid/articleshow/87691206.cms||---

In a press conference, AAP MLA Bharadwaj said that even after reducing taxes, the corporations are not returning the money to the traders, which they were forced to pay. “On October 25, the corporation said in an order that the increased rates of house tax will be reduced till March 31, 2022, but those who have deposited extra tax will not be refunded,” Bharadwaj said, claiming that BJP has come up with this new trick. “If they come back to power in the corporations, they will again charge 17 times the tax,” he said. . Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was misleading people. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-not-with-traders-aap/articleshow/87691208.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The UK, the host, found itself in an awkward spot when Turkey protested against the “special treatment” accorded to one “country” — its ire was directed at India. With Glasgow lacking in wherewithal to host a mega global event of this scale, the UK government has urged delegations to share hotels. Likewise, buses were organised to take the heads of governments to the venue of the conference. Exceptions, however, were made for three countries — the host, the US and India. They were allowed to stay in hotels they had booked exclusively for themselves, while their leaders — Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Narendra Modi — reached the venue on November 1 in motorcades. The protocol differential did not go down well, at least with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who, according to sources here, made his displeasure known. The Turkish leader, who, many observers feel, has meticulously been outfitting himself as the new Caliph, questioned what he considered to be the privileged treatment of India, sources said. Sources said the Turkish leader stayed aloof from the proceedings as a mark of protest, in what can further strain the already tense bilateral equations. Officials, however, justified the asymmetry by saying that it was an acknowledgment of the efforts India has lately made to shake off “part of the problem” tag in respect of the climate crisis and to transit to among those who are seen as earnestly working for its resolution. It launched the International Solar Alliance — the US chose to join the grouping during the Glasgow conference — in 2015 ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure at the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in 2019. Besides, PM Modi has assiduously projected his initiatives — Swachh Bharat, Ujjwala, Namami Gange — as part of the fight against the threat to climate and environmental degradation. The PM, being a veteran on the global circuit with enough familiarity with the “summit craft”, was of course, also a factor. In any case, few could have grudged the attention India grabbed after setting the bold target to bring down projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030. The ambitious goal came as a surprise, but, sources said, was absolutely necessary to come out of the unhappy situation where the country was getting tarred as the “third-largest polluter” despite having a measly 4% share of global greenhouse emissions between 1870 and 2019. Though dishonest, it could not have been ignored in view of the potency that climate threat has acquired in the global discourse and which gets reflected in the influence of outfits like the Green Party, celebrity activists as well as the emergence of “green concerns” as a factor in shareholder activism in the West. But even as he engaged with it, the PM reminded the leading polluters, China and the US, as well as the developed West of their commitment to “common but differentiated responsibilities” or, simply put, the moral obligation of the rich countries to provide “measurable” funds to poor and developing countries for adaptation and mitigation. India, which also took up cudgels for the island countries who are facing existential threat because of the rising ocean levels, is obviously hopeful of getting a fair share of the funds from developed countries and benefiting from the gradual switch to the green era characterised by renewables, electric vehicles, green hydrogen and other technologies which are sure to spell more jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/turkey-protests-cop26-special-treatment-to-india/articleshow/87692009.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Principals in fix over new OMR sheet mandate for class 9 exams||Prayagraj: The principals of government and government-aided secondary schools, which are recognised by the UP Board, are in a fix over the Board’s decision to conduct the half-yearly and annual exams of class 9 partly on OMR sheets as no extra budget has been allocated for the new system. As per the principals who would be holding the exams as per the Board directives following a government order, they are now needed to get the question papers printed, procure answer-sheets for descriptive questions and OMR sheets for answering of multiple choice questions by the students, all within Rs 25 that they are allowed to collect from students as exam fee. In such a situation, the principals have already expressed their inability to conduct the examination partly on the OMR sheets to UP Board. State president of the Principals’ Council, Brajesh Sharma said that though the principals welcome the new system, for implementing it the state government should also provide a specific budget. “Already, the expenses of all online work are being borne by the institutions and it is not possible to bear extra expenditure of OMR sheets also by them,” he claimed while talking to TOI on Friday. Under the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020, the UP Board has made it mandatory to conduct a part of half-yearly and annual examination of class 9 on OMR sheets from this academic session. This has been done so that the students can be prepared for future competitive examinations. Under this new system, now the class 9 question paper of 70 marks for the written examination has been divided into two parts: The first part of the question paper will have multiple-choice questions of 20 marks which students will have to answer on the OMR sheet while the second part will have descriptive questions of 50 marks which students will have to answer on conventional answer sheets. In these question papers, questions related to higher-order thinking skills will also be included. UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla has already sent instructions in this regard to all the district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) on November 2. According to the annual calendar released by the UP Board on August 14, the half-yearly examinations are to be held in November and the annual examinations are to be held in February 2022. Though UP Board officials are reluctant to comment on the issue as any decision with regard to a budget for government-aided schools in this regard can be taken by the state government only. A delegation of principals of government-aided institutions did meet UP Board secretary on November 9 in this very regard, said Murarji Tripathi, principal of Sarvarya Inter College, Bahadurganj, who was part of the delegation “The UP Board secretary has said that the sample of OMR sheet to be used in class 9 examinations from this session has been uploaded on the Board’s official website. He made clear that for this, no provision has been made by the government for charging any additional fee, which is also an area of concern for us,” Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/principals-in-fix-over-new-omr-sheet-mandate-for-class-9-exams/articleshow/87689325.cms||---

The general body of the NMC, during its meeting on Friday, gave its nod to the civic administration to go ahead with the project. During his visit to Nashik last month, Union highways and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had suggested the local administration to come up with a transport logistics park to decongest the city roads. He had also assured help from his ministry for the same. NMC officials said there is an existing parking lot for trucks built on 60 acre land in Adgaon. NMC is in the process of acquiring another 15 acre for its expansion. The civic body will scout for the remaining 45 acre land, which will be used for the logistics park where proper infrastructure will be set up.Mayor Satish Kulkarni said, “We already have the truck terminus land in Adgaon on Mumbai-Agra National Highway. We are planning to provide this land for the proposed logistics park to be set up by the Centre through its funds. According to the transporters, the proposed logistics park will help ease traffic congestion due to the heavy vehicles. Moreover, warehouses in the logistics park will enable storage, processing and transportation of the various agricultural produce. It will also boost the transportation of industrial goods using the expressway. The park will be at the intersection of the Mumbai-Agra National Highway and Surat-Chennai corridor, which will help in better transportation of the goods. It will not only help the businesses, but also increase employment opportunities. The corridor will pass through Nashik district. It will enter Nashik district through Surgana taluka and exit through Satana taluka after crossing 122.1 km through 61 villages in six talukas of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/logistics-park-planned-at-adgaon/articleshow/87689324.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||State may integrate Covid vax drive into regular immunisation plan in Dec||Panaji: The state government may shut all centres that exclusively offer the Covid-19 vaccine next month, and integrate the inoculation drive into its regular immunisation programme. The directorate of health services has moved a file to the government in this regard, so that its staff can productively be used for the implementation of other national health programmes, now that over 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. The integration will mean that citizens won’t be able to walk into any vaccination centre in their vicinity on any day of the week, as immunisation takes places on fixed days at various health centres. On Saturday, the government conducted a mega-vaccination drive that saw over 9,000 persons get the jab, almost twice the 5,000-odd who receive the vaccine on other days. The first dose was administered to 1,365 people and the second to 7,496. In centres that saw very few people turn up for the jab, health staffers went to the homes of people with disabilities and those of advanced age. As of Saturday, 9,68,961 persons in Goa are fully-vaccinated and 2,81,156 have taken just the first dose. Health centres are drawing up lists of names of those who can’t make it to vaccination centres, so that there’s no wastage once the team is out on the field. “Once there is a long list in hand, healthcare workers can move from house to house to vaccinate beneficiaries so that there’s no vaccine wastage,” a doctor said. One vial of the Covishield vaccine contains at least ten doses, and once opened, must be used within four hours. The state government has relied on the Covishielf vaccine for its drive. The health department also plans to have a survey done to find out where 100% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. This data will be shared with the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-may-integrate-covid-vax-drive-into-regular-immunisation-plan-in-dec/articleshow/87691209.cms||---

The state recorded 23 new infections on Saturday, with 2,705 samples tested. New infections have remained under the 50-mark for three weeks now. Active cases, too, have been under 300 for the sixth consecutive day. Over the past week of November 6-12, South Goa’s positivity rate fell below 1%, to 0.76%. North Goa’s was slightly higher, at 1.76%. One of the day’s two mortalities, a 68-year-old who had hypertension and tested positive on the day he was admitted, died within 24 hours of admission. He had symptoms eight days earlier. The second mortality was that of a 65-year-old woman from Sindhudurg, who died after 25 days in hospital. She was morbidly obese and also had type-2 diabetes. She tested positive the day she was admitted, and had complained of symptoms four days before that. In North Goa and South Goa, 59% and 60% of the positive cases respectively were detected via rapid antigen testing, and the rest via RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, four more persons were hospitalised, and 18 opted for home isolation. Two were discharged, and 36 recovered over the past 24 hours, the recovery rate rising to 97.96%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-more-succumb-to-covid-recovery-rate-nudging-98/articleshow/87691207.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||All that glitters is still gold||AHMEDABAD: Right from the gold standard to the maxim “old is gold”, and from the golden ratio to gold pass for events, the luminous treasure is ubiquitous. It is found in film titles such as “Mackenna’s Gold”, “Goldfinger”, and “The Gold Rush.” It serves as a pejorative noun, “gold digger”; marks out a champion who gets a gold medal; and defines an era of prosperity as the “golden age”. What makes the ‘noble metal’ so alluring? Satish Deodhar, a professor of economics at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), in his latest working paper ‘Gold is Old: Noble Metal in Indian Economy through Ages’ tracks India’s obsession with the metal and its religious and social significance. He says that while Hinduism has a deep connection between gold and Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess even finds mention in other India-originated religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. The goddess is often depicted as a deity with a stream of gold coins flowing from one of her hands. Minting gold coins may have started before 7th century BCE in India, experts believe. But the Vedas and Jataka tales, thought to be much older, mention gold coins. However, after the easily panned gold deposits primarily found from the riverbeds dried up, silver and copper became the predominant materials to mint coins in the subcontinent. But over the centuries, the lure of the yellow metal has remained undimmed. Kings hoard it, philanthropists donate it to socio-religious institutions, and people rush to buy it on days considered auspicious such as Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras. “We have a concept of stree-dhan (wealth of the woman) associated with gold. In many cultures, the right over gold rests with a woman and not the household,” said Prof Deodhar. “Thus, gold became an integral part of dowry in the Indian society as a cushion against adversity.” But the multi-millennia association of gold with sacredness, the continued obsession of Indians with gold jewellery, and their perception of gold as a permanent store of value has come at a cost, mentions the paper. Even today, Indian imports of gold account for Rs 2.5 trillion annually. The new uses for gold are pushing up its price. For example, a modern smartphone contains about 0.034 gram of gold as an efficient and corrosion-free conductor of current. It’s also used in other electronic goods and appliances and even in space tech. “Thus, from ayurveda to the space shuttle, the requirement of gold may increase,” mentions the paper. “Given this context, most of the gargantuan stock of India’s idle gold cannot be viewed as accumulated savings but hoardings,” said Prof Deodhar. “Possessing gold is considered as an auspicious act and Indians seem to view gold as a ‘permanent abode of purchasing power’.” The professor added: “Therefore, the government will have to adopt an effective economic policy that recycles the stock of idle gold and channels it for productive purposes through financial markets.” Prof Deodhar suggested revitalizing the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS) which, till 2018, had been able to attract only 11 tonnes of gold. “The nudging could happen by providing information that the gold deposits are not only secure with banks but they earn an interest of about 2.5%,” said the paper. “[It can also be pointed out] that there is no wealth tax, capital gains tax, and income tax on valuation, appreciation and interest, respectively and that customers have the flexibility either to take cash or gold at the end of the deposit tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/all-that-glitters-is-still-gold/articleshow/87690750.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Rs 40 crore misappropriation alleged in Ganga Kalyana Scheme||BALLARI: Ganga Kalyana is one of the welfare schemes to facilitate poor and small farmers to dig borewells so their dry land is made fit for irrigation. But irregularities in its implementation have deprived many beneficiaries of its benefits. In Ballari district, about Rs 40 crore is said to have been misappropriated. The council parliamentary committee, led by chairman Y A Narayanaswamy, has discovered the scam during its recent visit to the district. The committee members also visited some farmlands and inspected the borewells. Besides expressing their disappointment over the irregularities, they have directed the ZP CEO to send a detailed report regarding the irregularities. According to sources, Dr B R Ambedkar, Valmiki, D Devaraj Urs, Adi Jambhava, and Tanda development corporations have dug over 6,000 borewells to individual farmer-beneficiaries since 2015. The corporations were also supposed to provide submersible pumps, pipes, and electricity connections. The committee has found that over 2,000 beneficiaries in different taluks could not lift water from borewells due to the absence of electricity connection and submersible pumps. Narayanaswamy said the Ganga Kalyana Scheme is supposed to help poor and backward farmers in getting water for irrigation. “But in Ballari district, the scheme has lost its meaning because of the scam by officers and borewell agencies. During physical inspection of borewells in different taluks, we found over 99 % borewells with false measurement in documents. Private borewell agencies have have claimed to have dug 620 feet while in reality it is 420 feet. The agencies have also siphoned off government funds meant for casing pipes,” he explained. He also cited the example of a borewell dug for a beneficiary of D Devaraj Urs Development Corporation at Halkundi village in Ballari taluk. Even when the agency had dug to a depth of 340 feet, it mentioned 540 feet. Despite laying 24-foot-long casing pipe, it claimed 80 feet to make extra money. “The agency had also used low-quality cables and materials. Several such cases are in Ballari and Vijayanagara districts,” Narayanaswamy said. The MLC said a big network is behind the scam, and grants to the tune of Rs 40 crore have been misused in Ballari and Vijayanagar districts alone. “We will initiate stern action against private borewell agencies and also officers who have connived with them,” he said. Efforts made to contact Ballari ZP CEO K R Nandini for a response did not yield results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rs-40-crore-misappropriation-alleged-in-ganga-kalyana-scheme/articleshow/87688740.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

This time around, the police have planned to make the helmetless bikers appear for a test, clear the same and only then proceed towards their destination. The police hope that since the test would be a time-consuming affair, most bikers would prefer to wear a helmet instead of risking being caught without one and then having to appear for the exam. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey told TOI, “An order in this regard will be issued in a few days and the new system to conduct tests will be implemented.” “Wearing helmets is already compulsory for those looking to buy fuel at petrol pumps, and counselling sessions are being held at the Children’s Traffic Education Park for bikers who were found without the head safety gear. Now, we have decided to set up centres to conduct tests on traffic rules for the bikers caught without helmets,” said Pandey. He said helmetless bikers would be taken to the examination points set up by the police. The biker concerned will be given a booklet on traffic rules to read for two hours and then appear for the test. He/she would need to get at least 50% answers right to pass. If the person fails, he/she would be given the traffic rules booklet again to read for another two hours and then reappear for the exam. The police would be setting up seven to eight such centres across the city. Currently, as per the orders issued by the police commissioner, bikers without helmet are not entertained at petrol pumps. The police have also written to various establishments, institutions, etc. to not allow bikers without helmets inside their premises. Abhay Kulkarni, chairman of Nashik First organization that operates the Children’s Traffic Education Park at Mumbai Naka, said more than 4,000 bikers have been counselled over the past two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/testing-time-ahead-for-bikers-caught-without-helmet-in-nashik/articleshow/87689339.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Allahabad||UP Board to give one more chance to promoted students of class 10 and 12||PRAYAGRAJ: Taking an important decision in the overall interest of the students of class 10 and 12 (of the last academic session), the state government has decided to give one more chance to the students who were promoted in high school and intermediate exams without examination in 2021 during the pandemic. These students can appear in the board examination of 2022, without any special fees, if they are unsatisfied with their results. The last date for advance registration of classes 9 and 11 and online filling of class 10 and 12 examination forms, meanwhile, has also been extended yet again, this time till November 20. A notification in this regard has also been made available on the official website of the UP Board— https://upmsp.edu.in. The certificate-cum-mark sheet of 2021 will only be provided to the registered students for 2021 who opt to appear in the 2022 edition of the high school and intermediate exams, informed UP Board secretary, Divyakant Shukla. Earlier, a chance had already been given to the students of high school and intermediate exams promoted in 2021 by allowing them to appear in the marks improvement examination held from September 18 to October 6, 2021. All the promoted students, except those who have passed the marks improvement examination-2021, will again be given an opportunity to appear in the class 10 and class 12 examination of 2022 without paying any fees, officials made clear. In the board exam results of 2021, a total of 1,44,744 students including 82,238 students of high school and 62,506 students of intermediate, got their results which depicted no marks. However, these students have been running to their schools as well as the offices of the respective district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) and regional offices of the UP Board and even the UP Board headquarters, demanding that the issue be resolved. The decision by the board comes as a major relief for these students. It is also worth noting that earlier the last date for advance registration of class 9 and class 11 as well as for filling up the forms for class 10 and class 12 examinations-2022 was November 8, following two extensions already given. More than 51.27 lakh students have registered to appear in the UP Board High School and Intermediate Examination-2022 till November 8. Over 27.70 lakh students have registered for the high school exams-2022 while another over 23.56 lakh students have registered for intermediate exams, informed UP Board officials. In terms of advance registrations, around 31.78 lakh students have registered in class 9 and a little over 26.62 lakh students have registered for class 11, accounting to a total of 58,40,608 total advance registrations, by November 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-board-to-give-one-more-chance-to-promoted-students-of-class-10-and-12/articleshow/87689335.cms||---

The institute, which had witnessed a Covid outbreak during March this year, was deserted until the latest arrival of cadets of the new batch along with their parents. Speaking on the occasion, Colonel (retd) Amit Dalvi, the SPI director, said cadets can achieve their dream of joining the defence services of the country through devotion and hard work. “Even during the pandemic, 23 of our cadets cracked the necessary examinations and joined the defence services. The success of these cadets is an inspiration for the new cadets of the 45th batch,” he said. Stating that all routine schedules of the 45th batch will be carried out by following Covid-prevention norms, SPI authorities said adequate measures were in place to ensure the safety of students. “The preventive and safety measures against Covid have been arranged at our classrooms, hostels, playgrounds and the entire campus. All cadets have been instructed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in letter and spirit,” Dalvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/spi-campus-abuzz-with-cadets/articleshow/87689333.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Recruitment for post of principals in govt-aided schools to start soon||Prayagraj: Preparations have begun to undertake the recruitment of principals and headmasters in more than 4,500 government-aided secondary schools spread across the state through a written examination. At present, there is a system of recruiting principals directly through interviews after short-listing the candidates vying for the posts on offer. But on the orders of the state government, the officials of the Directorate of Education, Prayagraj, have prepared a proposal in this regard which will soon be sent to the government for formal approval, said a senior education department official requesting anonymity. Under the changes proposed, assistant teachers will now be able to apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. Till now, assistant teachers or trained graduate teachers (TGTs) teaching in high schools could only apply for the post of headmaster in government-aided high schools while post-graduate teachers (PGTs) could apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. But the new proposal aims at removing this barrier against assistant teachers applying for the post of principal in government-aided intermediate colleges if they possess the requisite eligibility as specified, he added. The development comes close on the heels of a meeting chaired by the special secretary of the state government, Jai Shankar Dubey on October 11 in Lucknow with representatives of the UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group) in which the latter had demanded recruitment of the principals through written examination and an opportunity to assistant teachers to apply for the posts of principals in government-aided intermediate colleges. State general secretary of UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group) Lalmani Dwivedi said that post this meeting, the process of duly amending the UP Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules-1998 to make the changes possible have been started by the state education directorate. As per the proposal, henceforth for the selection of principal and headmaster, a written examination of 300 marks (60 per cent marks) out of the total 500 marks will be conducted. The remaining 200 marks will be earmarked for experience and interview, another senior state education department official confirming the development said. The written exam will witness aspirants being tested through objective type questions regarding their general knowledge, educational aptitude, educational administration, school environment and health etc., he added. Principals will be selected based on a merit list prepared at the state level instead of the divisional level as done presently, he further explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/recruitment-for-post-of-principals-in-govt-aided-schools-to-start-soon/articleshow/87689332.cms||---

The old-age home was housed in an existing 40-year-old building along the Chimbel road for a few decades. Being run by the Institute of Public Assistance (IPA) – or better known as Provedoria – it was shut after being declared unsafe. A tender issued by Provedoria for axing 30 trees for a new asylum at the historic site triggered a controversy. The villagers opposed the felling of trees at a new site within the compound, suggesting instead demolition of the building for it. “We have learnt from sources that, despite our protests and gram sabha resolutions, Provedoria has sought police protection for felling 30-odd trees,” Ana Gracias, a local activist said. The site within the Provedoria compound is a historic site. One of the ruins, among a few structures that existed there in decades past, is a exquisite façade of a 17th century chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. It was at this site that the first indigenous religious order of Goan priests was set up. A few decades back, Goa’s first psychiatric care institution was established at the site. The government has recently notified the ruins as a heritage site. Initially, Provedoria planned the project near the ruins. But after protests, the authorities agreed to relocate it away from it, but the new site has upset locals over the tree-felling. “We are not opposed to the project, but only the location, as it would needlessly destroy the trees,” Tukaram Kunkolkar, a member of Chimbel Manch said. In a recent letter to Provedoria authorities, Ishwar Shirvoikar, vice-president, Chimbel Manch, stated that global climate change dynamics necessitate protection of green cover. In one of the protests, the villagers and children had hugged trees symbolically to protect them from felling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/felling-of-trees-for-chimbel-old-age-home-sparks-protests/articleshow/87691210.cms||---

Locals questioned the paying water charges to PWD when they get water supplied through tankers. A resident of New Vaddem, Shashikant Dhole said, “We are tired of the assurances that the problem will be resolved. We are relying on private tankers for water supply. We don’t get water supply even for an hour a day. It is a pathetic situation.” For drinking and cooking purposes, he said his family spends Rs 80 daily to buy packaged water. Adding, “When our children go to work they fill water from their offices in bottles and bring them home.” Another resident Manisha Gosawi said, “We keep a vigil at night to check the supply of water. We don’t get water supply, but we end up paying bills to PWD and bear added expenses for water tankers.” Festival time ends up doubling the trouble for these residents as water requirements go up. Vaibhavi Mehta, a local said, “We are troubled more during festivities. We are working people and yet we have to waste hours only to check the water supply.” The state convener of the newly-formed Goencho Avaaz Party, Capt (retd) Viriato Fernandes questioned the water scarcity in Dabolim constituency on a regular basis. He also raised doubts if there is any link between government officials and the private water suppliers. He said, “Mormugao constituency being at the tail end has no water issues, but Dabolim which falls in the centre has water shortage and irregular supply.” Fernandes said the panchayat minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho and the state government have set wrong priorities and in future there will be no water even to drink if corrective measures are not initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/why-are-we-paying-water-charges-when-supply-is-irregular-ask-vasco-residents/articleshow/87691236.cms||---

Yellow alert has been sounded for all the other districts. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a Facebook post said in view of the heavy rains, emergency relief camps would be opened in landslide/landslip and floodprone areas. “Directions have been given to show extreme vigil in high ranges, riversides and tourist centres,” Vijayan said The districts’ disaster management authority has been directed to keep vigil in hilly areas, river banks and tourist areas. Overall, rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over south peninsular India. Meanwhile, a fresh lowpressure area is likely to form over south Andaman Sea and adjoining areas by Saturday evening. It will move in the west-northwest direction and may become more marked as a depression over east central and southeast Bay of Bengal by November 15. Southern railway has informed that train schedules were disrupted as the heavy rainfall on early hours of Saturday caused landslides in Neyyatinkara–Parassala rail tracks and also along Eraniel - Kulithurai section. There will be a little relief for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta on Monday as the system moves northwards bringing rainfall to the remaining districts. Orange alerts have been issued for north Kerala including Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-issues-orange-alert-for-heavy-rains-in-seven-districts/articleshow/87690718.cms||---

The new bridge will reduce travelling distance by 12-13 km between Bicholim and Panaji. Several people from these villages who travel to Panaji for work prefer the Chorao-Ribandar ferry route as it cuts down travelling time. The distance between Bicholim and Panaji is about 33 km, however, travelling via ferry service reduces the distance to 18-20 km. However, despite three to four ferries plying along this route, commuters have to wait for long durations during the morning and evening rush hours. Also, motorists face tremendous hardship during heavy rainfall and gusty winds in the monsoon. In times of medical exigencies, people are forced to use the ferry service to shift a patient to Panaji. The student community is also inconvenienced when they get stranded in traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chorus-grows-louder-for-chorao-bridge-to-ribandar/articleshow/87691218.cms||---

The delegation said the sweeper woman could have been transferred, instead of being suspended. However, Thorat told them it was impossible to roll back the suspension order. The pregnant woman, Kira Gare, was admitted in the hospital on November 9. In the hospital, Gare was stopped from going to the toilet by the sweeper. This was followed by a scuffle between the two women. Later, Gare delivered a baby, who died on November 11. Her husband Kailas accused the sweeper of assaulting his wife. He also alleged that when Kira was taken to the labour room, no doctor or nurse was available to help her with the delivery. When contacted, the hospital’s gynaecology department officials refuted the allegation. “Nurses were present during the delivery, and the procedure was guided by Dr Promod Chaudhari. It was a case of premature birth of a baby with extremely high blood pressure. The baby was shifted to the neonatal department for further treatment,” added the civil hospital’s gynaecology department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/class-iv-staff-seek-rollback-of-sweepers-suspension/articleshow/87689360.cms||---

Seven persons were arrested with 52 unfinished semi-automatic countrymade pistols and 32 butts, which were to be brought to Munger for finishing and selling to criminals. The police also seized two lathes, two milling and two drill machines, one motor and two bikes besides raw materials for manufacturing pistols from the gun factory near Saat Mile Chowk in village Vishnupur under the same police station area in Hazaribag district. However, the two smugglers travelling in a car whom the STF team followed could not be arrested. Those arrested were identified as Mohammad Sonu, Mohammad Imran Hassan, Mohammad Nasim, Mohammad Imran, Mohammad Mushtaq Mustafa, all native of Kasim Bazaar in Munger, and Mohammad Shamim Akhtar and Mohammad Akhtar of Nawadih in Bokaro, Jharkhand. “The factory was set up to manufacture and supply firearms in Bihar. The illegal arms manufacturers of Munger and other districts in Bihar have shifted their base to neighbouring states following continuous crackdown against arms smuggling,” a senior IPS officer said. He said the two arms smugglers were scheduled to bring all the 52 pistol sets and butts to Munger. “Expert arms manufacturers would have given the finishing touches by fitting barrels, triggers, loading and reloading mechanism,” he said. He said due to panchayat elections in Bihar, one pistol would have fetched at least Rs50,000 to the arms smugglers. “The price increases before or during any election or due to crackdown on the manufacturing units,” he said. The officer said the STF had earlier busted illegal arms factories at Dumka, Deoghar and Giridih in Jharkhand where partially finished pistols were being manufactured for sales in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-stf-team-busts-gun-factory-in-hazaribag/articleshow/87689948.cms||Debashish Karmakar

His family alleges that this was because the police "misbehaved" and "threatened" them. The deceased, identified as Bhura, was a resident of Bilaspur and was accused of illicit liquor marketing. The police had pasted a notice according to section 82 of CrPC (proclamation for person absconding) outside his house. A case was ongoing in a local court, registered against him in 2010. According to the police, Bhura had not been appearing at court hearings due to which the police approached his family. The police said that the man wasn’t at home and had gone out for work. The mother of the deceased, Somwati, alleged that the police barged into their house in search of Bhura and after he couldn’t be found, threatened to beat up the male members of the family. She said that the police "misbehaved" and "hurled abuses" at them. Cops later pasted a notice at the door of their house and left. The family claimed that once Bhura learnt about what happened he was severely stressed. They said he subsequently committed suicide by consuming poison. The family also alleged that had the police behaved in a more "respectful" manner, Bhura wouldn’t have committed suicide. Inspector Tajvir Singh of the Bilaspur police station, Rampur said, “The notice was put up according to section 82 of CrPC and the police worked according to directions received from the court. There is no role of police in his death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-accused-in-illicit-liquor-marketing-case-commits-suicide-family-accuses-police-of-abetting-the-act/articleshow/87690727.cms||Maria Khan

Locals complained that patients do not find doctors in the Basti Dawakhana, forcing patients to visit private clinics or hospitals. The Basti Dawakhanas were opened amid much fanfare but the absence of doctors has become a bane for the locals. With only one nurse to see patients and distribute medicines at the clinic, locals alleged that the matter was brought to the notice of senior officials but no efforts have been made to appoint doctors. “We have enough medicines here. We are giving medicines to patients with complaints of fever, cough and cold. But there is no doctor to treat patients,” said the nurse. Congress leader Osman bin Mohammed Al-Hajri told TOI that many complaints were made to senior officials but the issue has not been resolved. He urged the state government to appoint a doctor immediately. He said that in the absence of a doctor, locals are forced to visit private clinics and cough up more money. One of the patients, Anwar, said that whenever he visits the clinic, he finds only one nurse to prescribe the medicines. “I have never seen a doctor in the dawakhana,” he said. When contacted, Dr Rukma Reddy, programme officer for Basthi Dawakhanas, said the doctor posted at Gunge ki Bowli Basti Dawakhana was shifted to Hakimpet Basti Dawakhana. He said that a doctor would be posted at the Karwan clinic soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/absence-of-doc-ails-dawakhana-patients-return-sans-treatment/articleshow/87690726.cms||Omar bin Taher

The big cat had given birth to two cubs in a sugar cane farm at Lambe Wadgaon village. However, human presence during cane harvesting forced the adult leopard leave and she was able to take only one cub with her. Vivek Desai, the honorary wildlife warden, said a farmer named Prakash Patil alerted them about the presence of a leopard in his farm. “When we reached the spot along with the forest department officials, we found only one cub,” he said. The deserted cub was offered care and was kept in a plastic container. Later, two trap cameras were installed and the area was cordoned off by the authorities. “On the same night, the leopard was spotted in a trap camera approaching the plastic container. The leopard, however, did not take the cub with her then. After two days, the leopard took her cub away on November 9,” said Desai. Honorary wildlife warden Rajesh Thombare, deputy conservator of forest VV Hoshing, assistant conservator of forest SK Shisav, forest officer SB Nagrale, guard SB Chavan and round officer GS Pinjari were part of the operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-experts-help-leopard-reunite-with-cub/articleshow/87689370.cms||Prasad Joshi

We will unveil our plan to re-liberate Goa from this second colonisation by having meetings with like-minded people,” Sardesai said, addressing a press conference held to induct an anti-coal activist, Vikas Bhagat, into the party. The Fatorda MLA further said that if his party comes to office, the requirement of NOCs from MPT will be done away with. “We will keep MPT completely out of the picture when it comes to erecting shacks on Goa’s beaches,” he said. Welcoming Bhagat into his party, Sardesai assured the people that if his party comes to office and forms government, all cases booked against the protestors who agitated against coal and linear projects will be withdrawn. The GFP president said that booking offences against coal protestors by the police ran contrary to PM Narendra Modi’s pledge of net zero emissions by 2070 by India at the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow. “There’s a direct contradiction in this — the Prime Minister assures the world of not using coal, and here the Goa government is making Goa a coal hub and filing cases against those who are fighting against coal pollution,” Sardesai said. He also said that his party would work towards an “accelerated coal exit”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-will-fight-to-liberate-goa-from-2nd-colonisation/articleshow/87691233.cms||---

A bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice C T Ravikumar observed that there should not be any adversarial approach in the matter and it would look into the issues and then take a call. “You must appreciate that this is not a one-time consideration matter. It is a continuous supervision matter,” the bench told senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who appeared for TN. The issue of seepage data cropped up when an advocate, appearing for one of the petitioners, said that the apex court must look into its details. Naphade told the bench that all the data and details have been considered by the supervisory committee from time to time. “It does not matter. You keep it ready for our perusal, if required,” the bench told the senior advocate. Naphade said Tamil Nadu will be ready with all the data for the perusal of the court. “Our only difficulty is that your lordships will find that petitions after petitions are being filed in this court only to keep us harassing,” he said, adding, “This is one more attempt to keep the pot boiling.” “If there is some evolving situation, how it has been addressed or how it will be addressed, are matters which will be looked into,” the bench observed. “If there is some input available, we will have a look at it and then we will proceed,” the court said, adding, “Ultimately, we will go by the expert committee opinion.” Meanwhile, regarding Kerala’s demand for the construction of a new dam, the TN government told the court that “repeated assertion” by Kerala to seek decommissioning of the dam is “wholly impermissible” as it has been found to be hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe. “The repeated assertion of Kerala and petitioners from Kerala in writ petitions filed from time-to-time inter-alia seek decommissioning of the existing dam and construction of a new dam, which is wholly impermissible in the light of judgment of this court on the safety of the dam,” the Tamil Nadu government has said. The bench then posted the matter for hearing on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mullaperiyar-a-matter-of-continuous-supervision-sc/articleshow/87690734.cms||---

He went on to state that attempts are being made to fuel anger against the state government, so that it becomes easier to impose President’s rule in Maharashtra. He said: “The BJP cannot do politics without hatred or riots.” He said these riots are a part of a major conspiracy to destabilize the state government, as the BJP could not achieve desired results by using agencies like CBI, IT, ED and NCB. Shiv Sena stages protests on Saturday in Aurangabad He said: “If BJP is orchestrating such violence, the Maharashtra home department is capable of bringing the perpetrators to book.” “The BJP government is working like Nizamshahi. The most important issues for the countrymen are unemployment and inflation, but the BJP has diverted attention to issues like India-Pakistan, surgical strikes and China,” he said. Raut, along with minister for employment guarantee scheme and horticulture Sandipanrao Bhumre and state minister for revenue Abdul Sattar, was in Aurangabad to lead to a mega protest against central government policies causing spiraling inflation. The agitation was organised by MLC Ambadas Danve. Sena MLAs Sanjay Shirsath, Pradip Jaiswal, Udaysinh Rajput, Ramesh Bornare and many supporters joined the agitation. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta told reporters, “No permission had been granted to the protest march.” Kranti Chowk police have registered a case against Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve and other organisers for holding the mega protest march without permission. Senior inspector Ganpat Darade said, "An offence has been registered for unlawful assembly and for unlawfully doing any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/violence-riots-in-parts-of-maharashta-is-bjp-conspiracy-says-sanjay-raut/articleshow/87689380.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Deesa, Indrajitsinh Bhatti, has directed Banaskantha superintendent of police (SP) to conduct an inquiry against 10 cops following a complaint filed in court by one Harshad Thakkar. The complainant has alleged that the accused cops not only framed him, but also extorted Rs 1.5 lakh from him. According to case details, in May when the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak, Thakkar was asked by his firm to work from home. So Thakkar was returning home in Deesa in his car when the cops stopped him at Chhapi check-post and booked him and three others for blackmarketing of remdesivir injections. Thakkar alleged in his court complaint that he was in jail for 45 days. During his two-day police custody, Thakkar, alleged that he was abused and insulted by the cops. He further alleged that the cops extorted Rs 1.5 lakh from him. Soon after getting bail, Thakkar had filed a complaint against the cops who were posted with Banaskantha local crime branch and Chhapi police station. However, no action was taken against the cops. As a last resort, Thakkar filed a complaint in court last month against the 10 cops accusing them of falsely framing him and abusing their power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/deesa-court-orders-inquiry-against-10-cops-for-filing-false-case/articleshow/87689972.cms||---

Water resources minister Roshy Augustine said that due to the reduction in rainfall presently there was no need to open the shutters of the reservoir. “As per the rule curve, the red alert level is 2,399.03ft and upper rule level is 2,400.03ft. But we will not wait for the water level to reach in the upper level. When it reaches the red alert level, if needed, the shutters will be opened to control the water level in the reservoir,” said the minister. KSEB assistant engineer Saju MP told TOI that the new rule curve in Idukki was applicable from Thursday. “The present rule curve will end on November 20. After that, the level is 2,403ft which is the full reservoir level (FRL). To reduce the water level in Idukki, power generation will be continued at the maximum level,” he said. The opening of dam shutters will be after consideration of the rainfall fall pattern, said Saju. The water level on Saturday at 4pm was 2,392.52 ft which was 94.74% of the total storage. The power generation at Moolamattom plant was 17.334mu on Friday. The water level at the Mullaperiyar dam continued to increase after Tamil Nadu reduced the discharge level and it rose to 139.6ft at 5pm on Saturday. The tunnel discharge was 556cusecs. The inflow into the dam was 4,056cusecs at 3pm on Saturday. The upper rule curve level fixed by the central water commission till November 20 is 141ft.

Hakim later asked civic officials to ensure a repair drive was taken up for all cratered roads across 144 civic wards. Sources in the KMC roads department conceded the condition of several roads were bad as adequate repairs could not be carried out before the Puja due to persistent rain till late September. “Though we started repairing roads before Puja, we could not work properly due to the torrential rain at that time,” said a KMC roads department official. Some stretches of major roads that need the civic body’s attention include APC Roy Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, Rabindra Sarani, M G Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road, Motilal Gupta Road, Diamond Harbour Road, Taratala Road, NSC Bose Road in Tollygunge and Dum Dum Road. “We have asked our officials in each borough to take note of battered stretches. Once the identification is done, we shall ask the borough engineers to set a deadline and take up repairs,” said a official at KMC headquarters. The official hoped that unlike the drive before the Puja, the work this time would have lasting results. “We have no dearth of hot-mix materials or labourers,” said a KMC roads department senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/repair-cratered-roads-in-all-144-wards-hakim/articleshow/87690761.cms||Saikat Ray

On October 9, the residents filed a complaint before the district magistrate stating that the nightclub located on a hill in Ximwaddo has been playing loud music throughout the night and day too, in complete violation of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. As no action was taken on their earlier complaints, the residents alleged that the management of the nightclub has been emboldened to carry out their activities fearlessly causing “immense stress, mental tension and considerable inconvenience” to the locals. Residents said the club had a three-day non-stop music party from October 29-31 with loud music day and night, and another similar event is being held with top DJs from November 10-13, which is likely to be extended. They urged the district magistrate to stop issuing permissions for such events and to conduct a site inspection of the club, and also take necessary action to stop the nuisance, failing which they will file a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court of Bombay at Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-not-acting-against-nightclub-noise/articleshow/87691247.cms||---

His Mathura-based friends have also been hauled up. The videographers, allegedly "with their shoes on", had entered the premises by climbing over the wall at midnight and had shot the film. Police said no one is allowed to enter there at night as people believe that Lord Krishna and Radha still perform raslila when the city sleeps. The purported video was deleted on Saturday. Though the YouTube channel is run by Gaurav Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Vihar in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, under the name of 'GauravZone' with 44.9 lakh subscribers, the FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station. In the FIR, complainant Rohit Krishna, who is a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, stated that some "anti-social elements violated limits of Nidhivan", which is considered the most prominent site dedicated to Lord Krishna-Radha and their 'gopis'. The complaint added that the men tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs. He demanded "exemplary deterrent". Superintendent of police (city) MP Singh told TOI that a police team was sent to Delhi to identify the suspects and the matter is under investigation. Civil judge (junior division) Archana Singh also directed police to ensure deletion of the video from all social media platforms after the priest approached the judge. She directed police to present a compliance report in court. A group of priests in Vrindavan staged a protest and later purified Nidhivan by sprinkling holy water. “We will launch an agitation if police fail to arrest the accused,” said Saurabh Gaur, president of Dharam Raksha Sangh. Sharma was arrested by Delhi police a few months ago for animal cruelty after he posted a video showing his dog floating in air with helium balloons strapped to its back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-youtuber-booked-brought-to-up-for-shooting-film-in-mathuras-nidhivan/articleshow/87690757.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||CM: Never left people to fend for themselves during Covid||Margao: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday reiterated that his refrain ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ was actually meant to reassure Goans that the government was committed to doing whatever it takes to help them get through their difficult times during the pandemic. “Despite the raging pandemic that saw the government’s resources stretched to the limit, the government didn’t let people fend for themselves and will never do so. And that’s why I kept reassuring people ‘bhivpachi garaz na’,” he said, speaking at the ‘sarkar tumchea dari’ programme at Curchorem. Referring to criticism that the ‘sarkar tumchea dari’ initiative has been done with an eye on elections, Sawant said that the programme was planned to be held two years ago, but the pandemic caused the delay. Sawant appealed to the people to develop a self-sustainable lifestyle by availing benefits of numerous welfare schemes initiated by the state and central government. Sawant also lauded local MLA and power minister Nilesh Cabral for his drive and initiative in completing various infrastructure development projects in Curchorem. He also distributed financial assistance and sanction orders under various schemes to the people in Curchorem constituency. Beneficiaries of the Goa gramin urja yojana were handed over LPG connections at the hands of the chief minister. Later, Sawant also held a meeting of swayampurna mitras appointed by the government under the Swayampurna Goa initiative, and reviewed the progress of various schemes and programmes implemented in the state, including projects under PM-KUSUM. “With sustained and coordinated efforts of all the stakeholders, the mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Swayampurna Goa will definitely be successful,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-never-left-people-to-fend-for-themselves-during-covid/articleshow/87691244.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||YS Vivekananda Reddy murder: Killers bought axe from Kadiri||HYDERABAD: Killers of former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy meticulously executed the murder plan and even made him write a suicide note forcibly after injuring him. In his statement to the CBI, one of the accused, Shaik Dastagiri of Pulivendula, who later turned into an approver, said: “On March 14, 2019, my accomplice Sunil Yadav told me to purchase an axe from Kadiri (a town in Anantapur) to kill Vivekananda. We did not buy the axe from Pulivendula as we were scared that people may identify us on the next day of the murder. So, I purchased the axe from Kadiri.” Recounting the events leading to the murder on March 15, Dastagiri said: Yadav, another accomplice Umashankar Reddy and I reached the house. Umashankar had already dropped Yerra Gangi Reddy at Vivekananda’s house. Later, we all entered an empty plot behind his house. We entered the house by jumping the compound wall. ” Explaining the killing, Dastagiri said: “After seeing all three of us, Vivekananda questioned our presence at that odd hour. Gangi Reddy managed the situation by saying that some important matter needed to be discussed. Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy entered into a heated argument over sharing of money and went into the bedroom. We also followed them.” “At this point, Umashankar signalled to me to get the axe. Yadav, on the instructions of Gangi Reddy, held Vivekananda from behind by blocking his arms. We all beat up Vivekananda. Umashankar took the axe from my hand and hit Vivekananda on his forehead. He fell on the floor. He tried to get up but Umashankar hit him on his rear side with axe,” Dastagiri recalled. He further said: “Yadav, who was aware of a stent in the heart of Vivekananda, punched him on his heart. Viveka shouted in pain. In the meanwhile, Umashankar and Yadav searched the house for a piece of paper. Yadav gave a pen to Vivekananda and asked him to write what was told to him. When Vivekananda refused, he was beaten up. Vivekananda pleaded with us to spare him and agreed to write the letter. At 5 am, we went to Gangi Reddy’s house where he assured us that Devireddy Shiva Shankar Reddy will take care of everything. Gangi Reddy even asked us to keep quiet as Shiva Shankar and other politicians of Kadapa have interest in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/viveka-murder-killers-bought-axe-from-kadiri/articleshow/87690760.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The issue can be solved only if door-to-door garbage collection is strictly enforced.”When contacted, a corporation official said they were intensifying door-to-door garbage collection. “Recently, we had received five more light commercial vehicles and they are being used for collecting garbage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-cleans-gandhi-managar-streets-residents-dump-garbage/articleshow/87690788.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa govt plans to begin free pilgrimages for elderly next month||PANAJI: As part of BJP’s electoral strategy to target the senior citizen vote-bank ahead of the forthcoming assembly election, the state government has commenced implementation of the Mukhyamantri Dev Darshan Yatra Yojana (MDDYY) for pilgrimages to religious places within and outside the state, free of cost. The state government is planning to send the first batch of pilgrims before December 19. The scheme will also provide free transportation to senior citizens who wish to visit prominent temples, churches, mosques and other religious places within the state. A senior officer said that they have finalised three places of worship outside the state. Shirdi and Trimbakeshwar will be covered under one circuit, while the Velankanni trip will be undertaken on another circuit. The officer said that the government will soon finalise the religious places in Goa under the scheme. Recently, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had promised Goans free pilgrimages to Ayodhya, Shirdi, Velankanni and Ajmer Sharif if the party forms the government in the state. “In today’s hectic life struggle, people have very little time for themselves and their families. It is only the religious and godly feelings that sometimes individuals seek for a few moments of peace and happiness,” states the objective of the scheme. “It is believed that by visiting sacred places, individuals obtain real happiness. However, due to their economical condition, the wishes of some people remain unfulfilled. The Goa government, therefore, endeavours to help such people, particularly senior citizens, to have blessings of the almighty God,” states the scheme. The scheme will provide a one-time travel assistance on pilgrimage in a lifetime to senior citizens to sacred places outside Goa as per the itineraries periodically decided by the government. “The pilgrimage will be conducted under the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) package as per MoU signed by the government with IRCTC. The pilgrimage tour will be organised for a group of not less than 750 persons who wish to visit the holy places as per itineraries decided by the government,” the scheme states. As per the criteria, persons should not be less than 60 years of age at the time of submitting applications under this scheme. Applicants should be a resident of Goa for at least 15 years certified by the respective deputy collector. The annual family income of the applicant shall not exceed Rs 3 lakh per annum from all sources. The applicant should be physically and mentally sound to perform the journey and shall not be suffering from any communicable diseases viz TB, heart diseases, leprosy, Covid, etc, and the same shall be certified by a doctor from the state health department, not below the rank of chief medical officer or health officer. Under the scheme, one attendant can accompany the pilgrim, provided that he/she is above the age of 60 years. Preference shall be given to the husband and wife, provided both of them are senior citizens. The scheme will also provide free bus transportation to visit the places of worship within Goa through Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL). The routes will be finalised by the government in consultation with KTCL. The directorate of social welfare will reimburse the transport charges to KTCL. Transportation will be arranged for a minimum of 40 senior citizens, while the tour will be conducted for an entire day. Senior citizens are entitled to avail benefit to visit the places of worship within Goa irrespective of their income status.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-plans-to-begin-free-pilgrimages-for-elderly-next-month/articleshow/87691248.cms||---

There have been instances of tiger movement in the district and this has led to police forming teams to go around, even inside habitations in the forest areas, to take precautions. Police said this was not to either lay a snare to poach the tiger or kill it. “We are advising people not to venture into the interior areas of the forest,” assistant SP P Sai Chaitanya said. He told TOI that villagers were being informed that if there was a cattle kill by the tiger, they would get compensation from the government. He warned them against laying any traps to kill a tiger. Sai Chaitanya warned that non-bailable cases would be booked against anyone trying to harm the tiger, capture it or poach it. He reminded that those who resorted to such a thing had been jailed last month. Last month, police detected that a tiger had been killed by the poachers. They were arrested and the case was handed over to the forest department. The presence of a big cat is detected either from the cattle kill, pugmarks or camera traps. Police teams are going around in autos and using loudspeakers to warn people against venturing into the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/big-cat-scare-in-mulugu-police-warn-villagers/articleshow/87690787.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Will not form alliance with BJP at any cost: MGP||Panaji: Stating that BJP representatives continue to approach them and are trying their best to form an alliance with his party for the upcoming assembly elections, Maharastrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar on Saturday said that MGP will not forge an alliance with BJP at any cost. “Every day one or two BJP or RSS representatives come to our place to meet us, but we are firm on not forming an alliance with BJP,” he said, adding that MGP is in talks with other political parties, but nothing has been finalised yet. Dhavalikar was reacting to the statement made by BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade that Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis is in talks with MGP to form an alliance. The MGP president said that his party has helped BJP form the government many times, but it has always tried to use and throw MGP. In 2007, when MGP joined BJP to topple the Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, MGP MLAs were disqualified. Later, in 2012, MGP had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and the alliance had won an absolute majority. However, after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was elevated as the defence minister, MGP had differences with then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, and Dhavalikar was later dropped from the cabinet. In 2017, after the assembly election results, MGP again supported BJP to form the new coalition government under Parrikar’s leadership, but after his demise, chief minister Pramod Sawant split MGP. Out of MGP’s three MLAs, two joined BJP, and Dhavalikar was again dropped from the cabinet. BJP’s Goa unit had invited regional parties to discuss pre-poll alliances for the upcoming assembly elections and had said that they are open for talks with MGP and Goa Forward Party (GFP). Recently, MGP had said that there was no progress on alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-not-form-alliance-with-bjp-at-any-cost-mgp/articleshow/87691266.cms||---

But people are hesitant to give away trash to domestic breeding checkers (DBC) who visit houses as part of dengue control programme as they want to sell them to trash collectors. But many could not do so as they remain away from home for work or can’t find trash vendors. To ensure that unused items are removed from houses, health staff are identifying trash vendors to visit houses to collect waste,” the official said.It will be a win-win situation for residents and vendors as residents can earn money from waste and vendors will get business, said S Mariappan, a resident of Mopperipalayam. A couple of dengue cases were reported from Mopperipalayam town panchayat five days ago.The drive will be carried out as part of the massive dengue source reduction campaign that is under way across the district. The campaign, launched on Friday, will go on for a week.The staff are collecting discarded tyres from households and public spaces. “We have instructed owners of automobile repair shops, who have displayed discarded tyres in front of their shops, to drill holes on them to drain water,” Aruna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/health-department-to-launch-waste-monetization-drive/articleshow/87690790.cms||Sampath Kumar

Rumour mills have gone into overdrive in the last few days, with unconfirmed reports of the winter session being held in Mumbai doing the rounds.Deshmukh, a former MLA, cited these “discussions” as the reason for him writing the letter. “As per the Nagpur pact, there is an obligation of the state government to hold one session of the state legislature here,” Deshmukh wrote in his letter sent on Saturday.On the same day, Ajay Patil, whose wife Pragati is a BJP corporator, too posted on Facebook that the Nagpur assembly session won’t be held this year. TOI reached out to some government officials about these reports but they refused to speak on record, citing “privileged information”. One such official said, “The committee which will take the final call is expected to meet in a few days. I believe that its earlier meet this week was postponed due to the CM’s surgery.” CM Thackeray underwent a surgery related to a cervical spine issue this week, and is currently recuperating.There were messages circulating on social media that a cabinet minister made the statement about Nagpur assembly session being cancelled, but the same could not be verified. Another government official said that earlier this month, legislature senior officials had visited Nagpur to oversee the preparations. “Local authorities discussed how things will be managed, considering this will be the first session in Nagpur after pandemic struck. A draft list of standard operating procedures too was prepared,” he said. But the official added that regardless of the prior preparations, the final decision is always taken by the business advisory committee (BAC). “The right to take the call is with the government and it’s handled by the BAC. We expect the pending meet to be held soon after the CM’s health is better,” the official said. In his letter, Deshmukh has hit out at this point too. “As per rules, the BAC meet must be held at least 45 days in advance, but it is pending till now. Issues related to Vidarbha are thus pending and need the government’s involvement for speedy resolution. The assembly session here must be held for at least a month,” stated the Congress leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/uncertainty-shrouds-nagpur-winter-session-amid-cancellation-rumours/articleshow/87690043.cms||---

An affidavit filed by GMR Energy explains the restoration work taken up under the supervision of Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Kakinada. Dredging work and dumping of waste material had damaged the mangroves near the Coast Guard office. After former IAS official EAS Sarma filed a petition on August 27, the National Green Tribunal issued orders appointing a joint committee which had given specific recommendations to restore the mangroves. GMR Energy spent Rs 22 lakh on restoration work. “Currently, mangrove saplings are healthy. The height of the saplings varies from 110 cm to 120 cm which indicate that mangroves are well restored,” said GMR Energy in the affidavit. Additional saplings will be planted between November and March 2022 in areas devoid of natural regeneration. The joint committee in its report said: “The mangrove area falls under Coastal Regulatory Zone-I area which is ecologically sensitive and plays a key role in the maintaining the integrity of the coast. As per CRZ notification 2011, no new construction is permitted.” An affidavit filed by GMR Energy explains the restoration work taken up under the supervision of Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/green-activism-mangroves-restored-in-coastal-andhra/articleshow/87690796.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Eating out turns costlier as restaurants in Pune jack up menu prices||PUNE: Eating out has become costlier. Many restaurants in Pune have recently jacked up menu prices by about 10-30% as commercial cooking gas rates, prices of vegetables, meat and cooking oil have soared. The United Hospitality Association (UHA) told TOI that most restaurants in Pune hiked menu prices in the last one month, with commercial cooking gas prices having soared to Rs2,000 for a 19 kg cylinder, oil prices doubling, and meat prices rising significantly. Restaurants are already operating at 50% capacity due to Covid norms and hiking menu rates is the only option to meet the rising cost and offset losses, industry sources said. Lovely Narang, president, United Hospitality Association, and owner, Food Music Love, said, “Prices of meat have gone up by about 30% in the last six months, while oil and cooking gas prices have also increased exponentially. Procurement rates of all raw material have increased consequently, thus menu prices had to be hiked. Restaurants were already working at a 20% margin prior to the spike, therefore, increasing the price was the only option.” Narang said that many restaurants have already increased prices on the menu by 20-30%. Ravish Arora, director, Incognito Restaurant, Bar & Cafe on Balewadi High street and Polka Dots, told TOI, “Restaurants that have not hiked menu prices so far may do so by the start of December as cost of all raw materials have gone up. We have been trying to cushion the rise in prices for the time being, but eventually prices of all items on the menu will have to be increased. We are in the process of drafting new prices. Restaurants may hike prices by about 10-20%. Restaurants that had underpriced menus may hike up to 30%.” Arora, who is also the director of Baker’s Basket, said that bakery products may also see a rise in price s. “We were hoping that the prices of raw material would come down post-monsoon , but that did not happen. Bakery packaging cost has also gone up due to shortage of paper. All this is going to have a cascading effect on the cost of eating out,” he said. Vikram Shetty, owner, Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said the price of commercial cooking gas per cylinder has gone up to Rs2,000 , edible oil prices have doubled, while meat vendors have hiked prices citing increasing feed costs. “Restaurants which have not increased menu prices may do so by the first week of December. Increasing the menu prices is necessary for survival as the pandemic has already had an adverse impact on business,” he said. The owner of a restaurant in Koregaon Park said, “A commercial cooking gas cylinder used to cost around Rs1,100 before the pandemic, but now it costs Rs2,000. A tin of oil was Rs1,300, but it has now gone up to Rs2,300. As diesel and petrol prices have shot up, raw material and transportation costs have also increased. Alcohol prices have also gone up. Hence, prices have been increased for both food as well as liquor on the menu by 10-12%.” Citing an example, he said, “A pint of a high-end beer now costs Rs260 at our restaurant as against Rs240 last month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eating-out-turns-costlier-as-restos-jack-up-menu-prices/articleshow/87690802.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Coimbatore||Girl’s suicide: School principal booked under Pocso Act, on run||COIMBATORE: The RS Puram all-woman police booked the principal of a private matriculation school under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on Saturday afternoon for her failure to report a sexual harassment complaint that a Class XII girl student, who committed suicide at her house by hanging on Thursday, raised against her teacher. Police have formed two special teams to nab the principal, who is on the run. Police booked the school principal, Meera Jackson, under Section 21 (punishment for failure to report or record a case) of the Pocso Act, after the parents, students and members of various associations staged protests at the victim’s house and the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), stating they would receive the girl’s body, which is kept in the mortuary since Thursday night, only after arresting the principal. The protesters said the principal had failed to take stringent action against the teacher based on the girl’s complaint and demanded the school management to issue a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the victim’s family. It is to be noted that the school management had transferred Meera to another school a few months ago. Police had arrested the teacher, K Mithun Chakravarthy, on Friday night on charges of sexually harassing the girl and abetting her suicide. T Jayachandran, city deputy commissioner of police (north zone), said Mithun was lodged in Udumalpet sub-jail in Tirupur district under judicial custody on Friday night itself. “The investigation is on. The school principal failed to take action against the teacher after receiving the complaint from the victim. We have registered a case against Meera and formed two special teams to nab her.” Chief minister M K Stalin, meanwhile, assured to arrest the culprits and bring them to justice. “The death of a Coimbatore student has made the mind sad. The perversion and cruelty of some human beasts have taken a life. School administrations need to ensure that sexual violence does not occur. We will arrest the culprits and bring them to justice; Let’s ensure the safety of women!” he tweeted on the day. Police said while the autopsy was carried out at the CMCH on Friday afternoon, the girl’s family members hadn’t received the body yet. “They are saying they will receive the body only after the arrest of the school principal.” DCP Jayachandran, Coimbatore MP PR Natarajan, AIADMK MLA Amman K Arjunan visited the victim’s house on the day and consoled her parents. In a tweet, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder president Kamal Haasan said the people who were reasons for the suicide of the minor girl should be punished severely. Pattali Makkal Katchi founder S Ramadoss said the school teacher had created a bad name for the entire teacher community. “The school teacher was only arrested by the police. It is not enough. The school management failed to prevent the suicide and people in the school administration should be arrested by the police,” he tweeted. DMK MP Kanimozhi also demanded action against the school management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/girls-suicide-school-principal-booked-under-pocso-act-on-run/articleshow/87690797.cms||A Subburaj
---||Surat||Gujarat: Suicide victim alleged gangrape in her diary note||SURAT: While probing into the suspicious death of an 18-year-old college student from Navsari, who was found hanging in a coach of Gujarat Queen Express on November 4 at Valsad railway station, cops have stumbled into grave details in her diary. Earlier, registering a case of accidental death, police had started investigation as it was not clear whether the girl had been murdered or if she took her own life. Talking to TOI, Parikshita Rathod, in-charge superintendent of police, Western Railway, Vadodara, said that the victim alleged “she was raped on October 28 in Vadodara by an autorickshaw driver and his aide”. “In her diary, the victim described details of being sexually assaulted by two men when she was going on her cycle from office to her hostel. She, however, did not mention clearly that she had been raped, but has described details of how she was sexually assaulted. We are also trying to gather scientific evidence that proves that she was raped. She did not inform her friends in Vadodara or her family members in Navsari,” Rathod added. “When she was returning from her office, she felt that someone was following her and she also dropped a message on her office WhatsApp group. However, none of her colleagues at the NGO saw the message then,” a police officer told TOI. The auto rickshaw driver and his aide kidnapped the girl and brought her to the Vaccine Institute ground where they raped her. The victim also wrote in her diary how a bus driver had helped her reach home in Vadodara after the incident. Meanwhile Vadodara cops have identified the bus driver and are questioning him for details, cops said. “Preliminary post mortem findings revealed that compression of the airway led to the girl’s death. Police are awaiting the forensic science laboratory report for exact details,” cops added. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/suicide-victims-diary-cracks-mystery/articleshow/87690051.cms||---

The man allegedly misbehaved with the staff after he forcefully entered the premises and broke the glass of an office table.

A written police complaint was filed against the PAC personnel, who identified himself as Jagjeevan Sharma.

He said the FIR will be registered after investigating the matter. When contacted, superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Raj Kumar Patel said a complaint to register an FIR has been given to the police. The complaint, filed by a senior conservation assistant, Amar Nath Gupta, stated that four- five tourists along with a policeman reached the East gate of Taj Mahal in the afternoon and tried to enter the premises without buying tickets. “When an ASI staffer, Suresh Chandra, asked him about tickets, Sharma allegedly misbehaved with him and threw his mobile phone at him,” the complaint reads. Following this, the tourist along with his family members entered the premises. CISF inspector Arvind Kumar intervened in the matter after ASI staff informed him about the incident.

---||Nagpur||Ytl murder: Docs protest in Ngp & Akola, march with candles after cops nab accused||Nagpur: Doctors from three prime government medical colleges in Vidarbha staged silent protests on Saturday demanding justice for MBBS final year student Ashok Pal, who was murdered on the premises of Yavatmal Government Medical College four days ago.While junior doctors led the protests, their seniors attached to the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) supported them by withdrawing from the duties at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Nagpur, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), Nagpur and GMC Akola. More than 750 residents and 1,600 junior doctors did not join their duties throughout the day. However, they continued to work in emergency, ICUs and Covid wards. By Saturday evening, Yavatmal police arrested three murderers in this case, after which the doctors lit candles in memory of Pal. “They will continue to raise the issue of safety of medical students and doctors on the premises of medical colleges,” said the office-bearers of MARD.Meanwhile, a screenshot, reportedly from a mobile phone of one of the protesting female students of the GMCH Yavatmal claiming that they are getting rape threats from the local goons, went viral in the afternoon. However, it could not be ascertained if the screenshot was genuine. The protesting doctors told TOI that some of them were threatened by unknown people on Thursday and Friday. “We have informed the police teams about the threats while they were recording our statements. Strict action must be taken against those goons who issued threats to us,” said a junior doctor. “The strike on Saturday was a symbolic one. By evening, police claimed that they had nabbed the murderers and the arrested goons had accepted their crime. We want thorough interrogation of this case,” said Dr Sajal Bansal, president of MARD at GMCH Nagpur. Central MARD President Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale said that the family members of Ashok Pal should have been given monitory help by now. “The doctor was murdered while he was in the campus of his college. He hails from a poor family. The government must have announced compensation by now. Is this the value of Covid warriors life?” Dhobale said.According to the protesting junior doctors in Yavatmal, although the three murderers, including a juvenile, have been arrested and police claim that the murder happened due to road rage, there is much scope of political pressure and involvement of local goons in this murder. “We will insist the police to interrogate from all angles. We are feeling neglected by administration and political leadership. We need concrete steps to ensure safety of doctors in campus,” said Dr Saket Mundhada, MARD president at Yavatmal GMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-murder-docs-protest-in-ngp-akola-march-with-candles-after-cops-nab-accused/articleshow/87690060.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said 28 dengue cases were reported in the corporation limits so far this month. “Compared to last year, it is an “alarming increase” in the cases. There is a new case every day. In order to curb the spread, we have decided to implement precautionary measures strictly.” He said the frequent spells of rain was one of the reasons for the increase in dengue cases this year. “We are conducting more tests as well and hence more cases are being identified. An area with a dengue case will be considered a hotspot and from there we will collect serum samples for testing.” The officer said 64 medical camps were being conducted in the city daily by 32 urban primary health centres. “Apart from distributing tablets, ORS sachets are also being distributed, as there will be loss of body fluid if one contracts dengue.” He said 800 domestic breeding checkers were deployed to fight dengue. “Each worker is allotted 600-700 houses, where they will check for mosquito breeding grounds. They have been asked to cover all the houses once in a week.” Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara has instructed the domestic breeding checkers to fine the residents, who fail to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds on their premises. “If they identify mosquito breeding sources at a house, the domestic breeding checkers will first warn the residents and ask them to clear the same for once and all. The residents will be fined if such conducive environment for dengue mosquito breeding were to be found on their premises during the next inspection,” a corporation official told TOI. The official said all the 70 handheld fogging machines and the five mounted on vehicles were being pressed into service daily to eliminate the aedes mosquitoes. “Fogging is done twice a day for a week in hotspot areas. We are closely monitoring both the normal and dengue fever cases in private hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dengue-cases-spike-officials-step-up-vigil/articleshow/87690817.cms||V Devanathan

---||Nagpur||NU Senate witnesses stormy debate over 50:50 exam scheme||Nagpur: Nagpur University’s adjourned Senate meeting on Friday witnessed a stormy debate on the circular issued by it, asking colleges to conduct first, third and fifth semester examinations of undergraduate courses. The members asked the NU top brass led by vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari to withdraw the circular and table the issue once again in the Academic Council for a broader consensus.The issue is not new to the university as Chaudhari’s predecessor SP Kane had also introduced a similar scheme naming it as “50:50 exam system”, which he had made his dream project when he took over in 2015. However, due to stiff opposition from affiliated colleges, the scheme never saw light of the day till expiry of his five-year tenure last year.Chaudhari tried to bulldoze the scheme and managed to clear it from the Academic Council and Board of Deans (BOD) on the basis of sheer numbers from Shikshan Manch and nominated members. However, it again hit a roadblock after Senate members, particularly the elected ones, fiercely opposed the VC’s move.Raising the issue, veteran member Baban Taywade, who was instrumental in opposing it when Kane was VC, said poor students would ultimately suffer if colleges hiked exam fees. He explained about trust which the students have in the NU exams as compared to colleges.“There will be a big difference in the scores of exams conducted by the university and colleges, as the latter are likely to show some leniency to the students. We need broader consensus on the issue before being implemented,” he said.Endorsing his views, Ajit Jachak demanded to withdraw NU’s notification. Other members, including Chetan Kumar Masram, Dhanshree Borikar, Manmohan Bajpayee, Sharayu Taywade, and Praveen Udapure also raised various points related to the topic during the marathon discussions.Chaudhari then entrusted commerce faculty dean Sanjay Kavishwar to clarify NU’s side. The latter explained that many universities like Mumbai had already implemented the system for many years where it only conducted final year papers while first and second year exams were held at the college level.He added that under the ‘New Education Policy’, the government was also bringing the same pattern where colleges would have more autonomy. Citing AICTE guidelines, he further explained that the apex body promotes autonomy among colleges so that those could accommodate latest changes in the industry.Taywade and others strongly countered his arguments by clarifying that Mumbai and NU could not be compared as there was a big difference between the number of students and colleges. They questioned who will set and evaluate papers where there was a big shortage of NET/SET and PhD qualified teachers across all colleges and even NU departments.They added that professional colleges cannot be compared with traditional ones offering arts, commerce and science courses, as a majority of students hailing from the lower strata of society study there.About 50:50 exam schemeFirst, third & fifth semester exams | To be conducted by collegesSecond, fourth & sixth semester exams | To be conducted by universityNU flays actress statement on ‘India’s independence’The NU Senate condemned a statement made by Bollywood star Kangana Ranaut on India’s independence. However, her name was omitted on the request of NU administration. The members flayed any attempt to undermine the nation’s democratic system by anyone. Ranaut had created a storm in her recent interview to a news channel stating that India’s independence in 1947 was not real freedom, but was ‘bheekh’ and real freedom was achieved after 2014.

Even as no action has been taken against the violation so far, the civic body has entertained yet another application from BJP seeking city buses for a rally. BJP city general secretary Narendra ‘Balya’ Borkar told TOI that there is nothing wrong in using city buses for BJP’s rallies and programmes. A couple of days ago, Borkar had submitted an application with NMC’s transport department demanding 100 city buses for a rally organized on November 15. NMC additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena has already told TOI that city buses cannot be allotted to political parties for their rallies and events. But Borkar, also a BJP corporator from East Nagpur, said that NMC has decided to rent out city buses for events. “We are ready to pay the charges. It will give additional revenue to the city bus service which is in loss,” he said.BJP has organized a rally from Yashwant stadium to Akashwani Square in Civil Lines to protest against the state government’s decision to stop foodgrains to a particular section of ration card holders. The transport department has sent Borkar’s application to higher officials suggesting that city buses should not be allotted for the rally. The department cited code of conduct for MLC elections and requirement of buses for smooth operations. Still, the NMC administration forwarded the application to collector’s office seeking opinion whether city buses can be allotted for a rally during code of conduct.Sources in NMC said that collector’s office has sent the application to the state election commissioner for its opinion.NMC officials said reply from collector’s office is awaited. “City buses will not be alotted till the collector office’s gives green signal,” they said.TOI on October 28 had reported about allottment of 60 city buses to BJP for a rally organized against the government based on an application by BJP corporator and chairman of legal consultative committee Dharampal Meshram.A show cause notice was issued to two officials of city transport department but later no action was taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-again-entertains-bjp-plea-to-use-city-buses-for-rally/articleshow/87690069.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Pravin Datke, the party’s city president, said that the state government has not distributed foodgrains recieved from the Centre, to the eligible beneficiaries. Datke said, “Orange card holders are being denied ration even though the Centre has made ample provision. During lockdown, the central government, under leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had sent enough foodgrains to Maharashtra. These foodgrains were to be distributed to needy citizens.” “To highlight this injustice we will take out a morchar from Yeshwant Stadium to district collector’s office. We request maximum people to join this rally because ultimately it is for the benefit of the poor,” said Datke. Apart from Fadnavis, all other senior leaders like Chandrashekhar Bawankule and party’s MLA and corporators are expected to join in. Datke said, “We have a list of demands but the prime ones are to provide immediate foodgrains to all orange card holders, as per the quota received from the Centre.” He also said the online card registration process must be simplified. Speaking to TOI separately, Datke also expressed concern over the violence in Amravati. “We appeal to everyone that peace must prevail at all costs. We are all confident that there will be no spill over of this in Nagpur as citizens here are peace loving and accommodating. All communities concerned here are mature enough to avoid any kind of confrontation. In fact, we appeal to everyone that full cooperation must be accorded to the police in such situations,” said Datke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/denial-of-foodgrains-fadnavis-to-lead-bjp-morcha/articleshow/87690083.cms||---

He slammed the previous government for wreaking havoc by releasing surplus water from Chembarambakkam lake without prior notice in 2015. “A total of 174 people died. More than 1.20 lakh people had to vacate their residences because of the floods then,” he said.“DMK government saved the people of Chennai by taking precautionary measures. DMK took proper steps before the onset of northeast monsoon. Over 19,500 branches of trees were cut so that incidences of tree falling could be prevented,” he said. As soon as the DMK came to power, the government desilted 4,000km of canals at a cost of Rs 65 crore resulting in Cauvery water reaching the tail-end areas, he said. The CM promised to evolve a permanent solution to minimize damages caused by heavy rainfall and flood in the state.However, he maintained that he did not want to politicise the flooding issue. He said a total of 68,652 hectares of cultivated land had been submerged in the rainwater. “Necessary steps will be taken to provide compensation to the farmers for the crop loss,” he said. Stalin said the Union government has not responded to the state government’s demand to extend the deadline for paying premium for crop insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/will-probe-flaws-of-aiadmk-in-desilting-water-bodies-cm/articleshow/87691270.cms||---

Instead of doing his duty, the PIO tried to give justifications for the absence of the letters. This clearly shows that he was under pressure to brush the issue under the carpet,” AAP’s state vice president Valmiki Naik said. He added that the PIO for Raj Bhavan, while stating that the information was not available, surmised that there is a separate system of direct communication between the governor and the higher authorities and hence such letters may not have been kept on record. “The PIO is hiding the letters on the instructions of the chief minister,” Naik alleged. Last month, Malik, who is now the governor of Meghalaya, levelled corruption allegations against the Goa government and the chief minister. He had said that “there was rampant corruption in anything and everything the Goa government did”. “Corruption in Goa has become a pressing issue. Goans are now realising the negative impact corruption has on the basic amenities provided to them by the government,” Naik said. While stating that the state government was busy doing corruption even in Covid times, Naik said, “Having seen this, the former governor had sent letters to the Prime Minister seeking action against those involved in it. Unfortunately, the central government took action against Malik and transferred him to Meghalaya.”  “It is the duty of the PIO to lodge a complaint if letters went missing. This is a serious matter. The central and the state governments and the PIO are trying to cover up large-scale corruption,” AAP functionary Amit Palekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/maliks-missing-letters-indicate-large-scale-corruption-says-aap/articleshow/87691280.cms||---

Batting for the community involvement, she said it would only help health teams identify areas where vaccination rates were low and cover them by involving people in the last mile coverage. The central health officials also stated on Friday that health workers would knock at every door, check, inspire and motivate people to vaccinate themselves under the “Har Ghar Dastak” programme. “Every individual has a role and NGOs, too, will help,” said a central health officials. A total of 110 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India so far. Of them, 74 crore are first dose and 36 crore are second. The national goal is to cover all eligible people with single dose of Covid vaccine by November 30. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, senior advisor to Public Health Federation of India (PHFI) and a member of the national Covid task force, told TOI that that the country was not in the last mile of vaccination coverage yet. “There is still a lot of distance to be covered to complete vaccination in the country. While the cumulative has crossed 108 crore, we need to have more people completely vaccinated. For this, we have to make efforts to vaccinate those hesitating to take their second dose by using judicious incentives and wherever needed, disincentives, to ensure that the entire population is covered at the earliest,” he said. Dr Salunkhe also said community involvement was critical and a proper communication strategy should be drawn up to ensure that the percentage of vaccination improved in all states. Former state health director Dr PP Doke, also a public health expert, said persuasion was a key factor to ensure that maximum beneficiaries were covered at the earliest. “Some reluctance has been observed among people, especially in those due for their second dose. Some of them have started believing that Covid is over and there is a sense of complacency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-bat-for-persuasion-for-last-mile-vax-coverage/articleshow/87690829.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The classroom block at Government Co-Ed Sarvodaya Secondary School will be equipped with facilities to aid online learning, including smart classrooms, combined desks and projectors. The building is also set to be environment-friendly with solar panels installed on the roof to meet the power consumption of the block, officials said. Stating that there is an increase in the trust that parents are placing with government schools, Sisodia said that 2.7 lakh children have moved from private schools to government schools in the current academic session. “Seven years ago, it was difficult to even imagine that people would have so much faith in government schools that they would take their children out of private schools and enroll them in government schools. The governance model of the Kejriwal government has made this a reality. This is a result of the hard work of our teachers and education department,” Sisodia said. The new building is expected to be ready by July next year and the education department is also planning to expand the school building to increase the number of students who can come to the school from nearby areas, officials said. Highlighting the government’s quest to provide world-class quality education to students of Delhi government schools, Sisodia said, “It is the priority of the Kejriwal government to ensure that every child of Delhi gets access to good quality education. This will promote our children to get educated and lay the foundation stones for a developed India.” “If this school is allotted some land from the adjoining MCD school, the Delhi government will prepare a magnificent playground with sports facilities as well as swimming pools.

---||Nagpur||Over 7 lakh jabbed in six days in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: Covid vaccination graph of all the 11 districts in Vidarbha is going up. Following tough measures by administrations, districts having low vaccination percentage are now going full steam with the drive. While some districts are vaccinating more than their daily targets and estimates, others have also reported good numbers, as per data on the Co-Win system. Over 7 lakh have been inoculated in a span of just six days from November 8 to 13 in Vidarbha. The region on Saturday recorded a tremendous jump in vaccination with 1.56lakh taking the jab, which is twice the average daily requirement of 75,000 to meet the November 30 deadline of covering maximum eligible beneficiaries with at least 1st dose. Amravati division recorded 4.4 lakh vaccination while Nagpur saw 2.6 lakh people getting vaccinated in this period. As on November 7, the first dose backlog of Vidarbha stood at 57 lakh vaccination which requires at least 40 days to meet the target. As the pace picked up, the time required can easily come down to 30 days if same figures are achieved on a daily basis. Districts administration have taken a slew of measures such as making vaccination compulsory for entry in government offices, using public transport, availing benefits of schemes etc. Some have warned of discontinuing free first dose while others have tried to lure people with electronic gifts. Amravati division, which is having bulk of unvaccinated eligible population, has been achieving new records after passage of each day. It started with the week at 81,000 jabs and ended on even higher note at 1.56 lakh jabs. Amravati, Buldhana and Akola have been given an average daily target of 15,000 jabs each. On Saturday, Buldhana jabbed 40,000, probably one of its best ever achievement. Amravati too scaled up to 24,000 jabs. Nagpur district alone covered 29,000 more beneficiaries in a day while rest of the districts in this division returned good numbers as per their backlog. TOI had reported that Nagpur division has backlog of 17 lakh. It needs 32,000 jabs per day to vaccinate the remaining 19% targeted beneficiaries with first dose by November 30 deadline. Over 70% of unvaccinated population is from Amravati, Yavatmal and Buldhana. Over 9 lakh are yet to receive their first dose in Amravati while unvaccinated beneficiaries totaling over 5 lakh belong to Akola. Amravati was the epicenter of second wave. Alleged official apathy had let to the rapid spread of Covid-19 from February onwards in the division. The administration now seems to have been successful in convincing people to get jabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-7-lakh-jabbed-in-six-days-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87690114.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

However, recruiters are skipping the event saying the venue for the screening process is crowded. “We skipped the recruitment drive this week as arrangements were not convincing,” a recruiter from the manufacturing sector said. Dozens of recruiters scout for potential candidates every Friday at the district employment office near Bharathidasan road. As the employment office is conducting training for youths to crack competitive exams simultaneously, both the floors were occupied by hundreds of people at a time. Recruiters said that such an environment may push them to postpone or opt for alternative recruitment options.After relaxations were introduced post the second wave, the district employment office near Trichy corporation main office resumed the weekly recruitment drive. Apart from youths, people who lost their jobs also appear in the recruitment process. Recruiters from staffing solutions, manufacturing, marketing and stock market sectors are actively recruiting youths. However, with over 300 people attending the event, inadequate space inside the employment office is making the recruiters feel unsafe. “We were given a very small room, there is no scope for social distancing. Dozens of job seekers were packed in a small cabin,” a recruiter under the conditions of anonymity told TOI. A senior official from the district employment office said that from next week they will consider suspending competitive exam classes on days when recruitment drive is in session. “For mega job fairs, we will conduct the event in school or college campuses,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/weekly-job-fair-at-employment-office-crowded-in-trichy/articleshow/87691276.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Study to evaluate risk of allergy to Covid vaccine in sensitive group||PUNE: A study to evaluate risk of allergy to Covid-19 vaccines among people with a history of food or drug sensitivities will soon be undertaken by the researchers from Mumbai-based Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital. It will be conducted by employing unique methods, such as skin prick and intradermal tests (see box). It will be done under the aegis of the product development centre of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) set up at the hospital. Dr Sunita Chhapola Shukla, founder and director, Mumbai Allergy Centre and Honorary Consultant Allergist, KEM hospital, spearheading the study, told TOI, “The contention of the trial is to exhort the government to not exclude people with a history of allergies from the vaccination drive. All such persons can be tested for an allergic reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine using such tests (skin prick/intradermal) and go ahead with the vaccination if no such reaction occurs,” she said, adding that the study is set to begin shortly. As per Union government guidelines, contraindications for Covid-19 vaccination in India includes people with a history of immediate or delayed-onset anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccines, pharmaceutical products, food-items etc. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI, “The study addresses a specific public health issue. How can the individuals with history of some form of allergy be assessed for safer vaccine administration, pertaining to first as well as second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, is what the investigators have proposed to investigate” Dr Shukla said, “A large part of the Indian population with a history of allergy or documented allergy are either not getting Covid-19 vaccine protection or not taking it due to the fear of adverse allergic effects. This is because the excipient Polysorbate-80 (a derivative of Polyethylene glycol), used in Covishield, could be the possible culprit for an allergic reaction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/study-to-evaluate-risk-of-allergy-to-covid-vaccine-in-sensitive-group/articleshow/87690832.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Two societies in Pune take to care, compassion & awareness to overcome testing times||PUNE: Self-care to stay fit, awareness to bust myths and testing to check Covid-19 spread. These were the tools that helped the residents of two Pune housing societies tide over the medical and health emergency brought in by the pandemic. Arranging the groceries, vegetables and making available tiffin (dabba) for the security guards were few of the other initiatives undertaken by the members of the 17-year-old Hari Ganga Cooperative Housing Society on Alandi Road. a vegetable stall for society members<p><br></p>“It was indeed a mammoth task to get everything together during the initial phase of the pandemic. We faced a lot of difficulties during the first Covid wave due to lack of clarity on almost all fronts. Resultantly, people were scared and not ready to step out of their houses. Arranging essential items for them was the most challenging thing. But each member of the society put in the sincere effort, helping in overcoming the Covid challenge,” Shekhar Bongir, chairman of the society, told TOI. The federation of River Residency Society on Dehu-Alandi Road also took several efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Prakash Jukantwar, vicechairman of the society who works as a psychiatrist at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital, said, “We helped the Covid-infected families by providing them essential items at doorstep during the two waves of the pandemic. This not only helped them get confidence, but also contained the spread of the virus in and outside the society.” The housing society has a total of 1,300 flats. Hari Ganga society’s chairman Bongir said they put in extra efforts for the benefit of the senior citizens. “Such residents were among the high-risk people and were restricted at home. So, right from their groceries, gas cylinders and regular medicines, we made them available everything at the doorstep. It was a tough task, but we did manage it,” he said. He said the society members engaged themselves in creating awareness about Covid-19 since the first wave of the pandemic. “To get the positive response and clear the doubts regarding the virus and its spread, we had roped in two doctors. They explained the medical aspects clearly to all the residents and also cleared their doubts,” Bongir said. The society also focused on sanitizing common areas of the premises, for which a contract was given to a private agency. “We have even arranged a vaccination camp for the residents of the society a few weeks ago,” Bongir said. The members of the River Residency Society gave paramount importance to Covid-19 testing. “We have so far carried out six rapid antigen Covid-19 testing drives to identify any possible infected patients,” society’s vice-chairman Jukantwar said. The residents also helped the infected families by arranging hospital beds, plasma and blood for the patients, while taking care of themselves. Talking about the mental support, Jukantwar said, “This was very crucial for all the infected families. We maintained personal contact with them to build confidence in them.” Over 90% of the society residents have been vaccinated now. “Residents continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour sincerely in all their daily activities now also,” Jukantwar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-societies-take-to-care-compassion-awareness-to-overcome-testing-times/articleshow/87690830.cms||---
---||Kochi||League warns of legal action against govt, calls meeting||Kozhikode: Muslim League said it would take legal action against the state government over its decision to entrust Public Service Commission (PSC) with the task of making appointments to Kerala Waqf Board. IUML state general secretary PMA Salam on Saturday said the Left government has been acting as if it harboured some hostility towards the Muslim community ever since it came to power. “The other day the government passed a law which entrusts appointments to the Waqf Board with the PSC. There are merely 100 posts in Waqf Board and they are leaving the appointments to them to the PSC. At the same time, there are over 10,000 posts in the Devaswom board and those postings have not been left to the PSC. Instead, they set up a special recruitment board for devaswom. Why can't they create a similar one for Waqf board as well,” Salam said addressing the media at Malappuram. He added that the stipulation that only Muslims would be appointed to the Waqf Board was a deception and that since the appointments are made through PSC, in future, inevitably, those from other communities as well would be appointed. He said a meeting of Muslim organisations has been called on November 22. Salam added that a decision on the further course of action would be taken after a discussion with other organisations. On Friday, the Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema had lashed out against the government over its decision saying that the LDF government, which secured a second term in office, has hastened its anti-Muslim moves. In an editorial published in its mouthpiece Suprabhatham, Samastha said a joint protest by Muslim organizations has become inevitable to put an end to the alleged anti-Muslim actions of the government, including the decision on appointments to the Waqf Board. It said that the government was repeating the same deception it carried out in the case of scuttling minority scholarship ratio in Kerala. “The government initially said that it will entrust both devaswom and Waqf board appointments to PSC. But after the proposal met with strong opposition from the majority community, it formed a special recruitment board for devaswom appointments and stipulated that those believing in Hinduism and temple worship should be the members of the board. The government seems to have moved ahead with entrusting Waqf Board appointments to PSC on the belief that Muslim community in state has become a section for whom there is no one to raise a voice,” the editorial had said. “It will lead to alienation of Waqf properties. Also the focus on social welfare schemes could get scuttled and aid for marriage, treatment, education and pensions for Qatibs and Imams could be denied by citing various reasons," the editorial had said. It had also alleged that the LDF government was moving ahead with anti- Muslim moves and policies even outmatching the BJP thinking that it can hold on to its last remaining bastion by appeasing majority communalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/league-warns-of-legal-action-against-govt-calls-meeting/articleshow/87690856.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat’s circular economic model presented at COP26||SURAT: After becoming a model city in the country for its circular economy — generating revenue through reuse of waste water — Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is now aiming to become a net Zero Liquid Discharge city. City municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani highlighted the city’s achievements at COP26 organized by Global Resilient Cities Network, Glasgow. Pani explained how the city is generating funds of Rs 140 crore by selling 115 MLD water recycled from waste water. The city aims to generate Rs 500 crore through selling the treated water for non-potable uses. “Surat city’s model of recycling and reuse of water has been widely appreciated by the participating members at the global conference. We have shown how a circular economy model can work in a city where we are generating revenue by selling treated water,” Pani told TOI. Along with recycling and reusing waste water, SMC also demonstrated the model of protecting its natural water resources. SMC’s efforts in blocking 44 outlets of wastewater that used to be released into Tapi river and thus preventing 370 MLD waste water mixing with river water was highlighted at the conference. “Surat city is generating 1,000 MLD waste water and we are aiming to treat and reuse it entirely. We have discussed the ideas of how we are going to adopt technology to recycle and reuse the waste water,” he added. It should be noted that the city was recently awarded Water+ certification as part of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and became the first in the state to get the status. The certificate was issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) for best practice in waste water management. Only those cities which were declared ODF++ (open defecation free) were eligible to qualify for this certification. Taking a step ahead, the city also scored higher points in managing the sewage water as per the global standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surats-circular-economic-model-presented-at-cop26/articleshow/87690137.cms||---

Officials said that the general OPD facility is likely to be started at Dalvi hospital in Shivajingar area, Khedekar hospital in Bopodi, Laigude hospital on Sinhagad Road and Sonawane hospital in Bhavani Peth by next week. The preliminary planning for providing required staff and medical officers at these hospitals has started. The number of patients admitted for Covid treatment has reduced at the PMC-run hospitals. Citing an improvement in the situation, local corporators have demanded that the administration start other medical services at the hospitals. Officials, however, said that a plan has been kept ready for re-utilisation of hospitals for treatment of Covid patients in case of a surge in cases. “We have a plan in place to tackle a possible third wave of infection. The hospitals will be pressed into service for Covid-19 treatment in a phased manner,” officials said. The PMC has also set up a dedicated wing for Covid positive children at one of the hospitals in Yerawada. A senior official said, “The next two weeks are crucial. We will be monitoring surge in cases post-festive season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-resume-opd-services-at-its-hospitals/articleshow/87690833.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation moots app-based system for supply of drinking water||KOCHI: City corporation authorities have mooted an app-based system for ensuring supply of quality drinking water in the city. All those who require potable water in the city should buy water only through the new system to be introduced by the corporation. Water from Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers will be distributed. Water will be dispensed from the plants of Kerala water authority (KWA) at Maradu and Aluva. The system would function like an online cab service. Once a person books water, the system will automatically send messages to the driver of the tanker truck, which is nearest to the fetching station. Once the driver accepts the order, the system will generate a pass which consists of date, location etc. “As of now, there are many incidents of contaminated water being supplied. The new system is to ensure that residents in the city get quality drinking water at affordable prices. As water would be dispensed from the KWA plants, where there are adequate quality checking devices, the consumer can be assured of pure potable water,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf. A Thiruvananthapuram-based firm has been assigned to operate the system on a trial basis. “Once the system is found to be a success, we will make it a permanent arrangement,” Ashraf said. Besides the mobile app, other modes like web, Akshaya centres in the corporation limits, corporation health circle offices, etc also can be used for booking. Water quality module of the app will help regular monitoring of the quality of water being supplied. Random samples will be collected from the trucks which transport water. The number and other details of the trucks from which samples are to be collected on a given day will automatically be communicated to officials who monitor the quality aspects via SMS or WhatsApp. The samples will be sent to the quality testing labs and authorities will take measures as per the outcome of the testing. There will be a vehicle owners’ portal where all details of the vehicles including registration, permit and other mandatory certificates should be uploaded. If a vehicle’s documents are found to be expired, then the system will not issue passes to such vehicles until the documents are renewed. There will be facilities for tracking the vehicles as well. The rentals of the trucks would be sent to the owner’s account on a weekly basis. “The decision to float an app-based system for ensuring distribution of quality water in the city is a welcome move. But, there doesn’t seem an alternative if the app-based system becomes defunct. So, there should be an alternative plan as well,” said opposition leader Antony Kureethra. “Moreover, consumers will have to pay a service charge to the corporation. This may increase the price of drinking water. Corporation authorities should take such issues also into consideration,” Kureethra said. There is also a plan for using the facility for collection of sewage from the households and establishments in the city for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-moots-app-based-system-for-supply-of-drinking-water/articleshow/87690164.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

On Friday, Delhi’s AQI touched 471 on a scale of 500, higher than 462 reported a day after Diwali. Smog with cocktail of noxious gases engulfed Jaipur’s sky affecting visibility. Health experts said it was causing breathing discomfort and respiratory illness among most people on prolonged exposure. As Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have been over 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 17 and 19 hours, respectively, states have been told to be ready to roll out “emergency” steps under the Graded Response Action Plan. Bhiwadi’s AQI was the worst in Rajasthan at 446. Kota’s air quality was also in ‘very poor’ category clocking 337. At 4pm, suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) at the Jaipur commissionarate was measured at 337 micrograms per cubic metre while PM10 was recorded at 238 micrograms per cubic metre. At Adarsh Nagar, PM2.5 was 361 while PM10 was 198. At Shastri Nagar, PM2.5 was 342 and PM10 was 157. The safe limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. “The main reasons for smog is that with the arrival of winter, velocity of air decreases. And when the velocity of air decreases, pollutants do not disperse in the air easily. When the velocity of air remains normal or high, pollutants disperse easily and does not create any sort of smog,” said an expert at Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The city had witnessed its worst-polluted day of the season on November 5 and since then the air quality improved till November 10 as it turned from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ to ‘moderate.’ It remained moderate till November 12 but again deteriorated on November 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/citys-air-quality-breaches-very-poor-category-again/articleshow/87691302.cms||---

Now, a single licence is needed for serving liquor at restaurants in the capital. The move is aimed at cutting down on paperwork and at facilitating ease of doing business, said officials. Meanwhile, a major shortage of liquor has hit the capital with the existing government shops getting ready to wind up their business while the private shops have already been closed to make way for big liquor stores. Many of the government stores are reporting shortage of various brands and they are no longer replenishing their stocks. The new liquor stores are permitted to open from November 17 and many shops are in the final stage of completion. According to a notification issued by the excise commissioner, existing L-17, L-17 F, L-18, L-18 F licences will be combined into a L-17 licence as per the report of a group of ministers that was released earlier this year. The L-17 licence was meant for service of Indian liquor in restaurants, while L-17F licence was meant for service of foreign liquor there in restaurants. The L-18 and L-18F licences were required for serving different liquors like wine and beer in the restaurants. The notification explained that the annual licence fee of L-17 licence will be Rs 5 lakh for restaurants with up to 1,000 sq feet area, Rs 15 lakh for 1,001 to 2,500 sq feet area and Rs 25 lakh for above 2,500 sq feet. The L-17 licence holder may serve any Indian or foreign liquor at any area, including balcony, terrace or open spaces or lower areas of the restaurant. They are, however, required to make sure that the area where the liquor will be served is screened off from public view. A liquor trader, who did not want to be identified, said that the capital was headed for a liquor crisis because while all the existing shops would be closing down from November 17, the 850 new liquor stores would not open in a single day. “Many of the shops are ready but only a handful of shops are likely to open on November 17,” said the trader. The trader also added that only 35 liquor brands were registered under the new excise policy till a few days ago while Delhi had around 400 registered brands under the old excise policy. “The excise department must speed up brands’ registration before November 17.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurants-need-single-licence-for-liquor/articleshow/87691287.cms||AlokKNMishra

As a channel that carries surplus rainwater often damages the mud road, local people sought the district administration to build a bridge on the road. S Saravanan, 30, who suffered injuries in an accident, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday, and his relatives at Nakkambadi village in Ariyalur conducted final rites and were taking the mortal remains to the cremation ground. But on the way, the mud road was found washed away by surplus water from the Big tank of Nakkambadi that was flowing to the Kuzhumur tank for irrigating maize and cotton in six villages. As it was impossible to cross the damaged road, the relatives cremated the body around 200m before the cremation ground.  Although a concrete road was established near the cremation ground, it was not fully completed to help villagers access the site. On information, revenue department officials and representatives of the ruling party visited the village. The locals have also petitioned the district administration seeking a bridge to approach the cremation ground in Nakkambadi village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/road-washed-away-in-flood-kin-cremate-deceased-midway/articleshow/87691278.cms||---

The two officials have been directed to submit their responses in the matter within seven days. The matter was heard before a single bench of Justice RC Khulbe. The contempt petition was filed in the court by Dinesh Kumar, deputy director in the Directorate of Earth Elements and Minerals, in 2017. Earlier, the high court had put a stay on promotions in the mining department while hearing a plea that challenged the state’s mining policy.

On Friday, a team of Sitabuldi police with senior inspector Atul Sabnis had landed at the Thakkar family’s residence in Wathoda to record a statement. Sameet’s brother Rishi said the cops wanted his younger sibling to step out of the house but relented after former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule assured to bring Sameet along the next day. “On Saturday around 180-200 cops landed up at our house, which is questionable,” he said. Rishi added that a senior journalist issued threats to his brother for “exposing” a politician. “My brother is a citizen activist and a freelance journalist without any party affiliation,” he said, adding that Sameet was being targeted for exposing the truth and “black deeds” of some politicians in power, and cricketers. Nagpur police chief Amitesh Kumar said city police only provided assistance to a team of Kalwa police that visited Thakkar’s place to serve him a notice for the registration of an offence. “Nagpur police only accompanied the team from Kalwa,” said Kumar, adding that all the steps taken were in strict adherence to the law. Sources said Bawankule and hordes of BJP workers reached Thakkar’s place when Thane cops, along with city police, went to his place to serve the notice. Sources added that Thane police were contemplating arresting Thakkar, who already has similar offences against his name for targeting politicians on social media in the past. Thane police relented after sensing BJP may resort to agitation, the sources said. A police officer said the offence was registered by one Dinesh Bane, who is a youth NCP functionary from the Kalwa-Mumbra assembly segment. In his complaint, Bane said that at around 3pm on Friday, he found Sameet’s “objectionable” tweet. The tweet reportedly stated, “Mumbra Maharashtra resident Sajjad Dhosi who was arrested in Dwarka Gujarat Drug haul case with 88 cr drugs in bags is an aide of Maharashtra Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad. Hello Miya @nawabmalikncp you your party are truly Narcotics Congress Party.” Bane mentioned that the tweet was posted on 11 November at around 3.59pm. The complainant added that there is currently a war of words among the political parties and hence a possibility that such tweets are posted with the intention of “creating more tension”. The complainant also called the tweet “instigating”. An offence was registered at Kalwa police station under Section 505 (2) for ‘statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes’, said Kalwa police senior inspector Manohar Awhad. Subsequently, a Kalwa police team was dispatched to Nagpur reportedly to nab Thakkar, but with the BJP leaders allegedly resisting, Thakkar was given notice under Section 41 of CRPC and asked to produce himself within five days before Kalwa police, said Awhad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thane-police-serve-notice-to-sameet-thakkar-amid-drama/articleshow/87690870.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Pune||Minister for participatory model in dists with low immunization||Pune: Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pawar on Saturday pushed for participatory model of vaccination for districts recording below 50% imminization against Covid-19 so far. “People should come forward and take the responsibility as the Centre has done its duty and provided enough doses to all states,” she told TOI. The minister said some districts in 11 states had registered less than 50% vaccination and it was a concern. These states would have to take responsibility and ensure that an environment was created to encourage more vaccination, she said. “Some states have announced Tika Mahotsav and some have launched Tika Vali Naav vaccination mahotsav to reach interiors and cover the people left out. The administration should work with people to ensure that they themselves come forward and help in these programmes,” Bharati Pwar said. The Union minister’s statement assumes significance while many state cabinet ministers are pushing forth a coercive model for pacing up the vaccination in Maharashtra, especially in laggard districts, like Aurangabad, Amravati, Beed, Akola and Nandurbar. Parrying questions on if coercive methods should be used to ramp up vaccination, Bharati Pawar said, “Why should anyone compel, why can’t citizens take responsibility, come on their own and get vaccinated?” She said earlier the states had complained about not receiving enough vaccines. “Today, many big states have one crore doses pending with them. Now, it is up to them how they increase the participation of the community to speed up vaccination,” she said, adding that many states such as Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Ladakh were inching towards 100% vaccination and they should be set as examples for other states. On some states’ demand (including Maharashtra) to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield, Bharati Pawar said, “Any decisions on it would be based on the advice of the task force.” She said, “As of now the focus is to ensure complete vaccination because currently about 79.2% of India’s adult population has received one dose of Covid vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minister-for-participatory-model-in-dists-with-low-immunization/articleshow/87690858.cms||Nisha Nambiar

ABVP functionaries, accompanied by the two students who sustained injuries in Friday’s baton charge incident, demanded that CO City be removed from his post for allowing violence against students. “We held a discussion with the principal of MBPG College today (November 13) and put forth our demands. Students have been demanding an increase in the number of admission seats for a long time now. So, that should be done. Besides, CO City, at whose behest the students were baton-charged, should be removed from his post,” said Devendra Bisht, district convenor, ABVP. Echoing a similar sentiment, Gaurav Sambal, one of the students who sustained injuries during the baton charge, told TOI, “The police action was uncalled for as the students were protesting peacefully. Thus, CO city must be sacked at the earliest.” On the other hand, police have dismissed allegations of baton charging students. “The students were not baton-charged. A few of them, who were not letting CO City’s vehicle pass by, were only removed from the path,” said Jagdish Chandra, SP City. Notably, the admission process has come to a standstill at MBPG College due to the ongoing protest. The agitating students have forcibly closed the college office, stopped professors from taking classes, and ransacked the examination department. Meanwhile, several college students staged a sit-in protest at Gandhi Park in Dehradun on Saturday against the state government for not allowing student union elections in higher education institutions across the state. The students said that both the central and state governments are holding their respective elections but when it comes to student union polls, then the excuse of the Covid-19 pandemic is put forward. The student union elections in various colleges and universities of the state were last held in 2019. The office bearers, who were selected then, are still occupying the positions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-baton-charge-abvp-members-students-hold-protest-against-police-administration/articleshow/87690182.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Dehradun||U’khand govt declares holiday on Igas, state’s own Diwali; Cong calls move 'politically-driven'||Dehradun: Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami's decision to declare a government holiday on Igas (Budhi Diwali) - celebrated 11 days in Uttarakhand after the Diwali festival – has brought the BJP and the Congress face-to-face yet again ahead of 2022 assembly polls. While the Congress claimed the announcement was politically motivated and it would make Igas a holiday when voted to power, the ruling BJP has slammed the opposition party maintaining that in the “Congress tenure holiday was announced for Friday, for offering namaz.” CM Dhami recently announced the government holiday for Igas, which he said was aimed “to promote tradition and culture of the state". However, soon after, former CM Harish Rawat posted a message on social media questioning the motive behind announcing a “holiday on Sunday as Igas is on November 14”. Thereafter, the government order was issued and a holiday was announced for Monday, November 15. Addressing a gathering in Pithoragarh on Saturday, CM Dhami said, “I have declared a holiday for a festival which is widely celebrated in the state. Igas is celebrated 11 days after Diwali. People from far off places will reach their homes. There is a leader who has a problem with the decision. We announced a holiday on Monday so that people got time to celebrate. When he was the CM, he announced a holiday for Friday and you must be knowing the reason why.” On the other hand, Rawat maintained that the BJP is in power and can easily find the copy of the order where he had declared a holiday on Friday. “There was no such decision. They are declaring holiday for Igas in the election year, if voted to power Congress will announce holiday on Igas each year,” Rawat said, adding that the move was “politically driven and aimed to please the BJP vote bank”. Uttarakhand Congress vice-president Surendra Kumar termed Dhami as “pinch hitter" who was trying to cover up the failures of the two "TSRs" – Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat. Kumar said, “The BJP government woke up on Igas now and was sleeping silent for the last four years.” Igas is celebrated 11 days after the country celebrates Diwali. It is widely believed that the news of Lord Ram returning to Ayodhya came 11 days late to this part, therefore Diwali is also celebrated in the form of Igas or Budhi Diwali in the Himalayan state. Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni has been running a campaign for the last few years to encourage Uttarakhand people living in other states to return to their native villages to spend the festival with their family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-declares-holiday-on-igas-states-own-diwali-cong-calls-move-politically-driven/articleshow/87690184.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Ramesh, Chandy to meet AICC leaders||Thiruvananthapuram: Senior leaders in the Congress party would approach the party high command against KPCC president K Sudhakaran’s decision to go ahead with the party revamp entailing appointment of new KPCC secretaries and functionaries of district Congress committees. The group leaders and those claiming neutrality in the party are of the view that since the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) has already declared elections in the party and the membership drive has begun, the restructuring should be stopped. It is learnt that senior leaders Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy will be meeting AICC president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi in the coming week to register their protest against the decision of the KPCC president. In the last KPCC meeting Sudhakaran had said that the reorganization of the party will be continued only after consultations with the AICC leadership. However, in the executive committee meeting that was held recently, the KPCC president said he is going ahead with the party revamp, which has irked the group leaders. Since the elections have been declared in the party, the leaders are of the view that there is no point in appointing the new committees. They will be replaced by the new ones once the elections are completed. Hence, the group leaders and managers want the revamping procedures to be stopped with immediate effect. Senior leaders in the party, including Mullappally Ramachandran and V M Sudheeran are already unhappy with the way the party restructuring has been going on despite the AICC declaring the elections. Several group managers have submitted a memorandum before the AICC leadership against the KPCC president in this regard. As the party high command is yet to respond positively on the issue, Chennithala and Chandy took the decision to meet the AICC president personally to register their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-chandy-to-meet-aicc-leaders/articleshow/87690866.cms||---

Bidhuri, who also participated in the meeting, said that under the new excise policy, liquor shops would be opened in many areas of the capital. “It will entangle the younger generation in the quagmire of liquor consumption and put the safety of women in danger. But the AAP government is not concerned about it,” said Bidhuri. The Badarpur MLA claimed that liquor shops are being opened in densely populated areas and it will become difficult for women and children to pass through the streets where liquor shops are located. The villagers are planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal with a memorandum and demand that the liquor policy should be withdrawn.

---||Visakhapatnam||GVMC novel plan to make Vizag water shock resilient||VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time for any city in India, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has decided to develop a city-level water resilience plan for Visakhapatnam. For this initiative, the GVMC will seek the technical assistance of Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA). The CWRA-City Water Resilience Approach has been developed by SIWI and applied to various cities across the globe, for the preparation of their respective city water resilience plans. The water resilience plan will be prepared under the Sustainability and Resilience Programme (SRU) of the GVMC, which has been started to continue the activities of the United Nations Development Programme-Government of India project. A city water resilience plan was suggested by the NIUA of the ministry of housing and urban affairs. The NIUA selected Visakhapatnam city for the water resilience plan preparation by involving SIWI. This plan will be prepared as part of the SRU activities by involving engineering, city planning and public health sections of the GVMC. GVMC commissioner G Lakshmisha said Vizag is in a constant state of negotiation between adversities and advantages in order to excel towards becoming a resilient city. “We invited foreign experts to Visakhapatnam to extend their technical assistance in preparation of the water resilience plan for the city,” said Lakshmisha. As per ‘The City Water Resilience Approach’ developed by SIWI, water resilience relates to how well a city is prepared to face any water-related stresses and shocks. This is important considering the increasing number of water-related stresses across the globe, such as depleting ground water, poor water quality, water scarcity, salinity intrusion, increasing water demand, poor sanitation, low-lying areas, drainage problems etc., and shocks such as cyclones, heavy rains, urban flooding, heat waves, coastal erosion etc. A water resilient city can survive and thrive through various shocks and stresses related to water. To carry out the UNDP-GoI (USAID) project’s activities and city initiatives for long-term, Sustainability and Resilience Programme (SRP) has been started by the establishment of SRU in December 2020. This serves as an autonomous and self-sustained entity under the commissioner, GVMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-novel-plan-to-make-city-water-shock-resilient/articleshow/87690191.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Jaipur||Jaipur trader gets fake bomb in cake||JAIPUR: A garment trader in Raja Park’s Panchvati Circle on Friday received a bomb-like device concealed in a cake with a letter demanding Rs 10 lakh. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said the device did not have any explosives or detonators but contained small batteries and a few nails. The series of events began shortly after 4.30pm when an e-rickshaw driver arrived with the cake in a box at Vibhu Gupta’s shop. The driver handed over the box to Gupta which had a small message on the top saying “Gupta tere liye surprise hai” (There is a surprise for you inside). When Gupta opened the box slightly, he saw some wires jutting out of it and a note, which asked him to travel in the same e-rickshaw with Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh. The letter also threatened that if he failed to pay, the bomb would explode. Shaken after reading it, Gupta refused to take the box and returned it to the driver. According to Lamba, the driver took the cake home and found a digital watch, batteries and wires inside it. “Shocked, the driver threw the box in a culvert. About the same time, we received a complaint at Jawahar Nagar police station from the trader,” Lamba said. SHO Panna Lal examined CCTV footage outside Gupta’s shop and tracked down the rickshaw driver. “We also found the box and the device in a culvert and brought it to the police station,” said an official. The driver claimed that a woman near a hotel in Raja Park paid him Rs 50 to deliver it to Gupta. The driver claimed he could not identify the woman, but police have constituted a special team to track down the woman. ‘Bomb’ design leaves cops perplexedThe bomb-like device contained three batteries, a ticking digital machine and three batteries usually used in home appliances. “The design indicates that it was a rookie job because it was a complete prototype of a bomb sans any explosive materials or anything to trigger it,” said an official. Hunt on for the woman who sent the giftA police team was examining CCTVs to ascertain the identity of the woman who asked the driver to deliver the box to Gupta. Despite an intensive search, police said they don’t have anything to confirm who the woman was.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-trader-gets-fake-bomb-in-cake/articleshow/87691309.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Health dept, Doon admin to crack down on pharmacies flouting norms||Dehradun: Following allegations of pharmacies in Dehradun not adhering to prescription guidelines and flouting drug-distribution laws, the health department and Dehradun district administration have said they will take action against any establishment found violating the law. According to provisions, no pharmacy is allowed to sell Schedule H, H1 drugs, lifesaving medicines, psychotropics, among others, over the counter. The license of any pharmacy, selling these drugs without a prescription, can immediately be suspended, as per the law. Neeraj Kumar, senior drug inspector, Dehradun, told TOI, “It was brought to our attention that some pharmacies may be selling such drugs without a prescription. Therefore, our teams are now conducting random inspections throughout the city. On an average, 20-25 inspections are conducted monthly and about 10 samples are collected. We will be conducting more inspections soon.” According to the district drug department, there are around 3,500 registered pharmacies in the city. In the last two days, the chief medical officer of Dehradun, along with drug department officials, inspected three pharmacies and two clinics. Samples were also collected for testing from these establishments. “While there was no evidence of sales without prescription, we found issues with the registration documents of two of the establishments we inspected. We have issued notices to them. The clinics were also not up to date with their papers. As this is a serious medical lapse, we instructed them to fix the issue and follow all norms of the Medical Establishment Act,” said CMO, Dehradun, Dr Manoj Upreti. The sale records and stock register of the pharmacies were also scrutinised during the exercise. Officials are especially concerned about the illegal sale of addictive drugs around the educational institutions of the city. “We don’t want the younger generation to have access to any pharmaceutical without a doctor’s recommendation for fear of addiction. Our staff will be on the lookout for any violations. Strict action will be taken against all offenders,” said the CMO. While a majority of pharmacy owners scrapped the allegations of selling addictive drugs over the counter, a pharmacist at a Dalanwala-based shop, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “Big pharmacy brands are very particular about prescriptions but the smaller companies don’t pay that much attention to it. Over the years, we have become familiar with a lot of our clientele. So, we make exceptions for them every now and then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/health-dept-doon-admin-to-crack-down-on-pharmacies-flouting-norms/articleshow/87690294.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The arrests were made after police received credible information that a gang of drug peddlers from Mumbai was operative in the jungle around Sweet Lake in Arambol. Arambol beach is visited by both domestic and foreign tourists. “After a tip-off, some cops posed as prospective customers to establish contact with the peddlers. Their location was confirmed.

---||Delhi||GK-1 market to get multilevel parking to ease congestion||New Delhi: Keeping in mind the acute shortage of parking space in the city and residents struggling daily, South Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to construct a multilevel shuttle car parking facility in Greater Kailash-1 M-Block market. With an estimated total cost of over Rs 63 crore, the parking facility will have the capacity to hold 399 vehicles on seven floors. The corporation in the past has constructed other automated parking lots in Lajpat Nagar and Green Park areas. When it was first planned in 2017, this shuttle parking lot was supposed to have a capacity of 200 cars. In October, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti wrote a letter to the standing committee, stating the M-Block market is prone to traffic congestion due to lack of sufficient parking space. “The new kind of shuttle parking system will park the vehicles at a floor wherever there is space after the car is left at a designated spot. The automated parking system will select the floor as well as the available vacant spot on that floor where the vehicle can be parked,” said an official. SDMC has finalised the agency, which will construct the parking lot and be responsible for its operation and maintenance for 10 years. The work is expected to be completed in the next 18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gk-1-market-to-get-multilevel-parking-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/87691318.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ind-NZ T20I: ‘Curating’ it right for special debuts||Jaipur: The statistics at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium heavily favours India. In 13 matches, 12 ODIs and a solo Test, India have won eight and drawn one. A happy hunting ground for the home team it seems. But the fact that India will be back at the venue after eight long years, makes these results irrelevant. More so, because with the India-New Zealand match on Wednesday, T20 internationals make their first appearance at the stadium. Other high-profile debuts on the day would be of former captain Rahul Dravid as India head coach and Rohit Sharma as the full-time T20I skipper. The day will herald a fresh start for so many involved and to ensure the hype is matched and the standards are met, the central zone pitch curator Taposh Chatterjee has been ‘protecting’ the wicket well. “As we were aware of the match date, we have protected the pitch from overuse and underuse to ensure the juice remains and the pitch is not slow. It has been tested during Colvin Shield, Under-19 matches, practice matches for state senior team and senior women challenger trophy,” the curator said. He added that the strip at the centre will be used for the match. “The simple reason behind using the fifth strip was to make sure that the seats are not killed and the dressing room is easily visible. These permutations and combinations have to be kept in mind. Since it is only one match, we could make it possible. During the IPL we invariably have to keep rotating the wickets to avoid overuse,” Chatterjee said.The USP of the shortest format of the game is its high-scoring nature, and what’s it without skyscrapers? “People should get value for money they spent on tickets to watch a T20 match. Expectation is of witnessing good high-scoring matches. So keeping that in mind a wicket has to be readied. In T20s if there is no consistent bounce, it cannot be a high-scoring pitch or if there is lateral movement it becomes difficult to score,” the curator mentioned. The match night will be a ‘special occasion’ for many and Chatterjee will be one of them, “For Rajasthan it is a very happy moment as an international match is happening after eight years. Since it is my home state I am putting in extra effort to ensure everything goes well,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ind-nz-t20i-curating-it-right-for-special-debuts/articleshow/87691315.cms||---

Elaborating the acronym ‘JAM’, Shah said, “Akhilesh has come in the field with JAM that means Jinnah (Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan), Azam Khan (SP member) and Mukhtar (jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari). While Yogi Ji’s ‘JAM’ means Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar cards and Mobile for everyone to eradicate corruption from its root. Now, people have to decide which JAM they would prefer.” He also publicly endorsed Yogi’s leadership and portrayed him as the next CM after polls. “I’m appealing you to give all Vidhan Sabha seats in Azamgarh to BJP so that Yogi could be made CM again,” Shah added.

He was speaking after inauguratingLaying the foundation of a university, Shah suggested it be named after Hindu warrior king and Rajbhar icon Suheldev, who fought battles to oust the invaders, in a clear message to woo the Rajbhar community and politically decimate the nascent OP Rajbhar-Samajwadi Party electoral alliance. Yogi announced that the university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev. “On behalf of the state government, I announce that the state university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev,” he said. “A place which had turned into a hub of extremists and a harbour for terror modules in the past several years, is now going to be converted into a place of Goddess Saraswati. The era of change for Azamgarh, which had converted into ‘adda’ (den) of anti-national activities, has begun,” Shah said. “We expected seats from Azamgarh in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly polls but failed to get them.

The health department will carry out a massive door-to-door survey to create the data bank of the lifestyle diseases among the people in the state and to study the reasons behind it. A mobile application is being readied under the ehealth programme for this, said the minister. This will be a comprehensive survey comprising data of people living with lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, COPD, oral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. The campaign is intended to create an awareness among the people on the diseases caused due to our lifestyle. Unhealthy eating habits, use of tobacco, addiction to liquor and lack of exercise are causing the lifestyle diseases among the youth. When a data bank is created, the health department will be able to launch campaigns focussing specific target groups for creating awareness, said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lifestyle-diseases-registry-in-the-works-minister/articleshow/87690887.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Curfew in Amravati after fresh violence||NAGPUR/NASHIK/AURANGABAD: As violence erupted in various parts of Amravati during the Saturday bandh call by saffron outfits, police imposed a four-day curfew and also shut down Internet there. Saturday’s bandh call was in response to Friday’s protest rallies by Muslim organisations to condemn the recent violence in Tripura. The rally witnessed stone pelting in which shops were damaged, leading to the bandh call. Internet services will remain suspended for three days to prevent the spread of rumours that fuel violence, said city police commissioner Arti Singh. On Saturday, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags and raising slogans, came out on the streets in Rajkamal Chowk area. Some people hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, police said, adding that the cops lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control. To aid the police force there, about hundred cops and 10 officers from Nagpur have been sent. Also, One or two companies of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) are expected to reach Amravati soon. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. The Nashik rural police have so far booked close to 1,500 people on charges of rioting, robberies, attempt to murder and assault . Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it was wrong to organise rallies in the state for an incident that “never occurred”. Meanwhile, the ministry of home affairs has said that news reports circulating on the social media about vandalism at a mosque in Tripura are fake and are a complete misrepresentation of facts. There has been no damage to the mosque in Kakraban area of Gomati district of Tripura, the MHA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curfew-in-amravati-after-fresh-violence/articleshow/87692043.cms||---

---||Delhi||EDMC to send teachers abroad to upgrade skills||New Delhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation will send its teachers to foreign universities to upgrade their skills. This is the first time in the city that a corporation is going to send its teachers to study abroad. Corporation schools, which have a relatively poor image regarding the quality of education, hope that the new learning styles acquired by teachers will fill in any teaching gaps. “We will be sending our teachers to foreign universities to study in teacher training-related programmes. EDMC will sponsor their entire education,” said Vikas Anand, commissioner for the corporation. Foreign training of government staff like civil servants has been taking place since 2001. Delhi government also has sent teachers to foreign universities to gain international exposure. As per the scheme, EDMC will sponsor two teachers for training at a reputed foreign university in the first year. There are around 5,000 teachers in corporation schools, including principals. Only regular teachers employed at corporation schools for more than 10 years with an impeccable professional record and not more than 42-years-old are eligible for the sponsorship. The teachers will get admissions in the top 100 institutes as per the Times Higher Education World University rankings published every year. They can take up subjects like public education, special education, developments in education and the use of digital technology in education. The maximum time allowed for a course is three years. Teachers will have to send reports of performance back to the corporation for further funding. Under the scheme, the maximum amount of funding approved by the corporation is Rs 75 lakhs per annum per teacher, including tuition fee, accommodation, living allowance, books and study material and travelling to and fro. If the person fails to complete the foreign study programme, then the person will have to return the funds spent by the corporation. EDMC has now started inviting applications for the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-send-teachers-abroad-to-upgrade-skills/articleshow/87691339.cms||---

A consumer court in the city on Friday made this observation while not only asking United Insurance Company Ltd to pay the entire treatment bill to a resident of Harni-Warasia Ring Road, who was infected with Covid-19, but also directing the civic body and state government’s health department to inquire and act against hospitals which charged more than the capped treatment rates set by VMC. Alpa Fadia had approached Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum after the insurance company did not pay the claim amount of Rs 1.2 lakh for her husband Mayank’s Covid-19 treatment. Mayank was admitted to a private Covid-designated hospital in April and had paid over Rs 2.2 lakh for the treatment. The couple had submitted a claim to the insurance company to reimburse the treatment expenses as Mayank was covered under the Corona Kavach policy. But they were paid only a part of the bill amount by the insurance company as it cited VMC’s notification. The notification had capped the ward rates at Rs 8,500 for a day which would also include pathology and medicine charges. During the hearing of the case, the couple’s lawyer argued that they are entitled to get the full amount as they had nothing to do with the VMC’s notification. It was also argued that if the insurance company believes that the hospital had charged more, then it should complain to the VMC against the hospital. The consumer forum presided by I C Shah upheld the arguments and also noted that the insurance company is duty-bound to reimburse the full amount to the claimant as per the contract of insurance. “If at all the insurance company feels that the hospital has charged an exorbitant amount as against the package charges fixed by the VMC then the insurance company should initiate appropriate legal proceedings against the hospital and should approach the authorities of VMC,” the court noted. The court directed the insurance company to pay the remaining amount to the couple with 9% interest and a compensation of Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/reimburse-entire-covid-bill-court-orders-insurer/articleshow/87690267.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The victim lodged a complaint with the Kondhwa police on Friday. Police inspector Gokul Raut of Kondhwa police station told TOI that on October 13, the man received a text message stating that the bank application had been blocked as he had not updated his PAN card details. “There was also a link in the text message asking the receiver to update his PAN details online using a form which will pop-up once he clicks the link,” said Raut. “The man clicked on the link and a form opened on his cell phone. He filled in his bank account details and pressed submit. Within a few minutes, he received a call from a man who claimed to be a representative of the bank. He asked the victim if he had received a text message with a four-digit OTP. The victim then told the fraudster the OTP following which the suspects siphoned off the money from his account,” said Raut. “Police are trying to establish the money trail.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Three-fold rise in digital eye strain in kids, say studies||HYDERABAD: With children and teenagers spending more time on the computer or mobile phone, thanks to online classes in view of Covid-19 pandemic, city eye specialists have reported increase in the number of cases related to digital eye strain (DES). Compared with the pre-pandemic period, the DES cases have increased by about three-fold among students. This is because they are spending about six hours a day on an average before the screen as against two to three hours a day in the pre-Covid-19 era. Various research studies, including those in Hyderabad in the last 20 months, reveal that DES has become a common eye problem in the city. The common ophthalmological problem encountered by children and adults due to DES is itching in the eyes. Other DES problems are double vision, headache, dry eye and seeing halos around things. One such study published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology reveals that the most common digital device used during the pandemic was smartphone. Computers and laptops come the next. About 60% of subjects studied as part of the research had said they use smartphones. And about 50% of the users had complained of DES. The research study suggested that “parents should be considerate about duration, type and distance of digital device use by their children to avoid DES”. Dr Narahari Y, consultant eye surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, said digital eye strain has emerged as the most common problem. “Constant staring at screen for long time, more so for children, does cause lot of ill effects on the eyes,” he said. Stating that for a normal individual, blinking rate is 10 to 12 times a minute, he said when one uses computer or mobile phones, the blinking rate drops to five or six times a minute. “This is the main reason for the DES. To overcome this is, try blinking frequently. The rule is to look at any object at 20 feet distance after 20 minutes of screen time for 20 seconds,” Narhari suggested. Dr Suresh Kumar Panuganti, expert in paediatric critical care and paediatrics, said one in four children who spend more than three hours before digital devices complain of DES or computer vision syndrome. He advises that one should use screens in proper lighting and change the resolution and increase the font size.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-fold-rise-in-digital-eye-strain-in-kids-studies/articleshow/87690899.cms||Syed Akbar

The increasing number of jellyfish at the beach is posing threat to tourism as people hesitate to venture into the sea for joy rides on water bikes, kayaks or scuba diving. Scuba divers found the presence of jellyfish at the beach while they were giving training to students. Jellyfish stings are usually harmless to humans but cause irritation and in a few cases, sting from a toxic jellyfish could require medical care. “ Here, most of them are yellow jellyfish. Exactly two years ago, Goa beaches were invaded by jellyfish swarms and around 90 people were stung at various beaches in 48 hours,” a scuba diver, Balarama Naidu, told TOI. He said jellyfish stings can cause a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Around 150 million people are stung by them each year across globe. He said scuba divers have found yellow jellyfish swarms in recent times. Yellow jellyfish are less dangerous than Australian box jellyfish. Their increasing numbers have been attributed to sea warming and increased pollution. Jellyfish bloom was reported off the coast of Visakhapatnam for first time in 2018. Around three to five thousand people visit Rushikonda beach every day on an average and it would be more than 10,000 on weekends or tourist season. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Mumbai beaches spot jellyfish bloom post-monsoon. However, there are jellyfish invasions throughout the year. “The rise in numbers of jellyfish indicates reduction in fish population. Jellyfish swarms also damage fishing nets. Jellyfish population is at its peak between September to January meaning monsoon season to non-monsoon season,” a researcher, P Srinivasa Rao, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/watch-out-for-jellyfish-killjoys-at-rushikonda-beach-next-time/articleshow/87690247.cms||Siva G
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Promotion of 18 engineering college principals reversed||Thiruvananthapuram: Left with no other choice to circumvent a high court order that directed the state government to follow the AICTE norms strictly for promotion of principals in government engineering colleges, the higher education department has reversed the promotion of 18 engineering college principals with retrospective effect from 2009. Through an order dated November 11, 2021, the higher education department has also promoted with retrospective effect 43 engineering faculties as engineering college principals. However, almost all the faculties who have been given back their due promotion have already retired from the service. But they would be eligible to claim the monitory benefits with retrospective effect. Those who have been demoted from service include Kerala Technological University vice-chancellor Dr M S Rajashree and Dr Byjubai T P, in-charge of director of technical education. Under the pressure from Left teachers’ union, the state government had been flouting AICTE norms in promotions. Instead of the competitive norms of AICTE, the Left union used to bat for seniority-based promotion. Though selection of eligible candidates through a selection process, including interview, is what AICTE recommends for the promotion to principal post, the Left unions never let the government follow the norms. When the UDF government adopted the AICTE norms and conducted the selection process, the Left union leaders boycotted the same. Further, when the LDF government came back to power in 2016, those who were promoted via the selection process was demoted and the seniority wise promotion was brought back. However, the high court struck down the seniority wise promotion in 2019. As the Supreme Court too refused to quash the HC order, the government was left with no other choice but to implement the order in letter and spirit. Following the retrospective promotion and demotion, several engineering college principals will have to pay back the excess salary they had received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/promotion-of-18-engineering-college-principals-reversed/articleshow/87690901.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘New vax manufacturing capacities could be of little use’||HYDERABAD: With the past one and a half years seeing the creation of massive manufacturing capacities in India to churn out millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines, what happens once the pandemic is over? Some feel that these new capacities created to fight the dreaded SARS-CoV-2 virus could help the world be better prepared to tackle any future pandemics, especially when it comes to mRNA vaccine technology where players like Biological E and Bharat Biotech are injecting investments. “Our mRNA (investment) is in early stages but the technology platform can be utilised not just for Covid-19 but also for other infectious diseases and immunotherapeutics in the future,” said Mahima Datla, managing director, Biological E Ltd. However, there are others who feel that much of new capacities could end up being a dud investment, especially for the pharma players that jumped into vaccine bandwagon to cash in on the Covid-19 rush. Here, vaccine industry experts pointed to the integrated vaccine complex set up by state-run HLL Biotech Ltd (HBL) at Chengalpattu on Chennai’s outskirts nearly nine years ago that has not produced a single vaccine and has been lying idle even through the Covid-19 pandemic when capacity shortages were hampering the government’s vaccination drive. “Those who got into the vaccine business from the Covid point of view will find it difficult to sustain as they don’t have any other vaccine,” said Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella. “We will also have excess capacities (Covid-19) everywhere but we are not relying on Covid vaccines (for revenue). We have children’s vaccines for sustainable revenues. So whatever (revenues) comes with Covid is just a bonus,” Ella added. Agreeing, Indian Immunologicals Ltd managing director Dr K Anand Kumar pointed out that while existing vaccine manufacturers will find some way to use excess capacities either through expansion or for new vaccines in their pipeline, but for the new players it may turn out to be a waste as vaccine manufacturing is not their core competency. The top honcho of another vaccine company pointed out that many of the new entrants, who have bought a lot of raw material like filters, media for growing virus and other plastic consummables, may have to end up selling them to existing vaccine manufacturers as they don’t have any vaccine pipeline. However, Ella felt that overcapacity would be unsustainable and could even be dangerous. “This problem (Covid) whenever it is gone all these capacities are going to be idle. There is no way of replacing it with another product and that could be downright dangerous.” He cited the example of China where excess capacities in the 1990s in government-run vaccine facilities in various provinces proved to be unsustainable and led to their merger into China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPGC) or Sinopharm as it is more commonly referred to today. Bulk Drugs Manufacturers’ Association (BDMA) national president (emeritus) M Narayan Reddy said it was too early yet to say how long the capacities created for Covid-19 would be utilised as there was no clarity on whether it would require an annual booster or not. Reddy’s company Virchow Biotech is one of the manufacturers of Russian vaccine Sputnik V in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-vax-mfg-capacities-could-be-of-little-use/articleshow/87690905.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

One of the minister who met Nadda is Mahender Singh Thakur, in charge of Mandi parliamentary seat, but the BJP failed to put an impressive show and lost the seat to the Congress candidate. The other minister who met Nadda was Ram Lal Markanda. It is assumed the both ministers apprised Nadda about the reasons that had led to the debacle of party in Mandi parliamentary seat.In the 2019 parliamentary election, BJP had won Mandi seat by a margin of 4,05,459 votes, but in the recently held by-election the BJP lost this seat by a margin of 7,490 votes. The party had appointed jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur as in charge for the by-election of Mandi parliamentary seat and education minister Govind Singh Thakur was appointed as the co-incharge while Sundernagar MLA Rakesh Jamwal was the coordinator. While the BJP was confident of winning this seat for consecutive third time, party failed to perform impressively in tribal areas, including Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur district beside Kullu, especially in Manali assembly area represented by Govind Singh Thakur himself.The ruling BJP’s dream of victory in Mandi parliamentary seat was shattered in nine out of 17 assembly constituencies as in nine assembly constituencies Congress took the lead while BJP could take lead in eight assembly constituencies only. The BJP high command has called a report from the state leadership on the reasons for the defeat in the by-election. The BJP high command has already held a meeting in Delhi before summoning the report. Apart from the state leadership, separate reports have been sought from the in-charges, office bearers, district and divisional presidents of parliamentary constituencies as well as party candidates who entered the election season in the by-elections. After receiving the report, the BJP high command will brainstorm on the reasons for the defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/poor-show-in-byelections-2-hp-ministers-meet-nadda/articleshow/87691338.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and private water operator — Orange City Water Private Ltd (OCW) have discontinued the supply citing that the connections are illegal. Congress corporator Sneha Nikose, BSP corporator Mamta Sahare and some residents staged ‘Jal tyaag’ agitation in front of the office of OCW from 9.30am for three hours and later in front of the office of guardian minister Nitin Raut at 5pm. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) members lodged a complaint against the private operator with Jaripatka police station on Saturday. According to Nikose, the 2,000 houses in “the three oldest localities in the city” were drawing water without meters for the last many years from an old pipeline. “OCW laid new pipeline and gave connections to houses having water meters and disconnected supply to old pipeline. Thus, around 2,000 houses stopped getting water,” said Nikose. The corporator claimed that the 2,000 houses were ready to complete formalities and take water connection from the new pipeline. “OCW demanded Rs6,000 for new connection, which is a big amount for these people. Discussions were underway with NMC to give instalment facility but OCW disconnected supply without any intimation,” she said. Nikose also said that Raut has directed NMC officials to restore water supply within 24 hours. “His staff contacted the minister who was not in the city and informed him about the issue. Raut also said that new connections will be given from new pipeline before November 30 and payment of Rs6,000 can be done in three equal instalments,” she said. Nikose, Sahare and others ended their agitation by having water after Raut’s directives to NMC officials. NMC superintending engineer Manoj Talewar did not respond to TOI calls and messages while OCW chose not to comment on the matter. AAP members in their police complaint alleged that OCW discontinued water supply from old pipeline without any intimation to the people, leaving large number of families without drinking water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/supply-cut-4-days-ago-no-water-to-2000-houses-in-3-areas/articleshow/87690906.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Senior inspector Ashok Kadam of the Cantonment police said, “Gaikwad runs a placement agency in the Camp area and refers job aspirants to Gosavi. Three job aspirants, who had lodged a complaint with the police, claimed that Gosavi and Gaikwad duped them of Rs4 lakh in 2020 by promising them employment in the hospitality industry in Malaysia. Gaikwad had gone to Dubai and we arrested her as soon as she came back.” The Cantonment police on Thursday took custody of Gosavi in the cheating case. He was arrested on October 29 from a lodge in Katraj in the job fraud case registered with the Faraskhana police. Kadam said, “The duped job aspirants were unemployed and approached Gaikwad seeking placement in the hospitality sector. She charged money and referred them to Gosavi. The trio visited Mumbai and Gosavi processed their documents in February-March 2020. Gaikwad and Gosavi failed to provide jobs to the trio, though. When they demanded their money back, Gosavi issued threats to them.” The Pune police have registered three cases against Gosavi with the Faraskhana, Cantonment and Wanowrie police stations. The first case of cheating was registered against him in Faraskhana in 2018 and had been evading arrest since then. The police swung into action after a selfie of Gosavi with actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan during the cruise drug bust went viral. He was arrested on October 29 and is still in judicial custody||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-more-held-in-cheating-case-involving-ncb-witness-gosavi/articleshow/87690902.cms||---

The CM has deputed home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali and senior officers including chief secretary Somesh Kumar and special chief secretary K Rama Krishna Rao to the meeting. The 29th SZC meeting will be chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah and attended by chief ministers, ministers and officials from southern states — AP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Union territories, apart from Telangana. KCR was supposed to attend the meeting to be held in the neighbouring state. But due to the friction with the Centre over various issues including the recent fight over paddy procurement, the chief minister has decided to depute his minister and other officials, sources said. “KCR feels that even if he participates in the meeting it would be of little use as many decisions taken in earlier meetings have not been implemented,” a senior TRS leader said. This is not the first time that KCR has skipped meetings involving the Centre. Earlier, he skipped Niti Aayog meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February this year. Official sources said the Telangana government has firmed up an agenda with 26 items for the council meeting. “The major issue that has been listed in the agenda is irrigation projects such as Palamuru-Ranga Reddy and Nakkalagandi project on Krishna river. While AP and Karnataka have complained that Telangana has not submitted a detailed project report (DPR), the state government may raise an objection saying this issue needs to be raised at the KRMB and Apex council meeting and not in SZC meet,” a senior official said. During the council meeting, Karnataka is likely to raise objection to Sangambanda project, which was taken up by the Telangana government with 3.3 tmc ft capacity as many of its villages were submerged due to this project. But the Telangana government claims it was constructed after sharing DPR with Karnataka. “The AP government is claiming Rs 3,000 crore power dues from the Telangana which is completely unacceptable and we are going to raise the issue. Apart from this, long pending distribution of assets and liabilities of schedule IX and X institutions and funds for Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line issue will be discussed,” an official, who is going to take part in the meeting said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-paddy-war-with-centre-kcr-to-skip-szc-meet-today/articleshow/87691343.cms||Koride Mahesh

Doctor-cum-lawyer Dr Pradeep Arora had filed the RTI application as the MPCB’s regional office insisted that the hospitals are required to install STP/ETP as per Biomedical Waster Management Rules, 2017 and its amendments.The MPCB has withheld its consent stalling license renewal of several private hospitals on the premise that they lacked ETP or STP.MPCB sub-regional officer Anand Katole said gazetted notification issued by ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) mandates STP at hospitals.“As per the notification, OPD and IPD waste has to be treated by disinfectant before releasing in sewage line. Without STP, it is not possible to comply with environmental norms,” he said.Katole said serial number 8 (clause 3) clearly states, “STP is also mandatory for hospitals below 10 beds by the year 2019. Hospitals want to directly discharge their waste in city’s sewage line. Already, the city’s doesn’t have proper sewage treatment facilities. Sewage water is randomly lifted and not all of it is getting treated. The notification is clear,” he said. The MPCB officer said bigger hospitals have set up STP while only smaller ones having 25 to 50 beds are opposed to it. “Those running in a single building don’t have enough space. We have been appealing to them to install STPs. They face problems during license renewal,” Katole said.Dr Arora explained the interpretation of the two clauses of Rule 8 in the MoEFCC notification which has led to misunderstanding and was now settled with reply of RTI’s filed by him.What Dr Arora says and what the clause say The Clause 1 states, “Above limits are applicable to the occupiers of health care facilities (bedded) which are either connected with sewerage network without terminal sewage treatment plant or not connected to public sewers”.Dr Arora explained that Clause 1 exempts any hospital from setting up its own STP if the public sewerage system is connected to a common STP. Like in case of Nagpur the common STP at the terminal end of Public sewerage of huge capacity is at Bhandewadi. So the hospitals located within jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation Nagpur are exempt from installing own STP or ETP.The Clause 1, therefore, gives the same inference as the reply of CPCB to RTI request filed by Dr Arora.Clause 3 , states, “The health care facilities having less than 10 beds shall have to install STP by December 31, 2019”,  Dr Arora said that it doesn’t make any sense because it leaves out bigger hospitals. “What about hospitals with 10 or more than 10 beds,” he asked. Dr Arora added, “Absurdity of this clause is much too clear, which is why I filed an RTI and now the reply of CPCB which is same as Clause 1 is absolutely binding on MPCB.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/treatment-plant-not-must-for-hosps-if-wastewater-is-flowing-into-stp-cpcb/articleshow/87690296.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The police said that the two accused were part of a gang that used to procure expired cement from Delhi and Haryana and then mix it with good cement at the factory in Patel Nagar to earn more profit. Police are now procuring records of people who have been supplied the inferior quality cement to prevent any accidents. SSP/DIG Dehradun, Janmaijai Khanduri, had constituted a team to raid the factory where the inferior quality cement was found. After the arrest, the accused -- identified as Nadeem and Mohammad Rashid -- told police that they used to procure cement for Rs 250 and then sell it for Rs 450 per bag (comprising 20-25 kg cement) after adulteration.

According to the special investigation team (SIT) handling the case, a clean chit has not been given to the owner of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories either. Investigation officer Rajendra Singh Kathait told TOI, “As far as the role of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories is concerned, we have not given a clean chit to its owner. Based on some crucial fresh findings, we will soon summon the lab technician of the Dr Lalchandani Laboratories for questioning. Action will be taken accordingly.” Notably, Mallika and Sharat Pant, owners of Max Corporate Services and the main accused in the scam, were arrested from Noida earlier this week. Max Corporate Services, tasked by Uttarakhand government to conduct Covid-19 tests during Kumbh, had roped in two other labs — Dr Lalchandani Laboratories and Nalwa Laboratories. After it was found that more than 1 lakh fake Covid-19 tests had been conducted in Haridwar during Kumbh, all three establishments were booked. However, while the police secured a non-bailable warrant for Mallika and Sharat Pant and Dr Navtej Nalwa (of Nalwa Laboratories), no such action was taken against Dr Lalchandani Laboratories, which had produced a little more than 10,000 test reports before the health officials during the Kumbh Mela. Meanwhile, police are also trying to catch Dr Navtej Nalwa, who is at large. In fact, two teams have already been sent to Hisar (Haryana) to nab him. The Hisar-based firm conducted more than one lakh fake tests during Hardiwar Kumbh, according to official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-test-scam-haridwar-police-prepares-to-summon-technicians-of-dr-lalchandani-laboratories-another-lab-accused-of-being-involved-in-the-scam/articleshow/87690297.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Hubballi||Profs, students decry ‘maladministration’ at Kannada varsity||Hubballi: The Kannada University (Hampi) has found itself in a spot following allegations by professors and students over different issues.While Kannada professors have written a letter to the governor alleging delay in sanctioning of pension, students have launched a signature campaign decrying the “maladministration” in the university. Following this, the professors’ association has called a meeting on November 16 to discuss ways to address the issues and retain the image of the university.Meanwhile, vice-chancellor S C Ramesh has written a letter to the syndicate, seeking formation of a fact-finding committee to look into the allegations made against him. He has termed the developments as a conspiracy to bring a bad name to him.Dr M Mallikarjunagouda, head of the department of Kannada literature studies, told TOI that the VC is demanding a bribe of Rs 6 lakh for promotion of teachers under Career Advancement Scheme. “He is deferring promotions of those who refuse to bribe him. He has also promoted those who have paid. After I asked him to share the guidelines for promotion, he transferred me to International Vachana Literature Study Centre in Kudalasangama. My tenure as the HoD here was to end on June 26, 2022,” he said, adding that he has complained the same to the higher education department in Bengaluru.Thirty-seven students have charged the university's administration with transferring many professors to units located outside the university and changing the responsibilities of some professors for no reason. “We are forced to pay commission/ bribe of up to Rs 50,000 to get scholarship, colloquium and other facilities. Our signature campaign is to counter the same,” they said.Requesting anonymity, some professors said they are being pressurised to pay their salary of eight months to declare their probationary period “successful”.M Chandra Poojary, a retired professor, said: “The university authorities say that some percentage of commission should be paid to get our benefits. So we (nine retired professors) have written letters to the varsity, higher education department and the governor...”Meanwhile, Kannada Vishwavidyalayada Adhyapakara Sangha will convene a meeting of teaching and non-teaching staff on November 16. They want to discuss ways to resolve the issues and maintain the university’s image. Sangha officebearers said they will launch an agitation if the administration fails to address their concerns.VC rejects chargesTerming the allegations as baseless, VC Ramesh said there is a conspiracy to assassinate his character. “For promotions, we have followed UGC norms. A committee checking UGC criteria will oversee this issue, and I have never interfered in its affairs. As far as pension is concerned, the varsity is running short of funds. The government has released Rs 12.5 lakh as against the sanctioned Rs 50 lakh. We have written to the government about our funds requirement to meet other overheads, and awaiting its response.”The VC said 10-15 professors have retired in the last 1-2 years, leaving them amidst financial constraints. “Following allegations against me, I have written a letter to the syndicate members seeking formation of a fact-finding committee to probe the charges. I have asked them to prosecute those who erred.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/profs-students-decry-maladministration-at-kannada-varsity/articleshow/87690307.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Pune||Maharashtra: GR soon on non-agricultural land conversion, says Balasaheb Thorat||PUNE: The state revenue department will soon issue an order to simplify the process of converting agricultural land to non-agricultural land soon, said state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Saturday. Thorat was addressing a press meet on the conclusion of a two-day revenue conference in the city that discussed innovative techniques adopted by the revenue machinery for citizens’ benefit. Thorat told TOI that the new guidelines would be issued in a couple of weeks. The conversion of land has become an important issue against the backdrop of increasing urban population and expansion of cities and towns. “The main aim is to eliminate complexities in the conversion,” he said. Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game made a presentation on this issue at the conference. Nashik has already granted powers to tehsildars to allow land parcels that have already been marked as residential areas in the development plan. The tehsildars need only issue a notice to these landowners, ask them to pay a challan and issue the non-agriculture permits, Game said. Thorat said the government will also issue a GR to simplify the sand auction process in a fortnight. The use of GPS-based rover machines for land measurement is an option under consideration, he said. The state would require enough machines to ensure comprehensive land measurement. “These machines can be used in a pilot project in city areas and then implemented in rural areas, Thorat said. The minister further said the state department of registration has exceeded its revenue target, driven by the sops announced last year in the form of stamp duty waiver. He said Rs3,200 crore was collected as revenue in October — the highest ever for a month — and clarified that the government had no plans to give any more sops. Thorat said the increased revenue collection was a sign that the state economy was gradually returning to normalcy. He said the high revenue collection in October was despite no benefits being offered by the state. Further, Thorat said the registration department’s initiative on e-registrations has gained momentum. He expressed confidence that the initiative would garner good response from RERA-registered developers, as it would allow them to register properties from their offices and to reduce footfalls in the sub-registrar offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gr-soon-on-non-agri-land-conversion-thorat/articleshow/87690907.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The civic body has taken up the project as part of the Vizag smart city project. The ABD area, chosen under the smart city project, comprises wards 19, 21, 27 and 29. The major components of the project include 24x7 water supply in the ABD area, reducing the extent of non-revenue water and fixing high precise, tamper-proof water meters. A new ground-level service reservoir is being constructed near the Commissioner’s Bungalow to pave the way for the 24x7 water supply. About one lakh people live in the ABD area. As part of the project, 26 quality sensors will be installed to monitor the water quality. The project would also fix bulk flow meters at the reservoir that supplies water to the ABD area. The distribution network of pipelines, spanning 58 kilometres in the ABD area, will also get a major revamp. According to GVMC officials, the project has achieved about 70% progress. “The project will be completed in the next four to five months. A private agency has bagged the tenders for Rs 71 crore. The trial run was completed in several parts of the project area. Needed interventions to control leakages/losses are being taken up to accomplish desired performance parameters of the project,” said a GVMC official. On the other hand, as part of the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), the Asian Development Bank is funding a 24x7 water supply project in the northwest area of Vizag city with about Rs 350 crore. Currently, about four lakh people live in the northwest area of the city which has a water demand of 67 MLD each day, which is expected to go up to 94 MLD by 2029. The civic body has taken up the project as part of Vizag smart city project.

---||Nagpur||‘Excessive use of mobile phones is impacting kids’ dialectic memory”||Excessive use of mobile phones by school-going kids has been an issue for the last couple of years, but the pandemic-induced lockdown and isolation has brought it to the forefront of mental health and studies pertaining to behavioural sciences. Well-known psychiatrist Dr Shailesh Pangaonkar talks to TOI about how excessive and inappropriate use of mobile phones by children is shaping their personalities because of the impact on the brain.Excerpts... Q. Many kids and adolescents, who are great communicators on their family Whatsapp groups, are unable to mirror that ability when meeting the same people in person.A. It’s a phenomenon which we see regularly. Someone who can write fantastic novels or make excellent video content is unable to express himself/herself properly when communicating in person. That is because these are two different skills. From childhood we see physical and mental development and there are various aspects to the latter. So social, cognitive and academic are all part of that and how all these come together affects a person’s communication skills. Usually when we are daydreaming, there is no limit to what we can imagine. We can dream of being the President to a famous cricketer because our identity is not a challenge during daydreaming. Similarly, when we are communicating in digital mode, the person is behind the screen which leads to less stress. So speaking or operating in a comfort zone, which in this case is the digital screen, helps these youngsters communicate better. Q. But does this comfort zone apply even when in midst of relatives and friends. After lockdown, when most families got together, they noticed that their kids were unable to have a long conversation with other relatives.A. Specifically with regards to lockdown and how it has impacted behaviour among youngsters, we need to look at it differently. Those kids who have been spending eight to nine hours on the mobile phone may have slowly become conditioned to being alone. This lockdown-enforced isolation and enjoyment of games etc in the mobile phone has led the young mind to believe that this is a safe environment, this is a comfort zone. But when speaking before a group of people that comfort zone is gone and feeling of one’s identity being challenged can make people nervous. Q. Did the lockdown-induced isolation make matters worse for youngsters?A. There’s no practice happening for the brain during social interactions. Ultimately, we always train our brain on what to say and to whom. It is this training, over a period of time, which informs the brain about how much information we can share with whom and similarly, learning what not to say to whom. The lockdown has impacted different age groups differently, because the development phase is connected to one’s age. For those who are around 11 years, it’s important to make a differentiation between themselves and the outside world. This usually happens in a natural way, when the child keeps interacting with people outside the home, like in school or a sports camp. But due to the lockdown-enforced isolation, this part has got hampered. And if no training is happening for the brain regarding emotional and social behaviour, then that ability recedes very fast. Kids who are spending hours on end watching mobile phones face difficulty in expressing themselves to parents. That environment of isolated mobile indulgence provides a false perception of security to the child. S/he starts believing that I’m safe and secure in this environment, and it’s scary to now move into a group of people and interact. Q. Has the ability of kids to form relationships taken a hit?A. Relationship is an integration of all senses. Visual, spoken communication, being clear in expressing thoughts etc are the key parameters. Our brain has a dialectic memory which is very dynamic. It’s different from the temporal and procedural memory which are often discussed, related to learning driving skills and remembering it or remembering names of your relatives etc. The best example of dialectic memory is knowing how to behave in different situations. While talking to a one-year-old baby, we too speak like a toddler but immediately shift to an adult tone when speaking with the parent. So these things like how loudly to speak in which place, what words not to use in front of people are also dependent on this dialectic memory. But this memory needs constant practice, unlike its other counterparts. You have to keep updating it regularly. Q. Dialectic memory training is definitely not happening for many kids right now.A. The process of conditioning that memory in kids may have changed during this lockdown and hence, that discomfort in communicating in a physical space with other people. That ability to integrate all senses needed for relationship building has now congregated in the small screen of a mobile phone. The earlier physical canvas or platform where relationships were being formed has now changed to mobile phones. Q. Is this a permanent loss or a negative impact on dialectic memory?A. It’s a difficult question to answer because the impact is connected to the age group we are addressing. Kids between ages 6-9 will take more time, but they will definitely recover. However, there will be some things that will always remain and hamper the next level of growth. Q. As mobile phones are here to stay, we can’t keep kids away permanently.A. Yes, so now the focus should be on judicious use. I prefer that kids read some text on the mobile like these e-books etc. Fast moving graphics and videos on mobile games are dangerous because of the impact they have on our kids’ brain. Also, parents must involve kids in using mobile phones for some practical purpose, like let’s say you want to book tickets for a movie or a plane, get the kids to search for it under your supervision. These youngsters are very smart in the use of technology, much better than parents. Also, keep their brains busy by always having a no-phone hour wherein the whole family gets together. Even if your kid is not going to school due to the lockdown, make sure that the schedule is not disturbed. A fixed time should be there for getting up, breakfast, bathing etc. And most importantly, parents must lead by example. You cannot be holding a phone in your hand and tell your child to stay away from it. The biggest challenge and top priority is to wean away kids from excessive and inappropriate use of the mobile phone. Just like in de-addiction centres we take away the object of addiction, a similar process will have to be followed. Focus on physical activity with a lot of aggression. Q. But decades ago we used to spend hours reading comics and parents would disapprove the practice. Are we over reacting?A. No, the dangers of screen time are well documented and researched. Loss of concentration and impatience has increased a great deal because of mobile screens. The games you play on mobiles result in immediate satisfaction, as in you press a button and something happens according to what you want. Slowly your brain is getting tuned to receive this instant ‘gift’ and in our brain two vital things are getting impacted. First is ‘postponing of immediate gratification’ and ‘frustration tolerance’. These two things are being destroyed in kids who indulge in hours of gameplay on mobile phones, which will never happen if you are reading a comic or a novel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/excessive-use-of-mobile-phones-is-impacting-kids-dialectic-memory/articleshow/87690941.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

On the occasion of Children's Day, the KSRTC issued a circular instructing conductors to consider the proof of age of children rather than their height when issuing half-tickets or allowing them to travel for free.The previous circular, dated October 30, 2004, instructed conductors to collect full fare if the child is at least 140 cm tall and half fare if the child is at least 117 cm tall. Children, both boys and girls, with a height of 117 cms or more were considered to have completed 6 years, while those with a height of 140 cms or more were considered to have completed 12 years. Following the circular, officials had marked a gauge inside the buses to measure the height of children if there was any doubt about their age. In a recently issued circular, the chief traffic manager (operations), KSRTC, Bengaluru, has clarified that conductors do not need to check children's height if they have proof of age. There is no need to use another criterion once the age has been confirmed.The same circular has been issued by KKRTC, while NWKRTC is still considering it. “We are deliberating on it and will issue a statement within 2-3 days,” said Rajesh Huddar, CTM (operations), NWKRTC, Hubballi.Welcoming the circular, Ravi Bhandari, coordinator, District Child Helpline, said that some children had complained about the issue. “It was unscientific to measure the height. Demanding a document to determine one's age is acceptable. In the absence of age-proof, benefit of the doubt should be given depending on the case,” said Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee, Bengaluru Urban District.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/height-no-more-a-criterion-for-kids-to-avail-half-ticket/articleshow/87690310.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Madurai||Heavy showers submerge Kanyakumari||Kanyakumari: Kanyakumari district faced a grim flood situation on Saturday as heavy rain for three days led to widespread inundation in all the six taluks with many areas getting marooned. One person is feared to have been washed away at Mullaiyaru while state disaster response force and police rescued 2,267 people from 755 families and relocated them to 48 rescue centres. Thovalai, Agastheeswaram and Killiyoor taluks bore the brunt. Vehicles stuck in water, stranded people being rescued on boats and youths playing in neckdeep water stagnated in their residential areas were the scene in the district. Draining of water from low-lying areas, agricultural lands and residential areas posed a challenge to the authorities as heavy downpour continued across the district during the day. “More than 40,000 cusecs of water flowed through Thamiraparani river at Kuzhithurai on Saturday evening against the river’s capacity of 20,000 cusecs,” an official said. The district recorded an average rainfall of 100.48 mm in 24 hours till 8 am on Saturday. Holiday was declared for schools and colleges in the district for the second day. Videos of water flowing like a river through the ramps and stairs of a private hospital near Thirupathi Saram (Thiraviyam Hospital) and water covering the entire ground floor of houses behind the hospital in Therkalputhoor were among those which went viral on social media. In all, 65 huts were damaged, seven fully and 58 partly.  The heavy downpour that began on Thursday went on till Friday when the district recorded an average 77.2 mm rainfall. Though there was no rain during the day on Friday, heavy rain lashed the district from evening throughout the night. Kolipurvilai (205 mm) recorded the highest rainfall, followed by Aanaikidangu (187.4 mm).Though there was not much flooding in the rivers initially, the continuing downpour led to breaching of tanks and channels. Fire and rescue services along with SDRF carried out rescue. The maximum relocation of people (379) was from 10 low-lying places in Thovalai taluk, while 304 were relocated from five places in Agastheeswaram, 66 from Kalkulam and 35 from Killiyoor. Tangedco said 34 transformers were turned off in low-lying areas due to inundation. This disrupted power supply to 2,367 connections. District collector M Arvind and IT minister T Mano Thangaraj visited the affected areas and discussed restoration and rehabilitation measures.“There is water everywhere in all the six taluks. There is no difference between tanks and fields,” a senior disaster mitigation official said. Officials said that they are yet to take stock of the damages caused to properties and for farmers as focus is to ensure that people of low-lying areas are rescued to safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/heavy-showers-submerge-kanyakumari/articleshow/87690917.cms||---

IIT-Delhi alumna Padmasree Warrior was the chief guest at the event. Highlighting the role of technology in society, Warrior, who was addressing the event virtually, said, “As technologists graduating from one of the top institutions of technology in the world, you must ask yourself – what will you build and how will you lead us into the future with the power of technology? The brutal rigour (at IIT) taught me how to problem-solve from first principles – a great skill for engineers and technologists to possess.” “If you are confident about problem-solving capabilities, you can be successful in any role in an industry, which in turn boosts your self-confidence,” Warrior, who is the founder and CEO of Fable, added. According to official data, IIT-Delhi awarded 843 undergraduate degrees, 986 postgraduate degrees and 288 PhD degrees this year.

---||Varanasi||In Rajbhasha meet, Shahinvokes Veer Savarkar||Varanasi: Invoking Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the Hindu nationalist ideologue, activist and writer, here on Saturday to put across his views on Hindi, Union home Minister Amit Shah said he (Savarkar) enriched Hindi by inducting many words in his ‘Hindi Shabdkosh’. Shah was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan, organised by the Rajbhasha department of the home ministry at the Trade Facilitation Centre, Bada Lalpur. Citing the example of Savarkar, Shah said, “Agar Veer Savarkar Ji na hote to shayad hum Angrezi shabdon ka hi prayog kar rahe hote (had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only),” said Shah, adding that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary, and introduced many new words. The time has come to make Hindi flexible for the wide acceptance of people,” Shah added. Shah said that the country which loses its ‘swabhasha’ (native language), also loses its original thinking and culture. The original thinking can only come from native or the mother tongue, he added. Shah said that Gandhiji converted the freedom movement into a people’s movement with three pillars: Swaraj, Swadeshi and Swabhasha. “Swaraj was achieved, but Swadeshi and Swabhasha were left behind,” he said, adding that the government has set a target to establish the glory of Swabhasha and Swadeshi in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ (next 25-years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav) when the country will celebrate its 100th Independence Day. Shah said that the Central government has given special emphasis to Rajbhasha under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “One of the main points of the new education policy is the promotion of native languages. The new change that the Prime Minister has made will change the future of India,” he said, adding, “For the first time since independence, the convention of Rajbhasha has been taken out of Delhi and organised in Kashi, which immensely contributed for the enrichment of Hindi.” “I am a Gujarati and speak in my native language, but I love Hindi more than Gujarati. We need to strengthen our Rajbhasha,” said Shah, adding, “There is no conflict between Hindi (Rajbhasha) and local languages, rather they are complementary to each other.” Rajbhasha can prosper only when the local languages are protected. It is the responsibility of the Rajbhasha department to promote and protect the local languages, he added. Shah also made an appeal to all guardians to talk to their children in their own native language. “It does not matter in which medium they are studying, talk to them in native language in your home in order to increase their confidence levels, so that they have no hesitation in speaking their own mother tongue,” Shah said adding that speaking in native language would not only benefit the language, but also benefit the children because original thinking could only result from native language. “Attempts were made in the past to spark controversies on Hindi language, but now it is over,” said Shah, adding, “There used to be a time when we were afraid, but a new era has started when we would be proud. This transformation of fear to feel pride and honour has been a huge achievement of Narendra Modi’s administration.” “We have set a goal to promote Rajbhasha and local languages in the fields of education, administration, judicial work, technical work, communication and entertainment,” he said and made an appeal to all to create a conducive atmosphere in the country for this purpose. The event was also addressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-rajbhasha-meet-shahinvokes-veer-savarkar/articleshow/87690315.cms||---

---||Delhi||Worried parents relieved over school closure||New Delhi: There’s poison in the city air. So, while schools resumed classes only recently, there was relief for parents when Delhi government announced on Saturday the closure of schools for a week. While attending classes in person was important for their children, the parents also felt that the deteriorating air was something they could not ignore. Arijit Basu, father of an eight-year-old who studies in a private school, said, “It had only been a day since my daughter’s attended school in person and we got the news of schools shutting down once again. She has not taken this well. However, it is important to factor in the pollution when thinking of school going. Physical classes should remain suspended if the pollution level deteriorates because it is the children who will end up suffering. In fact, at home due to the pollution, we are even restricting our daughter from going to the park.” In a bid to deal with the toxic air, many schools had gradually curbed outdoor activities for the time being. Sudha Acharya, principal, ITL Public School, Dwarka, reported, “We are ensuring that the students stay indoors when they come for classes. Activities like yoga or stretching have all been discontinued. At times, for activities like aerobics, we form small groups and we have the children performing these in the basement to avoid outdoor exposure. We have also kept N95 masks in the school because they are the best against pollution.” Mount Abu Public School, which was scheduled to reopen from November 15, had already decided not to allow outdoor activities, said principal Jyoti Arora. “Even before the school reopened, we had given appropriate directions to teachers and parents not to allow outdoor activities due to both the pandemic and the pollution,” she said. “We also want to focus on and engage children in discussions around the environment and climate change. It is important for them to ponder on the current air crisis.” Some parents demurred. Mohit Goel, father of two school-going children, argued, “Staying at home and attending online classes have impacted the children adversely in terms of developmental aspects. Pollution is here to stay until drastic steps are taken in the future to bring the levels down. So, after deciding to bring back the kids to school, the pollution should have been the lowest priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/worried-parents-relieved-over-school-closure/articleshow/87691344.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Kochi||Congress workers attack journalists in Kozhikode||Kozhikode: Media persons who tried to cover a meeting of Congress workers held at a hotel at Kallai Road in Kozhikode were verbally abused and assaulted by the latter on Saturday. Though there were reports that the Congress workers became provoked as the meeting was a secret A-group meeting, Kozhikode district Congress committee claimed that the meeting was held with the knowledge of the party. Kozhikode Kasaba police have registered a case against around 20 people in connection with the incident. Mathrubhumi daily’s senior news photographer Sajan V Nambiar sustained injuries to his neck in the attack. Sources said that the Congress workers dragged Nambiar into the meeting hall and manhandled him. When he fell down during the attack, the workers stamped on him. The accused grabbed his mobile phone as well. A portion of the gold chain that the photographer was wearing got broken off in the melee. He later sought treatment at a private hospital. The workers also tried to attack C R Rajesh of Asianet News and Megha Madhavan of Kairali TV when they tried to intervene. Deeptesh Krishna of Manorama News, who came to the spot, was also attacked by the group. The gang dispersed after seeing video cameras. Group activities within the Congress party have been on the back foot ever since the new leadership took charge. The meeting was attended by former DCC president U Rajeev and 25 others. Soon after the incident happened, Kozhikode DCC president K Praveen Kumar rushed to the spot and expressed regrets over the incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/congress-workers-attack-journalists-in-kozhikode/articleshow/87690944.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Open cantonment roads: Telangana minister K T Rama Rao to defence officials||HYDERABAD: A day after holding protests against the Centre over paddy procurement issue, municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao on Saturday gave vent to his anger at the defence ministry over continued closure of roads in Secunderabad cantonment. “The defence department is behaving as if it was running a parallel government in the state. The department is functioning as per its whims and fancies and closing roads in the cantonment area. This is completely unacceptable,” the minister said. KTR has raised the issue at a time when residents have complained that at least 21 roads in the cantonment have been closed for nearly five years now. TOI has been running a sustained campaign to merge Secunderabad Cantonment Board areas with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation so that road closure and other such issues can be resolved. KTR added that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and requested them to help in road widening and allotment of defence land for construction of flyovers. The state government gave tens of representations to the Centre. But the Modi government has not been cooperating with the best performing state, KTR alleged. “Traffic congestion on Patny-to-Shamirpet road and Paradise-to-Kompally route has become common. The roads are completely choked during peak hours,” KTR said. He alleged that defence officials were responsible for submerging of colonies near Shatam Kunta at Lungar Houz during recent heavy rains as the military officials constructed a check dam. Though Telangana is a performing state, the Centre is not giving any additional funds for developmental works. “For instance, Bangalore metro got Rs 17,000 crore for metro rail project. But our state is getting funds only for constitutionally mandated ones,” the TRS working president said. “The BJP government and ministers are giving awards and heaping praises on rural and urban bodies in the state, but not giving any funds. We will take up all these issues with the Union government,” KTR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/open-cantt-roads-ktr-to-def-officials/articleshow/87691361.cms||Koride Mahesh

We have not been able to bounce back ever since the lockdown until a few days before Diwali. This is the first time since the lockdown in March 2020 that people are going out and celebrating a festival, and the wedding season is also bringing in many customers, women as well as men,” said Kanika Solanki, who runs a beauty parlour in Viman Nagar. “I had to cut down on staff strength since we were catering to just about 30% of prepandemic clientele. Since the end of October, the number of clients has doubled, and we had to call back some of our staff members who were working on a freelance basis,” said Nisha Singh, who owns a parlour at Wagholi. Customers are opting for hair treatment, colouring and skin treatment, said parlour owners. “After we reopened in June, clients were most turning up for low-cost services such as threading, waxing, facials. Now, we are seeing a surge in appointments for Keratine treatments, hair straightening and contouring,” said a stylist at a nationwide salon chain. “The metrosexual revolution started a long time ago, but salon trips took a backseat as people wanted to spend their money on essentials Now, that some normalcy is returning, clients are coming and asking for various types of beauty treatments ahead of the wedding season,” said Jitendra Kumar, a salon owner in Kondhwa. “Not just to-be brides and grooms, but their family members and guests are also opting for various types of beauty treatments,” said make-up artist Sonali Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wedding-season-boosts-business-of-salons-and-beauty-parlours/articleshow/87690923.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Varanasi||In Azamgarh, Amit Shah asks people to choose between Akhilesh Yadav’s JAM and Yogi Adityanath’s JAM||AZAMGARH: Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday launched a frontal attack on Akhilesh Yadav in Samajwadi Party (SP) citadel Azamgarh, asking the people to choose between SP chief’s ‘JAM’ and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘JAM’ in the upcoming UP assembly elections. Elaborating the acronym ‘JAM’, Shah said, “Akhilesh has come in the field with JAM that means Jinnah (Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan), Azam Khan (SP leader) and Mukhtar (jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari). While Yogi Ji’s ‘JAM’ means Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar cards and Mobile for everyone to eradicate corruption from its root. Now, people have to decide which JAM they would prefer.” Shah also publicly endorsed Yogi’s leadership and portrayed him as the next chief minister after elections. “I am asking you to give all Vidhan Sabha seats in Azamgarh district to BJP so that Yogi Adityanath can be made the Chief Minister again,” Shah added. Laying the foundation of a university, Shah suggested it be named after Hindu warrior king and Rajbhar icon Suheldev, who fought battles to oust the invaders, in a clear message to woo the Rajbhar community and politically decimate the nascent OP Rajbhar-Samajwadi Party electoral alliance. Accepting Shah’s suggestion, Yogi announced that the university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev. “On behalf of the state government, I announce that the state university in Azamgarh will be named after great Hindu saviour Maharaja Suheldev,” Yogi said. Shah, who was addressing a charged gathering near Azam Bandh, about 15kms from district headquarters, after laying the foundation of the university, said, “A place which had turned into a hub of extremists and a harbour for terror modules in the past several years, is now going to be converted into a place of Goddess Saraswati. The era of change for Azamgarh, which had converted into ‘adda’ (den) of anti-national activities, has begun.” Targetting Akhilesh, Shah taunted, “With the arrival of elections Akhilesh has started considering Jinnah as great. These are the people who divide the society on the lines of caste and community and believe in fanning riots.” “We expected seats from Azamgarh in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly elections, but failed to get them. It’s enough now. Now, nobody’s account except the BJP should be opened from here. Each seat should go to Modi Ji to make Yogi ji CM again,” said Shah asking the people to go to the field with a pledge to bring BJP back in UP again with 300-plus seats. Shah said today UP is free of both the menace of mafia and mosquitoes. “East UP districts in the vicinity of Gorakhpur suffered from the deadly Japanese encephalitis due to apathy of previous governments towards sanitation. Yogi Ji not only ended the problem caused by mosquitoes by executing all schemes and programmes of the PM promptly, but also forced the mafia to seek shelter outside UP. The state has been rid of mafia elements and Azamgarh is an example. Thousands of acres of land has been freed from the mafia and is now being used for development work.” Telling people how the promises of construction of temple at Ram Janmabhoomi and abrogation of Article 370, which were in agenda since inception of Jan Sangh, were fulfilled, Shah said that 10 universities were opened in BJP regime while number of medical colleges went up from 10 to 40 in the same period. He also highlighted the growth in GDP, improved economy, investments in defence corridor, increased number of airports, activeness of state government in purchase of paddy and other crops and efforts for employment generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-azamgarh-shah-asks-people-to-choosebetween-akhileshs-jam-and-yogis-jam/articleshow/87690329.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The death, falsely certified as “still born”, led to the family’s alleged discovery that neither the accused, Qayamuddin Khan, was registered with Maharashtra Medical Council nor the medical facility, New Lotus Hospital, was running with BMC permission. Refusing to grant bail to Khan, the court held that acts of all accused did not fall within medical negligence as contemplated under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of IPC. While this attracts a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment, the more stringent charge under culpable homicide is punishable with up to 10 years jail. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sessions-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-doctor/articleshow/87692103.cms||---

A senior official said water can be released for the scheme only when the level is more than 67 feet. The scheme will primarily benefit Usilampatti area with surplus water from the dam. The dam had an inflow of 1,495 cusecs against the outflow of 1,269 cusecs. Meanwhile, water level in Periyar dam climbed to 139.35 feet against the permitted maximum storage limit of 142 feet. The inflow and outflow were 1,797 cusecs and 556 cusecs respectively. Water level in both the dams is in a very comfortable position compared to last year when Vaigai dam had only 48.62 feet and Periyar dam 122.75 feet of water.District collectors of Madurai, Dindigul and Theni were present when water was released in the channel. Former revenue and disaster management minister R B Udhayakumar of AIADMK said water should be released in the channel till all the 33 tanks are filled up. Welcoming water in the channel with a floral tribute at Usilampatti, the Thirumangalam MLA told reporters that water used to be released in the channel when the level in the dam touched 67 feet during the AIADMK government’s tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigai-water-released-in-58-channel-scheme/articleshow/87690928.cms||---

The one-and-a-half years old animal was hit by a bike while crossing a road in the Otur forest range. Some passers-by contacted the forest department. A team rushed to the spot and brought the animal to the rescue centre. Upon arrival, the forest officers discovered that the hyena was injured and unable to move. A thorough examination by veterinary officer Nikhil Bangar of Wildlife SOS, a non-governmental organisation, revealed that the male hyena had suffered complete hindquarter paralysis and was unable to bear its own body weight. “He was placed under intensive care and treatment. The hyena is now showing signs of improvement,” said an official from the forest department. Bangar said, “Over the past few weeks, we have been administering anti-inflammatory and oral medication to ensure a steady recovery.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 1 lakh to be tested for sugar to mark World Diabetes Day||Mumbai:BMC will screen 1 lakh people for diabetes through its health centres and dispensaries to observe World Diabetes Day on Sunday. It also released data to show it has promoted physical activity by setting up ‘open air gymnasiums’ at 488 public spaces. As the theme of World Diabetes Day is ‘access to care’, an official from BMC’s gardens department said the open-air gyms are part of various medical services to diabetic patients. According to National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-20), about 17.5% of people over age 15 in Mumbai have blood sugar higher than the prescribed level. BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said people should adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent diabetes. “It includes regular and timely proper diet, exercise at regular intervals, adequate sleep including walking, cycling, as per medical advice. At the same time, everyone above 30 should get their diabetes tested at least once a year,’’ he said. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said that while the concept of open gyms is good, once these are set up in civic gardens, they are not properly maintained. “Therefore, they lie unused in gardens.

Addressing a public meeting following the university’s foundation laid here by Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday, Yogi said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of development and Union home minister Amit Shah’s work has changed the image of Azamgarh. There is no doubt that this university will soon turn Azamgarh into Aryangarh. This university will become operational by the next academic session and students from 400 colleges of Azamgarh and Mau will get degrees from here.” Mentioning that Azamgarh had remained the area of concern for him, Yogi recalled there was a time in Azamgarh when people were killed on demanding reciting Vande Matram. But, can anybody now show the courage of killing anybody in full public view here? “In 2007, one Ajit Rai, an ABVP student leader was killed in front of the principal office of Shibli National College for demanding recital of Vande Mataram on occasions like Republic Day. Time of over a month was taken to register even an FIR in this case,” said Yogi, mentioning how he too was attacked during his visit to Azamgarh. “No one could commit crimes like this here now,” said Yogi highlighting the achievements of his government on the law and order front. “Those, who used to harass girls and women, are well aware that they will be treated like Duryodhan and Duhshashan of Mahabharata for their act,” said Yogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/azamgarh-could-be-renamed-as-aryamgarh-hints-yogi/articleshow/87690344.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The young Asiatic lions are being brought to the city from the Sakkarbaug Zoo in Junagadh. The Sayajibaug Zoo presently has two ageing lions. The lion Kunvar and lioness Gel are around 13-year-old. They have been recently shifted to new enclosures. The zoo has space for more large cats as two of the five moat enclosures are vacant. The moat enclosures that are as per Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI) norms were inaugurated in December last year. The two existing lions that had to be kept in separate enclosures earlier are now in the same enclosure. Zoo curator Pratyush Patankar said that two lions that are scheduled to arrive from Junagadh will be kept together in one of the enclosures. “They are around two-year-olds and will be shifted soon,” he said. The formalities for the transfer have been completed and is expected to take place later this month. Patankar said that the transfer was made through a tripartite arrangement. The Sayajibaug Zoo had given a pair of blue crown pigeons and love birds to the Sardar Patel Zoological Park in Kevadiya. In return, the young lion pair was to be given to Vadodara from Sakkarbaug zoo. With the arrival of the pair, one moat enclosure in Sayajibaug Zoo will remain vacant. The zoo is expected to get a white tiger for the enclosure. It has already started formalities for the same for quite some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-zoo-to-get-lion-pair/articleshow/87690351.cms||---

Besides, wards dedicated to Zika patients will be made in eight district hospitals, including Balrampur Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital, Lokbandhu Hospital, RSM Hospital, RLB Hospital and Railway Hospital to provide quick assistance to patients. The district administration also launched a helpline number of (Integrated Covid Command Centre) 0522-4523000 for any query. These decisions were taken at a meeting called by the district magistrate on Saturday after three Zika cases were found in the past two days. Officials of health department, Lucknow Municipal Corporation and police were present in the meeting. “Every patient would be isolated and barricades would be put outside the house. Extensive source reduction activities, including anti-larvae fogging and sanitization would be carried out in every zone daily. Besides, health teams will conduct door-to-door surveys for awareness and testing of symptomatic people, particularly pregnant women,” the DM said. Some teams would also be deployed in containment zones to monitor health of patients recovering at home and file a status report with the chief medical officer every evening, he said.

---||Goa||Youngsters at Kerala Blasters need a spark, we expect a lot from some of them this season: Ivan Vukomanovic||Ivan Vukomanovic knows the expectations at Kerala Blasters FC are high, but hasn’t forgotten the fact that the team finished tenth among 11 teams in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season. With a new set of foreign players, a clutch of promising youngsters and a lengthy pre-season, the Serbian coach is hoping to write a new chapter. Excerpts from an interview with TOI… Given that the league is very short, the focus is always on results, rather than the process. Will you need time with this team to prove what they can achieve? Every coach, team needs time. In football, if we only speak about results then football will always be concentrated on a short-term idea. At the end of the day, every club will suffer, the national teams will suffer. Getting results for a club is always a process. Everyone wants to have results, that’s our goal too, but we need time to complete the puzzle. Kerala Blasters is a great club with a huge army of fans and they deserve to be on top of the table. But in football, you can never have success overnight. You have to go through the process. The process is particularly important for the young players at the club? Yes, of course. They have to start somewhere. They have to be developed to be able to play for many years at the level of ISL, which will improve every year. I think we managed to sign some good guys, good players, who can bring something extra and also help these young players play an important role. Kerala Blasters always have high expectations, but the club hasn’t managed to qualify for the playoffs for the last four years. Last year, the team finished tenth among 11 teams. A top-four spot will still be a realistic target? We don't know. Nobody knows how ISL (new) players will develop. Teams have been undergoing changes. The most important aspect is the momentum. Teams which start well will be at the top of the table. If you collect points and there are (only) 11 teams, you will be at the top and stay there. In the ISL, anything is possible, and from what we have seen, anyone can beat anyone in this league. Small details will make the difference. Which teams are more likely to succeed? Those who are organised. With the reduction in foreign players, teams who possess the best group of Indian players will be on top. That’s why we are developing our (young) players. Kerala has one of the youngest domestic squads. They have lot of promise, but are they ready to deliver? All of them need one spark, one moment that will take them to the next level. Kerala Blasters have gathered interesting young players who can develop. Some have already started playing in ISL and are part of the national teams. We expect a lot from them. We will do our best to help them improve their game, develop and grow into better players. Is it an advantage or a disadvantage to have all new foreign players? Both. Because, again, we don’t know how it will pan out. I think we have signed some good foreign players, all of them. This year we have no problems with communication. All of them speak English, a couple of them speak Spanish between them, so I can speak with them in English or Spanish. As humans, they are quality persons. This is a very important aspect and can have a positive influence. Was it a conscious decision not to sign a foreign defensive midfielder, something that every other ISL club has done? First, we have some domestic players in that position who can be developed and go on to become important players for the national team. From the national team perspective, it’s important to give these players space and time. Tactically, with lesser foreign players, let’s say if during the game you want to add more offensive power to your team from the bench and you want to keep your strikers on the pitch, it means you will have to take off one of your midfielders or one of your defenders. If those guys are having a good game, they will still become victims of the foreign player rule or a tactical substitution. If you push out a midfielder, you have to field someone else there, or maybe change the shape, do certain things that will end up in a mess. From that point of view, our idea was to develop certain players for certain positions. During substitutions, we want to change players, position for position. Don’t want to complicate too much. We need to keep things simple. It’s obvious that there is lack of domestic options in some positions… Our idea is to try and develop some players in certain positions. These players will add value to the club in the future. This year we want to give space and time to some domestic players to develop and become important players, not just for Kerala Blasters but also national team. What are the goals for this season? To win as many games as possible. I like my teams to have a winning mentality, even for small-sided games. This is the mentality we want to have in our team. At one of my previous clubs, when you enter, there is a big sign. It states, ‘victory is not the most important part of football, but what we want to do is teach our players what is winning mentality’. When you have this mentality, victories will follow. We will be able to achieve good things. We have to work hard. We have to be honest. As a team, last season, we were second from bottom. We have no right to speak big. We have to shut our mouths and work hard. That’s our goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/youngsters-at-kerala-blasters-need-a-spark-we-expect-a-lot-from-some-of-them-this-season-ivan-vukomanovic/articleshow/87704227.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

About 600 artisans are displaying their handmade products at about 300 stalls which drew a huge crowd on Saturday. The fair will continue till November 21. The massive entrance with the selfie point demarking the name of the fest in hashtags, dhols and Rajasthani puppet dancers collaboratively worked to give an appropriate ambience to the fest. The Vishwakarma park which was decorated with a massive idol of Lord Vishwakarma as a centre piece highlighted the main incidents from the story of independence. For many of the city folks it felt like a picnic with their families where children ran all over the Haat playfully. The youngsters were engaged in posing for selfies and photographs while the others were fascinated by the beauty of the handicrafts. Ritika Chaturvedi, who visited the Haat with her kids along with a few of her friends and their kids, said, “We brought our kids to the Haat so that we can inform them about the traditional art works of our country. After the entire pandemic this is the first time we all managed to plan out a picnic for the kids.” People were also busy with their cameras posing with different items. One among them was Manisha Sahay, who said, "The Vishwakarma Vatika that showcases aazadi ka amrit mahotsava was the best part of the Haat for me. I could pose for pictures for my social media. I also bought Handcrafted dupatta, vase and paper flowers. I also witnessed the charm or charkha by posing with it." Nisha Pandey, a shopaholic, said, "I have been looking forward to this fest for about a year. I really loved the products which I purchased last year. This year the work of brass seems really incredible.” Ashish Lama, who recently shifted from west Bengal said, “My wife and I found really interesting stuff like the handcraft furniture. The massive wheels and the wood carved mirrors were the best." Arun Sarkar, a seller said, “I have brought hand embroidered and needle works sarees from Tripura." Kolla Subhash, who had a stall on incense sticks and ittars, attracted people from all walks of life. “We have a wide variety of incense sticks which have no chemicals. Instead, they are made with natural things. Some special variants include Rudraksha. We also offer customised ittars at a very economical price."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hunar-haat-draws-craft-connoisseurs/articleshow/87691384.cms||---

The protesters comprising drivers of buses, autos and lorries gathered at the toll plaza under the banner of Kappalur Toll Gate Edhirpu Iyakkam. “Only around 10 days ago, commercial taxes minister P Moorthy along with district collector and revenue divisional officer held a peace committee meeting and fee exemption was allowed for local vehicles from T Kallupatti and Peraiyur. However, now, the toll plaza officials are telling us we have to pay up,” said Andisamy, a co-ordinating member and protester. He further said that this is not the first time that toll plaza officials are seeking fee from them defying the orders of the local administration. The protest led to piling up of vehicles at the toll plaza. The protesters disbursed only after Thirumangalam revenue divisional officer and police held talks. Saying that NHAI has informed that they are allowing exemption only through another road, the officials promised to continue the exemption for local vehicles till a permanent solution is arrived at legally. “This is a long pending issue. Kappalur toll plaza has been built in violation of rules. Friction between locals and toll plaza officials continues as the toll plaza officials keep disobeying local orders and demand fee after a short time,” said Raghunatha Raja, president, Kappalur Industrialists Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/locals-protest-fee-collection-at-kappalur-toll-plaza-in-madurai/articleshow/87690955.cms||---

Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and medical college dean Dr A Rathinavel were also present. Addressing the media, Dr PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan said that the lift was installed as promised by the state government and local authorities. “Madurai Medical College is one among the oldest and historical medical colleges in the state. There is also a vote counting centre here and when we visited in 2014, we found that the lift was not in proper condition. In 2021, the condition of the lift worsened further and a voter, who is a lift operator, had appealed to renovate it as it caters to the needs of medical students,” he said. The minister said that installing a new lift in such an old building is not easy. “It is difficult to remove it completely and get a new lift. Within the same frame, a custom electrical lift that is completely safe has been installed,” he added.  The doors also got a new décor and depicted a photo of the famous Thirumalai Nayakar Palace in Madurai. The inauguration of the new lift has been welcomed by doctors, students and staff at Madurai Medical College.  Some of the lifts located in various parts of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) campus are quite old and require maintenance. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-med-college-gets-a-new-lift-at-last/articleshow/87690948.cms||---

According to sources, ED has registered a case and has approached the state police seeking details regarding cases against Mavunkal. The central agency will be probing suspected violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The move comes after the high court on Thursday directed to make the ED a party in the case against Mavunkal and others involved in the fake antiques scam. The agency would be looking into the possibility of the financial transactions connected with the trade of antiques being a mode of money laundering. Source said that the agency has formally approached the investigation team probing the case to share information relevant to the central agency’s investigation. CB SIT itself had found that transactions worth lakhs were made through non-banking channels without any documentary support. ED will investigate the possible financial irregularities in these deals. The central agency will now summon the complainants and witnesses in the case and record their statements. Petitions will have to be moved in the court concerned to question Mavunkal, who is now in judicial custody. The high court had on Thursday observed that there was more than what meets the eye in the case and the court would not allow a cover-up. Monson was initially arrested based on the complaint by six people that he had allegedly duped them of Rs10 crore by gaining their trust through sharing a fake bank account statement with them. There is also a cheating case to the tune of Rs 6 crore against Monson based on a complaint by Rajendran Pillai of Sreevalsam group. Crime branch has also registered cases against Monson for impersonating as the chairman of a channel and duping a sculptor from Thiruvananthapuram of nearly Rs 80 lakh by not paying for the sculptures he bought from him.

That is the reason booster doses are recommended,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health (Telangana). He said the effect of vaccine waning off has also been observed locally among healthcare workers. India is focussing on completing two vaccine doses, but Rao said people opting for these at the individual level will not break any law. But they won’t get certificates. Health authorities said the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are recommending booster doses but not immediately because of the inequality of vaccines across the globe. “Certain countries have taken a policy decision to give booster doses and are giving booster doses to elderly people and healthcare workers. Citizens going ahead and taking booster doses is ok,” he said. He said the cocktail method is best when it comes to booster doses. “Internationally mixing of vaccines is recommended for boosters, which means that if the first two doses are of a particular company, the booster can be taken of a different company,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-officials-urge-people-to-go-for-third-vaccine-dose/articleshow/87690953.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Approver: Rs 8 crore land deal behind Jagan Mohan Reddy's uncle Vivekananda's murder||HYDERABAD: Was it a Rs 8 crore land deal and political mistrust that led to the murder of AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s uncle and former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy? As per the statements of one of the accused, who later turned as an approver, to the CBI probing the case, it appears so. While political mistrust triggered a rift between killers of Vivekananda, sharing of the property dispute settlement money of Rs 8 crore led to the gruesome murder, it is learnt. The CBI recorded statements of approver Shaik Dastagiri under CrPC sections, which revealed that a Rs 40 crore deal was struck between key accused Yerra Gangi Reddy and suspect Devireddy Shiva Shankar Reddy, a Kadapa politician, to eliminate Vivekananda. Dastagiri was a car driver with Vivekananda from February 2017 to December 2018. He along with three others — Yerra Gangi Reddy, Sunil Yadav and Gajjala Umashankar Reddy — was chargesheeted by the CBI for the murder of Vivekananda. The CBI has moved a petition stating that Dastagiri had turned into an approver in the case. Gangi Reddy was a close associate of Vivekananda and used to be with him all the time. Twenty days prior to committing the murder (on March 15, 2019), Yadav and Umashankar even maimed the dog in the house as they did not want any hurdle in executing their plan. “We even conducted recce of the house several times,” Dastagiri said in his statement to the CBI. Rivalry between Gangi Reddy and Shiva Shankar broke out after the defeat of Vivekananda in the MLC election in 2017 at the hands of BTech Ravi of TDP. Dastagiri in his statement said: “After he lost the poll, Vivekananda was furious with Gangi Reddy, Shiva Shankar and other leaders of Kadapa and warned them to mend their ways. While this was so, Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy visited Yelahanka near Bengaluru several times to settle a land issue.” He further said: “Umashankar was also interested in the land issue as they used to discuss with all of us about the money to be received through this land settlement. In June 2018, during a visit of Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy, there was a heated argument over share of money. Gangi Reddy and Umashankar were humiliated by Vivekananda several times over their alleged role in his electoral defeat. There were arguments over financial matters as well.” Dastagiri was removed from work at the fag end of 2018. However, he ran an auto and maintained contact with Umashankar and Yadav. In his statement, Dastagiri said: “Vivekananda used to tell Umashankar that the latter had cheated him and created differences within the family.” He said the conspiracy to murder Vivekananda was hatched by Gangi Reddy along with Umashankar and Yadav. “When I expressed doubts, Gangi Reddy told me that he has the support of Umashankar and will manage everything. Gangi Reddy said Vivekananda turned greedy and wanted the entire Bengaluru land settlement amount for himself.” “Gangi Reddy said he would be receiving Rs 40 crore from Shiva Shankar. He had already offered Rs 5 crore. Four to five days prior to the murder, Yadav handed over Rs 1 crore to me as an advance for carrying out the murder. Yadav told me that he and Umashankar would also get Rs 1 crore each,” said Dastagiri in his statement. Dastagiri further said: “After receiving Rs 1 crore, I decided to purchase a villa in Pulivendula at a cost of Rs 75 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/approver-rs-8cr-land-deal-behind-viveka-murder/articleshow/87691396.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Local sources play key role in poisoning Delhi’s air: Experts||NEW DELHI: With winds not strong enough to blow away the smog hanging over the city, Delhiites continued to be victims of severely poor air quality. However, while stubble burning in the neighbouring states has exacerbated the situation, Delhi seems to be failing in controlling locally generated pollutants and emissions. On Saturday, the Supreme Court made this point while noting that stubble burning did contribute to the capital’s murky air, it was not the sole reason for it. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to data from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), on Saturday, the city was largely a victim of its own pollution sources, with around 10% of the PM2.5 pollutants locally generated by biomass burning and 24% by vehicles. Other contributors were industries at 7.6%, construction at 3.5% and internal waste burning, 2.2 %. “There are over 29 sources of pollution in Delhi, of which biomass burning is one. While emissions are blown into the city from the 19 National Capital Region districts, local sources are a major component, transport being at the top,” said Shambhavi Shukla, assistant programme manager, air pollution, Centre for Science and Environment. Shukla asserted there was a need for “integrated multisector regional action plan covering all of NCR” by addressing the local sources. An IITM official said, “The data fluctuates. Often, the contribution of internal sources peaks to 65% in Delhi’s AQI, the remaining coming from the NCR cities. The biomass burning share in the PM2.5 is often surpassed by local sources or transport pollution. However, this changes every hour depending on meteorological factors like wind speed. Proper planning for cuts in source emissions can help bring down pollution levels from ‘severe’ to ‘moderate’.” According to a CSE study based on the data from IITM between October 29 and November 8, around 31% of the pollution in the city had local sources. Of the pollution from local sources, around 51% was created by vehicles. CSE observed that the overall contribution of Delhi’s own sources to pollution increased during the evening hours and lasted till the early morning hours. The CSE study said, “The contribution also comes from outside Delhi, including 19 districts in the NCR as well as biomass burning in the neighbouring states. During November 2-6, the contribution from NCR dominated in the initial phase, going up to 70-80%, but the share declined during the smog episode after Diwali when the relative contribution of Delhi’s own sources increased. Similarly, the contribution of biomass burning from other states remained low in the initial pre-Diwali phase but peaked post Diwali.” Gufran Beig, founder project director of the Union earth ministry’s SAFAR forecasting body, noted that the while the extremal sources of pollution spiked during the stubble-burning peak season, their contribution remained lower than local emission. “Under normal conditions, transport causes 41% of pollution in Delhi, industries 22.3% and re-suspended dust, up to 18%,” said Beig. “However, during the stubble-burning period, the external contribution to pollutants reached up to 30%. Even then, a large chunk is locally generated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/local-sources-play-key-role-in-poisoning-delhis-air-experts/articleshow/87691393.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The residents said that the roads in Officers Town have been greatly damaged by heavy vehicles over the years. Further, the rain has also left the roads slushy with stagnant water and potholes. They said that the roads are a constant threat for motorists and there have been accidents as well. “For several years, the road has not been laid. The original road that was laid around eight years ago, was substandard. We have reached out to the civic authorities, district administration and even to ministers repeatedl,” said R Karmegam, president, Officers Town Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam. The residents’ welfare association has recently submitted a petition to the Madurai district collector as well. “The area also has a private school with a strength of more than 1,000-1,500 students, who have to make use of the roads. We also don’t have many basic facilities in the area and without proper roads, we remain isolated,” said M Muthulakshmi, a resident. The residents also alleged that corporation workers did not come to the area to clear garbage, fogging etc., due to the poor condition of roads. Meanwhile, K P Karthikeyan, Madurai Corporation commissioner said that the government has sanctioned special grants for laying new roads in the city. “The government has sanctioned funds and the first batch of tenders has been floated and we are awaiting approval for the second batch. Once the rain stops, roads will be laid in a phased manner across the city,” he said. The commissioner also said that post Diwali festival, there have been some issues regarding the deployment of sanitary workers in some areas. The corporation helpline no 842842500 can be reached in case of any complaints and action will be taken promptly, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/damaged-roads-continue-to-plague-officers-town-residents-in-madurai/articleshow/87690961.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Her husband and two others have been arrested. As news of the death spread on Friday, BJP Yuva Morcha (BJPYM) members reached the spot and blamed Varsha’s husband and his family for killing “the Hindu girl”. Tension prevailed in the area after members of two communities indulged in stone-pelting and firing. The BJPYM members also staged a protest, demanding arrest of the accused and shouted slogans. They allegedly attacked some shopkeepers in the area. A video that went viral on social media purportedly shows people indulging in abusive language and assaulting one another. In the melee that ensued, some unidentified person opened fire but luckily there were no casualties. Police have registered an FIR against five people, including the husband of the deceased, Mohd Faheem, under IPC section 304 B (dowry death), 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty ) and provisions of the Dowry Prevention Act on a complaint filed by the woman’s family members. Faheem, his father and brother were remanded to judicial custody on Saturday after being produced in court, while his mother and sister are still absconding. Varsha’s brother, Dushyant Singh, said she had married Faheem, a car mechanic, one-and-a-half years ago. He claimed he had received a call from her brother-in-law in the evening, saying that she had committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan. “My sister cannot take such a step,” he said, alleging that she was murdered. He claimed that when he and his family members reached her house, they were attacked by her in-laws. “I was assaulted by them,” he claimed. Sudhir Kumar Singh, SSP, told mediapersons that the situation is under control now and a police force has been deployed in the locality to avoid any further incident. He said the autopsy report revealed the cause of death as “hanging”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/communal-clash-in-agra-after-death-of-an-interfaith-married-woman/articleshow/87690363.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Varanasi||Let BJP take ‘vikas ki aandhi’ forward in UP, Shah tells voters||Gorakhpur: Seeking second term for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday lauded the Yogi Adityanath government for all-round development of the state and asked voters to let the party take forward ‘vikas ki aandhi’ by ensuring a record win in the 2022 assembly elections. “Under Yogi, the state is number one in many schemes. Development is all-pervasive and today UP is a riot-free state... there is a positive change in every sector, from law and order to farming, education, industry and infrastructure,” Shah said after opening Sansad Khel Mahakumbh at Shaheed Satya Mansingh Stadium and inaugurating/laying foundation of 94 development projects of Rs 189 crore in Basti district. Apart from the Chief Minister, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and MP Harish Dwivedi were also present at the event. He said: “A lot has been done by Prime Minister Narendra Modiji and Yogiji, but a lot still needs to be done. For this, blessings of voters is required once again.” Heaping praise on the chief minister, he said, “The Yogi government gave Rs 36,000 crore loan waivers to farmers and paid Rs 80,000 crore directly in the farmer’s account by purchasing of 435 lakh metric ton grains. As many as 2.53 crore farmers in the state got help of Rs 37,000 crore under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme and the government made 45 farm mandis tax free and computerised 27 mandi of the state.” “Today, UP is number one in smart city scheme, PM Awaas scheme, construction of toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission, Saubhagya scheme, Ujjwala scheme, PM SVANidhi scheme, besides production of paddy, wheat, potato, sugar, mango and amla in the country,” Shah said. Lauding Yogi, Shah asked if there are any more mafia elements seen now in the state. “Elections are around the corner. I want to ask you if any mafia is seen now in the entire Purvanchal. Have the mafias not been removed?" Home Minister Shah asked. “Earlier the police was scared of mafia in UP, but now when mafia see police they plead not to shoot them. (Pehle police mafia se darti thi par ab mafia gale mein takhti latka kar kehte hain ki hum sharan mein hain hume goli mat maaro),” Shah said. Unleashing a sharp attack on the erstwhile Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said those responsible for the mass exodus of people have themselves exited the state. The apparent reference was towards Kairana, where scores of Hindu families had left in the aftermath of Muzaffarnagar riots. The issue was raked up by BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and had played a major factor in the party’s resounding performance in the parliamentary polls and 2017 assembly elections in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/let-bjp-take-vikas-ki-aandhi-forward-in-up-shah-tells-voters/articleshow/87690364.cms||Arjumand Bano

It has also been placed in the A2 category for institution academic excellence. Under OBE, the ranking authorities evaluate and measure the objectives of an institution with its ability to meet and deliver these objectives through its outcomes. The framework has been specifically designed to weigh and focus on three essential parameters — inclusion and diversity, internship and placements, and entrepreneurship and innovation. Through effective evaluation of these three verticals, the best performing institutes are recognised and awarded for their ability to meet the standards of quality which are expected in these categories, through an analysis of teaching methodologies and outcome-based models. “These rankings are a testimony to our efforts towards promoting and developing excellence in education,” said PU’s vice president Dr Parul Patel. “From the date of joining, our students are groomed in numerous streams for career development, entrepreneurship, research and internationalisation,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pu-ranked-23rd-for-outcome-based-education/articleshow/87690375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC gives school an earful for expelling pupil over fee row||MUMBAI: A school is a temple of education, observed the Bombay high court on Saturday while directing a Pune school to unconditionally take back a student of class VI whom it had expelled because his parents refused to undertake not to file complaints about increased fees. “This is how you treat students? Why have you set up the school? To behave in this manner with children and parents?” asked a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar angrily on a petition by the 11-year-old’s father. The Orbis School at Keshavnagar issued a transfer certificate on May 7. The school’s advocate said it will take the student back but his father must undertake to withdraw complaints and litigation. “You cannot tell parents of students not to file litigation against you,” said Justice Kathawalla. The advocate said the school wants to resolve the matter amicably. “You throw the student out and then you say this. You will take him back unconditionally,” said Justice Kathawalla. The school’s advocate then said it will take the boy back but the annual fees for 2021-22 must be paid. “We’ll compensate him for six months of loss of studies. The parent must not precipitate the matter,” he said. The judges pulled up the father, a software engineer, saying he must cooperate. “The school also has overheads. You must also know where to draw the line. If parents start fighting with schools, the children will suffer. It appears there is an ego fight,” said Justice Kathawalla. Justice Jamdar said: “Your son suffered because of this.” The father’s advocate, Siddharthshankar Sharma, said there is a petition in the Supreme Court to reduce fees during the pandemic. The judges said whenever there is a general order it will bind the school too. “What will our children learn if we fight with the school? We call it vidyamandir. We call them guru. Then we fight with the school. If we respect the school, the children will respect all teachers,” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges directed the father to pay Rs 91,000 fee. “The school will not only provide study material but will also ensure that extra classes are held for the child,” they said, adding that it will not place any other condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-gives-school-an-earful-for-expelling-pupil-over-fee-row/articleshow/87692118.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP (North), said, “It’s a moment of pride for the entire police force in Delhi that the Sadar Bazar police station is rated among India’s top three. This police station has already won several laurels earlier, but to be in the top three is at a different level. This would not have been possible without the efforts of everyone in the force as well as the residents and traders in the area who have been the eyes and ears of the police force.” Watch Delhi: Sadar Bazar police station among top 3 in the country||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sadar-bazar-police-station-in-run-to-be-indias-best/articleshow/87691406.cms||---

At the same time, diabetic eye diseases are also seen on the rise. At the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), over 200 such cases are being seen each month. “Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy have increased significantly in Hyderabad. This is due to the fact that many patients did not come for their regular retina check up due to the fear of the coronavirus during the last one and half year. Their blood sugar control has also not been good due to lack of outdoor activity and increasing option of work from home. At the LVPEI, we are seeing more than 200 patients with severe and advanced diabetic retinopathy each month. Many of these patients are in their 30s and early 40s,” said Dr Raja Narayanan, Director and Network Head, Clinical Research at L V Prasad Eye Institute and Head and General Secretary at Vitreo Retina Society of India It has been estimated that diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in young working-aged (25-40) adults.  “One in 4 working adults (early ’20s to early 60s) have undiagnosed diabetes. Very often, vision problems lead to the discovery of the condition. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of diabetic eye disease. If it is left untreated, these can even lead to complete vision loss,” said Dr Gaurav Arora, regional head- clinical services at Dr Agarwals Eye Hospitals. While in the initial stages, the disease does not have any symptoms. With progression however, blurred vision, spots floating in vision, dark or empty areas of vision and sudden visual loss can occur. “Diabetic education, compliance to the drugs, regular screening for complications and regular follow ups with dialectologists are the key to successful management of diabetes and its complications,” said Dr Shehzad Ruman, consultant endocrinology and diabetes, Kims Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/diabetic-retinopathy-on-rise-during-pandemic-say-docs/articleshow/87690969.cms||Amrita Didyala

Sources said that the central committee (CC) member of the banned Communist party of India (Maoist) Milind Teltumbde, who is in charge of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh zone, is also among those killed. The CC is the apex body of the rebel movement in which Teltumbde used to occupy a top post as far as Maoists movement in central India is concerned. He is also considered a forerunner of the concept of ‘urban Maoism’. Observers say Saturday’s encounter has dealt the three-decade-old Naxalite movement a big blow. On April 22-24, 2018, commandos had gunned down 37 Naxalites including 19 women. Saturday’s encounter is the second-biggest in terms of Naxal toll. Goyal said the bodies need to be identified “following the standard operating procedures”. “We have heard that Teltumbde is dead but the information is yet to be confirmed as the jawans are yet to return,” he said. Once the bodies are brought to the district headquarters, surrendered Naxalites will be called for an identification. At the time of going to the press, the commandos are yet to return to even the Gyarapatti armed outpost. It’s learnt that the encounter started at 6.30 am and went on till 4.30 pm. After it ended, the commandos launched search operations in the forest as the Naxalites are known to drag away those killed and injured to nearby villages. Sources said this could not continue for long as darkness had set in. Four commandos who received bullet injuries were airlifted to Nagpur for medical assistance. According to early reports, a big cache of arms and ammunition was seized after the encounter which is considered to be one of the longest one in the history of the state’s fight against Maoism. Sources also claimed divisional committee members (DVC) Shuklal Parcheki and Prabhakar of company No. 4 formation of the Maoists too were among the ones who died. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil congratulated the Gadchiroli police in a tweet. Naxal range DIG Sandip Patil, who is also in-charge of the state Anti-Naxal Operation, couldn’t go to Gadchiroli as the state government had rushed him to Amravati city to tackle the law and order situation that arose there on Saturday. According to sources, Teltumbde was being escorted to the Maharashtra border by Chhattisgarh-based Vistar dalam. Teltumbde was received by Korchi dalam members and company no. 4 formation. “There were at least 40-45 Naxalites camping at the site,” they added. Around 16 C60 teams reached the place and cordoned off the camp. The commandos formed layers and mounted the attack. Maoist sentries opened fire and the C60 retaliated. Outnumbered, the Maoists tried to flee into Chhattisgarh but were trapped as their escape routes had been plugged by the commandos. The injured jawans were first brought to Dhanora and then airlifted to Nagpur where they are being treated at a private hospital. “All four are stable but two jawans have critical injuries,” said Dr Anup Marar of the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/26-maoists-gunned-down-in-10-hour-operation/articleshow/87690978.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police arrested Heena Begum, 22, and her live-in partner Shaik Mohammed Khadar, 25. Police said that the victim, Mehak, was killed as she was unwilling to beg and also because she disliked Khadar. Mehak had died after sustaining fist punch injuries on various parts of her body. After nabbing the couple, police came to know that Heena got married to one Ahmed, who was arrested in a burglary case, and the couple have three children- Affan, 7, Mehak, 4, and Mahera, 3. After Ahmed went to jail, Heena during her visit to a toddy compound met Khadar and they became friends, while she shared her problems. He proposed to marry her and he agreed to take care of her children too. Later, he took them to Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Manali for begging. “As the child was not happy with Khadar being close to her mother, the victim insisted on going back to her father. Besides, she refused to go for begging. As a result, she was frequently subjected to severe physical torture,” joint commissioner of police (West Zone) AR Srinivas said. Police said on November 3 when the girl and accused were in Bengaluru, she was repeatedly beaten up by the accused with their fist. The victim became unconscious. The couple decided to board a bus to Hyderabad. While they were seated in the bus, the accused realised that the girl has died. Later, they came near NIMS and abandoned her. Police found a couple getting down an auto near Model House. The auto driver gave the lead that he came across the couple at Lakdikapul, where they got down a bus. Using details, they zeroed in on the accused and caught them at Jubilee Bus Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-yr-olds-murder-solved-mother-paramour-arrested/articleshow/87690981.cms||---

---||Lucknow||ED to attach BSP ex-MLC’s sprawling university campus||Lucknow: A private university owned by former BSP MLC, Mohammed Iqbal, with a sprawling campus in Saharanpur has come under scanner of Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has slapped a notice on the former legislator before it plans to attach the premises. Last month, ED attached prime property in Dehradun owned by Iqbal and his family valued at Rs 74 crore under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). The economic intelligence agency also attached seven sugar mills owned by him and his family valued at Rs 1,097 crore under PMLA on March 9. Iqbal’s two sons are embroiled in a scam relating to sale of 21 state-owned sugar mills during the BSP regime, scraping the exchequer of Rs 1,800 crore. An ED official said, PMLA, 2002, was lodged against Iqbal based on investigations conducted by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) of ministry of corporate affairs and relates to acquisition of assets through illegitimate means in 2010-2011. A senior ED official told TOI that a notice has been served on Iqbal and his family for illegal acquisition of land for setting up a private university, which soon be attached. His other properties are under scanner, he said. ED said, Iqbal and his family members fraudulently acquired land at Saharanpur in 2015 in the name of a company, BSS Associates. Explaining the modus operandi, Singh said, big unaccounted money was deposited in bank accounts of the former legislator and his family in 2014-15. “This was quicklyl transferred to the account of a shell firm, Glocal India Industries, which ploughed the money into purchase of shares of BSS Associates. Iqbal also conducted transactions to maintain a carefully-crafted façade to own land in Dehradun. Apart from cash deposits, entries from shell companies were used to infuse tainted money into purchase of shares of BSS Associates by Glocal India Industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ed-to-attach-bsp-ex-mlcs-sprawling-university-campus/articleshow/87691415.cms||---

Addressing the gathering, the governor said that the MC aims at providing the best urban experience to residents. He said that residents would be greatly benefited by the 24x7 water supply project as water quality would improve and households would receive sufficient pressure to fill tanks up to the third storey, which would decrease pumping cost. The governor underlined the need for public participation to understand issues and recognise areas which required improvement. He congratulated the mayor, councillors and the commissioner as well as the team of officers for taking up people-centric steps. The Governor asked the officers concerned of the Chandigarh administration and MC to expedite work on the project. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said that the primary goal of the project is to switch from intermittent supply to a 24x7 continuous, pressurised supply system for health, hygiene and water-conservation benefits. He said the project would involve new water works with 4 million gallon of additional storage, 13,700 smart meters, 20 km of new lines and automated monitoring of system through SCADA. Also, he said that all the 37 tubewells would be phased out and 100% water supply would be shifted to surface water. Dharam Pal, adviser to the administrator, Chandigarh highlighted other crucial projects being carried out by Chandigarh Smart City Limited such as the ‘Im Chandigarh (I am Chandigarh)’ app, Integrated Command & Control center (ICCC) and Public Bike Sharing (PBS) system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/foundation-stone-of-24x7-water-supply-project-laid/articleshow/87690406.cms||---

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: After two decades, Kairana gets its own fuel station||MEERUT: For two decades, Kairana residents would either travel all the way to Shamli or Panipat in Haryana, both 12 km away, to buy diesel and petrol and other petroleum goods as no petrol pump was in the area. Now, a local businessman has obtained a licence to set up and run a pump in the politically relevant town. Vipul Jain, who is building the pump station, said. “There used to be a petrol pump here 20 years ago, but owing to rampant law and order problems, it was shut down. Goons would get their tanks filled up but never paid. As a result, It was people who had to suffer. Now, with better conditions, we think we can have this basic facility here again.” Welcoming the move, Abdul Ahmad, a resident of Kairana, said, “Kairana was only known for crime and politics. Even during elections, better roads and fuel supply were non issues, so no one bothered and the public suffered silently. It's good we'll have at least one pump now.” The facility is currently under construction and will take some time for it to become fully operational. Sukriti Madhav, superintendent of police, Shamli, said, “Kairana has always been in focus because of the high rate of crime. Apart from clamping down on organized crime, we worked extensively towards restoring traders' faith and securing public utility services. Opening of a petrol pump in Kairana is a positive signal and we'll ensure it runs smoothly.” Way back in 2016, the then BJP MP of Kairana, Hukum Singh, had produced a list of 250 families that he claimed had migrated elsewhere due to poor law and order in the town. The issue found mention in the BJP manifesto and Kairana became a poll plank of the saffron party in 2017 UP polls so much so that after winning the polls, a massive crackdown began against criminal elements. Police encounters resulted in the liquidation of dreaded gangsters like Mukim Kala. Several gangsters were either gunned down or were thrown behind bars. The crackdown even drew sharp criticism from the opposition that accused police of indulging in extra-judicial killings. But it did help in improving law and order in Kairana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-two-decades-kairana-gets-its-own-fuel-station/articleshow/87690448.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||50 quintals of solid waste, mostly plastic, removed from Ramganga river in Corbett||DEHRADUN: A 15-day-long cleaning exercise in the Ramganga that flows through the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) yielded almost 50 quintals of trash recently. The trash had come into the river following intense spells of rainfall on October 18 and 19 that left 59 people dead across Kumaon and prompted CTR authorities to shut down the park for two days owing to large-scale soil erosion and waterlogging in several of its zones. Ramganga river houses rich aquatic life, consisting of otters, gharials, crocodiles and fishes like mahseer. Besides aquatic species, the river stretch is also frequented by other animals, including tigers, leopards and elephants since it is a drinking water source for them. Officials said that the amount of muck and plastic waste that trickled down the river after the rain spell was so huge that it could have choked animals. There was also the fear of an epidemic breakout due to the waste accumulation in the river. In the past, too, tigers and leopards have been spotted near the river with plastic in their mouths, indicating the serious concerns raised by plastic pollution. “The waste mostly consisted of polythene bags, water bottles, shoes, slippers and pipes. It made its way to Ramganga in Dhikala, which forms the core zone of the reserve,” said Rahul (who goes by his first name), director, CTR. “To make sure that animals do not drink the polluted water, we conducted the massive cleaning drive in which two truckloads of solid waste were taken out from the river. The amount of waste retrieved from Ramganga also highlights the shoddy waste disposal management in the hills. Much of the plastic waste had come from the villages between Gairsain and Ramnagar as the river flows down from Gairsain in Chamoli,” he added. This year, the annual cleaning exercise, which is usually held for three days in February when the water level recedes, was forwarded by a few months due to the trash choking the Ramganga. The drive was conducted with the help of rafts, inflatable boats, and additional contractual forest staff. Volunteers were also deployed for cleaning the Ramganga reservoir, officials said. Meanwhile, RK Tiwari, warden of CTR, told TOI that the reserve, including all core areas, will be opened fully for tourists from November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/50-quintals-of-solid-waste-mostly-plastic-removed-from-ramganga-river-in-corbett/articleshow/87689680.cms||Shivani Azad

On September 17, the government passed the bill for registration of child marriages by amending the Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act. For which, a PIL was filed by Dr Kriti Bharti, managing trustee and rehabilitation psychologist on behalf of Saarthi Trust of Jodhpur. Simultaneously, another PIL was also filed. Bharti has annulled 43 child marriages and has stopped more than 1,500 child marriages. In the hearing of PIL of Saarthi Trust, it was told that till now the government has not withdrawn the bill, they have only kept it in the review. The process of which has not progressed. In the hearing, the high court sought information from the additional advocate general of the government, C L Saini, about the status of the Marriage Compulsory Registration Amendment Bill. At the same time, instructions have been given to present the actual status in two weeks. The Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by the state assembly had opened a can of worms with legal experts and activists claiming that it is promoting child marriage by giving it validation. Although child marriage is voidable, it is also a punishable as well as non-bailable offence against those persons who solemnise it. While the government claimed that the proposed amendment is to safeguard the legal rights of the children, experts said that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 already does with sections for Custody and maintenance of children of child marriages (section 5) as well as Legitimacy of children born of child marriages (section 6) thereby making the state’s justification fall short. Law experts further added that annulments of child marriages would become more cumbersome as registration certificate would now be a requirement to prove that minors were married off. They also raised the question that in case of children if parents register the marriage then FIR should be filed against them as they solemnised the wedlock. Following this uproar, the government had asked the Governor to return the bill for review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-seeks-status-of-marriage-registration-bill-in-2-wks/articleshow/87691011.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parsi trust sells sea-facing Bandra property for Rs 350 crore||MUMBAI: A Parsi trust has sold its prime, sea-facing bungalow property at Bandra Bandstand to a developer for Rs 350 crore. In late October, Imperial Infra, a Boman Irani-led Rustomjee Group firm, concluded the sale agreement with the Bandra Parsi Convalescent Home Trust for the 1-acre plot near Taj Land's End Hotel, reports Nauzer K Bharucha. The trust has received Rs 234 crore from the sale with part of proceeds going to the suburban collector as collector's fee. The trust will get back a built-up area of 12,000 sqft free of cost when the builder redevelops the land. Rustomjee is reportedly planning a luxury residential tower there. Realty deal makes Parsi trust richer than BPP in corpusThe deal for the property of the Bandra Parsi Convalescent Home Trust was registered a few days ago and around Rs 17 crore was paid as stamp duty. The trust had invited bids in 2019, but it took two years to finally conclude the deal because of the Covid-induced lockdown. There were only three bidders, of whom one was disqualified. The two that remained in the race were Rustomjee and Runwal Developers, whose offer was just over Rs 100 crore. The land deal makes the Bandra Parsi trust now richer than the Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) in terms of corpus. Although the BPP controls land and buildings worth thousands of crores, its corpus is just about Rs 117 crore. The plot currently contains a dilapidated early 20th century bungalow, which was once used as a convalescence home for poor women and children from the Parsi community. It shut down around 15 years ago due to poor occupancy. On Saturday, the trustees said the annual interest earned from the money will be used to expand the trust’s charity work for the Parsi Irani community. The trust currently provides medical help and funds for education and amelioration of poverty. The decision to sell the prime property was also due to the high ground rent charged by the collector, who increased it from Rs 4,600 a year to Rs 16 lakh. The trust found it “unaffordable”. Property market sources said the entire Bandra seafront will open up for construction and redevelopment with the stringent Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms recently diluted. “Builders will now get more floor space index (FSI) to develop plots near the coastline,” they said. The earlier CRZ rules allowed only restricted construction up to 500 metres from the high tide line. The Bandra convalescent home for Parsis was started in 1903 by social worker Shirinbai Mancherji Cama. After being widowed at a very young age, Cama dedicated the rest of her life to public service and community service true to her motto: ‘To serve one’s people is to serve God’. “She toiled night and day for it and considered all in the home as her children. She devoted her attention like a mother for their care, happiness and medical treatment. Sir Dorab Tata donated Rs 50,000, from which she bought Jalbhai Sett’s bungalow at Bandra,” said the Parsi historian Marzban Giara. Bai Avabai Faramji Petit, too, had donated Rs 1,500 to purchase furniture for the home. “The chief aim of this home was to restore the health of poor and weak women desirous of maintaining their family rather than depending on others, but due to poor physique unable to do so. The objective was to empower them so that they could lead an industrious and useful life,” Giara said. In 1932, Shirinbai started another Convalescent Home for Poor Parsi Men and Boys at Bandstand in a bungalow called Sea Breeze. This home is still functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-realty-deal-makes-parsi-trust-richer-than-bpp-in-corpus/articleshow/87692127.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Delhi||Exposure to pollutants may damage kids’ brain||NEW DELHI: The effect of pollution on the heart and lungs is well-established, but doctors say there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to the pollutants can damage a child’s brain. Particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 micrometres in size that are suspended in the air can enter into the brain through the olfactory nerves directly and damage the brain. Also, various components of polluted air like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, etc can dissolve in the blood and reach the brain. According to Dr Sheffali Gulati, professor and head of the child neurology division at AIIMS, the fine particulate matters can activate the microglia, the primary innate immune effector cells of the central nervous system (CNS), on entering the brain, leading to inflammatory response causing accumulation of proteins in the brain. “It can lead to an early ageing process of the brain in children at a very young age,” she said. Dr Gulati added that animal studies have shown that significant inflammatory infiltrates observed in various areas of the brain because of exposure to toxic elements in the air. The AIIMS doctor said another significant effect of air pollution on a child’s brain is seen through mothers. “In children born to mothers who were exposed to significantly polluted air during their pregnancy, the incidence of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, other behavioural issues like anxiety, depression, etc are higher than controls,” she explained. In 2017, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had released a report that warned about serious consequences of children due to prolonged exposure to air pollution. The Unicef report, titled Danger in the air, explained that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matter can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier — a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances. Second, exposure to air pollutant particles like magnetite can lead to oxidative stress, which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. “Not only do pollutants harm babies’ developing lungs, but they can also permanently damage their developing brains and, thus, their futures,” Unicef executive director Anthony Lake had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exposure-to-pollutants-may-damage-kids-brain/articleshow/87691440.cms||---

The contraband was concealed inside their bags, said an officer. One of the women, during interrogation, revealed that a Kenyan national had promised her money in exchange for the delivery of ‘certain goods’. “The Ugandan woman accepted the deal and travelled to Nairobi from Kampala by road where the Kenyan woman handed her over a bag to be delivered in Delhi. She also provided tickets and fake documents to cover her visit as a medical tourist,” the officer said. Zubair Riaz, commissioner (customs), said that the passenger was supposed to deliver the goods to a person who would have contacted her on exit. “When she was intercepted by customs officers, she was found to have a bag with a false bottom cavity wherein 5.4kg heroin was concealed,” Riaz said. About 7.5 kg of heroin was recovered from the possession of another female passenger, who was also posing as a medical tourist. The customs have seized over 100 kg heroin this year so far and nabbed 26 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13kg-heroin-worth-rs-90-crore-seized-from-2-flyers-at-igi/articleshow/87691012.cms||---

Jaipur Child Welfare Committee member Satyapal Chandolia said, "We had recommended that the registration of the private shelter should be cancelled after conducting the inspection. Out of the 20 children aged between 6 to 12, five said they had been sexually abused and will undergo a medical examination. The shelter was registered in 1961 and this is the first time that we received this complaint." It was found that children, who had left the shelter after becoming adults, would also visit at night without anyone’s knowledge and mistreat the younger ones. A video showed that alcohol was also taken inside the shelter. Police had detained two inmates in the case on Thursday and started interrogating staffers. Primary investigation revealed that no registers were maintained for staffers or visitors and no security guards were placed at the entry and exit points. Authorities have been asked to take action against the shelter. The child panel took cognizance of all such complaints. Presently, there are 172 child-care institutions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sexual-abuse-at-shelter-registration-of-pvt-childrens-home-cancelled/articleshow/87691013.cms||---

They demanded immediate action to clean and treat waste in the landfill using scientific and practical methods. Association members submitted that as mothers, they were deeply concerned about the MC’s inaction towards cleaning the landfill, which, they said, violated children’s right to life. “All children have the right to live in a clean and healthy environment. The image of Chandigarh across the country is well planned and city beautiful but the dumping of untreated waste at the cost of our children is very far from the image,” the NGO submitted. They stated that the Daddumajra dumping ground also violates several provisions of the Solid Waste Management Act, 2016. According to this Act, landfilling or dumping of mixed waste must be stopped. It also states that only non-usable, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, non-combustible and non-reactive inert waste can be disposed of in sanitary landfill sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngo-urges-mc-to-clear-dumping-ground-waste-scientifically/articleshow/87690449.cms||---

In all, 12 persons had lost their lives in the gruesome incident, of which 11 had been stuck in the raging fire caught in the bus and were burnt beyond recognition. Police had to collect their charred bones to be handed over to the forensic laboratory for DNA examination in order to establish their identities. Director of the laboratory at Jaipur, Ajay Sharma said the lab had received 11 samples on Thursday, of which identities of eight victims were established through DNA examination. “Report of the remaining three victims would also be handed over to police in next two days as their examination was under process,” said Sharma to the media. SHO (Pachpadra) Pradeep Danga said the mortal remains were handed over to the family members after based on the reports. These victims have been identified as Vibah Dave (22), Kamla Gawaria (38), Mehraram Prajapat (55), Jagdish Rao (42), Mahendra Meghwal (33), Dhanraj Rao (25), Suresh Kumar (17) and Vikram Singh (17). The horrific part of the exercise of identification was that the police had to collect the charred bones of the victims and pack them into cloth bales to be provided to the FSL at Jaipur. All of them had been waiting for these remains since the day of the accident so that they could execute the last rites. On the other hand, taking a serious note of the incident, transport commissioner Mahendra Soni visited the spot on Friday and constituted a committee to inquire into the matter. The high-level committee comprising officials of National Highway Authority of India and Regional Transport Office will submit its report to Soni in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/mortal-remains-of-bus-mishap-victims-handed-over-to-kin/articleshow/87691016.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Regaining relevance in Afghan maelstrom||Afghanistan is reeling under ever worsening humanitarian maelstrom with harsh winter, pandemic and famine. The disaster is compounded by inept Taliban government, struggling to find even basic international acceptance. The stark reality festers, in form of plight of significant number of refugees in the western and the gulf countries. It has also triggered in Europe a feeling of being let down by unilateral US pull out, as also guilt pangs on current plight of Afghan populace, particularly refugees, minorities, women and children. Growing difference in perceptions is diplomatic opportunity that Pakistan and China seek to exploit by according humanitarian crisis overriding importance and relegating other critical issues to background. There is concerted orchestration by Pakistan to magnify projections of crisis, to secure release of frozen funds, amounting to approximately $9.5 billion, thereby whittling down minimal leverages. Pakistan organised an international seminar to coincide with Troika plus meeting to hype up its pro-Taliban agenda. It will be worthwhile to reiterate red lines — inclusivity and pluralism; zero tolerance on terrorism, including proliferation of narcotics and arms; ensuring basic human rights specially for women, children and minorities. Humanitarian relief under the regime, where minorities like Shias and Sikhs are being targeted and women terrorised, mandates incorporation of safeguards to enable just coverage to include marginalised sections. India as likely major donor of wheat needs to ensure international monitoring. Chinks in collective resolve to link diplomatic recognition with compliance with red lines is already manifesting. Taliban appointees have taken over embassies and consulates in Pakistan. The same may happen in China and later Russia. The need is for collective action to retain leverages and incentivise compliance to internationally agreed objectives. Collapse of Doha process has sprouted alternative mechanisms like Troika plus (Russia initiated with USA, China plus - currently, Pakistan and Iran). Moscow format (enlarged regional formulation, including India) and recent Delhi dialogue, amongst others. India is literally at margins, struggling to regain relevance. We are paying heavy price for supporting duly elected regime and not opening parallel channels with Taliban. The US on its part has tried to initiate regional dialogue, concurrently aimed at countering China, through Quad variants. Central Asian one, announced before Taliban take over, is unlikely to take off. USA, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan are the members of this one. Middle Eastern variant has USA, Israel, UAE and India. Ironically, Israel and UAE have long standing security cooperation arrangements with China, including technology exchanges. In these confusing times of plurilateralism, Indian initiative with Russia, Iran and all five Central Asian countries is very timely endeavour. Unfortunately, Pakistan stayed away and even influenced China to do likewise. India has very difficult and complicated choices, starting with need to accept fait accompli and ‘real politik’ of dealing with Taliban. Between inactivity dubbed as strategic patience and smart engagement, the latter is pragmatic option. The harsh reality is that transition has been outsourced to Pakistan, yet, India has to forge consensus to preclude Pindi from hijacking the plot completely. The challenge can be outlined as regaining relevance, cementing consensus to nudge Taliban towards responsible governance, in effect retain leverages till compliance. More importantly, explore shared concerns and safeguard them. In Delhi dialogue, notwithstanding the Russian participation, some back tracking by Moscow on Delhi consensus has been reported. The need to be wary of stance of Zamir Kabulov, Russian interlocutor in Troika plus dialogue and his alleged pro-Pindi leaning. Is Russia utilising Nikolai Patrushev and Kabulov to remain engaged with two differing approaches? Indian opportunities lie with Iran and its ire at continuing marginalising of Shia, Hazaras and Ismailis. Insurgency in Sistan and growing number of refugees from Afghanistan have heightened concerns in Tehran. It is an opportunity to re-energise connectivity projects like Chabahar, Zaranj-Delaram, as part of North-South corridor. Side stepping US antagonism towards Iran and sanctions are the key challenges. Though seemingly tough, India needs to keep chipping at possibilities of reviving stake in Ayani air base in Tajikistan. This is specially critical as China is reportedly secured go ahead for policing and surveillance facility, essentially benign euphemism for military base. Our forays and efforts should include Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan, which is supposedly more autonomous. It may seem non-Kosher but it will be worthwhile to tie up with Americans, including utilisation of operating base, for OTH surveillance of possible areas of operation of ISIS and variants. It can have spin-offs in capability building, technology exchanges and messaging to ward off Chinese designs in Gilgit-Baltistan. It is time USA woke up to mess created due to over dependence on Pakistan and build redundancies through India. Euphoria in Pakistan over Taliban victory is having blow back effect. The government there caved in to self-appointed, anti-blasphemy warriors of TLP by accepting its unreasonable demands. It has resulted in main streaming and virtual carte blanche to the extremist party, whose cadres fired at and killed security personnel. In another incident, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had to appear before Supreme Court to explain amnesty to TTP, perpetrators of massacre of APS Peshawar. The growing perception is that the military has virtually capitulated, in Sirajuddin Haqqani brokered agreement. Repeated assurances on ISIS and TTP being under control are not even worth value of rapidly sinking Afghani currency. It is time world woke up to triggering of Domino effect of competitive extremism by legitimisation of TLP and TTP. The malevolence needs to be capped before, we confront new variants of ISIS, IMU, ETIM and more radical offshoots of Taliban. The answer lies in keeping focus on red lines and ensuring zero tolerance on terrorism specially its proliferation in neighbourhood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/regaining-relevance-in-afghan-maelstrom/articleshow/87691014.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Uro ailments worsen post-Covid infection’||LUCKNOW: As doctors handle surge in cases of worsening symptoms of urology related ailments in patients who had such issues before Covid-19, it is likely that the impact of Covid-19 may not be limited to just the respiratory system or other body organs directly involved with the disease While doctors insist a thorough research is needed to establish a distinct relation between Covid-19 infection and patients with urology issues, they agree that there are patients who are facing aggravated urology symptoms after contracting novel coronavirus. "Patients with post-Covid lower urinary tract symptoms are still coming to the outpatient department (OPD) several months after recuperating from the virus. They complain of having a sense of urgency for urination, increased frequency in urination and similar issues, which were perhaps present previously too, but the symptoms have worsened post-Covid," said Dr Alok Srivastava, faculty, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). "Such situation does arise in certain viral diseases, like Lyme disease, but there is currently no evidence to say the same correlation exists with Covid too," he added. Echoing the presence of a similar trend, urologist at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) Prof MS Ansari said, "There is not a new onset of urology symptoms in post-Covid patients, but for those patients who had a history or those who could not get timely consultation during the Covid period, are turning up with long term ill effects on their urinary system." This, he said, was true for patients with both benign and malignant forms of urology disorders. "A lot of the patients who were earlier dealing with a benign form of stone disease are dealing with an aggravated health situation. Similarly, patients of bladder dysfunction and urinary tract infection (UTI) are also seeing heightened symptoms," said Prof Ansari, while explaining the possible causes for thee trend. "Since treatment of these diseases require regular change in medication, which many could not have been able to get during Covid, there is a possibility that it could have added up to the problem at hand, causing renal failure in several patients," Prof Ansari said. Unfortunately, it is not just outside the urologist’s chamber that these patients are lining up but also the psychologists, who admit getting more patients complaining of urgency in urination and increased frequency. "A group of medical students had visited us with urology problems after doctors at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) referred them. These students were going through urology symptoms because of heightened anxiety and uncertainty in their line of duty with the expected third wave. They were also reliving the time of wearing PPE kits during service wherein they had to hold onto their bladder for long hours," said psychologist Dr Neha Anand. "A 30-year-old male post Covid patient also complained of the same symptoms owing to anxiety caused from the work from home setup," she added. “A 30-year-old male post Covid patient also complained of the same symptoms owing to anxiety caused from the work from home setup,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uro-ailments-worsen-post-covid-infection/articleshow/87691447.cms||Yusra Husain

The district collector said that due to refinery construction, traffic pressure has increased a lot between Pachpadra and Jodhpur, and in such a situation, the transport department and police should set up a permanent check post at the national highway near Pachpadra. Along with interception, vehicles should be deployed on the highway for taking action against speeding vehicles. He directed to put maximum speed limit signboards at the main places on national highways, in which speed limit for cars, buses, trucks etc is mentioned. The collector asked all passenger buses to have an emergency exit and put indicators on them, and directed officials to catch all buses that are running without the emergency exit door. He said that for emergencies, a sharp hammer should be kept so that in case of an accident, the glass can be easily broken. SP Deepak Bhargava said that accident-prone zones should be identified on national and state highways where signboards can be put up and the required technical improvement of the roads should be done. Also, camel carts, bullock carts, tractor trolleys etc should put radium on them and regular campaigns should be run for this. Additional district collector Om Prakash Vishnoi said that an inter-departmental committee has been formed for investigating the bus accident. In the meeting, CEO Mohan Dan Ratnu, additional SP Narpat Singh, district transport officer Sanjeev Choudhary, SE Kapil Verma, JP Suthar were present. Sub division officers at the block level remained connected to the meeting through VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meeting-held-to-avert-barmer-like-tragedy/articleshow/87691022.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid leading to rise in diabetes cases? Doctors try to figure out||NEW DELHI: Sayan Mukherjee, 49, was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 when, to his surprise, tests confirmed he also had diabetes. Mukherjee was, therefore, put on drugs to manage his blood sugar levels. But he is not alone. Dr S K Wangnoo, a senior consultant endocrinologist at Delhi’s Apollo hospital, says data from his OPD shows one out of every four diabetics he has seen over the last two years were diagnosed with the metabolic disease, which causes high blood sugar, while undergoing treatment for Covid-19. It is not yet clear whether the metabolic condition that causes high blood sugar levels was triggered by the coronavirus infection directly or it was diagnosed as a result of thorough testing. However, doctors say, there is going to be a definite rise in diabetes prevalence post-pandemic. “Our hospital is participating in a country-wide study to assess whether Covid-19 has led to a surge in diabetes cases,” Dr Wangnoo said. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body’s systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels, the World Health Organization says. On the brighter side, doctors say, the past few decades have witnessed significant advances in technologies as well as drug discoveries that help to effectively manage the metabolic disorder. According to Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc, new drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepetide help in achieving good weight loss in addition to controlling blood sugar levels. “There are also once a week insulin in the pipeline and new real time monitoring devices,” he said. Dr Sujeet Jha, who heads the endocrinology division at Max healthcare, said research conducted by them also shows that intensive lifestyle intervention delivered by healthcare workers with raised blood sugar levels and waist circumference helped in reducing both weight and waist circumference in one year. Weight-loss surgeries are known to benefit severely obese people who have uncontrolled diabetes. But recent studies show even those with mild obesity– BMI ranging between 30 kg/m2 and 34.9 kg/m2 – and uncontrolled diabetes can benefit from weight loss surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-leading-to-rise-in-diabetes-cases-doctors-try-to-figure-out/articleshow/87691026.cms||---
---||Delhi||AQI a bit better, but Delhi doesn’t get break from its gas chamber||NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to be a gas chamber for the second day in a row. Its air quality remained in the ‘severe’ category despite a slight improvement towards Saturday noon due to supportive weather conditions and drop in farm fire share in the city’s pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityPollution monitoring agencies expect a very slight and temporary relief on Sunday when the city's air quality index (AQI) may reach lower end of ‘severe’ or upper end of ‘very-poor’. According to the weather department, the slight improvement within the severe category on Saturday was a result of increased wind speed. However, the winds are expected to slow down from Sunday evening again, thereby increasing the pollution levels. “The wind speed increased by Saturday afternoon and reached about 12 kmph. This helped in clearing the region and provided some ventilation. The wind speed, however, will drop from Sunday evening leading to increased pollution levels,” said an official at India Meteorological Department. “The humidity may drop slightly tomorrow and the wind speed may remain moderate towards the noon but will drop in the evening. Thus, the relief from pollution may turn out to be temporary,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. The city's AQI spiked to spiked to 471 on Friday, which was worse than a day after Diwali, and improved to 437 on Saturday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. The PM2.5 levels, the major source of pollutant in air, hovered between 354.7 ug/m3 and 252.8 ug/m3. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 ug/m3. The PM10 levels on Saturday fluctuated between 547.9 ug/m3 and 420.2 ug/m3, against a safe limit of 100 ug/m3. Meanwhile, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels were above the dangerous threshold of 300 and 500 microgrammes per cubic metres (ug/m3), respectively, for 36 hours. However, the ‘air emergency’ or ‘severe++’ measures under Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) demand the PM2.5 or PM10 to remain over the threshold for at least 48 hours, under which entry of trucks is barred, odd-even vehicle rationing scheme implemented and construction activity stopped. “There is an urgent need to revisit the GRAP and reduce the waiting time for air emergency from 48 hours to something practical. In the matter of two days, the weather conditions change completely and keep fluctuating. So it is severe today, very-poor tomorrow and severe again. It’s the citizens at the receiving end,” said environmentalist MC Mehta. Following the adverse air pollution situation, the sub-committee of CAQM on GRAP held a meeting on Saturday evening, however, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels had come below the threshold by then. The sub-committee, hence, continued measures under ‘severe’ category that keep the stone crushers, brick kilns, etc, closed; suggest offices to reduce use of private vehicles; and advise citizens to avoid outdoors. The city saw a slight drop in farm fires in neighbouring states from 4,056 on Friday to 3,157 on Saturday, according to SAFAR. The share of stubble burning to the city’s pollution came down from over 21% to 10%. The unfavourable meteorological conditions are likely to prevail for next five days, stated Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-a-bit-better-but-city-doesnt-get-break-from-its-gas-chamber/articleshow/87691463.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Agra||Custodial death: FIR lodged against 'unknown UP policemen' as dad accuses 5 cops in complaint||AGRA: Four days after the death of Mohammad Altaf, 22, in police custody, his father Chand Miyan met the superintendent of police (SP) of Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod, to file a complaint on the basis of which an FIR has now been lodged against "unknown policemen" who have been charged with murder under IPC section 302. Miyan has accused five policemen for killing his son. They are station house officer Virendra Singh Indolia, sub-inspector Chandresh Gautam, sub-inspector Vikas Kumar, head moharrir (clerk) Dhanendra Singh, and constable Saurabh Solanki. All five had earlier been suspended for “negligence on duty” after news of Altaf's death in custody spread. Altaf's uncle, who accompanied Miyan to the SP's office, alleged that they were not provided with a copy of the complaint and were told to "go home". "They said that a copy of the FIR will be provided to us soon," he added. Police claimed that the FIR was lodged on the basis of an "earlier complaint received from Altaf's father by post". The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, is dated November 11 and doesn't mention the names of any policeman. “We were not aware of the names of the policemen at the time the first complaint was sent by post,” said Altaf's uncle. The SP explained: "The fresh complaint will be included in the existing FIR. Following an investigation, the names of all the policemen involved in the matter will be added. A special team has been constituted to investigate the case.” Chand Miyan said, “It is now clear that the FIR against my son was registered after his death. If he was found hanging at 2:30 pm, as the police claim, why was he taken to the hospital after 90 minutes? The police proposed a wrong theory about him being depressed and committing suicide to hide their crimes. My son was brutally murdered in police custody. I have filed a police complaint and the SP has assured me that he will take suitable action.” According to the police, Altaf, accused of kidnapping a Hindu girl, was found hanging in the lock-up's bathroom at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead after roughly 15 minutes. The FIR against Altaf says that the case was registered on Tuesday at 4 pm, much later than his time of death. Earlier in the week, a letter with the thumb impression of Chand Miyan went viral on social media. It stated, “My son Altaf committed suicide when he was taken by the police for questioning in a case. He was depressed. The police took him to the hospital but he died there. I don’t have any complaints against the police, nor do my family or I want any investigation in the matter.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said he was "detained" at the Goraha police outpost after the death of his son. “The police made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by policemen. I was asked to give a thumb impression and was told that if I don't do it, the dead body of my son will not be handed over to me and I will not be allowed to leave. I had no idea what was written in it,” the complaint said. “I was pressured to put a thumb impression on the letter.” Miyan's complaint says Altaf's height was more than 5.5 feet. However, the FIR says that his height was "around 5 feet.” The police had earlier claimed that Altaf had “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." The tap was less than 3 feet in height. Azad Samaj Party (ASP) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who had accompanied the family along with a delegation of local leaders to file the complaint, said, “The case was registered after Altaf's father met the SP and handed over a fresh complaint letter. Not naming the accused policemen is highly condemnable." On the basis of a complaint by a Rampur-based RTI activist, Danish Khan, the National Human Rights Commission has registered a complaint into the custodial death. Taking suo motu cognizance, the National Commission for Minorities has also issued a notice to the UP government and state police chief, seeking a detailed response on the death of Altaf at the Sadar Kotwali Police Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fir-lodged-against-unknown-policemen-as-dad-accuses-5-cops-in-complaint/articleshow/87690504.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Lucknow||Lucknow firm to make parts for Rafale, BAE, Safran||LUCKNOW: Located some 25 km away from the heart of the city, Precision Tools & Castings (PTC Industries), with its 150 engineers and advance army of robots has been silently manufacturing high quality engineering components for various critical and supercritical applications for advance world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile Brahmos missile, ISRO rockets. Now its subsidiary Aerolloy Technologies Limited will develop components for multi-role fighter jets like Rafale , nuclear submarines under advanced technology vessel project, ultra-light howitzers gun and others. Focused on import substitution since 1963 and exporting to nearly 20 countries for over 35 years, in 2017 PTC set up a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility called the Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Centre (AMTC) in Lucknow with an investment of over Rs 250 crore. Under the AMTC campus, on Saturday defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the PTC’s subsidiary and laid the foundation stone for an integrated metal manufacturing facility that will produce key raw materials in titanium and other exotic Alloys for aerospace applications. This facility houses the most advanced manufacturing technologies such as Replicast, Rapidcast, Forgecast, Titanium casting with the latest machineries and a high level of robot-assisted automation for manufacture of metal components and sub-systems. Speaking to TOI, the chairperson and MD of PTC, Sachin Agarwal said, “We are among less than half a dozen manufacturers in the world who have developed indigenous capabilities to manufacture super-critical metal components, subsystems in Titanium, super nickel alloys and other exotic materials which were earlier inaccessible to India for defense and aero-space.” “If the country has to surpass its rivals and develop a strong economy, manufacturing is the key to it. We manufacture components for BrahMos missile, ISRO rockets, and other systems but now will move into production of components for Rafale jet engines, ATVP nuclear submarines, BAE systems, strategy systems for Safran, Honeywell, helicopter engines, drones and US howitzer ultra-light guns. The UP government understands how important manufacturing is for economic growth and is creating an ecosystem to nurture industries like us in a dedicated defence corridor program,” he said. PTC exports 75% products to foreign firms like Rolls Royce, Siemens, GE, Alstom and Emerson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-firm-to-make-parts-for-rafale-bae-safran/articleshow/87691477.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Cinemas and multiplexes were also permitted to operate at 100% seating capacity. As Covid cases have been on the lower side for the past several weeks now, the government asked residential universities to prepare a schedule for students to return to campuses in phases. The state, however, stopped short of lifting the lockdown and extended it by a fortnight till November 28. Cinema owners welcomed the move, saying it would help them tide over the losses incurred during the two subsequent lockdowns. “We are happy with the government’s decision. We are hoping to make some profits this month as there are a few big movies lined up now,” said Sanjay Barjatya, the regional head of Miraj Cinemas. Owners of restaurants are still waiting for corporate houses to call employees to offices.For social gatherings, however, the cap stays.

With the region witnessing a dip in Covid-19 cases, the college campuses are abuzz with activities that students missed out on for a long time due to the pandemic. It was either held virtually or cancelled altogether in most campuses. Rajesh Chowta, chairman, Mangalore Institute of Technology and Engineering (MITE), Moodabidri, said that those students who are now in their final year of engineering have attended on-campus classes for only one-and-a-half years. “They have not witnessed college life as others have experienced it. Therefore, the college has planned to conduct all inter-department competitions, including the institution’s biggest cultural programme—Sentia Award Nite—that is usually held in March,” he said. “We may not plan an inter –collegiate festival, since we are not sure if the colleges from other districts and states would come to our campus due to Covid-19,” he said, adding that groundwork for next year’s events have already begun. The demand to start these activities have come from students in a majority of the colleges. Spokesperson of St Joseph Engineering College, Sathyendra Bhat J, said, “Only academics is not enough for students. They requested us to hold all events that were planned in a virtual mode, on campus instead. Due to the pandemic, they have missed the chance to showcase their non-academic talent. The virtual events had made no impact, and were not interesting as the on-campus ones,” said Bhat. On Saturday, the campus held a day-long Milan-2021, an inter-class cultural event. The last Milan fest was held in 2019. “We will resume all other activities which were halted,” he said. The students who were taking online classes are participating more actively in these extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, compared to the days before the pandemic, said St Aloysius PU College principal Fr Clifford Sequeira. “The institution had shifted all the activities, including academics, online. However, from this academic year, we will have them offline. We will also organise the annual sports day and inter-collegiate fest ‘PreUnique’ this year,” he said. “I had imagined that my PU college days would end without getting a stage to showcase my talent. I am happy to be able to spend a few months on campus,” said Fevin D’Souza, a II PU student and budding vocalist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/college-campuses-abuzz-with-co-curricular-activities/articleshow/87689720.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Kolkata||Most parents agree to send kids to school, some wait & watch||Kolkata: Barring a few schools where parents are still taking time to make up their minds, in most others a large number of parents has already consented to sending their children to school on Tuesday. In some cases, 100% consent has come in already. Those that are yet to get satisfactory response from parents are extending the deadline to take last-minute calls. Most schools are keeping the hybrid option open so that children of unwilling parents can stay home and attend online classes and the syllabus doesn’t suffer. Heritage School is among those where almost all parents have consented, not only for the board years but also for classes IX and XI and hence the term exam in this school, starting later this month, will be conducted only in the offline mode. There will be no option for online exam. If a child is sick or there is a genuine reason for absence, they will be allowed to write the test at a later date but that has to be from school, said principal Seema Sapru. South City International School is another one where almost all parents have given consent, said principal John Bagul. “We are starting out with some mock practice tests on OMR sheets for the board year students when school reopens on Tuesday,” he added. Some schools like Rammohan Mission and DPS Ruby Park have just announced the re-opening and did not seek consent letters. In the parent-teacher meetings, however, parents have said that they were in favour of sending children back to school as the online classes have exhausted their utility. “More than 80% parents have said that they were sending their wards back. We did not seek consent because we are reopening by government order, expecting kids to come back. By sending their children to us, they are automatically giving consent,” reasoned Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohan Mission. La Martiniere for Boys School, which is re-opening with classes IX and XI first, not wishing to disturb the board year students, has managed to get consent only from one fourth of the parents. “We have kept the classes hybrid so that no one misses out. I believe that initially parents are apprehensive but gradually the ice will melt,” said acting principal John Stephen. One reason why many parents are reluctant is because children of classes IX and XI will stop coming to school and will go back to online classes when the board exams begin on November 22 for ISC and November 29 for ICSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-parents-agree-to-send-kids-to-school-some-wait-watch/articleshow/87690538.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Villagers of 2 panchayats cast vote to ban liquor||JAIPUR: Two Panchayats, Barar and Weir, have become the fourth and fifth in Rajsamand district to vote for the removal of a liquor shop in the village on Saturday. The voting for the removal took place under the relevant sections of the Rajasthan Excise Act following the movement by the village women since 2015. The voting started at 8am till 5pm saw 64% voting mostly by the women sealed the fate of the sale of liquor in the village. The minimum votes required is 51% of the total registered 5,632 voters. The enthusiasm level in both the panchayats was far high than assembly and legislative polls as women came out in hordes singing and dancing till late in the evening. Sarpanch of Barar, Pankaja Singh along with a group of women ran from one house to another calling women to vote throughout the day. “Our village men are addicted to liquor in high numbers is a reason that women and children in every second household suffer from domestic violence. The addiction has increased the poverty in the village as the men were selling ornaments, land and movable articles to pay for the liquor,” said Singh who recalled that in 2015 for the first time she gave the representation to local administration against the removal of the shop. The pre-condition for the polls is that 20% of the voters must agree to vote by signing a petition. In 2017, the movement received a setback when the village didn’t qualify for the voting as less than 20% of the villagers agree to go for votes. The campaign again intensified in 2019 and the village qualified for the voting in 2021 along with Wier. Arvind Poswal, the district collector of Rajsamand, says, “The application for the voting was seriously pursued by us even after the failure in the first attempt. I gave credit to the resolve of women who have never given up for the past five years.” He informed that this is the fourth village in the district and assured that if his office will come across any such application will be proceeded immediately. Pooja Bharti Chhabra, national president of Sharabbandi Andolan, the provision of removal of a liquor shop in panchayat and ward wise was injected in 2013 in Rajasthan Excise Act by the Gehlot government. “So far, seven panchayats have exercised the special right including five in panchayats, Kachabali, Mandawar, Thaneta, Barar and Wier (Rajsamand), Rozda gram panchayat in Jaipur Rural and Foga gram panchayat in Churu,” said Chhabra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villagers-of-2-panchayats-cast-vote-to-ban-liquor/articleshow/87691043.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Return-to-school plans hit uniform-size hurdle||KOLKATA: Ankita Mukherjee was relieved hearing about the reopening of schools from November 16 as her son, who is in the Xth standard, was growing increasingly restless and had started showing disinterest in other activities. But she was in a for a shock when she discovered he had outgrown his uniform. This is not a one-off case. Several parents are faced with this dilemma where their children have outgrown their uniforms and shoes in the last 20 months since schools and colleges shut down in March 2020. Lack of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and binge eating induced by boredom along with natural growth in mid-teens have meant that many students in the higher classes have outgrown their uniforms. Parents are scrambling to purchase new uniform, blazers, pullovers and shoes at the last moment as none of the schools has said that students can attend classes in casuals. “It did not cross my mind earlier but earlier this week, when I took out my son’s uniform from the closet, I realised he will not fit into it. My fears came true when I made him wear it,” said Mukherjee, a resident of Maniktala. Ankit Pachisia will have to purchase a pair of school shoes and a pair of sports shoes for school. “A couple of days ago, I took out my shoes to polish them and tried wearing them. I realised that they were not fitting me anymore. I wore school shoes after almost 20 months,” said Pachisia. Parents are faced with another dilemma. By the time November starts, most schools shift to winter uniforms with full sleeves and blazers. But this time, schools have not mentioned anything yet about students wearing winter uniforms though morning chill has already set in. “So we are not sure if we should buy the winter uniform or not,” said Sunita Banerjee Sarkar, whose son studies in a school off the EM Bypass. Parents will also have to purchase some spare sets of uniforms due to the pandemic. “If there are three or four sets of uniforms, it will be easier to wash and sanitise them,”said another parent. Schools say they are as much in the dark as the parents about how the situation will unfold in the coming few days. “Everything depends on how the Covid situation is in the next few weeks. Earlier this year, too, we,tried reopening, but the second wave undid all the plans. If we tell parents to buy new uniforms and schools have to be shut again after a few days, students will outgrow even the new uniforms. So, at this juncture, it is meaningless to say anything about uniforms,” said the principal of a central Kolkata school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/return-to-school-plans-hit-uniform-size-hurdle/articleshow/87690541.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In the meantime, two youths on camels came rushing into the Indian border from Pakistan side and tried to throw something tied with stones. The BSF jawans, giving warning, tried to catch them but they ran back to Pakistan. BSF registered strict protest to Pakistan and handed over a protest note, and the two youths caught near the Indian border were handed over to Beenjraad police. Continuous efforts are being made to push heroin consignments across the border adjoining Barmer. But an alert BSF is foiling their efforts. According to information from official sources in BSF, the alert jawans saw two suspicious looking shepherds going towards the fencing at the international border at BKD bop of the 50th battalion in Beenjraad police station area. The BSF caught them but they could not give any satisfactory reply. In the inquiry, they said that they came near the fencing while grazing goats. They told their names to be Awas Khan (25) and Idrish Khan (20), residents of Hasam Khan ki Dhani. BSF held a flag meeting with Pakistan rangers and gave a strict protest note.

---||Jodhpur||Miscreants loot Rs 26 lakh from ATM near Jodhpur||JODHPUR: In yet another money heist, some persons fled with Rs 26 lakh from an ATM in Beru village near Jodhpur on Friday night. The incident came to the notice on Saturday morning only after villagers saw the broken shutter of the ATM. According to police, the information was received on Saturday that the shutter of an ATM of the Bank of India was broken. The looters used a heavy iron rod to lift the shutter of the ATM and broke into it. “When we reached there and entered the ATM after lifting the shutter, it was found to be damaged badly,” said the police. According to bank officials, Rs 25.75 lakh were stacked in the ATM before the loot and the looters decamped with the entire amount. Though the police have started the investigation into the matter, the preliminary investigation has revealed that there were four persons involved in the heist, which was executed sometime late Friday night. According to the information, an unsuccessful bid to loot the same ATM had been reported about six months back. But inspite of that, the bank officials have not put in adequate security measures to safeguard the ATM. As a safety measure, however, they kept the ATM shut at night, possibly to avert repeat of any such incident but even this could not save the ATM from this big loot. The incident took place three days after two unidentified robbers looted Rs 12 lakh from a rural branch of SBI in Gangani village near Jodhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/miscreants-loot-rs-26l-from-atm-near-jodhpur/articleshow/87691047.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Pvt schools look at new ways to keep students engaged in online classes||Kolkata: Although the state school education department is planning to distribute Foundational Numeracy and Literacy (FLN) material among students of junior classes to fill up gaps in learning that may have occurred due to inadequacies of the online method, some city private schools are applying various methods on their own and experimenting to make the teaching-learning process more attractive for young students who may have to continue online classes for several more months. Private schools started online classes immediately after the Covid outbreak. Over the last two years, several disadvantages of online learning, like loss of patience, lack of concentration, spelling mistakes, bad handwriting, reduction in attention span and frequent numerical errors, have been observed by the schools. Rumki Chakraborty, mathematics teacher at a private school, said, “Students have turned restless because they are unable to share their emotions. So, I try to make them share everything with me. Many students have lost interest in mathematics because they are unable to understand properly through the online mode. I have started using entry-exit numeric passes, which actually works to enhance their number knowledge.” Some private school teachers are trying to relate day-to-day life and events with studies. “I asked students to draw rangoli on Diwali, through which they learnt about shapes without unnecessary stress. Sometimes, I ask them to make audio-visual presentations on a particular topic and I have noticed that it really works,” Chakraborty said. North Point Senior Secondary Boarding School is applying Social Emotional Learning or SEL. Director of the school Rita Chatterjee said, “Despite the content of the syllabus, it is more important whether the child is enjoying it or not. Teachers are using various methods. It is important to keep the writing habit, so teachers are instructed to get kids to write regularly.” It has been noticed in some schools that many students are not focusing on the languages, while others have lost the reading habit. Poor handwriting and spelling mistakes are also more frequent. Prapti Bhar, English teacher at a private school, said, “While initially happy to be home, children started missing the school environment within two-three months. So, we try to make the whole learning atmosphere as happy as possible. We have slashed the syllabus and have tried to include activity-based learning. We applied the ‘Dream Journal’ method, where students write about their dreams and read it out in class.” Debjani Das Roy, another language teacher, said, “We noticed that during tests, students get help from parents or the internet. So, we have started giving 50% focus on picture composition, 25% on grammar and 25% on audio-visual presentation.” Most teachers believe schools should be opened for all classes as early as possible. Rekha Baishya, academic director of Salt Lake Shiksha Niketan, said, “We are applying methods to make online learning joyful, but nothing can replace physical classes.” The result of the National Achievement Survey will help find out the loopholes in the teaching-learning method of the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-schools-look-at-new-ways-to-keep-students-engaged-in-online-classes/articleshow/87690545.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Jailed in S Arabia for FB post: Kin approaches MEA for help||Mangaluru: A woman from the city has sought the intervention of the external affairs ministry for the release of her husband, who has been languishing in a jail in Saudi Arabia for nearly 20 months, in connection with a blasphemous social media post. Kavitha, a resident of Barnakatte in the city, said that her husband Shailesh Kottari,52, has been falsely implicated in connection with a Facebook post against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia. The mother of two, Kavitha said that Shailesh was not aware of the Facebook post, which was allegedly shared by miscreants using a fake profile created in his name. Jithendra Kottari, social worker and a BJP leader, told TOI that the issue has already been communicated with Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel. “Shailesh, who was working for a private company in the hospitality sector in Saudi Arabia for the past 20 years, had deleted his Facebook account after he got threat calls for sharing posts in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Indian government. Later, he was shocked to find a FB page in his name on January 23 last year. Posts against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia were shared on the fake page, which was created using his name and picture. Soon, he brought the issue to the notice of his employer, who suggested that he file a complaint. When he went to the police to file a complaint on February 16, he was arrested and a case was booked against him,” he said. MP Kateel has already sent a request to the ministry of external affairs. “In this particular case, only the central government can help the family since Shailesh has been booked for social media posts against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia. We have decided to bring the issue to the notice of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. We have planned to meet the external affairs minister on November 19 through our MP. Many NRIs and Kannada Sanghas from Dakshina Kannada in Saudi Arabia have contacted us and offered their help,” he added. Kavitha said that they did not allow her husband to make calls to her. “The authorities in Saudi Arabia take him to court regularly, but are not giving any information,” she added. In a similar incident, Harish Bangera, a resident of Goyadibettu in Beejadi village, Kundapur, an air-conditioning technician for a company in Dammam, was arrested for allegedly posting derogatory messages on Facebook against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and a community. He was released in August this year. Several organisations and people’s representatives had worked for his release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/jailed-in-s-arabia-for-fb-post-kin-approaches-mea-for-help/articleshow/87689743.cms||---

After a one-day break, the state has again seen daily cases increase. With the next few days crucial, the state health department has asked cities and districts to go all-out to ensure that no suspected case goes unreported. A high-level meeting was conducted by the chief secretary to contain the spike. An official present said that the emphasis is on ensuring the best possible monitoring for the next fortnight. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health), told TOI that testing will be increased manyfold. “Before Diwali, about 50,000-70,000 tests were conducted, which came down to about 35,000 during Diwali. We instructed all cities and districts to ramp up testing by setting up kiosks, mobile testing vans and to pay special attention to those entering at bus depots, railway stations, airports and district or state borders,” he said. Aggarwal asked municipal commissioners and collectors to send medical teams to tourist destinations and places with high footfalls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cities-districts-directed-to-screen-all-on-entry/articleshow/87690556.cms||---

---||Pune||Mixing with peers helps in kids’ development: Experts||Pune: With some normalcy into play, children are glad to be able to visit parks, go for movies and be allowed at restaurants. Even so, there are missing out on many activities that are important for their all-round development. Punam Vasudevan, a mother of a six-year-old, said, “My son plays in our housing society with children most of whom are much older to him. I feel he is missing out on the experience of being treated as an equal among peers.” Rahul Agarwal, a father of a five-year-old, said, “I enrolled my daughter for tuition so that she could physically interact and socialise with children of her own age. Her confidence has since gone up. She is learning to be more independent, and there is a sense of healthy competition among her peers when it comes to schoolwork, which she was missing out on when she was only attending online classes at home.” While on-ground classes have resumed for senior students, educators and parents believe that pre-primary students might not be called back to school before next year. The lack of a classroom environment for almost two school years has already affected their social development. “For pre-primary children, a classroom provides an environment for forming bonds, making friends, learning discipline and responsibility, which cannot be taught at home under the supervision of a parent. Things like taking care of one’s belonging, taking out notebooks and pencils for work and putting them back, eating tiffin, going to the toilet by themselves etc are learnt in a school environment. But while we wait for in-school classes to resume for the little ones, parents can help in the development of their independence by giving them simple household chores to do such as keeping the groceries and vegetables by at home, keeping their plate in the kitchen sink after eating etc. This will give them a sense of responsibility,” said Moumita Sarkar, a special educator. Child psychologist Nilanjana Singh said, “Being among peers helps children build their personality. Peer relationships are crucial for development of their emotional, ethical and moral development as well as cognitive and problem-solving skills. Some parents have formed play groups. They bring children from the same class to a playground, park or a common area where they can meet and play, instead of just seeing each other on screen during online classes.” Nelson Fernandez, a pre-primary teacher, has noticed that the classroom environment allows students to make mistakes and learn from them while at home they are assisted by parents to submit perfect assignments, which hinders their evaluation and education. “Parents often help their children complete the worksheets and assignment without realising that we do not expect it to be perfect. We want them to do the work and learn from their mistakes. It makes it difficult for teachers to evaluate how much the student has learnt, where they are lacking, and need help.” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mixing-with-peers-helps-in-kids-development-experts/articleshow/87690559.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The police found the person had used a similar modus operandi for cheating two other shopkeepers in the last few days in Pimpri Chinchwad. “The person is around 38 years old. He comes on a bike and visits jewellery shops under the pretext of buying gold. He creates a message showing details of the payment with date and account number,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jeweller-duped-of-rs-25350-in-chinchwad/articleshow/87690551.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Despite SC directive, security yet to be provided to key witnesses||BAREILLY: Farmers, who are witnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that took place on October 3, have alleged that they have not been given security cover, despite the Supreme Court (SC) directing the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to witnesses in the high-profile case, in which Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish is the main accused. UP police have provided security cover to nearly 100 witnesses as well as to the families of the deceased. However, farmers from Uttarakhand alleged they have not been given any protection yet. Tejinder Singh Virk, farmer leader from Uttarakhand, who sustained a deep head injury and backbone fracture after being hit by Ashish Mishra’s convoy, said that he along with other farmers who are witnesses in the case, was nearly killed but they are yet to get police security despite the SC direction. He added that he has sent applications to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the President of India with a request to provide protection. A member of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the matter said that they are writing to the Uttarakhand police to provide security cover to the farmers. When queried, Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said that he has “no information yet on any security cover to be provided to farmers who are witnesses in the Kheri case.” Meanwhile, Virk said that he was called to Kheri from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand on Thursday and made to sit for almost seven hours without being produced in court. Three other farmers from Uttarakhand accompanying Virk, Gurjeet Singh, Harpal Singh, and Hardeep Singh, who are survivors of the violence and witnesses in the case, were also made to wait for several hours and their statements not recorded in court either, he alleged. Harjeet Singh, the farmers' counsel termed this as “deliberate harassment of key witnesses.” Virk told TOI, “After coordinating with the SIT members, it was decided that our statement will be recorded in court on November 11. I was in the hospital for nearly a month and have had head surgery so it is not possible to travel easily. I somehow reached on time but was made to sit for several hours along with three other farmers who had also sustained injuries earlier." Virk claimed that the SIT officials initially told him that they don't “have anyone to take him to court.” He says he was taken to the court later, but the officials took him back before he could enter the premises, saying that "the magistrate is not there." SIT counsel and special prosecution officer, S P Yadav, when asked about the issue, said, “I was there in court on November 11 and the magistrate was also present but the three farmers were not produced to record their statement. I am not sure why that happened."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-despite-sc-directive-security-yet-to-be-provided-to-key-witnesses/articleshow/87690550.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Varanasi||At Rajbhasha meet in Kashi, Amit Shah invokes Savarkar||VARANASI: Invoking Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the Hindu nationalist ideologue, activist and writer, here on Saturday to put across his views on Hindi, Union home Minister Amit Shah said he (Savarkar) enriched Hindi by inducting many words in his ‘Hindi Shabdkosh’. Shah was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan, organised by the Rajbhasha department of the home ministry at the Trade Facilitation Centre, Bada Lalpur. Citing the example of Savarkar, Shah said, “Agar Veer Savarkar Ji na hote to shayad hum Angrezi shabdon ka hi prayog kar rahe hote (had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only),” said Shah, adding that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary, and introduced many new words. The time has come to make Hindi flexible for the wide acceptance of people,” Shah added. Shah said that the country which loses its ‘swabhasha’ (native language), also loses its original thinking and culture. The original thinking can only come from native or the mother tongue, he added. Shah said that Gandhiji converted the freedom movement into a people’s movement with three pillars: Swaraj, Swadeshi and Swabhasha. “Swaraj was achieved, but Swadeshi and Swabhasha were left behind,” he said, adding that the government has set a target to establish the glory of Swabhasha and Swadeshi in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ (next 25-years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav) when the country will celebrate its 100th Independence Day. Shah said that the Central government has given special emphasis to Rajbhasha under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “One of the main points of the new education policy is the promotion of native languages. The new change that the Prime Minister has made will change the future of India,” he said, adding, “For the first time since independence, the convention of Rajbhasha has been taken out of Delhi and organised in Kashi, which immensely contributed for the enrichment of Hindi.” “I am a Gujarati and speak in my native language, but I love Hindi more than Gujarati. We need to strengthen our Rajbhasha,” said Shah, adding, “There is no conflict between Hindi (Rajbhasha) and local languages, rather they are complementary to each other.” Rajbhasha can prosper only when the local languages are protected. It is the responsibility of the Rajbhasha department to promote and protect the local languages, he added. Shah also made an appeal to all guardians to talk to their children in their own native language. “It does not matter in which medium they are studying, talk to them in native language in your home in order to increase their confidence levels, so that they have no hesitation in speaking their own mother tongue,” Shah said adding that speaking in native language would not only benefit the language, but also benefit the children because original thinking could only result from native language. “Attempts were made in the past to spark controversies on Hindi language, but now it is over,” said Shah, adding, “There used to be a time when we were afraid, but a new era has started when we would be proud. This transformation of fear to feel pride and honour has been a huge achievement of Narendra Modi’s administration.” “We have set a goal to promote Rajbhasha and local languages in the fields of education, administration, judicial work, technical work, communication and entertainment,” he said and made an appeal to all to create a conducive atmosphere in the country for this purpose. The event was also addressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-rajbhasha-meet-shah-invokes-veer-savarkar/articleshow/87691490.cms||---

A simultaneous and sharp rise in the prevalence of diabetes-related preventable vision loss has also been observed. It is estimated that around 1.1 crore people suffer from retinal disorders in India. Alarmingly, about one in every three persons living with diabetes has some degree of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetes-related complication that affects the eyes. The young population suffering from juvenile diabetes, (Type 1 diabetes) is vulnerable to diabetic retinopathy, especially if they have had diabetes for over 10 years. Even people suffering from Type-2 diabetes are at risk of losing their eyesight due to the onset of diabetes-related retinal diseases. Dr Vishali Gupta, professor, Vitreoretinal and Uvea Advanced Eye Centre, PGI said, “In India, the burden of retinal diseases is on the rise. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), for instance, mainly affects the working age population of 35 to 45-year-olds, causing distorted vision. However, DME onset can be significantly delayed if diabetics effectively control their diabetes and blood sugar levels,” she said. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY: The young population suffering from juvenile diabetes, (Type 1 diabetes) is vulnerable to diabetic retinopathy, especially if they have had diabetes for over 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/burden-of-retinal-diseases-caused-by-diabetes-on-the-rise-pgi-doc/articleshow/87690561.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Of the five active patients in the district, two patients are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Igatpuri and two in Malegaon and one in Nashik city.According to the data shared by the state health department, the five districts of north Maharashtra — Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar — have 32 active cases.The total number of active cases in these five districts was 51 during the second week of October. Nashik (23) had the most number of active cases, followed by Nandurbar (14), Ahmednagar (13), Jalgaon (1) and Dhule continued to have no active mucormycosis cases. Dr Sanjay Gangurde, the Nashik district coordinator for mucormycosis and ENT surgeon of Nashik civil hospital, told TOI that active mucormycosis cases are fast declining in the district. “At one point in time, we had around 450 active cases in Nashik. And there was a huge demand for the injection to treat patients suffering from this ailment. But things are under control,” he said. According to him, district collector Suraj Mandhare and district civil surgeon, Dr Ashok Thorat guided the panel set up by the administration to deal with the mucormycosis cases. Nashik had registered 782 mucormycosis cases in the last few months and 84 patients had succumbed due to the infection. About 511 surgeries were performed for removal of eyes, nasal portion etc. “Cases of Covid are declining due to which cases of mucormycosis are also dropping. But more important measures for treating Covid patients like judicious use of steroids and medical oxygen to treat patients have played an important role in reducing mucormycosis cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5-active-cases-of-mucormycosis-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/87689764.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Police on Saturday said the case had been taken under the Case Officer’s Scheme and they would request the court for a speedy trial. On October 5, headmaster Keshav Yadav raped the girl studying in class 7. The girl initially kept mum and later informed her family members who approached the child welfare committee through child helpline on October 13. Thereafter, an FIR was lodged on October 14 at Singhana police station. On October 16, Singhana police in Jhunjhunu arrested Yadav, which was followed by the arrests of two women teachers including Sunila and Sumitra, who allegedly exerted pressure on the girl and her family to keep the case under the wraps. As per the chargesheet filed by Singhana police, Yadav has been charged with Sections 376(2)(H) which deals with punishment of sexual assault of child below 16 years, 354(outraging the modesty) and 506(criminal intimidation) of IPC and sections 5,6,9,10,12 of POCSO Act and also against 67-A of IT Act. On the other hand, the two woman teachers, who are co-accused in the case, were charged with Section 201(Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and Sections 16,17, and 18 of POCSO Act. “Both the teachers had deleted the vulgar messages sent by the main accused,” said an officer. Senior police officers said the case had already been taken under the Case Officer’s Scheme. “We have dedicated an officer who would appear in the day-to-day hearings of the case and we would also request the court for speedy trial,” said a senior police officer. The court has fixed November 16 as next date of hearing in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-file-chargesheet-against-headmaster-for-raping-11-year-old-girl/articleshow/87691061.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Corona warrior’s death: Gujarat HC moved for Rs 25 lakh compensation||AHMEDABAD: A woman has approached the Gujarat high court after she was not given Rs 25 lakh compensation by the state government after her husband, who was a primary school principal and worked as a corona warrior in Covid-19 duties assigned by the authorities, died and the hospitals did not clearly mention the cause of death in his death certificate. After preliminary hearing, Justice Sangeeta Vishen issued notice to the authorities seeking their replies on why cause of death was not mentioned in the death certificate. The court has also asked the Botad district panchayat education department to place on record its decision taken over the widow’s request for compensation for the death of the corona warrior. The case involved Manishaben Bhavnagariya (34), whose husband Dineshbhai was posted a principal in a primary school at Sarva village of Botad district since December 2019. Bhavnagariya has submitted that her husband had to undertake various Covid duties following different notifications issued by the higher authorities. Those circulars named primary teachers as corona warriors and her husband’s name also figured in the list. “After working as corona warrior and serving Covid-19 duty to the government and citizens for so many months, subsequently he started showing symptoms of Covid-19 himself. He was clinically diagnosed and his treatment was done as a corona patient,” the petition reads. The principal passed away on September 13, 2020 after few days of hospitalisation in Sir Takhtasinhji General Hospital at Bhavnagar. The petitioner submitted that her husband was cremated at Gorad crematorium and the fees charged by the Smashan Samiti were also for corona death. He was treated for Covid and his last rites also took place according to the guidelines for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients. The hospitalisation, treatment and finally the handling of the dead body revealed that it was a covid death. However, the hospital mentioned in its certificate that it cannot accord a specific opinion of whether he died due to Covid-19 or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-warriors-death-hc-moved-for-rs-25l-compensation/articleshow/87690568.cms||---

Walking barefoot to receive one of India’s highest civilian honours from President Ram Nath Kovind last week, Padma Shri Harekala Hajabba and Padma Shri Tulasi Gouda stood out among all the awardees and won a million hearts. On Saturday Tulasi aka ‘Vruksha Mathe’ called on Hajabba known as ‘Akshara Santha’ (Saint of Letters) at his house on the outskirts of Mangaluru. Tulasi, her daughter-in-law Venkamma and grandchildren, Shekhar and Hema, visited Hajabba and had breakfast at his house. The orange vendor and his family honoured the green warrior from Honnali village in Uttara Kannada district. Hajabba said that though the two wanted to meet each other during the award ceremony in the national capital it was not possible. “I am happy that Tulasi Gouda has visited this poor man’s house. I consider this as great honour in my life. I could not meet her at the airport either,” Hajabba said. On her part the 72-year-old Tulasi said she intends to support Hajabba in his dream. “ I will extend my support for the development of Hajabba’s school. He should contribute more for society and people must support him in his dreams,” she said. Later, Tulasi was accorded a warm welcome by students and staff of Hajabba’s school. They took her in a procession from his house to the school. Both the Padma awardees were honoured by the students and teachers. Tulasi also interacted with the children much to their delight. She held students in her thrall with her innate knowledge of plants and how she gained it while working alongside her mother from when she was just 12 years old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/barefoot-warriors-catch-up-overbreakfast-at-hajabbas-house/articleshow/87689772.cms||---
---||World||Booster dose is a scandal, must stop now: WHO||At a time when the discourse on booster shot of Covid vaccines has commenced in many countries, including India, the WHO called distribution of booster doses “a scandal that must stop now”. In August, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a global moratorium on boosters that he later extended until the end of the year. But, countries such as Germany, Israel, Canada and US have gone ahead with booster schemes. “It makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults or to vaccinate kids, when health workers, older people and other high risk groups around the world are still waiting for their first dose,” Tedros said as he condemned stockpiling and administration of booster shots. Countries with highest vaccination coverage are stockpiling more vaccines, whereas low-income nations are struggling to get even the first dose for their population. “Everyday there are six times more boosters administered globally than primary doses in low-income countries,” Tedros said. In India, while the government is yet to take a call on booster doses and is focused on ramping up coverage of first and second doses, many states and health experts have started advocating in favour of booster doses, mainly for health workers and elderly who were prioritised to receive the vaccine. WHO officials underlined unequal distribution of jabs can pose risks not only to countries with low vaccination coverage but also to others as economies are opening up, restrictions are being lifted and travel has begun. Noting that over 100 countries are still short of vaccinating even 40% of their population with first dose of the vaccine, the WHO said an additional 550 million doses are required to achieve the target of vaccinating at least 40% of the population of every country by end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/booster-dose-is-a-scandal-must-stop-now-who/articleshow/87692161.cms||Sushmi Dey

It is the fourth such case being reported in the district in the past three months. Incidentally, all other cases were also reported under the rural police district. On August 31, a woman was gruesomely murdered by her estranged husband on a public road by slitting her throat near Pothencode. Suspicion of infidelity was what led to the crime. On August 26, a woman was killed by her husband at home during a domestic dispute. Relatives revealed that quarrels were common between the couple. On August 20, a woman was killed by her husband at Edava during a quarrel. Speaking to TOI, rural district police chief superintendent P K Madhu said that this undesirable trend has come to his notice. “For now, all we can do is to urge the woman to seek help as soon as they sense danger. We have a women's cell that provides counsellors’ service to hear their problems and provide legal guidance,” the SP said, adding that in all these cases, the couple had a history of breaking into quarrels at home, which could be a sign of impending danger. The circumstances that lead to the murder at Palode were also no different. “Unfortunately, many refrain from reporting domestic abuse or seeking help from family, which results in their plight going unnoticed,” P K Madhu said. With the threat of Covid still remaining, the several community related activities of the police are yet to get back to full swing as their primary goal still now is enforcing Covid protocols. There are schemes under Janamaithri community policing initiative which involve officers visiting neighbourhoods and even households and interacting with individuals to learn about their problems. The department is devising plans to relaunch those schemes with improved efficiency. “We believe that many domestic issues can be addressed through good community policing initiatives,” the SP said. Meanwhile on Friday, the Palode police received a letter, apparently written by Abduk Rahim, in which he mentioned that he suspected his wife of infidelity which provoked him to commit the crime. The letter was addressed to the inspector of Palode police station and it arrived on post. “The date on the latter indicates that it was posted a day ago. Which means he posted it while escaping from the house after committing the crime,” Palode inspector C K Manoj said. The police on Friday searched the city for the suspect. This was after they received surveillance camera footage suggesting his presence in the city. His last known location, as per the footage received, was Karamana. Rural SP P K Madhu said that the suspect has made some scandalous allegations against his wife, which the police have not taken into face value. The primary focus of the police is to nab the suspect and bring him before the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cases-of-domestic-violence-homicides-rising-in-district/articleshow/87674024.cms||---

In an attempt to boost the vaccination compliance, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has launched a state-wide drive for this. Dr Mehul Shah, secretary of IMA Gujarat chapter, said that thousands of doctors are members of the association. “Through our different chapters, we are amplifying the message of full vaccination. We had a talk with the state health department after which we have conveyed to our members that they should take the vaccination status of the patient and their relatives. If they are due and had not taken it, the doctors should know the reason,” said Dr Shah. If it’s due to any medical condition, they should be appraised of the possible way, and if it’s due to any misconception, it should be allayed with logical argument, he added. Senior IMA officials said that the focus would be districts with very less coverage of first and second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gps-to-check-vax-status-of-patients/articleshow/87690596.cms||---
---||Delhi||Successive CJIs showed concern at air pollution||New Delhi: For the past six years, the Chief Justices of India have repeatedly given clarion calls for urgent measures to find sustainable solutions to the problem of noxious air — emitted from industries, vehicles, dust particulates and stubble burning by farmers — choking the northern states, especially the national capital and its surrounding areas. The CJIs have poignantly described the grave impact caused by pollution on people’s homes. If in October 2015, the then CJI H L Dattu had said that his grandson looks like a ‘Ninja’ at home by wearing masks, the present CJI N V Ramana’s words on Saturday portrayed that the situation at Delhiites’ homes have not changed much in the past six years. CJI Ramana said, “People have to wear masks even at home because of the dangerous levels of pollution. We need urgent drastic steps to bring down the AQI levels from the present 500 to a manageable 200-300. If needed, the industries, construction sites and factories can be closed, a lockdown can be declared for two or three days, and farmers can be told to stop stubble burning for a few days.” CJI Dattu’s successor, Justice T S Thakur had made an anguished remark over Delhi’s pollution in December 2015. “Delhi has earned a bad name as the most polluted city. Last week, a judge from the International Court of Justice came to Delhi. It is very embarrassing for us to tell him that this is the level of pollution in Delhi,” he said. Two future CJIs — Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant — who were part of the bench headed by CJI Ramana, on Saturday also echoed the views of earlier CJIs. Justice Chandrachud, who is to become CJI in November next year, said, “The pollution levels of Delhi affects the school children severely. Despite the severe air quality, the schools are open and little children are exposed to it. Have you done anything about it?” Justice Kant, who would be CJI in November 2025, took exception to the Delhi government laying blame at the doors of farmers for resorting to stubble burning causing the Delhi air to turn noxious. “Has the Delhi government imposed any ban on factories and construction activities in the last seven days?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/successive-cjis-showed-concern-at-air-pollution/articleshow/87691509.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The child had a congenital condition with an underdeveloped left side of the heart, a condition known as ‘univentricular heart.’ Cardiothoracic surgeon Anupam Das said the patient had to undergo two surgeries for the same at the two places, the first being done at AIIMS-Delhi in 2014 wherein the deoxygenated blood from upper part of her body was diverted directly into her lungs. “The second, which was more difficult and complicated, was accomplished by the CTVS team in AIIMS-Jodhpur. An artificial conduit was placed between the vein bringing the deoxygenated blood from lower part of the body to the right pulmonary artery”, said Das adding that the entire procedure was done on the beating heart. He said the surgery was successful and the girl had been discharged in a perfectly healthy condition. This surgery is also notable in a sense that it is the first case of redo surgery being performed in the department of CTVS in AIIMS-Jodhpur, which has carried out 15 surgeries for various congenital heart diseases ranging in age from 6 months to 23 years in past 3 months. Interestingly, all these patients had been previously referred to centres outside Rajasthan for surgeries. Director Sanjeev Misra said the cardiothoracic department of the institute was in the process of establishing a centre of excellence for congenital cardiac surgeries soon in western Rajasthan and aims to perform all complex congenital cardiac surgeries with good results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/aiims-jodhpur-perform-complex-heart-surgery/articleshow/87691085.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Gold at 9-month high of Rs 51,000||AHMEDABAD: Continuing its rally, gold price touched a nine-month high on Saturday to touch Rs 51,000 per 10g in the Ahmedabad market. The last time gold touched this level was January 30 this year, when prices hit Rs 51,000 here, according to bullion traders. Analysts attribute the rally in gold prices to surge in demand of gold in the international market. Explaining reasons, Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA), said, “International gold prices have rallied to the level of $1,864.5 per ounce, according to world gold council. This is primarily due to increased demand for gold for industrial use. That apart, rising global inflation has also propelled prices of gold further up as gold is customarily perceived as a hedge against inflation.” From a low of Rs 49,200 per 10 gram just ahead of Diwali, pure gold price increased by Rs 1,800 in merely 10 days in the local market. Analysts also attribute the surge in yellow metal price to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar. A similar trend was observed in silver. Silver prices touched Rs 67,500 per kg in the local market on Saturday -- up by Rs 3,000 per kg since Diwali, when price touched Rs 64,500 per kg. The rally in gold as well as silver prices is expected to continue till the end of the year. With increased demand, a rise in prices is expected. Throughout the Diwali festive season, gold and silver demand remained buoyant, largely propelled by muhurat purchases of wedding jewellery, light-weight jewellery as well as coins and bars. However, bullion traders suggest that with the recent surge in price of gold through this week, customer footfalls have reduced. “People who were buying coins and bars for investment purpose tend to keep a close watch on the prices. With a dramatic increase in prices, bullion demand has taken a hit and people may wait a few weeks for prices to stabilize,” said Hemant Choksi, a city-based bullion trader. “Jewellery demand has marginally taken a hit with increased prices. Those who have weddings planned are definitely buying as they’re left with little choice,” said Zaveribhai Zaveri, president, Gujarat Jewellers’ Association (GJA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-at-9-month-high-of-rs-51000/articleshow/87690604.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Aurangabad||Over 10 lakh Covid vaccine doses administered in Aurangabad city||AURANGABAD: Amid official boost to the Covid vaccination drive, Aurangabad city on Friday crossed the 10 lakh vaccination mark. As per the official data, over 6.2 lakh first doses and more than 3.8 lakh second doses have been administered within the municipal limits of Aurangabad city. With this, of the total target population of 10.5 lakh, 59% beneficiaries have received the first dose, while the percentage of fully vaccinated citizens has reached 36%. The authorities have appealed to the remaining beneficiaries to get their doses at the earliest. Dr Paras Mandhlecha, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer, said, “We have identified areas with low vaccination numbers and concerted measures are being made to enhance the vaccination coverage. We have started a door-to-door vaccination campaign among other measures in these areas.” The number of lactating and pregnant mothers taking vaccination is very less, even when the experts have advised them to get immunization at the earliest. Dr Asha Sakolkar, a gynaecologist and obstetrician said, “The Covid infection invites more health challenges to lactating and pregnant mothers. In pregnant women, the Covid infection may cause health complications that can lead to morbidities in children. The vaccine is safe and effective and must be taken.” The civic administration has set November 30 as the deadline for getting at least one dose, failing which, a ban will be imposed on the sale of fuel and inter-district travel. In addition, the district administration has made partial vaccination mandatory for getting ration through fair price shops and LPG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-10-lakh-covid-vaccine-doses-administered-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/87689798.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 50% people won’t know they have diabetes till tested, says professor Sanjay Bhadada||CHANDIGARH: Prevalence of prediabetes is higher and by getting screening done on time, this medical condition can be reversed, PGI’s endocrinology dept head Prof Sanjay Bhadada tells Shimona Kanwar ahead of World Diabetes DayIs there any increase in the number of new patients registered for diabetes at PGI? If yes, what are the causes you would attribute for the rise?In a study supported by the ICMR, the prevalence of diabetes in Chandigarh was 13% and the highest in the country. We also did a study for bone health in which we excluded the diabetics. But in that study as well, we found 20% prediabetics. If most of the people are screened and tested, 50% will not be knowing they have diabetes unless there is complication with one or the other organ. Covid saw diabetic patients as the most vulnerable to the virus. How can the survivors take care due to long Covid? How many long Covid patients are you seeing and with what complications?We are not specifically seeing long Covid patients, but those who have diabetes are coming with higher blood glucose levels. This may be attributed to taking steroids over a period of time. And in case they stop or lower the steroids dose, they run the risk of hypoglycemia — low blood sugar. What can be done to prevent diabetes? Chandigarh has seen high prevalence of this NCD. Please give a list of advice to prevent it. Any screening tests once a year?Being an Indian is itself a risk for being diabetic due to ethnicity. The screening age outside our country is 40 years of age, while it is 30 years in India. We need to lower this age group soon as we are seeing younger diabetic patients. If a person is middle aged and overweight, tests like Hb1Ac, blood glucose and blood pressure must be done once every year, while for others it can be done after two years. A diabetic patient has to be very careful with bone, foot and eye health. What are the facilities we have in PGI or what more we plan for their eyes, foot and bone complications?We are planning to have a point of care treatment in the PGI for all the investigations of diabetes. This implies that for follow up, a patient has to first get his height, weight evaluated , visit a dietician and then get eyes and foot tests done under one roof. By the time the reports come, he can get a better consultation for assessment by the doctor after seeing all these reports. If this model succeeds, we will also have a cardiologist and a nephrologist for this point of care treatment. Our department is also working on having a data base of all the patients registered so that we can have details like sex, age wise of the patients undergoing treatment. Such a registry will help us to know screening age, what age complications set in. Can pre-diabetes be reversed? If yes, how? Also, what’s the best way to manage diabetes?It can be reversed by losing 10% of the body weight, by exercising and not by diet alone. Diet modification and not leading a sedentary lifestyle. Results can be seen in six months. For diabetes management---diet control, exercise, oral drugs and then insulin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/50-people-wont-know-they-have-diabetes-till-tested/articleshow/87690603.cms||Shimona Kanwar

However, even when the district administration gave permission to open all the other parks in the city, no decision has been taken to open this park. The park which is spread over 40 cents of land was renovated at a cost of Rs 62 lakhs. People from the locality used to come to the park in the morning and evening to work out and also to relax with their family. The park has a capacity to accommodate 200 people at a time. Even though a group of people had given a memorandum to reopen the park to the secretary of the city corporation, no action has been taken till now. “The government has given permission to open the zoo and museum to the public, but they are not giving the permission to open the Kowdiar park. The authorities have not provided any justifiable reason for this also. We are planning to reach out to the human rights commission if the corporation fails to give the permission”, said Shefin Kowdiar, president, royal Kowadiar protection forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-decision-on-reopening-of-kowdiar-park/articleshow/87674043.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Rahul Gandhi a part-time politician: BL Santhosh||Mangaluru: BJP national general secretary B L Santhosh referred to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as a 'part-time politician' and took a dig at his tweets. “We don't know where he tweets from because he is a part-time politician. People (Congress leaders) here begin tweeting in response to his statements and make fools of themselves. They have no regard for dedication, efficiency, or hard work. Hence, we need a Congress-Mukth Bharat,” he said while delivering the valedictory address at the state-level workshop organised for representatives of 24 cells of BJP here on Saturday. “Our goal is to liberate India from the ideology of the Congress, not to eliminate the Congress from the country. A strong opposition party is essential in a democracy. The aim of Congress-Mukth Bharat is not to destroy the Congress, but rather its anti-national ideologies,” Santhosh said. “The country should be made self-sufficient by providing jobs and opportunities for everyone. However, they (the Congress) turned India into a begging nation. Congress leaders believe that news about them will appear on the front page of newspapers I f they target Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Hence , they continue to criticise Modi. When elections are approaching, they begin making allegations against RSS. Congress leaders should stop being demagogues because they have lost the public's trust. In Congress, there is a dearth of reliable leadership,” the general secretary said. “The Congress was the party that committed the most sins in the name of Gandhiji. While criticising the BJP, politicians such as former chief minister Siddaramaiah keep asking if anyone has sacrificed their lives for India's independence. We had not been born then. During the emergency, it was the BJP and RSS leaders who instilled confidence in the public and were jailed,” he added. “In a veiled attack on the JD(S), Santosh said there are many political parties that use the words ‘social’ and ‘secular’ in their names. “I am still not sure what secular ideologies they carry. Those secular politicians have become advocates of caste and dynasty politics,” he said. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, ministers Kota Shrinivas Poojari and S Angara were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rahul-gandhi-a-part-time-politician-bl-santhosh/articleshow/87689800.cms||---

In a statement, Kataria said that I completely disagree with her statement and the freedom that the country enjoys is because of the sacrifice of lakhs of freedom fighters. No one should term it as the freedom given in charity. If someone thinks that we achieved freedom in 2014, it is wrong. Raghveer Meena, Congress leader and member of the CWC, had questioned BJP’s stand on this controversy. Replying to his question, Kataria categorically dismissed Kangana’s statement and said that many freedom fighters and countrymen have struggled for India’s freedom in their own ways and their ultimate motive was to achieve freedom. No doubt, the nation building works have progressed from 2014 onwards but the country’s freedom certainly was not in alms, he said. Kangans’s statement has raked controversy across the nation and a case against her has been registered against her at many police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kataria-opposes-kanganas-remark-on-independence/articleshow/87691089.cms||---

Singh who has been struggling to wipe off the internal fight in the BJP over the leadership told media persons that ‘I will speak to him on this issue, I have not gone through the complete statement.” Following the debacle in two assembly segments and local body polls, state BJP is in damage control mode by reaching out to its sidelined leaders and hinting at removing the presidents of eight to 10 districts over non-performance. BJP state in-charge Arun Singh met former education ministers, Ghanshyam Tiwari and Kalicharan Saraf, who are away from the limelight for quite a long time. Singh is in Jaipur to attend the two-day organisational meeting held a marathon meeting with state BJP leaders and heads of all frontal organisations on a concluding day on Saturday. The party leaders discussed the upcoming statewide campaign against Congress government on deteriorating law and order, unfulfilled promise of farmers loan waiver, reducing VAT on fuel by the state. Directions were given to the frontal organisations to prepare a strategy to ensure that from party workers to commoners are involved in the series of protests against the state government. Also, responsibilities were assigned to leaders to make the protest successful,” said a source, who added that the party special focus will be on pushing the state for reducing the VAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parnamis-statement-on-raje-triggers-row-in-bjp/articleshow/87691514.cms||---

Vakil’s says “Illegal non-vegetarian food joints near educational institutions, religious places should be removed as passersby have problems due to the stench emanating from such joints”. Vakil claimed that meat of illegally slaughtered animals is being sold in public places. “The civic body should take action against such outlets under provisions of the GPMC Act such as Sections 331 (2), 334, 376 (6), 382 (b) and 335,” the letter says. Section 331(2) says, “No person shall establish a private market for the sale of, or for the purpose of exposing for sale, animals intended for human food, or any article of human food or livestock or articles of food for livestock or shall establish or maintain a private slaughterhouse except with the sanction of the commissioner who shall be guided in giving such sanction by the decisions of the corporation.” “Illegal non-vegetarian food outlets are hurting people’s religious sentiments and are also against Indian culture,” Vakil wrote. These provisions prohibit private markets and private slaughterhouses, the import of cattle without the commissioner’s license and gives powers to the commissioner to expel any non-vegetarian outlets and slaughterhouses operating without the commissioner’s permission. On September 30, the civic body announced a drive against illegal ‘non-vegetarian’ food carts across the city that are operating without valid municipal food vending licences.

In a statement, the Apollo hospital said, the patient had come to the hospital, complaining about a sudden loss of vision in one eye, 15 days after his recovery from the vector-borne disease. Tests confirmed the patients had mucormycosis, a deadly fungal infection. During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year, a large number of cases of mucormycosis were reported. Mucormycosis post dengue is a new observation and hence, patients with a recent history of dengue should remain actively updated about their health and consult a healthcare expert immediately after noticing any new symptoms, doctors at the hospital said. Dr Suresh Singh Naruka, senior consultant (ENT), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, who is leading the treatment of the patient, said, “A rare case of black fungus (mucormycosis) came into our view when the patient came to the hospital, reporting a sudden loss of vision in one eye post dengue fever. It is rare to see mucormycosis as a post-recovery complication in a dengue patient as this condition is generally seen in people who have a history of diabetes, compromised immunity and various other infections.” The case reported at the Apollo hospital in south Delhi comes amid a huge spike in the number of dengue cases in the national capital. According to a civic report on vector-borne diseases released on Monday, nine deaths and a total of 2,708 dengue cases have been recorded this season till November 6, which is the highest count since 2017 for the same period. Over 1,170 cases were logged in the first week of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-delhi-hospital-reports-rare-case-of-post-dengue-mucormycosis/articleshow/87691094.cms||---

Inaugurating an upgraded 100-bed ICU in the state-run Niloufer Children’s Hospital, the minister said the government was planning to add another 800 beds at the hospital. The minister said the government has also plans for recruiting doctors and medical staff and setting up four hospitals in four sides of the city and a medical college in each district to ensure that the best of healthcare facilities were provided to the poor. “While we have been working on strengthening the government health infrastructure since the pandemic hit us, Rs 133 crore has been allocated to tackle a possible third wave. When Telangana was formed, there were only five government medical colleges which has now gone up to 21. Nine more colleges will be operational from next year. We stood first in Covid-19 vaccination rate and we will continue to improve on various parameters,” said the minister. A cabinet sub-committee headed by the minister, which was formed in June this year, will review government hospitals, staff, infrastructure facilities, etc., and submit a report. The Hyderabad Software Entrepreneurs’ Association had donated Rs 18 crore as part of corporate social responsibility to improve infrastructure in government-run hospitals in the state, the minister added. Harish Rao said, “It is a good thing that Hysea and Nirman are jointly coming forward to create infrastructure in government hospitals. The Telangana government is providing oxygen to every bed.” Oxygen generation plants in hospitals will be set up as per the chief minister's vision of further strengthening the medical sector. Health secretary Rizvi, DME Ramesh Reddy, Niloufer superintendent Murali Krishna, Nampally MLA Jafar Hussain, Hysea MD Bharani and officials from Nirman, Infosys and Open Text representatives were present on the occasion.

DGP Niraj Sinha confirmed the arrest and said it was a “historic achievement” for the state police. An official briefing about the operation that led to Bose’s arrest is likely to be held on Sunday. The People Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) appreciated the non-violent police operation to arrest the Maoist ideologue but asked the senior officers to abide by the law and ensure that the basic rights of any detainee are not compromised. “Irrespective of the stature of the person arrested, the police must ensure production before the court of law within 24 hours or else they must be set free,” PUCL state president Arwind Avinash said. He also condemned the delays in the production of the arrested people. “We expect the law enforcers to abide by the law and we, as human rights defenders, are concerned about the rights of everyone, be it a criminal,” he said. Avinash stressed that anyone detained or taken into custody even for questioning must be produced before a magistrate court within 24 hours notwithstanding whether a formal arrest was made or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dgp-hails-kishan-das-arrest-as-historic/articleshow/87690391.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

According to the villagers, four persons — Surendra Nath Bharti, Anil Singh, Manjeet Singh and Shashi Singh — had announced that they would contest for the post of mukhiya from the panchayat and started campaigns. When the villagers approached them last month, saying that only one of them should fight for the polls, none of them are willing to back out. Hence, the villagers decided to hold an election on their own to select the unanimous candidate for the upcoming polls. The villagers then set up a polling booth at the village temple and printed ballot papers for the exercise. A few locals, Bikhu Singh, Asdev Singh, Balgobing Baitha, Awadh Singh, Yaswindra Yadav and others were given the roles of polling officials and some youths were given the charge of security. On Friday, 629 residents of the village cast their votes during the polls which started at 10am. The result was announced in the evening and Manjeet Singh was declared as the winner. Commenting on the polls, Bhikhu Singh said, “Out of four candidates, Manjeet Singh won and he will be our mukhiya candidate when the state government announces the election dates. While Manjee Singh got 416 votes, Surendra Bharti received 62 votes, Shashi Singh 73 and Anil Singh got 33 votes. A total of 29 votes were declared invalid.” One of the villagers said, “No one will be allowed to contest against him.” Shashi Singh, who came second, announced that he will donate Rs 11,000 to Manjeet Singh to contest the election. Surendra Bharti also said he contribute 5,000 to Manjeet Singh. Meanwhile, Mayurhund block development officer Saket Kumar Sinha told TOI that the dates were not announced for panchayat elections and said everyone, who is eligible, has the right to contest the polls. “I am aware of the pre-poll in the Manjhgawan panchayat where the villagers elected their mukhiya candidate. But if anyone wants to contest from the panchayat after polls dates are notified, no one can block any candidature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chatra-village-elects-mukhiya-before-state-announces-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87690378.cms||---

Jamtara plans clubs for elderly to unwind||Ranchi: The district administration at Jamtara has decided to convert buildings into clubs and recreational centres exclusively for the senior citizens to provide them with an opportunity to interact socially and unwind. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Jamtara deputy commissioner Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said, “We have planned one club each across six blocks and they are expected to become operational by mid-December.” He added, “The idea for an exclusive club-cum-recreational centre for senior citizens struck us after coming across instances of depression among them due to various issues. I was searching for ways to address the problem and that’s when we decided to put abandoned or unused buildings to good use.” He further said, “The government often spends crores of rupees in constructing buildings but quite often some of these structures remain unused or underutilized leading to wastage of public money. Also, abandoned buildings become potential crime hotspots. Hence, we thought of converting buildings where the basic infrastructure is in place and all that is required is a little innovative intervention to transform them into a healthy place.” The groundwork for the project has already begun and once ready, the administration will constitute a management committee from among the locals to run the clubs. “The local block development officer will be an ex-officio member of the committee. The local committee can run these clubs in the way that keeps the atmosphere lively. The club will have indoor games like carrom board and ludo and a TV. Once a month, we will organise health check-up camps and other activities,” the DC said. Jamtara is one of the six districts that comprise the Santhal Pargana commissionary. Over the years, this sleepy town has become notorious as the phishing capital of India because of the numerous incidents of cybercrimes originating from here. To channelize the youths in the right direction, the district administration earlier this year successfully initiated another innovative plan of setting up libraries across all its panchayats. “Today, all our 118 panchayats have fully functional libraries with over 35,000 books where thousands of youths across different age groups spend time reading daily. We have also come up with a dedicated website where details of all the libraries are mentioned. Regular classes are held daily on various topics at each place, details of which are updated on the website,” the DC said, adding that the district administration is focusing on social engineering to help Jamtara shun its negative image.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/feeling-blue-jamtara-plans-clubs-for-elderly-to-unwind/articleshow/87690366.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Sudden weather change to impact crop yield||Ranchi: Sudden change in the weather condition, which brought rain in most parts of the state on Saturday, will impact farmers in both positive and negatively. While the showers are a boon for those who had harvested kharif crop and were preparing to sow the rabi ones, they are detrimental to the growers who are yet to harvest their kharif crop or had left the harvested crop in barn without shed. Under the influence of a low-pressure, which originated over the Bay of Bengal and lies centered over north interior Tamil Nadu and its neighborhood, extending upto 3.6km above mean the sea level, caused rain in the southern parts of Jharkhand. Ranchi recorded 19mm rainfall, while Jamshedpur recorded 7.6mm since Saturday morning. According to a bulletin, issued by the IMD, the trough now runs from the cyclonic circulation over north interior Tamil Nadu to Gangetic West Bengal across Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and extends upto 0.9KM above the mean sea level. Director of Ranchi IMD centre, Abhishek Anand, said the rainfall activity is likely to continue in the southern and northeastern parts of the state in the next 48 hours. “Rainfall activity would reduce subsequently and there would be a drop in the day temperature during the next 48 hours,” he added. The night temperature is likely to fall, bringing in the winter chill once the cloud cover subsides. Weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University, Dr Abdul Wadood, advised farmers to spread dry their harvested crops to avoid fungal infection in case it was drenched in the showers. “Ideally, kharif crop should have been harvested by now but due to delayed monsoon and delayed sowing in some parts of the state, around 30% crop cover is yet to be harvested,” he said, expressing concern that the maturity time of these crops would be further delayed by around a week now due to the current rainfall. “Farmers, who had harvested kharif crop and were preparing their fields for rabi sowing, can make the best use of the showers and go for rabi sowing once the rainy days are over,” Wadood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sudden-weather-change-to-impact-crop-yield/articleshow/87690357.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A century ago, an unwelcome royal guest left a trail of riots in Bombay||I want you to know me and I want to know you". It was not to a shy princess but to a burning Bombay that a prince uttered those words a hundred Novembers ago. Silk sarees and trams were ablaze in Elphinstone Road on the hot winter morning of November 17, 1921 when a sun-tanned, navy-captain-uniform-clad Prince of Wales Edward VIII stepped off a ship called Renown at the Gateway of India for the first time to thank the country and the city for their contributions to the First World War. "..it was Bombay which gave Godspeed to thousands of India's soldiers who left her shores to fight the battle of the Empire in the Great War and it was Bombay which received and tended them when they were war-worn and wounded on their return," said the future emperor before leaving the city war-worn and wounded in his wake.  India was still sore from the scars of 1919's Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Bombay was in the grip of Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement when this quickly-forgotten four-day-long violent chapter of Mumbai's history called 'The Prince of Wales Riots' unfolded. In anticipation of the future emperor's arrival, the then Viceroy, Lord Reading, had planned a grand welcoming ceremony and 80,000 copper medals were specially minted with the words: "Visit of His Royal Highness. Bombay. November 1921". Gandhi, on his part, announced a hartal on the day of the Prince's visit saying: "If a robber held a feast at our expense, would we attend it?"  "After Gandhi set alight his bonfire of foreign-made cloth at 10.30 am, striking mill workers stormed out of the Elphinstone Mills compound and burned a few trams and automobiles," wrote historian Dinyar Patel in his 2008 research paper on the communal riots in which Hindu and Muslim supporters of Mahatma Gandhi--angered by violations of the hartal-- attacked Parsis and members of "other supposedly loyalist minorities".  Besides robed maharajahs and sober-suited soldiers, attendees included Mumbaikars chiefly from the Parsi, Anglo-Indian, and Jewish communities. “Despite the thousands of placards displayed in every nook and corner of the city appealing in the name of Mr Gandhi for a boycott of the Prince's visit, people began to flock towards their chosen points of vantage along the route fixed for the Royal procession from Apollo Bunder to Government House..." said a TOI report. After the ceremony, crowds saw men wearing Gandhi caps or the Khilafat fez on the streets throwing stones at vehicles passing by Marine Lines and Charni Road. Soon after the prince left for Malabar Hill's Government House, crowds at Kalbadevi began throwing stones at trams and at New Nagpada, a mob tried to set fire to the police station, killing three Indian constables  By mid-day on November 19, at least three Zoroastrian fire temples were attacked and on November 20, a mob of 500 Parsis, armed with bamboo sticks, gathered on Princess Street to defend the Atash Behram fire temple, revealed Patel.  News of the violence reached Gandhi. An anonymous Mazgaon writer recounted how Nusserwanji Dhondy, a Parsi who had rushed to help non-cooperators control riots in Khetwadi on November 18, faced the wrath of both Gandhi supporters and members of his own community. "Dhondy subsequently died of ‘Acute Mania from effects of the Bombay Riots’," said Patel. Usha Thakkar, president of Mani Bhavan--Gandhi's place of residence in those tumultuous years--said that the leader was "pained to see the outbreak of violence." In a pamphlet in which he vowed not to eat or drink anything but water until the tensions ended, Gandhi wrote: "The swaraj that I have witnessed during the last two days has stunk in my nostrils." When the violence subsided finally on November 20, Gandhi drafted a public statement to Bombay residents pledging cross-communal harmony before breaking his fast the next day. As for the Prince, he left Bombay for his four-month maiden journey across India after watching a polo match, shaking hands with 3000 guests at the Government House reception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-century-ago-an-unwelcome-royal-guest-left-a-trail-of-riots-in-bombay/articleshow/87692227.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Matheran panel to look into transport difficulty at hill station||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Saturday directed the Matheran Monitoring Committee to look into a resident’s grievance on lack of transport for students, the elderly and the differently abled and submit a report . A vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar heard a petition by Sunil Shinde, a retired schoolteacher, to quash or amend a February 4, 2003 notification of Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) that declared Matheran and surrounding region an ‘ecologically sensitive zone’. He prayed to allow entry of LPG/CNG/electric vehicles for essential goods and to provide transport for school children, senior citizens and the differently abled. Shinde’s petition said that due to MoEF’s notification, horses and handcarts involving human labour are used as means of transport. “This makes cost of living for residents in Matheran and surrounding areas very high,” it said. It added that 30,000 residents currently face a hard time and since the pandemic began, residents are paying Rs 250 extra per gas cylinder. The petition said that since transportation is not available, children have to walk miles every day to reach school. “Senior citizens and differently abled also have a tough time moving around Matheran area,” it added, and said that though Mahabaleshwar and Dahanu are eco-sensitive zones, the MoEF has not banned vehicle traffic there. “The banning of vehicles from ECZ of Matheran is illegal and unconstitutional as Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, does not cover vehicles under its ambit,” the petition stated. Shinde’s advocate argued that only ambulances and fire-engines are allowed. On Friday, he said students have to walk 5km to school. “We can’t expect students to walk 5 km up-down,” said Justice Kathawalla. On Saturday, government pleader Poornima Kantharia said one of the schools is hardly 3.5 km from Dasturi Point. But Justice Kathawalla said, “Students cannot be expected to walk that distance.” The Centre’s advocate, Rui Rodrigues, submitted MoEF’s recent office memo on re-constitution of the committee saying it can look into Shinde’s grievance. The committee is directed to hear Shinde and submit a report after 2 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-asks-matheran-panel-to-look-into-transport-difficulty-at-hill-stn-in-mumbai/articleshow/87692243.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘MCOCA confession valid in other offences in same case’||Mumbai: Observing that confessions recorded under the MCOCA Act can be used against the accused to convict them for other offences in the same case even if the charges under the stringent act are dropped, a special court this week found two men guilty and sentenced them to 7 years rigorous imprisonment for attempting to extort Rs 1 crore from a city builder in 2015 at the behest of wanted accused, gangster Vijay Shetty. The court also fined the accused, Sujit Rao (30) and Lohit Anchan (37),Rs 1 lakh each. Of the fine amount, if recovered, Rs 50,000 will be paid to the builder as compensation. The two accused are in jail since 2015. Charges under MCOCA were dropped as the prosecution could not prove that there was more than one chargesheet against Shetty, head of the alleged crime syndicate, a requirement under the act. The court said xthe prosecution had failed to establish that the “so-called gang leader” Vijay Shetty alias Vijay Anna, named in the first chargesheet and Vijay Shetty alias Bala Anna shown in the second was one person. “Admittedly, the chargesheeted accused were not previously chargesheeted. Therefore, the basic requirement for invoking the provisions of MCOC Act that the gang leader was facing more than one chargesheet during last 10 years and that the competent court had taken cognisance of the offence against him, remains to be established,” the court said. Twenty-seven witnesses, including the builder, deposed in court. The prosecution had submitted that in 2015, the accused had conspired to extort Rs 1 crore by threatening to kill the builder and his family members. It was alleged that while the builder began to receive calls in May 2015, the next month he approached the joint commissioner of police (crime) and a copy of his complaint was given to the Anti-Extortion Cell. The court relied on accused Anchan’s confession statement where he “admitted his guilt of making phone calls and demanding ransom for himself as well as for the wanted accused Vijay Shetty and Dhanraj”. “In view of the above observation, I conclude that by the evidence of prosecution witnesses the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that accused, wanted accused Vijay and Dhanraj have hatched criminal conspiracy to commit extortion by threatening calls to prosecution witness [builder] and that the accused have made threatening calls and demanded cash of Rs 2 lakh for settling the dispute and threatened the informant [builder] to kill him,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcoca-confession-valid-in-other-offences-in-same-case/articleshow/87692281.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Mumbai awaits Mahim mela in honour of Sufi saint||MUMBAI: The musical instruments daff and nagara fell silent suddenly and remained paused for months. During the painful pandemic when lives went topsy turvy the number of devotees to places of worship was curtailed to just a few who comprised the trustees and khadims or those serving at the shrines. But, after the reopening, the foot falls at the iconic Mahim Dargah or mausoleum of secular Sufi saint of Mumbai, Makhdoom Ali Mahimi, have increased. It has rekindled the hopes that the dreary months are behind us and the famous Mahim Mela will return. As the annual Mahim Mela (December 18--28) nears, Mahim Dargah management, owners of giant Ferris wheels, swings and owners of temporary eateries at the “entertainment zone” hope the authorities will grant permission to hold the Mela. "We have written to commissioners of police and BMC seeking if any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the annual Mahim fair has been made. We will follow all the guidelines required for visits of devotees to the shrine," said Mahim Dargah's managing trustee Sohail Khandwani. He added that all measures would be taken to avoid crowding at the Dargah and no individual or group would be allowed to bring DJs in the Dargah's vicinity. "Playing loud music at a sacred place like a Sufi's shrine is forbidden and we request devotees not to bring or play DJs," he said. Besides the spiritual significance of the mela when thousands of sandals (flower petals, shawl, sandal paste), including the first sandal from the Mumbai police, are traditionally offered to the Saint, the mela’s entertainment zone too attracts thousands. Giant Ferris wheels, swings, eateries, shops selling toys and dresses attract families. Thousands await the mela for the whole year as they earn money during the 10-day festival that helps them see through the year. “Now that the government has allowed entertainment activities in open maidan where jhoolas (swings) rides operate, the Mahim mela too should be allowed. This is an open ground with three gates where private guards can help police in managing the crowd. Everyone should be required to wear a mask,” said Fazil Zubair, founder-chairman, Maharashtra Anand Mela Association. “If other states have allowed melas to be held, what will stop the state government from allowing Mumbai’s biggest annual mela.” Zubair’s family has put up Ferris wheels at the mela since 19970s. He said in the last 18 months or so the equipment of wheels and rides have been rusting.  “Over 10,000 people are directly dependent on this mela. The mela is also a source of revenue for the government. The mela will be a big booster to the families of people who earn money through sales or working during the 10-day festival,” said Aslam Khan who too has put up a Ferris wheel at the mela since 1970. For Hafeez Yaqoob Patel, the mela will give a “new lease of life” to jhoola operators who desperately need money to stay in the business. “I have already scrapped two jhoolas and there are many like me who hope to get a booster through this mela,” said Patel. A lot rides on this annual mela which commemorates Makhdoom Mahimi, a leading Sufi scholar of his time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-awaits-mahim-mela-in-honour-of-sufi-saint/articleshow/87692283.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Khan is out on bail since September. The case will come up for hearing on November 20. The NCB moved the plea citing certain recently found material for which the voice samples were needed. The NCB had arrested Khan in July this year, alleging he invested funds in drug trafficking along with arrested British national, Karan Sejnani. The NCB had accused Khan of being part of a syndicate and involved in dealing with, peddling and consumption of drugs. At the time of granting him bail, the court had said the quantum of contraband seized as per the chemical analysis report was not a “commercial” quantity and the charges of abetment and conspiracy made out by the NCB do not apply. The court also pointed out that there was “nothing except the statement of the accused and the co-accused” to link them with contraband. Of 194kg drugs seized, active constituents of cannabis were found in 1.2kg, which puts the quantity of contraband in the “intermediate” category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-seeks-sameer-khans-voice-samples/articleshow/87692290.cms||---

On connecting with his friends through social media, the officials traced the aggressive teen's family in UP who came down to fetch him. "When we advised them to seek professional therapy for him, they told us he had been addicted to PUBG, a multiplayer game that was banned in India last year," says a child welfare officer, who has seen the mobile game's legitimate variants fuel the kind of truancy that's threatening to make up for the recent lockdown-induced dip in the number of missing children admitted in the child care institution he heads. "Many kids had taken loans to play the mobile games and ran away fearing their family's reactions on discovering the debt," he says.  In a trend that CCTV cameras at CST and Churchgate would attest to, truancy came to a screeching halt when Covid put a stop to incoming trains during the lockdown. Of late, however, with railway services resuming, children's homes of Matunga, Mankhurd, Dongri, Thane, Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi are beginning to fill with passport photos of minor boys and girls from UP and Bihar who board CST-bound trains. "On probing, they say they are here on tour," says a child welfare official.  If you chart Maharashtra's graph as per National Crime Records Bureau's data of missing children, you would find a cheerful sagging arc starting from 4388 in 2016 to 1711 in 2018. The curve jumps up again in 2019 with the state reporting nearly 4000 missing children but then this is somewhat flattened in 2020 thanks to the state tracing over 4800 missing children. A chunk of these reunions with families were a consequence of intervention by NGOs such as Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi's Bachpan Bachao Andolan as well as Operation Muskaan, the centre's initiative to reunite missing children with their families since 2014.  Recently, as part of Operation Muskaan's latest round, Mumbai Police is reported to have carried out 145 reunions in a month-long drive in June when it found that 909 children in the city were missing. Some of these children were not even reported missing by their families and were found begging on the streets, says a recent article in a daily. Data provided to TOI by Thane Police's Child Protection Unit (CPU)--which saw the number of missing children in the city of lakes drop almost by half between 2019 and 2021--shows that the unit has traced 515 of 598 children reported missing this year. "Young kids tend to remember things like wells and trees, which we have traced to places such as Shahapur and Wada," says a senior officer. Out of 598 children who went missing in Thane city this year, 463 were girls. Though the Thane CPU--which is in the throes of sudden transfers--has not been able to provide reasons for the skewed gender ratio, clues can be found in NCRB's data for Maharashtra, the state that reported the highest number of missing women last year. Six per cent of the 900-odd trafficking victims in the state, the report says, were children. Incidentally, one such case cracked by Thane CPU even made it to a celebrated crime re-enactment TV series whose anchor is now a certified crime scene investigator. While confiding about a recent climb in cases of teen boys from far-flung small towns eloping into Mumbai with minor girls, a city-based child welfare official admits that Operation Muskaan has helped children's homes break the "language barrier". "It puts missing children from far-flung towns in UP and Nepal in touch with cops from their hometowns who speak the dialect," he says. Breaking the ice isn't easy, says Arun Yadav, a volunteer with the NGO My Home India--which started reuniting missing kids with their families in the same year as Operation Muskaan in 2014. "While escorting them back home, we have to stay up all night in the train for fear that the kid might run away," says Yadav whose boss Shravan Jha confesses that the slump in work afforded him enough free time to compile all of the NGO's successful 2000-odd reunions. "Each of them is a sitting-duck OTT documentary," he says, inviting us for a glimpse of the file which contains stories, including that of a 13-year-old musically-inclined girl from Udupi who took a literal leap of faith the same day that she won a high-jump contest. She jumped over a 6-ft-wall of her Udupi hostel and came to Mumbai to meet Anu Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-train-services-resuming-runaway-kids-head-for-mumbai/articleshow/87692310.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

It said there was unexplained delay in giving better medical care and she died due to the doctor’s negligence. Justice R.K. Agrawal (president) and Dr S M Kantikar (commission member) dismissed an appeal by a Nallasopara hospital and doctor who runs it, challenging a February 2015 state commission order which held them liable for medical negligence. The state commission had directed them to pay Rs 16 lakh to the widower and his two daughters but the hospital had challenged it. Quoting Susan Wiggs, National Commission said, “There is something about losing a mother that is permanent and inexpressible a wound that will never quite heal.” On September 20, 1995, at 5.30am, the woman started bleeding and at 6.30am a lower segment caesarean section was performed after consent from her husband, and at 9.30am her second daughter was born. The hospital asked for blood bottles and four were organized by 10.30am. Due to anxiety, the co-brother of the complainant husband , Dr. Ram Barot, contacted a gynaecologist who phoned the Nallasopara doctor, asking him to shift her to Bhagwati hospital for an emergency hysterectomy to save her life. Dr Barot organized 18 bottles of her blood type. The National Commission order said after alleged refusal she was finally shifted at 4.30pm, when she was declared dead before admission. “It was an act of omission from the (doctor) wherein it fell below that of the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in his field,” said the National Commission. Their advocate, Anand Patwardhan, argued that there was no medical negligence. But consumer activist Shirish Deshpande as authorised representative for the widower and daughters said she was shifted to Bhagwati belatedly and died due to “hemorrhagic shock following surgery” as mentioned in her post-mortem. He submitted a medical expert opinion that since it was her second delivery with a rare A- blood type, the hospital should have kept her blood type available, as there were chances of unexpected uncontrolled haemorrhage. The commission directed the hospital and doctor to pay Rs 1 lakh as litigation cost too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-payout-hiked-to-rs-20l-for-family-of-woman-who-died-during-childbirth/articleshow/87692313.cms||Swati Deshpande

The clarification by a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar, was on a petition by the couple from Mumbai who hail from Chaubari village, Bachao taluka, Gujarat. On the pretext of placating her family, the 22-year-old woman was taken to Chaubari and forcibly “married” to another who assaulted and tortured her. She escaped to Mumbai. The judges were informed by prosecutor Prajakta Shinde that six persons, including her second “husband”, his brother, the woman’s father, her brother, the village sarpanch and the community head, were arrested immediately after lodging of an FIR on Thursday. On Friday, they were remanded to police custody till November 17. Advocate Deepa Chawan for the couple referred to the FIR lodged against the woman at Bachao police station at the instance of the second husband. The judges then said their November 5 order granting police protection also refers to that FIR. “The order passed by this court shall continue until further orders,” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges posted the hearing before the regular court on November 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/police-cover-to-continue-for-inter-caste-mumbai-city-couple-court/articleshow/87692316.cms||---

The prosecution submitted Waze did not provide relevant information about former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s whereabouts. It iterated that for wanted accused number one, Singh, Waze extorted huge amounts of money from cricket bookies by threatening them with arrests. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap submitted that the investigators wanted to find out if there are other victims, including bookies and prominent businessmen. The prosecution further said that the circulation of money after extortion also needed to be ascertained. “The extortion amount is yet to be recovered. It is also necessary to find out how the extortion money was used by the accused,” the prosecution said. The remand plea also said cops wanted to find out how many times such extortion had taken place. “The complaint mentions extortion done of BMC contractors. We want to probe it further,” the remand plea said. The crime branch had said the investigation into the complaint of businessman Bimal Agarwal had brought to light that Singh started the extortion racket immediately after Waze was reinstated in 2020.  Waze’s lawyer Aarti Kalekar said he was under tremendous pressure due to the Centre and state and contemplating giving his statement under 164 of Criminal Procedure Code. Such statements are recorded before the magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-sent-to-crime-branch-custody-till-monday-now/articleshow/87692337.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Calling it a breach of provisions of the NDPS Act, special judge V V Patil said, "In the present case, the search was undertaken by a female panch who is not an empowered officer to effect the search and, therefore, there is a breach of Section 42 of NDPS Act... present accused is entitled to grant of bail on that ground." No proof to show Satija acted in conspiracy, says spl courtNupur Satija’s advocate Ayaz Khan had submitted before the special court that according to law, a panch is not empowered to search and recover contraband, and it has to be done by officers empowered by the NDPS Act. He said a 1985 notification revealed officers of and above the rank of inspector in the NCB are empowered to exercise powers and perform duties specified in Section 42. The prosecution had submitted that the drugs were found wrapped in sanitary napkins. While Satija (29), Delhi residents Gomit Chopra (28) and Ishmeet Singh Chadha (33) and city resident and alleged peddler Shreyas Nair (23) were granted bail on October 30, detailed order copies were made available on Friday. In Satija’s case, the court said, “Admittedly, personal search of accused as well as search of room of accused was (under)taken by (a) female panch witness. Admittedly, there was no lady officer present and no panchanama was carried out by person authorised for that purpose.” It said there was no specific evidence on record to show the accused had acted in conspiracy with each other. It noted that other accused, Aryan Khan (23), Arbaaz Merchant (26) and Munmun Dhamecha (28), had been granted bail by HC. Chopra, a make-up artist and guest on ship, was held on October 3. Three grams of cocaine and ecstasy pills were allegedly recovered. Granting Chopra bail, the court said though prosecution had relied on WhatsApp chats between Satija and him, the conversations are only regarding consumption and not regarding sale, purchase or for any other use. “I find substance in the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicants that on the basis of WhatsApp chats, at the most it can be said the applicants are consumers of contraband,” the court said, while accepting advocate Kushal Mor’s submissions. The court said only Section 27(a) of NDPS Act, which attracts punishment up to one year, was applicable. A businessman, Chadha, also a guest on ship, was held on October 3. Allegedly 6.5 gms of MDMA was recovered, and he named Nair as his supplier. Nair was held a day later. The court said barring Chadha’s statement, prosecution failed to bring on record specific evidence to show Nair supplied the contraband.

The number of deaths increased to 49 compared to 41 and 28 on Friday and Thursday, respectively. A health officer said the increase was due to a reconciliation exercise. "Out of the total 49 deaths reported on Saturday, 34 deaths are more than a week old. Of these 34 deaths, 26 are from Raigad, five from Thane and one each from Buldhana, Nashik and Pune," he said. Except on Wednesday, the daily tally in the state has been under 1,000 since November 5. In Mumbai, the daily tally kept under 300 for the third day, with 246 testing positive for the virus on Saturday. Only two deaths were registered, taking the toll to 16,290 since March 2020. The daily cases haven't yet gone up substantially although it is a week since Diwali and many experts had feared that cases could increase due to crowding and socialising during the festival. While daily tests were below 1 lakh (60,000 on some days) during the Diwali week, the numbers increased to 1.15 lakh in Maharashtra. On Saturday, the BMC update showed 41,078 tests were done, higher than the average of 35,000 tests a day. Active cases in the state (12,219) and Mumbai (3,577) continued to dip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/daily-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-rise-to-999-deaths-move-up-to-49/articleshow/87692341.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan. Citing Savarkar’s example, Shah said, “Had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only.” Shah also said that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary and introduced many words. Time has come to make Hindi flexible for the wide acceptance of people,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/savarkar-worked-a-lot-to-enrich-hindi-says-amit-shah/articleshow/87692342.cms||Binay Singh
---||Mumbai||Cops want ‘proclamation’ issued against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The crime branch will move a plea before the magistrate’s court seeking issuance of proclamation against “absconding” accused, former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, and two others, Vinay Singh and Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti, in an alleged extortion case where they threatened a businessman and hotelier and extorted money. The crime branch said that a non-bailable warrant was issued by the court on October 30, but the trio were not available at their respective addresses. It alleged that they had gone into hiding after the case was registered. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said that once proclamation is issued by the court, an accused has to appear within 30 days. “If an accused fails to appear within this time, then proceedings can commence for attachment of their properties,” Jagtap said. The crime branch moved the plea before the court on Saturday. However, it was referred to the in-charge court, where the crime branch will file the plea on Monday. The plea will also invoke Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. The crime branch said that cops had gone to Param Bir Singh’s Malabar Hill home on November 10. But due to his absence, the warrant could not be served. The statements of a police guard stationed at the building and the cook were recorded. The police guard told them that for the last three months, Singh had not come to the building. He said Singh’s family also did not live there, and he did not know the whereabouts of any of them. The cook said that he had been living and working in the building for over a year. He too said that neither Singh nor his family had been to the premises in the last three months. Vinay Singh’s wife told cops that he had not been to their Kandivli apartment since the FIR was registered in the case. She also claimed that he had not been in touch with her. The woman said she was unaware about his current location. At Bhatti’s Versova home, his wife too gave a similar statement. On Wednesday, the magistrate court issued a non-bailable warrant against Singh in an extortion case. This was the third such non-bailable warrant issued against Singh. Last month, a Thane court as well as the 37th metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Singh in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-want-proclamation-issued-against-param-bir/articleshow/87692348.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||28 per cent of 1,574 Mumbai hospitals fail to comply with fire norms||MUMBAI: As many as 435 of 1,574 hospitals, nursing and maternity homes in Mumbai inspected by the fire brigade till October 31 were found to have not complied with fire safety norms. This report comes in the wake of an investigation into the blaze at Ahmednagar Civil Hospital that killed 11 Covid patients, pointing towards inadequate fire-fighting equipment in the hospital. Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said their teams visited 1,574 private, BMC, state and central government hospitals and found lacunae in fire-safety requirements. “Of these, 1,139 have complied with fire safety measures while the rest have not. However, upon serving them notices, many have complied,” said Parab, adding it is an ongoing audit and notices to violators are served under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. Data also shows 254 of the nursing homes that were visited were closed at the time of inspection. Fire officials said the most common violation is the absence of fire alarms, sprinklers and smoke detectors in these premises. TIMES VIEWFires like at the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, Bhandara District Hospital and Sunrise Hospital in Bhandup show the unpreparedness of the administrations to deal with such calamities. Poor fire-fighting equipment combined with lack of stringent audits are leading to the loss of precious lives. This year has already seen multiple devastating fires and therefore it is imperative that authorities take strict action against those who violate safety norms.Kandivli corporator Kamlesh Yadav said the BMC must also crack down on the many nursing homes that are operating illegally in the city. “I had contacted the medical officer of every ward and found that there are over 241 unauthorized nursing homes in the city which must either be shut or they must be made to apply for permission. If they have no permission, how can one expect any kind of fire safety measures on their premises,” said Yadav who had also raised the issue in the civic standing committee meeting recently. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said while the civic body grants permission, it is often found that nursing homes or hospitals, due to space crunch, utilize more than what they are permitted to. “This then puts a load on the existing electrical infrastructure, which in any case faces a high load with NICU and ICU medical machinery and air-conditioners operating the entire day. Hence, it should be first checked if more than the actual space granted by the BMC is being used by the premises,” said Miranda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-28-of-1-6k-city-hosps-fail-to-comply-with-fire-norms/articleshow/87692367.cms||Richa Pinto

Mumbai is now among the handful of cities and towns — Bhubhaneswar, which was the first in the country, Indore, Ladakh and Kinnaur, among others — to have statistically completed 100% first-dose coverage. Unlike the single-dose Covid vaccines available in the West, the Covid vaccines available in India require two shots for completion. Around 1.5 crore vaccine doses have been given out so far in Mumbai, and the BMC is now focusing on completing the second shot coverage. Till Saturday, 60,33,148 (65% of the city’s adult population) were fully vaccinated. “We will not stop giving the first shot as 92.3 lakh was just a projection based on the census data and the number of eligible citizens. The total adult population of the city could be higher as new people keep coming into the city,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We want to continue vaccinating till everybody living in Mumbai or working here is safe,” added Kakani. There is another reason for the BMC to continue offering the first vaccine shot: many beneficiaries could have come from neighbouring satellite cities especially in the earlier months when vaccines were in a short supply. “Mumbai is geographically integrated with nearby satellite cities, so there is a possibility that 10% of the total beneficiaries so far came from outside the city,” said Kakani. On Saturday, the Centre’s Cowin portal showed that 89,529 people had taken the vaccine in Mumbai. The BMC update said a reconciliation exercise had been carried out, leading to 31,730 shots given in private hospitals between May and October being added to take Saturday's tally to 1,18,237. The Thane Municipal Corporation said it had delivered over 50,000 vaccine doses since it started the door-to-door drive in Thane four days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-crosses-its-adult-population-figure-of-9239902-for-first-dose/articleshow/87692376.cms||---

While the latest International Diabetes Federation report has pegged the number of Indian adults affected by diabetes at 74 million, the prediabetes burden is high at 40 million too. Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi, chair of IDF-South East Asia region, said, “Apart from diabetes, India has two big burdens. One is prediabetes and the other is asymptomatic diabetes. A solution would be to start diabetes screening from 25 years of age as against the present 30 years.” A group of endocrinologists have made this suggestion to the central health officials. While there is no estimate with local authorities about the incidence of prediabetes, private laboratory SRL Diagnostics released a report on 2.9 lakh samples received for glycosylated/glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test from January 2017 till September 2021 in Mumbai that gives an idea: 37% of all these samples tested were positive for diabetes and 37% tested positive for prediabetes. In the 31-45 age group, the report said over 40% samples tested prediabetic and over 23% were found to be diabetic, proving that the onset of diabetes is earlier among Indians. SRL laboratory’s Dr Kshama Pimalgaonkar said, “One in six people with diabetes in the world is from India. What is more alarming is that a staggering number of the population is also living with prediabetes, which can be prevented from turning into a chronic condition.” Another survey of 5,000 people done by health-tech company Fitterfly showed people under 40 years are at the highest risk of prediabetes. “Of the millions who have prediabetes in India, 70% of them could convert into Type 2 diabetes over the next five to 10 years,’’ said Dr Arbinder Singhal of Fitterfly. His survey found 74% of the respondents were obese or overweight, 59% had a family history of diabetes and 44% were not active as per World Health Organisation’s recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. “Weight loss of 8 to 12kg in the at-risk population will cut the risk of diabetes by 50%,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prediabetes-detected-in-1-in-3-persons-tested-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/87692384.cms||---

However, the AQI has now remained in the ‘severe’ category for ten straight days. Taking initiative to clean the city air, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board recommended a cumulative fine of Rs 65.5 lakh on eight polluters on Saturday. Track the pollution level in your city“During our survey, we found a violation of road dust norms on Pustha Road in Kanawani and recommended a fine of Rs 50,000 on GDA (Ghaziabad Development Authority) and GMC (Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation)," said a UPPCB official. The road runs parallel to the Hindon river on the banks of which sand gets stored. "No step has been taken to stop dust pollution there despite alerting the two agencies a few days ago,” said the official. The seven other polluters are private developers, found to violate construction and demolition waste norms. Meanwhile, Noida remained the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day on Saturday, with an AQI 464 in the ‘severe’ category. On Friday, the AQI was 488. Greater Noida, on the other hand, recorded an AQI of 408 in the 'severe' category on Saturday, an improvement over its AQI of 478 on Friday. PM2.5 is the major pollutant in Greater Noida while both PM10 and PM2.5 contribute almost equally to the pollution levels in Noida. Amid severe pollution levels, Noida’s environmental committee meeting has been preponed for early next week. “The committee usually meets once a month on a fixed date. However, I’ve asked for it to be arranged on Monday or Tuesday, ahead of schedule. We hope that we can discuss some concrete implementable solutions that are urgently required,” said Suhas LY, Noida district magistrate. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Saturday imposed penalties worth Rs 12 lakh on environmental polluters. A Rs 5 lakh penalty was imposed on the Noida Authority over the construction of Noida Convection and Habitat Centre in Sector 94. Other penalties were imposed on private developers and plot owners. Meanwhile, the anti-smog tower planned by the Noida Authority will be inaugurated on November 17. The 20-metre high tower will be located along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway on the stretch leading to the DND flyway. Just like an air conditioner, the fans in the tower are supposed to suck in polluted air while the filter is supposed to take out the dust particles before releasing the fresh air into the environment. Costing nearly Rs 2.5 crore, it is expected to control pollution levels within a radius of 1km. However, some residents and air quality experts said that the device has been placed in a location where people spend too less time for it to be effective. It may not even benefit the nearest residential and commercial/institutional areas such as sectors 15, 15A, 16A and 17, which are some distance away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/noida-most-polluted-for-second-day-aqi-in-gzb-still-severe/articleshow/87692412.cms||Abhijay Jha

The girl was last seen by her elder sister (10) walking on a lane towards the family's one-room tenement in Shramik Kunj 2. The park in Sector 108 where the body was found is 2km from her home. Police said a tooth of the girl was missing, her ear had a piercing and a slipper (not hers) was found near the body. An FIR has been filed against unknown persons on charges of murder and abduction. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander told TOI, "We are investigating the case. But one thing is clear - someone known to the family is behind the murder. The girl seems to have been accompanied to the park (where she was found dead) by someone she knew," he added. Quoting from the autopsy report, Sujeet Upadhyaya, the SHO of Phase 2 police station, said the girl was possibly killed an hour or two after she went missing around 1pm on Thursday. The autopsy, he said, revealed that the girl had died of shock and haemorrhage due to ante-mortem injuries. Police have ruled out sexual assault. The girl had gone out to play around Thursday noon with her 10-year-old sister at a nearby park. When she wanted to go home, the sister had accompanied up to the lane that leads to their house. "Both of us were playing in the park. I took my sister to the lane that leads to Daksh's house and then our home. She told me she could go alone," the 10-year-old told TOI on Saturday. The family of Daksh, a neighbour, said they hadn't seen the six-year-old girl around that time. The victim was the sixth girl child of Anuradha, who had married twice. She has two daughters - aged 19 and 21 - with her first husband. Eleven years ago, Anuradha married Ram Kumar, who owns a kiosk selling bidis and cigarettes. The couple have four daughters, of whom the six-year-old was the youngest. Anuradha said she suspected some neighbours were behind her daughter's murder. "I believe someone from the neighbourhood might have killed our child," she said but didn't elaborate why she felt so. A neighbour this correspondent spoke to said Anuradha and Ram Kumar often had fights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/6-year-old-noida-girl-found-dead-in-park/articleshow/87692475.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Nagpur||Yavatmal police suggest MBBS student died in road rage; 3 ‘real killers’ nabbed||YAVATMAL: The Yavatmal police on Saturday claimed two youths have been arrested and a juvenile in conflict with law rounded up for the murder of Ashok Pal, a final year MBBS student of Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal. Yavatmal SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal explained the circumstances under which the murder took place, suggesting that Pal, a resident of Thane district, was killed in a road rage incident. “The trio was on a motorbike which hit Pal who was returning to his hostel from the college library on the campus on Wednesday night. This led to a verbal duel which ended in stabbing of the MBBS student to death,” he tod media on Saturday. The agitating students and doctors have been claiming that Pal’s murder was an act of revenge and that police “are acting under politial pressure to protect the real murderers”. The arrested youths have been identified as Rushikesh Gulabrao Sawale (23), a resident of Mahavir Nagar, and Pravin Sanjeev Gundajwar (24), a resident of Savitribai Phuley Society. The SP said the trio has confessed to committing the murder. In another revelation, the SP declared that the two youths arrested earlier and remanded in police custody are inncocent. “They were arrested on the basis of complainant filed by dean Dr Milind Kamble, medical superintendent and PRO Dr Surendra Bhuyar,” said the top cop and added that they would be released as per legal procedure. The SP said, “The arrests of the real murderers would put the speculations to rest. The motorcycle and weapons used in the crime have been seized. The juvenile offender has two other crimes already registered against him.” “The arrested youths will be produced before the court on Sunday,” said the SP said adding that the city PSO Nandkishor Pant is investing the case. A reward of Rs one lakh cash was declered for cops involved in nabbing the trio. On threats issued by a Shiv Sena neta to the agitators in front of district collector Amol Yedge, the SP Bhujbal said he has been booked and a order will be issued soon prohibiting his entry to the campus. On Saturday, Director of Medical Education Dr Dilip Mhaiskar visited the college and assured the agitating students to fulfill their demands at the earliest. A five-member team from MUHS too interacted with the students and assured to resolve their issues. Dr Aniket Gaurkhede representing the protesters told TOI that said that they are insisting on adequate compensation for the next of kin of the deceased. The agitators rejected an aid of Rs5 lakh announced by Digras MLA Sanjay Rathod of Shiv Sena from the CM’s relief fund. The IMA observed one day OPD bandh to express solidarity with the agitating students. The alumini offered Rs5 lakh aid for the next of kin of Ashok Pal while IMA district unit has given Rs3 lakh to the family. One of the IMA members has declared to bear the education expenses of Pal’s younger brother and sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-police-suggest-mbbs-student-died-in-road-rage-3-real-killers-nabbed/articleshow/87691090.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Tripura violence fallout: 4-day curfew in Amravati, internet snapped||NAGPUR: As violence erupted in various parts of Amravati during the Saturday bandh call by saffron outfits, police imposed a four-day curfew and blocked internet in sensitive areas. Saturday’s bandh call was in response to Friday’s protest rallies by Muslim organizations to condemn the recent violence in Tripura. That rally witnessed stone-pelting in which some shops were damaged, leading to the bandh call. Internet services in the city will remain suspended for three days to prevent the spread of rumours that fuel violence, said city police commissioner Arti Singh. Internet towers have been blocked in the city’s sensitive areas. To aid the police force there, about hundred cops and 10 officers from Nagpur have been sent. Also, one or two companies of state reserve police force (SRPF) are expected to reach Amravati soon. BJP Amravati rural district president Nivedita Chaudhary has given a call for Amravati district bandh on Sunday. On Saturday morning, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags hands and raising slogans, came out on streets in Rajkamal Chowk area of the city, around 670km from Mumbai. Some members of the mob hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, police said, adding that the cops lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control. Against the backdrop of back-to-back incidents of stone-pelting on Friday and Saturday, additional police commissioner Sandip Patil issued orders imposing curfew within the city limits under sections 144(1), (2), (3) of CrPc to avoid any untoward incidents. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. A gathering of more than five people is not allowed, as per the order. On Friday, stone pelting was reported during rallies taken out by Muslim organizations to protest against incidents in Tripura, at Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal. Police have so far arrested 20 people and detained four others by registering 20 FIRs under various charges, including rioting, in connection with Friday’s incidents. In Amravati, over 8,000 people had gathered outside the district collector’s office on Friday to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community in Tripura be stopped. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of Kotwali police station. Launching a veiled attack on opposition BJP, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the MVA government. Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Raut said the state government is firm in the saddle and real faces of the perpetrators of violence will be exposed soon. “Raising the bogey of violence, they (opposition) will meet the state governor and write letters to the Union home ministry claiming that the (law and order) situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating. This will happen in the future too. But the state government is firm in the saddle,” Raut said. State Congress president Nana Patole accused BJP of conspiring to provoke riots ahead of next year’s assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. “BJP wants to polarize the society ahead of UP elections. People should not fall prey to such tactics,” he said. Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said some anti-social elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by throwing stones at shops. “The state government will take necessary action. However, some people are using this for political gains,” she said and appealed to people to not believe rumours. The minister also urged all party leaders to strive to establish peace, in a meeting of the peace committee. Amravati MP Navneet Rana said politicians must now focus on bringing the situation under control. “I appeal to the guardian minister (Thakur) and (Sanjay) Raut saheb to please not politicize the issue. It is time for all to come together and ensure peace in our city,” said Rana in a video message. AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel also condemned the violence in Amravati. “I want to question those leaders in the state who came to power by taking the votes of Muslims why they didn’t condemn the violence in Tripura. If this violence in Maharashtra is a ‘tit for tat’ by any political party, then this is the example of irresponsibility,” he said. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it was wrong to organise rallies in the state for an incident that “never occurred” in Tripura and appealed to people to exercise restraint. “The Tripura government and local police have clarified that no religious place of a minority community was burned down. They have issued pictures of the same as well. I appeal to both the communities to observe restraint,” the former chief minister told reporters in Mumbai. He added that political parties in the state government should not give inflammatory statements. Meanwhile, 31 places have been earmarked as communally ‘sensitive’ in Nagpur and put under special security surveillance. Around 5,000 cops have been deployed across the city, including in plain clothes, and crime branch personnel have been assigned vigilance tasks. City police chief Amitesh Kumar has appealed to citizens to remain calm and refrain from spreading and believing rumours.

---||Kolkata||The Bounceback||Kolkata: Too many people miss the silver lining because they are expecting gold, but Kolkata’s leading real estate players know life is about finding those silver linings and turning them into gold. The pandemic blow notwithstanding, Credai’s national chairman H V Patodia, who is from the city, and its Bengal president Sushil Mohta are optimistic about a realty flourish in Kolkata and its suburbs. Both believe that the market momentum gathered in August-September and being carried forward to November could get better over the next few months. The reasons are aplenty. The Bengal budget has reduced the stamp duty by 2% on registration of all kinds of properties, which has been extended to January 31 by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In addition, the guideline value (circle rate) on properties has been reduced by 10%. H V PatodiaKnight Frank India — one of India’s leading real estate consultancies — noted that Kolkata Metropolitan Area or Greater Kolkata’s real estate market had received a major boost ever since the state government announced the 2% rebate on stamp duty for registration of all documents (except those of amalgamation of contiguous land) in its budget in July 2021. Experts feel the move has been instrumental in prompting homebuyers to complete registration of properties previously purchased as well as create new demand for the sector. In fact, buoyed by the stamp duty cut, 6,861 units were sold in Kolkata’s primary residential market in Q3 (July-September). Sushil MohtaAccording to data available, the Q3 period this year witnessed a total of 15,160 residential sales deeds being registered in KMA, marking a 122% year-on-year (YoY) growth over the third quarter of 2020. The months of July, August and September this year noted a YoY increase of 39%, 268% and 79% over the respective months of 2020. As the stamp duty cut was only applicable for 22 days in July, the real upward momentum came in August before slowing down in September owing to the onset of the inauspicious ‘Shradh’ period of 11 days, beginning September 20. “Owing to a period of heightened momentum in registration of residential sales deeds in August 2021, it constituted 48% of the quarterly total,” a real estate consultant said. Patodia said there was a major increase in demand in Kolkata. “The home loan rate is at its lowest, which is a reason,” he said. Mohta observed that the sentiment was strong in October and till date in November. “The trend is very encouraging as far as residential real estate is concerned. The first 10 days of this month have been really good,” he said. “The real estate industry has strongly coped with the challenges of the pandemic and has recuperated to follow a growth trajectory despite all odds. The past few months have been extremely encouraging for us, with sales touching record highs. As home loan interest rates are at a historic low and stamp duty has been slashed in an excellent initiative by the Bengal government, people are keen to buy homes. I am confident that this is just the beginning and the momentum will sustain itself in the coming months,” said Sanjay Jain, managing director of Siddha Group. Sanjay JainIn terms of micro-markets, south Kolkata emerged on top, accounting for nearly one-third of total residential sales deeds registered, followed closely by north Kolkata. A good number of residential sales deeds were registered in several municipalities in North and South 24 Parganas, which are part of modern-day Kolkata’s vast urban agglomeration. “While the stamp duty cut has pushed registration of residential sales deeds across micro-markets and apartment sizes, the highest percentage jump has been observed in the unit sizes of 93sqm (1,000sqft) and above. This is indicative of homebuyers, in possession of residential assets of a higher value, taking the advantage of the temporary window of stamp duty cut to come forward and register their assets. During the Q3 period this year, apartments above 93sqm saw a massive 403% jump in registration over the same quarter in 2020,” a leading consultant said. Siddharth PansariFor the first nine months of the 2021 calendar year, 35,149 residential sales deeds were registered, marking a 102% annual increase over the same period in 2020. Director of Primarc Group Siddharth Pansari said the last quarter had seen exceptional sales across segments in and around Kolkata. “The need for space in this hybrid virtual world has drastically increased and brought in permanent lifestyle changes like work-from-home or study-from-home. Even at increased prices, the demand is constant and will stay,” Pansari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-bounceback/articleshow/87691190.cms||---

The animals walked 15-16km on Friday and are resting in Bhalki jungle under Ausgram (II) block. The calves — around 10 of them, including a newborn — have slowed the herd’s movement and it has rested for about 10 hours. The forest department has decided to give the elephants, who have strayed into villages, several hours’ break before attempting to drive them towards Bankura. This has been done so that the calves can recuperate and the herd can regroup after getting split up on Friday evening. While the calves were visibly tired after being shunted around by villagers and hulla parties, the splitting up of the pack into splinter groups may prove a headache for the department. Hulla teams from Bankura, East Burdwan and West Burdwan are waiting for the weather to clear before trying to reassemble the elephants. Two teams will be with the herd and another will keep close watch to avoid unwanted incidents with humans. One of the major challenges for forest officials will be vehicle movement on NH-2 when the animals cross the highway. Instructions have been given to control traffic. Debal Roy, principal chief conservator of forests, wildlife, told TOI: “If the weather is suitable, we will start drive work. Our teams and plan are ready.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-tired-elephant-herd-throw-up-challenges-for-forest-dept-in-e-burdwan/articleshow/87691077.cms||Mohammad Asif

SEC chief Saurav Das held a meeting with chief secretary H K Dwivedi, home secretary B P Gopalika, health secretary N S Nigam and DGP Manoj Malviya on Saturday over the security arrangement on the day of polls and also on the hours of polling in tandem with provisions under the West Bengal Municipal Act. The SEC wanted to know from the state government if it wanted deployment of central forces apart from state police. State officials told the SEC that they had adequate state police personnel and would submit the proposed security arrangements for the polls on Tuesday. SEC officials said that by next week the number of voters for KMC would be finalised after getting details of the electorate in the 2021 Assembly polls. For HMC, the SEC will finalise it by December 5, as it will take time to omit the voters of Bally municipality. In 2015, Bally municipality was amalgamated with HMC and now it has been delinked. For KMC, the poll panel plans to use 5,000-plus booths keeping in mind the pandemic situation. For following Covid-safety norms, use of sanitizers and gloves have been suggested along with use of thermal guns at entry points. The SEC has started testing the EVMs to find out whether they are functioning properly. There will be no VVPAT with the EVMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sec-seeks-security-plan-for-bengal-municipal-polls/articleshow/87691056.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kunal submits Ramayana works to cops in defence of Sita statement||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress general secretary Kunal Ghosh on Friday submitted academic works on Ramayana to police in Tripura to prove that his “Sitar Patal Prabesh” (Sita’s entry to earth) remark didn’t amount to a criminal offence. Ghosh’s remark had led to five FIRs against him in Tripura, several lodged by police themselves, from hurting religious sentiments to criminal intimidation. He was questioned at Tripura’s Bagma police station on Friday by five officers. Ghosh stepped into the police station on Friday with the original text of Valmiki Ramayana, apart from the Oxford Companion to World Mythology by David Leeming. He was also carrying Nrisinghaprasad Bhaduri’s ‘Ramayani’, Haraprasad Mukhopadhyay’s ‘Khola Chokhe Ramayan’ and Nabanita Deb Sen’s treatise on Sita apart from several other research works. He also summarized his findings in a note and submitted that with the officials questioning him. “I never disrespected any religion or any epic. My statement was based on decades of research backed by scholarly articles and books,” Ghosh told the officers. “No part of the remark was a figment of imagination. They were from the Valmiki Ramayana and to negate my speech, the police will have to disown those portions of the epic too. There is a place at Bithoor in Uttar Pradesh where Sita is believed to have entered the abyss,” Ghosh said, speaking to TOI on Saturday. A few days ago, Ghosh had spoken on Sita’s ‘Patal Prabesh’, arguing that she was exiled when she was pregnant and, in the end, chose to end her worldly life. Ghosh had also spoken on the use of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans to spread political terror and intimidate and attack people, including women. The FIRs followed this statement, he said. Bhaduri, whose literary work was quoted by Ghosh, said: “When Sita was summoned before Ram from the jungle where she was exiled, she was again asked to pass through fire.

---||Kolkata||32.5L fully jabbed in Kolkata with 32.4L vaccine-eligible population||KOLKATA: The number of people who have got both doses of their vaccine in Kolkata has now outstripped the city’s vaccine-eligible population. More than 32.5 lakh people in Kolkata have got both doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. The number of people eligible for the vaccine in the city is 32.4 lakh, according to Bengal government data shared with the Centre. A more detailed break-up of Kolkata’s 18-plus population is expected when the State Election Commission releases the voter list ahead of the December 19 Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls. Around 80.8 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in Kolkata till Saturday evening, out of which more than 48 lakh have received only their first dose and the rest both doses. The “apparent discrepancy in statistics” — vaccine recipients being more than the eligible population — can be explained by the large daily migratory population that Kolkata hosts, say officials. “Many people who come to work in the city may have taken the vaccine here instead of a health centre near home,” one official explained. Officials say the “100% double-dose” mark is more significant than what the numbers suggest. Kolkata, because of its population density and greater mobility, has been at the peak of Bengal’s Covid curve. It has reported 3.2 lakh Covid cases and 5,193 Covid deaths; it reported its first Covid case on March 23, 2020, and its first Covid death two days later. Over 20% of Bengal’s 16 lakh Covid cases and 27% of Bengal’s Covid deaths have been reported from the state capital. But Kolkata has also had the added advantage of a robust private-sector healthcare service to complement the KMC and state-run Covid Vaccination Centres. Officials have now set themselves the target of “rectifying” Kolkata’s vaccination gender gap. The city suffers from the sharpest male-female gap in the state when it comes to vaccination. More than 44 lakh of Kolkata’s vaccinated population of 80 lakh-plus are men; only about 36 lakh are women. The gap is much less in Bengal; 4.2 crore males have got the jab along with 4.1 crore females. About 2.4 crore of Bengal’s eligible population (of 7 crore) have received both their vaccine doses. The CoWin dashboard has captured several key vaccination trends over the last 30 days that suggested Kolkata was inching towards the “100% vaccination” target. Both government-run and private vaccination centres have seen the demand for the second shot rise in the recent past. The sharpest second shot-versus-first shot gap occurred on October 26; 38,097 people took their second dose that day compared to 6,388 first-dose recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/32-5l-fully-jabbed-in-kol-with-32-4l-vax-eligible-population/articleshow/87691427.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 52-year-old auto driver dies after falling into manhole in Dum Dum||KOLKATA: A 52-year-old man, who fell into an open manhole near Seven Tanks Road in Dum Dum on Friday night, died hours later in hospital. Locals pulled him out after hearing his screams and admitted him to RG Kar Medical College & Hospital where he died in the early hours of Saturday. Doctors said they tried flushing out the sewage water he had gulped but his condition deteriorated quickly and the toxins in the water could have led to his death. Autorickshaw driver Ranjan Saha had parked his rented auto at the owner’s residence at Seven Tanks and was on his way home in Dum Dum’s Bediapara about 15 minutes away when the mishap happened around 9.45pm. Saha’s shattered family blamed the civic authorities for turning a blind eye to the open manhole that claimed his life. His wife, Soma, said the death had plunged their lives into uncertainty as he was the sole bread earner. Their elder son Akash is in college while younger son Kisan studies in Class III. “Without a job, we will perish. There should be a proper investigation into the incident. We should be provided a job on humanitarian grounds,” she said. Tarak Singh, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation administrator overseeing sewerage and drainage department, blamed state PWD officials for not acting on an alert that the civic body had issued on missing manhole covers during the deluge in September. The chairman of KMC’s board of administrators, Firhad Hakim, said the police needed to conduct an inquiry into the death and find out what had actually happened. Ward coordinator Pushpali Sinha did not rule out the possibility of foul play but cops said there was no evidence of homicide. “No one has lodged a complaint. Prima facie, there is no evidence that he was pushed by someone,” a police officer said. Locals said the cover of the manhole into which Saha fell would often be removed at night by youths from the adjoining slum to relieve themselves. Some even claimed that Saha had toppled while relieving himself into it. One of Saha’s relatives, Chandrasekhar, said the 52-year-old probably did not spot the open manhole due to poor lighting at the spot. Missing manhole covers is not a new menace in Kolkata and its neighbourhoods. A racket stealing manhole covers at night and selling them as scrap iron still operates in some areas, said a civic official, recounting the tragic death of a toddler in Ultadanga area after the child fell into an open manhole a few years ago. The civic authorities seem to have learnt no lessons from a more recent example where a woman got trapped in an open manhole in New Town in September. The woman was rescued after two-and-a-half hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/52-year-old-auto-driver-dies-after-falling-into-manhole-in-dum-dum/articleshow/87691445.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||All in a day: CBSE 1st term exam, evaluation, uploading of marks||KOLKATA: Thirty minutes after board examinees finish writing their term one papers, the CBSE will release answer keys and school principals will have to ensure that the OMR sheets are corrected and marks uploaded on the CBSE portal the same day. This was among the announcements made by Sanyam Bhardwaj, the board’s controller of exams, at a virtual meeting with school heads and district/city co-ordintors on Saturday. This is the first time that such speedy same-day corrections will be done. Though the corrections and uploading of marks will be done in schools, the OMR sheets will have to be parcelled to the board the same day for random cross-checking. The corrections will be done by the teachers under the supervision of external observers appointed by the board. Each evaluator will be given 30 OMR sheets and the evaluation is to be done between 1:45 pm and 4 pm. The answer keys will be sent at 1 pm. It is not necessary for subject teachers to correct relevant OMR sheets. The marks will have to be uploaded on the CBSE portal between 4 pm and 4:30 pm. “I call this design-thinking. The board exam this time feels like any national-level competitive exam. Writing to uploading of marks will just take a few hours,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School. Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy felt this was fool-proof planning. “In these Covid times, one cannot delay anything. Introducing OMR sheets in board exams is indicative of how short and sharp processes are expected to be now,” she said. The board has also asked schools to open up multiple rooms and ensure that only 12 candidates are seated in a room to ensure distancing. It has asked schools to distribute mock OMR sheet test papers among examinees from Monday. “Last year’s situation of average marking led to many a heartbreak. This year, at least board examinees will be able to write an exam and earn the marks they deserve. We can only heartily accept the new CBSE X and XII format,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-in-a-day-cbse-1st-term-exam-evaluation-uploading-of-marks/articleshow/87691413.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||TMC picks Luizinho Faleiro for Rajya Sabha, Mahua Moitra to head Goa unit||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress named former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro as its candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal left vacant following the resignation of Arpita Ghosh nearly two months ago. TMC also tasked Mahua Moitra, its Krishnanagar MP, to immediately take charge of the party’s Goa unit. Faleiro will file his RS nomination on Tuesday and elections will be held on November 29. Faleiro, TMC’s all-India vice-president, is the third candidate from outside Bengal after Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Sushmita Dev to have received the party’s ticket for Rajya Sabha. “We are extremely pleased to nominate Luizinho Faleiro to the Upper House of Parliament. We are confident that his efforts towards serving the nation shall be appreciated widely by our people,” the AITC tweeted. Seventy-year-old former Navelim MLA Faleiro is TMC’s face in Goa when the party is making forays in the state after a resounding victory against BJP in the Bengal assembly polls. With TMC’s tally in the Bengal assembly rising to 218, Faleiro’s passage to Rajya Sabha is but a formality. Amid speculation that Faleiro’s nomination was a “broad hint” that the party might not project him as Trinamool’s CM face in the 2022 Goa assembly polls, party seniors put such speculation to rest saying that Faleiro would be contesting the Goa elections as well. Later, party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee issued a press release, which read that party chairperson Mamata Banerjee “looks forward to a brighter future for Goa, with All India Trinamool Congress paving the way with courage and wisdom”. The release said Moitra was being appointed TMC’s Goa unit’s state-in-charge with immediate effect. In a statement, Moitra thanked her party for the opportunity and said, “Looking forward to doing my very best.” Earlier, Trinamool had made Dev a part of the party’s Tripura committee, heading into the November 25 Agartala Municipal Corporation elections. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh seized the opportunity to say Trinamool chose to field a candidate from outside Bengal depriving “Banglar meye” (Bengal’s daughter) Arpita, who was made to resign from Rajya Sabha. Arpita said she was quite happy that a person like Faleiro was nominated for the seat she vacated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-picks-luizinho-for-rs-mahua-to-head-goa-unit/articleshow/87691051.cms||---
---||Nagpur||6km pipe conveyor system for coal transport launched||CHANDRAPUR: State energy minister Nitin Raut on Saturday launched the 6km long modern Pipe Conveyor System for direct transport of coal from Bhatali coal mine to Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS). This dedicated system is first-of-its-kind for Coal India Limited (CIL) as well as Mahagenco. The Rs200 crore project has coal carrying capacity of 6,000 metric tonne per day. “The pipe conveyor system is a step in the direction of developing a modern, efficient and eco-friendly mode of coal transportation from mines to power project,” said Raut. He claimed that it will go a long way in mitigating environmental impact of road transproation by eliminating dispersed coal dust and vehicular emissions. “It will also help in avoiding coal pilferage and facilitate assured quality and quantity of coal to power plants at lower transport costs,” he said. The minister further said that a similar system of over 16.5km is being built from five mines in Nagpur WCL area to supply coal to Khaparkheda and Koradi power plants in Nagpur district. He also revealed plans for building a floating solar project having capacity of 105 MW power generation in Irai dam here. “We have given formal approval for the project worth Rs660 crore. Approval is pending with the Union ministry for unconventional energy,” he said adding that it will also provide employment to 100 people. Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar raised issue of high pollution caused by power plants and other industries, and welcomed the initiative of Mahagenco towards curbing pollution. On presence of tigers and other predators in CSTPS area, he demanded construction of a compound wall around the project area. He also raised concerns over fly ash from ash bund of CSTPS flowing into Irai river and demanded immediate measures. Energy minister Raut agreed to demand for the compound wall and assured that measures are being taken to strengthen the ash bund. Minister of state for power, Prajakt Tanpure, MLA Prathibha Dhanorkar, MLA Kishor Jorgewar, ZP president Sandhya Gurnule, higher officials of power ministry, Mahagenco and WCL were present during the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6km-pipe-conveyor-system-for-coal-transport-launched/articleshow/87691204.cms||---

Two soldiers were killed during a shootout with militants in the Hoshab area of Pakistan’s Turbat district, while a third soldier was killed while trying to clear an improvised explosive device in a related incident, the armed forces’ communications wing said. Earlier on Saturday, two policemen were killed and six civilians injured, including a young girl, in attacks in northern Pakistan near Afghanistan as local Taliban militants agreed a month’s ceasefire after talks with the government, police said. The cease-fire between Pakistani Taliban — known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan — and the Imran Khan government was announced on Tuesday. The policemen were killed by an improvised explosive device near the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where they were posted at a reservoir. “The other attack took place on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, where a policeman and five including a young girl and three women were injured. The explosives were planted in a motorcycle targeting a police patrol in the area, said Ali Raza, a senior police officer. A TTP spokesman denied responsibility for the attacks, saying the militant group will abide by the ceasefire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/5-securitymen-die-in-attacks-in-pakistan-near-afghanistan-border-amid-government-ttp-deal/articleshow/87692498.cms||---

They came in a car, used a gas cutter to open the machine and escaped in less than 20 minutes. The bank manager, Pankaj Kumar Panday, said, “We had closed the bank and the ATM kiosk at 6pm Thursday. Around 4.45am, I got a call from a local that the ATM kiosk was broken into. I came to the bank branch and informed the police.” “Thieves have stolen Rs 9.74 lakh from the ATM. We have a gunman during the daytime, but there is no guard at night, when the bank and the kiosk are closed,” he added. Police said the footage of the CCTVs installed in the area showed two masked men came in a car around 2.15am. “They first moved the cameras of two CCTVs installed outside the bank upwards with a stick so that their images were not recorded and then they sprayed a liquid on the CCTV camera installed inside the kiosk. The duo cut the cash box of the machine with a gas cutter and took out money. The theft was executed in around 15 to 20 minutes after which they sped away in their car,” said a cop. Bhondri police post in-charge ASI Daljit Singh said, “A case has been registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) and 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC. Even as we have asked the banks to deploy guards at night too, the branch had not.” Sources in police said, “The image of the vehicle in which the accused had come has been recorded in a camera, but it is difficult to see its registration number because of darkness.” Police said since the village is around 12 kilometre from Bondri police post, it is not easy for cops to ensure complete security there. Meanwhile, Ludhiana rural police on Friday asked the banks to deploy security guards and install secret cameras too. Ludhiana rural SSP Rajbachan Singh said, “The bank branch didn’t have a guard for night. We have asked the banks to take adequate measures. They have been directed to have hidden cameras, too.” SIMILAR INCIDENTS November 2, 2019: Masked men uprooted SBI’s Pakhowal branch ATM that contained more than Rs 23 lakh and escaped with it in wee hours June 3, 2019: Thieves tried to loot an ATM of a private bank at Heera Singh Road in Jagraon at night hours May 11, 2019: A group of miscreants decamped with a private bank’s ATM at Kishanpura Chowk, Hambran Road, after holding a security guard hostage at gunpoint November 10, 2017: Looters struck at an ATM in Qila Raipur village in Dehlon and ran away with lakhs of rupees after breaking the machine with gas cutters||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/thieves-break-open-atm-in-sidhwan-bet-flee-with-rs-9-74l/articleshow/87673444.cms||---

However, if they are found to be symptomatic for COVID-19 on arrival or during the home quarantine period, they shall undergo testing and treatment as per protocols. "Children under 5 years of age are exempted from both pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic for Covid-19 on arrival or during home quarantine period, they shall undergo testing and treated as per laid down protocol," the Health Ministry guidelines on November 11. The Health Ministry said that the guidelines for international arrivals in India have been reviewed in view of increasing vaccination coverage across the globe and the changing nature of the pandemic. "The global trajectory of Covid-19 pandemic continues to decline with certain regional variations. The need to monitor the continuously changing nature of virus and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) must still remain in focus," the guideline said. This standard operating procedure (SOP) shall be valid from November 12 (00.00 hours IST) till further orders, the Ministry stated. The revised guidelines also state that 15 days must have elapsed since the completion of the COVID-19 vaccination schedule. On arrival, de-boarding should be done, ensuring physical distancing and thermal screening of all passengers is carried out by the health officials present at the airport. Contacts of suspected cases are co-passengers seated in the same row, plus three rows in front and three rows behind, along with identified cabin crew. Also, all the community contacts of travellers who have tested positive would be subjected to quarantine for 14 days and tested as per the Indian Council of Medical Research's protocol, the guidelines stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-covid-19-test-for-children-under-five-travelling-to-india-health-ministry/articleshow/87692556.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||83% of dengue cases are from urban areas||Ludhiana: The district’s dengue count has climbed to a five-year high. Of the cases reported this year, around 83% were from urban areas, including Ludhiana city, Khanna and Jagraon. According to the health department report, the number of dengue cases in Ludhiana was 1,534 till November 12. It is the second-highest count since 2015, when 1,876 cases were registered. There were 1,509 cases in 2019 and 489 in 2018. Of this year’s 1,534 cases, 1,266 (82.5%) were from urban areas of the district. And of the 1,266 cases, 1,136 (89.7%) were from Ludhiana city. Khanna had 67 cases and Jagraon 63. The rural areas had 268 cases (17.47%). In rural parts, Koom Kalan had the highest 47 cases, Sahnewal had 44 and Sudhar 40. There are 3,811 suspected cases in the district. The health department officials said more cases were expected before November-end. A health department official said, “More cases are being reported from urban areas, as population density is more there as compared with rural sections. Dengue cases are reported in October and November. Steps are being taken to check the disease.” Officials said the department teams destroy larvae and the municipal corporation carries out fogging. Experts said cases were being reported because of various reasons. “Earlier, the cases would be more in one year and less in the other. However, there are fluctuations in cases every year. It depends on weather conditions too. Rain increases the incidence due to accumulation of water. In urban areas, cases are more as there is congestion with more close buildings and more close contact,” said Dr Daljit Singh, former principal of DMCH. The civil surgeon couldn’t be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/83-of-dengue-cases-are-from-urban-areas/articleshow/87673413.cms||Shariq Majeed

The officials are dependent upon the old receipts, if residents have maintained these, or they ask them to pay the fee, saying that it is quite nominal and will help in regularising their connections. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had, on November 9, asked the officials to conduct the survey in blocks 29, 31, 32 and 34. Out of these, unique identity numbers are linked to properties only in block 34 and the officials can check the records with one click, while for other blocks the UID numbers are yet to be attached. However, the officials claimed that employees ask for the receipt or some old water supply bill that can prove that their connection is legal, but failing to show any proof can get them a notice. All these four blocks cover 50% of the area falling under the MC. The officials claimed that there were 70,973 properties in block 29; 74,008 in 31; 31,688 in 32; and 33,064 in 34. Requesting anonymity, an official claimed that they were told to scan properties door to door, which was not possible. He said despite involving staff from other branches, it was proving difficult as office work suffered. MC superintendent Abdul Satar said, "Since there are old buildings in the areas, we are simply asking for some proof of legal connection. And in the absence of it, we are serving notices, giving them three days to bring proof or pay fee. Charges are nominal, so we are convincing people to pay to regularise their connections.” Another superintendent, Vivek Verma, said, “At first only a receipt or a bill is being checked. If it is not there, then employees check it through the UID number, as in block 34 all properties are linked with it.” Probe marked into overcharging plaint As soon as a video of three MC employees overcharging water and sewerage connection regularisation fee in ward 27 went viral, the officials of operation and maintenance cell recommended action against them. Executive engineer Ranbir Singh said, “We recommended action against them and now the MC commissioner will decide the next course.” Later in the day, MC commissioner marked an inquiry to joint commissioner Ankur Mahindroo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mcs-survey-for-checking-all-defaulters-ill-planned-exercise/articleshow/87673400.cms||---

Nurses’ association chairman Manjeet Kaur said, “Forty-nine staff nurses protested in support of their demands of pay parity, food, uniform allowances, removal of anomalies related to Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, regularisation of contractual staff, among others. We called off our strike after a meeting with deputy CM O P Soni, who said our demands will be fulfilled next week.”Even as they were on strike, contractual staff were working, so patient-care services were not affected, Manjeet Kaur added.The strike, however, gave patients a tough time. Neha, a resident of Giaspura, said, “I am pregnant and getting treated at civil hospital. On Friday, the services were hit. Doctors don’t have staff while they were seeing patients.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP may fix onus of restoring road on agency that digs it up||BENGALURU: BBMP plans to implement a rule pinning the responsibility of restoring a road on the agency that digs it up. Additional chief secretary and BBMP administrator Rakesh Singh said, "The coordination between civic agencies is not great. Roads are being dug up by Bescom, BWSSB, KPTCL, and even OFC companies. Hence, we are planning to implement a rule mandating that whichever agency digs up a road will be completely responsible for restoring it once work is over. The ward-level Palike engineer will supervise things." At present, agencies ask BBMP for permission to dig up roads and have to a deposit with it an amount for restoration work. Singh said these days, many agencies tend to just say they have paid the money. "The new rule will bring in a lot of transparency into the system and is also likely to put an end to the blame game that leads to delay in road restoration," he said. Citizens welcomed the initiative but wondered if the BBMP has thought things through. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha said, on paper, it is definitely a good rule, do agencies that dig up roads have the competence to restore them? BBMP must also impose penalty on agencies that fail to restore roads in the given time frame. Citizen groups also believe ward committees should be informed about the roads that will be dug up and they should also be part of the restoration process, as it is they who will suffer if it is not done properly. Jagadeesh Reddy, a member of NGO Varthur Rising, said, "The concept that the responsibility of road restoration lies with the agency that digs it up is ideal. But do the other agencies have the expertise to carry out this work as BBMP would? A detailed study needs to be done into this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-bbmp-may-fix-onus-of-restoring-road-on-agency-that-digs-it-up/articleshow/87692601.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar row: Forest principal secretary wanted ‘action taken’; Bennichen Thomas a scapegoat?||IDUKKI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After documents in the public domain made it clear that the Kerala government was in cahoots with the Tamil Nadu government to cut trees at the Mullaperiyar dam site, the LDF regime quickly suspended chief wildlife warden Bennichen Thomas for issuing the controversial order. However, two letters (accessed by TOI) from the principal secretary of forest department to four senior forest officials seeking necessary clearance for felling of trees near the baby dam reveal that Bennichen was possibly being made a scapegoat and that he had only acted on orders from people higher up in the hierarchy. The first letter, dated October 19, 2020, addressing principal chief conservator forests and head of forest force, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, principal chief conservator of forests (forest management) and deputy director of Periyar Tiger Reserve — with subject: 'Forest and wildlife department; strengthening of baby dam, removal of shrubs and felling of trees in and around Mullai Periyar Dam, Baby Dam, Necessary clearance requested’ — asks them to take action and furnish an action taken report. A letter for Tamil Nadu public works department, dated September 3, 2020, is mentioned as a reference. The letter from forest principal secretary states: “I am to forward herewith a copy of the letter referred above and to request you to take action in the light of Honourable Supreme Court verdict, existing rules and directions of government of Kerala in this regard and furnish a detailed action taken report to government urgently.” After nine months, the forest principal secretary again sent a letter to the same officials and sought a detailed action taken report. This letter, which mentions the earlier letter dated October 19, 2020, states: “I am to invite your attention to the reference cited and to request you to furnish the detailed action taken report called for therein to the government urgently. Copy of the reference cited is enclosed herewith for ready reference.” Meanwhile, forest minister A K Saseendran continues to claim that he was unaware of any such development. Saseendran is reportedly upset that the forest principal secretary along with other officials kept him in the dark about the orders issued on tree cutting at Mullaperiyar. The minister himself, and his party NCP, have sought action against the forest department officials. NCP state president P C Chacko said he has asked the chief minister to take strict action against the officials. “The order has been issued without the knowledge of the forest minister, which means that serious disciplinary action will have to be taken against the officials. When it comes to interstate issues, the minister and government have to take decisions, not officials,’’ said Chacko. “The principal forest secretary's letters reveal that the chief wildlife warden issued the tree felling order following pressure from the top level,” said environmentalist M N Jayachandan. "It has to be noted that Bennichen Thomas had denied permission for tree cutting near baby dam area earlier when he was deputy director, Periyar Tiger Reserve. The new tree felling order shows that some people used these officials as tools for implementing their agenda," Jayachandran added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mullaperiyar-row-forest-principal-secretary-wanted-action-taken-bennichen-thomas-a-scapegoat/articleshow/87692591.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The Tele-Law initiative of the Department of Justice, launched in 2017, is a free service for the poor and marginalised sections of the society. The downloadable app version of the service available on phones would help to rapidly expand its reach and cover the entire population where those eligible will continue to get free service. It has already helped more than 12 lakh beneficiaries, including people from SC/ ST communities and women. Rijiju had earlier mentioned that the government is working towards taking the justice delivery system to the doorstep of the people. Rijiju, who felicitated frontline Tele-Law workers assembled from across the country, said downloading the ‘Citizens Tele-Law Mobile App’ would optimise the citizen centric justice delivery mechanism.

One person is feared to have been washed away at Mullaiyaru while state disaster response force and police rescued 2,267 people belonging to 755 families and relocated them to 48 rescue centres. Flooded tracks and landslips disrupted Nagercoil-Thiruvananthapuram and Nagercoil-Tirunelveli rail traffic. "More than 40,000 cusecs of water flowed through Thamiraparani river at Kuzhithurai on Saturday evening against the river's capacity of 20,000 cusecs," an official said. The district recorded an average rainfall of 100.48mm in 24hours till 8am on Saturday. In Chennai, at least 78 locations and 167 streets continued to face water stagnation on Saturday. Some areas in Alwarpet, Kodambakkam, Madhavaram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Semmencherry and Perumbakkam continued to remain under knee-deep water. The IMD said a new low-pressure area had formed over south Andaman Sea at 8.30am on Saturday. While the city may be spared from the new weather system, some areas may get light to moderate spells for the next two days due to a cyclonic circulation. The state government, meanwhile, formed a 14-member panel under retired bureaucrat V Thiruppugazh to to suggest ways to devise flood control methods and design storm water drains to reduce flood impact. Chief planner of town and country planning organisation in Delhi, Nambi Apppadurai, director, Climate Resilience Practice World; Janakiraman of Madras Institute of Development Studies; Kapil Gupta from IIT Bombay; Pradeep Moses, director, Centre for Human Settlement, and experts from CMDA, corporation, highways, and environment department will be its members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-100-mm-rain-in-24-hours-sinks-kanyakumari/articleshow/87692647.cms||---

While the ruling YSRC holds a clear edge in all municipalities and Nellore, all eyes will be on the contest in Kuppam, which is the constituency of TDP chief and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. Kuppam, which was upgraded into a municipality after the YSRC came to power in the state in 2019, is going for its first election. The town is the headquarters of the assembly constituency, and has been voting for TDP and Naidu since 1989. While the former chief minister is taking it as a prestige issue and has deputed senior leaders of the party, including his son Nara Lokesh, for campaigning, the ruling YSRC is keen to win wrest the municipality. Besides the 12 municipalities and Nellore municipal corporation, by-elections are being held in 12 divisions in seven municipal corporations, and 13 wards in 12 municipalities across the state following the death of the candidates in the elections held earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stage-set-for-pending-ap-local-body-polls-as-campaign-ends/articleshow/87692656.cms||Gopi Dara

After the allegations surfaced last month against the pastor, village elders tried to settle the issue without reporting the incident to the local police. However, after the videos of minor girls levelling sexual abuse charges against the pastor went viral in social media, the police intervened and booked a case against him on Saturday.

---||India||India under Congress was semi-Islamic state, says BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday said barring the interregnum of the Vajpayee government, India before 2014 was a semi-Islamic state. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi also alleged that Congress member Rahul Gandhi’s derogatory remark on Hinduism led to violence in Maharashtra and fake news was purposely spread after large scale ruckus took place across the state. “Under the Congress rule, India was partially a Muslim nation. I’m saying so with full responsibility because Sharia provisions were part of the constitutional system,” he said, referring to practice like instant talaq, now barred, and grant of Haj subsidy, since discontinued. In an apparent reference to the Rajiv Gandhi government bringing a law to override an SC order in the Shah Bano case, Trivedi said the judgment was overruled to give primacy to Sharia provisions. “Overriding an SC judgment was not done even in a Muslim state,” Trivedi said, adding, “Insulting Hindu religion is in Congress DNA.” He alleged that the violence in Maharashtra over the “false” news of mosques being targeted in Tripura and Congress leaders’ comments attacking Hindutva were part of a conspiracy. “Large scale violence, Rahul’s remark against Hindutva and Salman Khurshid comparing Hindutva with Islamic terrorist outifts can’t be a coincidence but smacks of a larger conspiracy of spreading hatred against Hindu religion,” he said. Trivedi said it was Rahul’s tirade against Hindu religion, which stirred Congress workers in Maharashtra. “It seems he has been an inspiration to his party workers in Maharashtra in defaming Hindutva and driving an organised campaign to stoke communal discord and violence,” he added. Asserting that Shivaji’s rule was also associated with Hinduism, Trivedi said leaders like Rahul can’t comprehend the concept and asked him to read up his own party stalwarts like Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Jawaharlal Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-under-congress-was-semi-islamic-state-says-bjp/articleshow/87692695.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Brisk business during Diwali washed out by rain||CHENNAI: After months of poor business due to pandemic, the hospitality and retail sector in the city was badly affected by the recent rain. Footfalls in restaurants and retail shops that had picked up during the festival season, dropped significantly, while the occupancy rate at hotels in Chennai and in the tourist hotspot of Mamallapuram was minimal. Business establishments in the commercial hub of Pondy Bazaar that was bustling till the Diwali weekend are yet to revive from the impact of rain. An eatery with empty seats has trimmed its menu because of poor footfalls over the past four days. On Saturday, though parking was full along the 'Pedestrian Plaza', the weekend crowd was missing.  The situation was similar in the wholesale and retail textile market of Washermenpet. Hotels in the city and Mamallapuram recorded several cancellations of bookings due to heavy rain and some conferences scheduled at five-star facilities were put off this week. For instance, TTDC's Beach Resort Complex at Mamallapuram has only 30% to 40% confirmed reservations, which touched 95% in the past three months. G Venkat, an employee at an ornaments outlet at Pondy Bazaar said business and walk-ins had dipped. "Our business picked up during Ayudha Puja and peaked during Diwali, but fell flat due to rain. When shops reopened post-Covid lockdown, there was a shortage of products, while customers were available. Now, products are in plenty, but no takers," he said. A V S Marimuthu, high-level committee member of Washermenpet Cloth Merchants Association said the market records an average sale of 100 crore daily. "Diwali saw brisk business. However, rain cost our business, which is hardly 10% of the normal trade in our market," he said, adding that traders were expecting a revival from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-brisk-business-during-diwali-washed-out-by-rain/articleshow/87692708.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Police on Friday visited a park in the city where namaz is regularly offered after a photo of the congregation was tweeted by a user and asked the gathering not to offer Friday prayers there. On Friday, Twitter user Tribhuwan Pratap Singh posted the photo of the Noida Authority park in Sector 65 where namaz was being offered. Tagging official Twitter handles of Noida police, UP Police, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s office and others, Singh tweeted: “This is not a masjid but a park in Sector 65. 250 members of Muslim community are offering namaz here in violation of Covid guidelines. Please take note.” In 2018, when protests in Gurugramhappened for the first time, police had stopped Friday prayers at a park in Sector 58. “A controversy had been witnessed over offering of namaz at the Noida Authority park in December 2018. A notice was issued by the Sector 58 police station to companies in the area to ask their employees not to offer namaz collectively at a public park. After that, it stopped. Then Covid happened. Now that the situation is improving, people have again started to offer namaz here,” a police officer told TOI. Phase III SHO Vivek Trivedi said they took note of the tweet and visited the spot where several workers employed in the nearby export, garment and other factories had gathered. “The community members had been offering namaz collectively. They were informed that since 2019, namaz was not being allowed at the public park and it cannot be allowed in future as well. They were explained the rule and they promised they will not offer namaz here again,” Trivedi said. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar told TOI as per rules, any religious activity could not be allowed at a public place. Among those who tweeted to question the namaz gathering at the Sector 65 park was Ambuj Bharadwaj, social media coordinator for Panchjanya, the weekly magazine published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/namaz-stopped-at-noida-park-after-tweet/articleshow/87691444.cms||Shikha Salaria

Of the amount, the five allegedly withdrew Rs 2.5 lakh from his bank account. In his police complaint, Ravi Kumar, a Nandgram resident employed as a sanitary worker at a Delhi school, claimed that he had given a loan of Rs 2.5 lakh to a woman, named Neelam, introduced to him by one of his acquaintances. When Ravi asked Neelam to pay up as agreed upon earlier, she expressed her inability to repay the loan and promised to arrange a bank loan instead, “which the victim needed for giving alimony to his wife as part of their divorce”, according to the complaint. “I was in dire need of money, so I agreed to their proposal. Neelam introduced me to her friend Hemlata and with help of two others — Omkar and Kuldeep — helped me in opening a bank account with the UP Cooperative Bank’s Raj Nagar Extension branch,” said Ravi. The four allegedly told Ravi that they knew the bank manager who would help him in procuring a loan of Rs 3 lakh. “They made me sign some blank documents and took a couple of leaves from my cheque book.” “The amount was subsequently transferred into my account, but much later I realised that I owed the bank Rs 5 lakh. I also came to know that they had fraudulently withdrawn Rs 2.5 lakh from my account using the signed cheques that they had taken from me,” Kumar said. On his complaint, an FIR under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471(forging document) and 506 (criminal intimidation) was lodged against the five accused at the Kavinagar police station on Friday. “We have registered a case against Neelam, Hemlata, Omkar, Kuldeep and the manager of the Cooperative Bank. They had allegedly conspired to cheat the victim,” said a police officer. “No one has been arrested yet. A probe is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bank-manager-among-5-booked-for-duping-customer/articleshow/87691454.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Bengaluru||Post Covid, diabetes seen in many 30-40 year olds in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Doctors in city hospitals have come across a trend of people in the 30-40 age group, all of whom have recovered from Covid-19, seeking treatment for diabetes. While some experienced extreme fatigue, others suffered from eyerelated problems, only to know later that they’ve been living with undiagnosed diabetes. “Compared to the pre-pandemic era, the number of youngsters seeking treatment for diabetes has shot up by 5-10% now. They have all recovered from Covid. We don’t know if Covid itself has been a contributing factor. The virus seems to have affected beta cells in the pancreas which produce insulin. In some cases, overuse of steroids during the treatment may also have led to diabetes,” said Dr Dwarakanath CS, endocrinologist. He added that in many cases, the person would be having pre-existing diabetes, but was diagnosed only after testing positive for Covid. As per the state health and family welfare department, a majority of the Covid burden was seen among youngsters in the age group of 30-39. Over 6.8 lakh Covid patients in Karnataka were in this bracket. Doctors at Apollo Hospitals have taken up a study to understand how many patients developed diabetes post Covid. “Diabetes status among Covid-recovered persons is being studied. In five cases that I have come across, diabetes was noticed post Covid. They came to us when they suffered from an eye infection or developed a blood clot in the retinal vein. These are post-Covid sequelae which we are seeing now,” said Dr Shalini Shetty, senior consultant ophthalmologist, Apollo Hospitals. While all the five cases of eye-related issues were seen in Covid-recovered persons below 40, one of them was a woman, said Dr Shetty. A senior doctor from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute said Covid impaired blood sugar levels among many patients and has led to insulin dependence in some. “The pandemic is still on and we don’t know if the onset of diabetes seen after Covid is reversible with medication,” the doctor said, refraining from commenting on the exact percentage of new diabetes cases. “It’s tough to quantify the rise in diabetes, unless a study is done locally,” the professor said. Covid directly could cause diabetes or precipitate it in a person with risk factors, by causing insulitis or inflammation of the endocrine tissues in the pancreas that regulate glucose levels, and hence lead to elevated sugar levels, said the doctor. Dr Pallavi D Rao, endocrinologist, Specialist Hospital, said one of the first questions she asks her patients is if they were infected with Covid earlier. “The question is pertinent as medicines have to be tailored differently for those with post-Covid recovery. We don’t know how the pandemic is going to pan out, but Covid has led to substantial risk of diabetes,” said Dr Rao. Irrespective of the pandemic, diabetes is increasing every decade, said Dr Swathi Sachin Jadhav, endocrinologist from Sagar hospitals. She said in some cases, people who had no diabetes prior to Covid, have seen its onset. “We tested past three months’ sugar levels of Covid patients when they showed high sugar levels. In some patients, there was no history of high sugar levels prior to the infection and the onset of diabetes happened during Covid. However, there are several unanswered questions on the new onset of diabetes post Covid,” said Dr Jadhav. According to Dr Manohar KN, secretary, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India, Karnataka, though there is definitely a rise in diabetes cases because of Covid leading to insulitis, lockdown-induced weight gain could have also caused the condition. “It would be too early to quantify the increase in diabetes cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/post-covid-diabetes-seen-in-many-30-40-year-olds-in-karnataka/articleshow/87692740.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Pilot is expected to become a general secretary in Congress. The post of media in charge (communications department) is up for change as Randeep Surjewala is holding the dual charge of media and general secretary in charge of Karnataka. It is to be seen if Pilot gets the charge of a state or some other position. Pilot on Friday met party president Sonia Gandhi at her residence in the national capital amid speculations of a possible cabinet reshuffle and other key appointments in Rajasthan. After the meeting, Pilot said Congress wants to strengthen the state organisation ahead of the assembly elections which will be held in 2023. On Thursday, Pilot met senior Congress leader KC Venugopal ahead of the Gehlot-Sonia Gandhi meeting. The much-awaited cabinet rejig and appointments have been pending ever since the Covid pandemic broke out. The Assembly by-polls had also been delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speculation-rife-sachin-pilot-could-be-made-aicc-general-secretary/articleshow/87692742.cms||---

Veliparambil Akbar from Chenthrappinni killed both birds (safety and expense) with one stone -- he bought a horse for his son Muhammad Musthafa to ride to Government LP School, Korikkuzhi, where he is a third standard student. “I bought the horse for about Rs 1.20 lakh, and I raised the money by selling my Bullet,’’ Akbar said. He says he has to spend around Rs 180 per day to maintain the horse, and feels it's less expensive than maintaining a sedan. He is also now free from the fear of his 8 yr-old getting infected during the commute to school and back. Akbar’s two elder sons are studying in nearby schools. The six-year old mare, christened Surumi, is quite docile, and Akbar was able to learn horse-riding by himself. Lessons in the YouTube channels also came in handy and he taught his three sons to handle Surumi at the nearby beach. Akbar, who is working as a construction contractor, uses his horse for work-related travel as well. “I bought the horse from a trader in Palakkad three months ago. My son has already learnt horse-riding. Now I accompany him to school, and bring back the horse after dropping him. Eventually we are planning to tether the horse somewhere near the school and keep some feed and water near it. My son will then be able to ride alone,” Akbar said. Musthafa of course is ecstatic, not just because of the daily saunter but also the attention it has brought him. “I’m thrilled to go to school on horseback. My schoolmates and teachers are also happy. Some friends are asking me to teach them horse riding,” Musthafa said. Incidentally, in April 2019, a girl student C A Krishna had ridden a horse to Holy Grace Academy in Mala to appear for CBSE 10th standard examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-galloping-fuel-prices-force-musthafa-to-commute-to-school-on-horseback/articleshow/87692755.cms||T Ramavarman

Her cremation is scheduled to take place in Delhi on Sunday. Mayawati’s father Prabhu Dayal passed away almost exactly a year back on November 19, at the age of 95 years. The news of the death was issued by party’s national general secretary and MP Satish Chandra Mishra who said that Ramrati was undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital and died of heart failure. “May everyone get the strength to bear this loss. Her final rites will be conducted on Sunday after Behenji reaches Delhi and other family members can also come together,” Mishra said. Party sources said that immediately after getting the news of her mother’s death, the former UP chief minister left for Delhi and paid her last respects to her mother at her Thyagaraj Road residence. “Behenji was extremely close to her parents and after losing her father in 2020, she had directed party workers not to celebrate her birthday this year, which is ordinarily a big event for us. She had been in Lucknow for several days due to elections but left as soon as she received the sad news on Saturday afternoon.

On Friday, the US justice department said Bannon, 67, was indicted on one count for refusing to appear for a deposition last month and the other for refusing to provide documents in response to the committee's subpoena.  He is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday and will appear in court that afternoon, a law enforcement official said. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Bannon’s indictment reflects the justice department’s “steadfast commitment” to the rule of law. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars. The indictment came as a second expected witness, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, defied his own subpoena from the committee on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bannon-indicted-for-contempt-over-congress-capitol-riots-inquiry/articleshow/87692808.cms||---
---||Chennai||It's raining paint parties now||CHENNAI: When she wanted to throw her friend a bridal shower, Karishma Menon and her gang of girls decided to paint the town red. Literally. With acrylic paints, brushes and aprons, they filled their canvases with the silhouette of a woman against a vivid backdrop. “We wanted to do something different and had seen photos of paint parties on Instagram. Since the bride loves painting, we thought a paint party would be fun,” says Karishma. “We hosted it at a café, all of us wore pink. It was therapeutic, especially as the bride was stressed out with all the wedding planning.” Private paint parties — where people get together to learn how to create a painting from scratch under the guidance of an instructor — are getting popular across cities. While earlier they were held in malls, public spaces, art galleries, and for corporates, outfits are now curating these creative experiences for weddings, birthdays, kitty parties and anniversaries. Playing with colours can be destressing and healing. And paint parties are ideal when you are cooped up at home due to the pandemic or the inclement weather as they can also be held online. Indrajala Moturi and Mridul Sahuwala, founders of IlluminArty which organised the paint party for Karishma and her friends, initially focused on doing art workshops for corporates when they launched their company in 2017. “We did our first public paint part in Chennai in December 2018 at a lounge bar and after that there was no turning back. And when we held public events, we got bookings for private parties,” says Indrajala, adding that IlluminArty is an experiential creative workshop company. “A paint party is a 90-minute guided art session where a resident artist or IlluminArtist teaches participants step by step how to create a painting,” says Indrajala, adding that the theme is conceptualised beforehand. “We did one, based on the artist S H Raza on request, and also a 1990s theme party. The venue is chosen by the host. We provide the art material — easel, canvas, brushes, acrylic paint — and the guests get to keep the painting they make.” Ruchi Mehta, founder of The Paint Social which has hosted paint parties across the country, says they did get requests to conduct these parties for baby showers during the pandemic. “Many people wanted to do it before and after the second wave. We prefer offline events as it’s a social event where people meet, chat, relax and paint,” she says. “And I prefer to have a minimum of 10 people though we have hosted it for 100 to 200 people when we do corporate events.” Other companies, like IlluminArty, switched to virtual parties during the pandemic. “We did Insta Lives every Friday and Saturday and our followers painted with us. So we began doing online events, where we sent kits to people and then hosted a 60-minute session on Zoom,” says Indrajala. Drishya Gupta, for instance, threw her mother Seema Goyal a paint party to mark her 50th birthday last year. “It was in August and the pandemic was raging. So I wanted to do something special but also ensure it was safe. So I got six or seven of her friends home, the instructor got online and we all made a painting of a ballerina,” she says. “I served wine, finger food and everyone had a great time as few of them had ever painted on a canvas or used an easel.” Mumbai-based Vinisha Savla, founder of Paintology, has also been conducting virtual paint parties across the country. “Many people are WFH in their hometowns, so we send art kits to them and then decide the day and time,” says Vinisha, who launched the company four-and-a-half years ago after a trip to Australia with her husband. “We were strolling down the streets of Surfers Paradise and saw a small place where people were seated, sipping on wine and painting. The concept was really new to me but playing with colours really de-stresses you.” And that’s the charm of these parties. “Each colour has a property — blue is cool and soothing, green is close to nature,” says Vinisha, whose company specialises in acrylic painting and fluid art, where you pour colours on canvases to create unique art works. “We create a cut-out of your initial and pour paint on to it,” she says. And while most participants are newbies apprehensive of wielding a brush, all companies have instructors who make the process simple and destressing. “Anybody, of any age, can paint. I introduce people to the medium and they get so engrossed that they don’t even know how three hours have gone by,” says artist Virali Vatsal Shah, who works with Paintology. There are no hard and fast rules. “If it is a detailed painting, the drawing is already done so guests can just focus on the painting. But there is no restriction, you can use your imagination and add whatever you want to the painting,” says Virali. Ruchi says they have different concepts. “For a corporate team building event, we broke down a painting into 16 different canvases and each person painted one bit,” she says. Charges vary depending on the number of people, medium, and so, but usually ranges between ₹1,500 and ₹3,000 a head. But, for the participants, it is all about the experience. “None of us knows how to paint and we were nervous about it. But our paintings turned out well. They are a memory of the bridal shower we had,” says Karishma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-raining-paint-parties-now/articleshow/87692811.cms||Priya Menon
---||Lucknow||Azamgarh backed 2 former CMs, got nothing in return: Yogi Adityanath||AZAMGARH: Taking a potshot at Samajwadi Party (SP) leadership, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that “Azamgarh backed two former CMs and also sent them to Parliament. But, the duo distorted the image of the district and created a crisis of identity for the people of the area as this place turned into a harbour of extremists and terror modules.” Addressing a public meeting following foundation laying of the state university here on Saturday by Union home minister Amit Shah, the CM said, “Development work is taking place in the same Azamgarh, which had given two chief ministers to UP and also sent the duo to Parliament, but ironically they only tarnished its image. The youth of Azamgarh used to be denied entry into hotels and not given rooms on rent whenever they went outside the state and the people of the area were facing an identity crisis.” ‘4.5L got jobs in my tenure, none kin of PM, Shah or mine’The CM added, “These were the same people who divided the society in the name of caste and promoted only family members and relatives.” Targeting SP over dynastic politics, CM Yogi said, “Whenever a job recruitment drive was started in its regime, the members of a family and their relatives used to roam like characters of Mahabharata to extort money from the aspirants. In my regime, government jobs have been offered to 4.5 lakh youth while 3 lakh youth have been recruited on contract basis. And none of them are relatives of Modi, Shah or myself.” Taunting SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for not even visiting his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh during the Covid-19 pandemic, Yogi said: “Members of this family will come in elections to mislead and win, but they would never be seen helping people of their constituency during a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.” “But, in the same Azamgarh where over one lakh migrant labourers returned during the pandemic, my government not only ensured their safe return but also arranged free ration, tests, medicine and vaccine. “The free ration distribution will continue among 15 crore beneficiaries till the festival of Holi in 2022,” he added. Yogi said, “Now, Azamgarh has changed and Purvanchal Expressway is becoming the pivot of your development. The airport of the district is 95% complete. UP’s youth will be ‘smart youths’ as the government is all set to give smart phones and tabs in their hands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/azamgarh-backed-2-former-cms-got-nothing-in-return-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87692818.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Chennai||When tech meets Tholkappiyam: Chennai artists collaborate for NFT musical project that can be heard in 19,440 ways||CHENNAI: On a chilly evening at Manhattan’s glittering Terminal 5 earlier this month, thousands watched as digital artist Beeple’s iconic $69 million non-fungible token (NFT), ‘Everydays — The First 5000 Days’, made its public debut. And setting the tone for this historic event — the world’s first NFT-focused music, art, and technology festival titled ‘Dreamverse’ — were sounds from the Tamil soil. In the project titled ‘Pann’, musical moods that outline landscapes such as Kurinji (mountain), Neidhal (ocean) and Marudham (agricultural fields) in ancient Sangam literature, have been woven into a sublime arrangement of programmable music by 41 visual and musical artists from Chennai. The project was commissioned for the mega event by MetaKovan (aka Vignesh Sundaresan), founder and financier of the NFT investment fund Metapurse. But in what will be a colossal milestone for independent artists from Tamil Nadu, ‘Pann’ will be minted as an NFT on Async Art — an experimental art movement built on the blockchain — in November. The initiative promises to open those like Chennai singer and music composer Pradeep Kumar and Tamil folk star Anthony Daasan up to a burgeoning tribe of collectors and connoisseurs fuelling the NFT market. “When the project came to us a couple of months ago, we were led by one strong drive: to connect as many artists as possible directly to a global audience,” says Pradeep, also the brain behind ‘Pann’. “The greatest gift of a block chain-powered art space is that it empowers the artist to perform with complete ingenuity and freedom, and witness their value addition to a vast, evolving and decentralised space,” he says. The musical piece comes in 19,440 combinations it can be heard in. These are created out of nine layers containing a wide range of instruments, vocals and ambient sounds. So, if a collector buys one layer, they can literally fashion out the master track as per their choice using the variations available to them. Variations for each layer have also been recorded live — including sounds from different landscapes of Tamil Nadu and electronic layers from a modular synthesiser. The technology has been developed on the Etherium blockchain that enables smart contracts and royalties to be coded into it. So, for every layer and master track purchased, the artist gets remunerated through an automated system. "This is really the beauty of the NFT space. It cuts out the intervention of record labels and streaming platforms – which in this case - could be likened to middlemen. The artist gets their due and the audience gets the real worth of the artwork they’re purchasing,” says Radar With a K, an independent music producer and one of the artists in ‘Pann’ Anthony Daasan, who has painstakingly worked his way up from singing at funerals to becoming an indisputable voice of folk art in Tamil cinema, sees this as an opportunity to catapult struggling folk artists to brave new heights. “I am determined to include as many of our brothers and sisters in this movement. It could keep precious performing traditions alive and incentivize the younger generation to flourish them,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-tech-meets-tholkappiyam-chennai-artists-collaborate-for-nft-musical-project-that-can-be-heard-in-19440-ways/articleshow/87692828.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Maoists abduct, kill 2 villagers in Balaghat||BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Maoists have stepped up violence in the vicinity of Kanha National Park, killing two villagers in Balaghat district in an apparent revenge attack in the wee hours of Saturday after branding them police informers. A band of 15-20 armed Maoists kidnapped victims Jagdish and Santosh from their homes in Malakhedi village around 3am on Saturday, Balaghat SP Abhishek Tiwari said. They dragged the duo to a spot near the village where a woman Maoist had been gunned down last year, and shot them dead. This is the second Maoist killing in a year, and the seventh in four. Maoists left letters on the bodies, accusing them of working for the police, and asking SP Tiwari "not to influence people in the region". On November 7, 2020, a 25-year-old woman Maoist, Sharda, carrying a reward of Rs 8 lakh, was killed in an encounter with police near Malakhedi in Baiher, some 90km from the district headquarters and 450km from Bhopal.  Jagdish and Santosh were killed by the Maoists' Khatia-Mocha Dalam, which is active in Balaghat and tribal-dominated Mandla districts of MP, said police.  It could be retaliation for the killing of Sharda, who was a native of Bijapur in neighboring Chhattisgarh and was wanted in 18 cases. She was member of Khatia-Mocha Dalam, and carried bounties of Rs 3 lakh in Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5 lakh in Chhattisgarh. A month later, in December 2020, two more women Maoists - Savitri and Shoba - were shot dead in an encounter with security forces in Balaghat. They were members of Darrekasa and Malajkhand Dalams. The gunfight took place in Borevan forest in Kirnapur, about 100km from Malakhedi. Police officers say that a portion of Kanha National Park is virtually under the control of Maoists. Forest guards don't patrol those areas, and neither are tourists allowed there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-maoists-abduct-kill-2-villagers-in-balaghat/articleshow/87692885.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurgaon chokes on ‘severe’ air for second day on the trot||Gurgaon: The city’s air quality index (AQI) recorded a slight dip but remained in the ‘severe’ category for the second consecutive day on Saturday. While it stood at 441 on the day, it was 448 the previous day. According to the officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a reduction in moisture content during the day and marginal rise in wind speed have allowed slight dispersal of pollutants, but the AQI is likely to stay in the ‘severe’ to ‘very poor’ categories for the next few days due to unfavourable weather conditions. All monitoring stations in the city reported ‘severe’ air on Saturday. The AQI reading was 435 at Gwalpahari, 403 at Sector 51, 414 at Teri Gram and 409 at Vikas Sadan. “Winds have picked up speed during the daytime with a speed of 6-8 kmph, which has allowed the dispersal of pollutants to some extent and improved visibility. However, the air quality level is likely to remain ‘severe’ or ‘very poor’ due to dip in temperature, increased humidity and slower winds which will prevent dispersal,” the IMD said. The minimum temperature dropped from 13.4 degrees Celsius on Friday to 11.3 degrees on Saturday, while the daytime temperature was at 25.5 degrees, three notches below the season’s normal. Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said they are making “all efforts” to improve air quality. “We implemented precautionary measures from October 1 and now, we have optimitised our efforts and are continuously engaging every stakeholder to mitigate the air pollution. We urge residents not to carry out activities which contribute to pollution such as open burning of waste, and encourage them to opt for carpooling,” an official said. Activists, meanwhile, pointed towards lack of enforcement by government agencies for the rising AQI. “Construction activities and waste burning are going on unabated and polluting industries and DG sets are being run without any checks. As of now, the government has no will to address this emergency situation,” said Abhishek Srivastava, an environmental engineer and a member of Citizens For Clean Air, a residents’ group. Doctors have advised people to avoid outdoor activities. “People who have a history of respiratory diseases need to remain watchful. We should also have a good balanced diet which is rich in protein and avoid outdoor activities during the peak pollution times,” said Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant and head of the department of pulmonology at Paras Hospital. Meanwhile, Delhi continued to be a gas chamber for the second day in a row. Its air quality remained under ‘severe’ category despite a slight improvement towards Saturday noon due to supportive weather conditions and drop in farm fire share in the city’s pollution. The pollution monitoring agencies expect a very slight and temporary relief on Sunday to lower end of ‘severe’ or upper end of ‘very-poor’. According to the weather department, the slight improvement within the severe category on Saturday was a result of increased wind speed. However, the winds are expected to slow down from Sunday evening again, thereby increasing the pollution levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-chokes-on-severe-air-for-second-day-on-the-trot/articleshow/87691634.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Centre's quick nod, Habibganj is now Rani Kamlapati station||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the quick renaming of Habibganj railway station after Rani Kamalapati. The Madhya Pradesh government had sent the proposal on Friday and the nod came in no time. "In childhood, we used to hear 'Taal to Bhopal Taal Baaki Sab Talaiya , Raniyon Mein Rani to Kamalapati Rani Baki Sab Ranaiyya' (Bhopal's lake is the best among lakes, and among queens, Kamlapati is the greatest). Kamala Park has already been developed in her name in Bhopal. Modiji has enhanced the pride and honour of tribes by renaming Habibganj as Rani Kamlapati railway station on the occasion of Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas," the CM said. The redevelopment of the 42-year-old station has come at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore for the first phase. Phase-2 is expected to cost Rs 350 crore. Aimed at meeting global standards, the station is designed to avoid crowding - both on the platforms and the approach roads outside. It has 160 CCTV cameras, along with facial recognition technology. India's first railway station redeveloped through PPP mode will be inaugurated by the PM on Monday. Representatives of the Gond community met the CM to express their joy.. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday wrote a blog on Rani Kamlapati, the Gond queen after whom Habibganj station has been renamed. Going back in history, Chouhan has written how Kamlapati, the daughter of Raja Kirpal Singh Sarautia of the princely state of Salkanpur, Sehore, was "intelligent and courageous" from her childhood and had "mastered education, horse riding, wrestling and archery". "As a skillful Senapati, she fought wars with her father's military and her female team. She kept protecting her kingdom from invaders," the CM writes. She married Nizam Shah, the son of Suraj Singh Shah who reigned over the state of Ginnaurgarh. King Nizam Shah built a seven-storeyed palace in Bhopal as a token of love for Rani Kamalapati in 1700 AD. "Today, its remains can be seen in the park of the Upper and Lower Lake," he writes. "Gond Rani Kamalapati is relevant even today, 300 years later, and we are grateful for being able to honour her for her sacrifice. Every part of Bhopal narrates her story. The echoes of her sacrifice can be heard in the waters of the lakes here," the CM has written, referring to her "Jal Samadhi". It's after her death in 1723 that the rule of Nawabs started in Bhopal, led by Dost Mohammad Khan. "I have had the privilege of installing a grand statue of Rani Kamlapati at her Jauhar site outside her palace. On the occasion of Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, a replica of her statue will be presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modiji," he writes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-centres-quick-nod-habibganj-is-now-rani-kamlapati-station/articleshow/87692925.cms||---

The accused, police said, was part of a larger gang that would similarly target houses in the upscale societies in DLF areas of the city. According to police, the accused would seek work at houses and flee with valuables after a few days. Several items of gold jewellery, including eight bangles, four chains, eight pairs of earrings, eight rings and four pendants, have been recovered from the accused, identified as Laxmi, police said. Eleven silver coins and three locker keys have also been found. The woman was arrested after a complaint was submitted by a resident of Silver Oak Apartment in DLF-1 accusing her domestic help of stealing cash and jewellery worth several lakhs earlier this month. The complainant claimed that the domestic help was hired a few weeks prior to the theft. The accused had managed to avoid sharing her personal details for police verification. A case in the matter was registered at the DLF-1 police station. ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan said police had traced Laxmi’s cousin and asked her to join the probe. “We managed to get the address and other details of the suspect,” the ACP said, adding that a team was sent to West Bengal which arrested herfrom Sonpur village on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/woman-poses-as-domestic-worker-steals-valuables-held/articleshow/87691637.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Eateries, bars in Haryana can operate at 100% capacity||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Saturday allowed restaurants, bars, gyms, spas and club houses to operate at full capacity, provided these commercial establishments followed social distancing norms and other Covid-appropriate behaviour. Cinemas and multiplexes were also permitted to operate at 100% seating capacity. As Covid cases have been on the lower side for the past several weeks now, the government asked residential universities to prepare a schedule for students to return to campuses in phases. The state, however, stopped short of lifting the lockdown and extended it by a fortnight till November 28. Since July this year, single screens and multiplexes had both been running at 50% capacity. Owners welcomed the move, saying it would help them tide over the losses incurred during the two subsequent lockdowns. “We suffered huge losses. In the past year and a half, we had been shut on most days. When we opened, we were told to operate at only 50% capacity. All the shows of the recently released Sooryavanshi were full. Had the decision been announced a week ago, we could have garnered considerable revenue. But we are happy with the government’s decision. We are hoping to make some profits this month as there are a few big movies lined up now. We will follow strict Covid protocols, like we have been doing for so long,” said Sanjay Barjatya, the regional head of Miraj Cinemas. Owners of restaurants, which have been allowed several relaxations in their timings over the past few months, are still waiting for corporate houses to call employees to offices. “In a city like Gurugram, office workers form the major chunk of our customer base. So far, only 10-15% of the corporate crowd have been visiting the eateries near their offices. We have been getting families and local residents and the business is about 70% of what it used to be. Gurugram has a huge corporate base and we are hoping normalcy in terms of attendance will return by this year,” said Gagan Vashisht, the owner of Dhaba 29. For social gatherings, however, the cap stays. In indoor areas, no more than 200 people would be allowed at a time. In open spaces, the number of guests can be up to 500. Despite the reducing numbers, the Gurugram administration warned people against letting their guard down. “The government has been easing restrictions in phases. However, people should continue to stay alert. The wedding season is here, so gatherings will happen. It is extremely important for people to take all precautions while attending such events,” deputy commissioner Yash Garg said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/eateries-bars-can-operate-at-100-capacity/articleshow/87691645.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Rani Kamalapati Railway Station (formerly Habibganj Railway Station) in Bhopal, redeveloped on a PPP model, is set to become India's first railway station to deliver the never-seen-before facilities in the country, officials say. This station revamped on the lines of world-famous Heidelberg Railway Station of Germany, will have airport-like facilities for passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the 'Rani Kamalapati Railway Station' revamped at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore (first phase-station work) on November 15. Rs 350 crore have been earmarked for commercial renovation. The revamped station boasts of a huge parking area that can accommodate 300 cars, 850 two-wheelers, rickshaws, taxis and even buses. The most attractive part of the station is the newly-constructed air-concourse. It is a 84m x 36m central air space, equipped with a modern waiting room, sitting amenities, food stalls and other facilities that are said to avoid congestion on platforms. Air-concourse facility will be available for passengers actually boarding the trains. It has been constructed by dismantling the old foot-over-bridge (FoB). There will be large LED screens for entertainment and multiple delicious cuisine shops in the air-concourse. The air concourse lounge will have a space for 700 passengers at a time.

---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh high court says need to establish if ‘Pahari’ has own script||SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh high court has said directions could not be issued to the state government to declare Pahari as an official language of the state unless it was established on record that Pahari (Himachali) language had its own script and that a common Pahari dialect was spoken throughout the state. The HC said this while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) petition which sought directions for the state government to declare Paharias an official language of the state. The court set the petitioner at liberty to approach the department of language art and culture of Himachal Pradesh, with his demand for undertaking a research to promote a common Pahari (Himachali) nuclear language structure and nuclear Tankri script. A division bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Sabina, in a recent order, said if the petitioner approached the respondents, or the state, through its additional chief secretary (language, art and culture) for the prayer made in his petition, it would be for the said authority to consider the same in accordance with law. This petition was filed with a prayer that the state government be directed to declare Pahari as one of the official languages in Himachal Pradesh in any script and also direct them to promote research towards a longterm formal Pahari (Himachali) nuclear language structure and nuclear Tankri script. It was also prayed that the state government be directed to promote Pahari (Himachali) and other local languages as the medium of instruction in primary and middle-level schools as per the New Education Policy 2020 and to demand the inclusion of Pahari (Himachali) language as a separate category for the 2021 Census and simultaneously undertake an awareness campaign to create awareness amongst the masses, especially the youth of the state who speak Pahari (Himachali), to get it marked as their mother tongue in the upcoming Census. In response to the query pointed out by this court, the counsel for the petitioner did not dispute that dialect of the Pahari spoken in different areas of Himachal Pradesh, differed from area to area. Even Ashok Sharma, advocate general, assisted by additional advocate general Vikas Rathore, submitted that not only the dialects of Pahari language would differ from one district to another district of the state, but even in a single district of the state, in different areas, different dialects of Pahari language were spoken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hc-says-need-to-establish-if-pahari-has-own-script/articleshow/87691549.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Covid-19: Second dose coverage below 50% in 32 districts of Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh government's all out efforts to woo every eligible individual to get vaccinated against Covid-19 notwithstanding, 32 districts of Madhya Pradesh have reported less than 50% second dose vaccinations. The state government has set a target of achieving 100% vaccination of eligible people by the year end. According to state health department records, a total of 5,02,60,585 people have been administered the first dose of vaccine. Of those, 2,51,64,497 or 50% have been fully vaccinated with both the doses. There are 8 districts including Barwani, Singrauli, Alirajpur, Satna, Jhabua, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Sheopur where the second dose vaccination percentage is less than 40%. The lowest is in Barwani where only 36.21% of those who have received the first dose have also received the second dose of the vaccine. Thus, there are a total of 32 districts in the state where the vaccination percentage is less than 50%. Among the districts where there has been better vaccination includes Indore where 67% of those who have received the first dose have also been administered with the second dose, in Jabalpur it is 66%, Ujjain 63%, Bhopal 62% and Datia 61.9%. Sources said that if full vaccination has to be achieved by year end, then drives like the one initiated on November 10, are a must because if average vaccination for past one and half months is seen it is less than 2.5 lakh per day and in a bid to achieve full vaccination by year end, it needs to be above 5.5 lakh per day now. However, vaccination status is likely to improve in coming days as several measures are being taken at both state and district levels to get people to vaccination centres across the state. The state government has roped in the fair price shops to make sure that the message is driven among the public that beneficiaries would be entitled to subsidized ration only if they are fully vaccinated. Similarly, in several districts, the local administration is taking different measures and are urging religious leaders and organisations to spread the message for vaccination. Besides, traders' bodies and hotel associations are being encouraged to allow only fully vaccinated people in for services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-second-dose-coverage-below-50-in-32-districts-of-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/87693028.cms||Amarjeet Singh

I had even offered to arrest. But, they have asked to go,’’ said Jaihind. Notably, Jaihind was booked under sections 420,467,471,120B, 183 and other sections of IPC when he had taken out the Kanwar yatra while wearing the trishul and barcha on his body. Coincidentally, the incident came at the time when Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar was in news for allegedly threatening to behead one of the BJP leaders who had offered him a Farsa during his yatra. Notably, the file of the case had been eating junk for over three years and it was all of a sudden Jaihind was asked to join the investigations. This had made Jaihind active who had been in hibernation, especially after severing his matrimonial ties with DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal. Soon after Jaihind announced to join investigations. AAP Haryana had announced to back him with volunteer joining him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-naveen-jaihind-joins-investigations-in-panipat-let-off-after-questioning/articleshow/87689902.cms||Manveer Saini
---||Ludhiana||BSF to only complement and assist police, says Punjab frontier IG||JALANDHAR: Two days after the Punjab legislative assembly passed a resolution against the Uniojn government’s decision to increase the jurisdiction of BSF from 15 km to 50 km along the international border, BSF inspector general (IG) for Punjab frontier Sonali Mishra said the powers of the state police remain intact and the border force was only there to complement it. In a press conference at BSF Punjab frontier headquarters here, she in the emerging national security threat, the challenges are becoming complex and complicated and drones have become one of the biggest challenges in the last two or three years. In this year so far, BSF troops had sighted 45 drones flying in from Pakistan side. The number of drones sighted in 2019 was 12 drones and 32 in 2020. The Punjab Frontier of the BSF is mandated to guard 553 km of the international border with Pakistan. IPS officer Mishra refused to say anything on the assembly resolution or the statements by Punjab CM and home minster. She said the increase in jurisdiction would only help to quick reaction from BSF whenever required and rest of the work would be done by Punjab Police as was the case so far. From the details given by her it appeared that BSF has been given some powers under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the first time. Since 1969, the force has powers of arrest, search and seizure under the Foreigners Act-1967, the Foreigners Act (Entry into India) Act-1920, the Customs Act, the NDPS Act and the Arms Act, up to 15 from the border. “Now, the central government has issued three notifications on October 11 under provisions of the CrPC, the Passport (Entry into India) Act-1920 and the Passport Act-1967, uniformly extending the jurisdiction of BSF within a belt of 50 km. The territorial jurisdiction of BSF under the NDPS Act-1985, the Arms Act-1959 and the Customs Act-1962 remain the same at 15 km as earlier in Punjab,” she said. “BSF has no policing powers. It does not have powers to register FIR or to carry out investigations. Any seizure or arrets have to be handed over to the state police or other law enforcement agency like NCB. The state police jurisdiction continues to be till border,” she said. About Pakistani drones, she said, their sighting started in 2019 and BSF troops could see and hear their noise and see their blinking lights. “Now, they fly at higher altitudes and sighting or hearing them is becoming difficult,” she said, adding, “anti-drone technological solutions are being worked out.” Asked to respond to Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s comment that if drones were able to fly across the border it was BSF failure, she said she would not respond to any statements but the force was not failing as they had been spotting drones and immediately informing police also. Punjab assembly had dubbed the Centre’s move of extending the BSF's jurisdiction as an “insult” to the state police. The resolution said the decision was an “expression of distrust” towards the state police and the people of Punjab. The Centre had last month amended the BSF Act to authorise the border guarding force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within 50 km from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Mishra said, “The Border Security Force is mandated to guard the border and our main role is to maintain the sanctity of the border, to create a sense of security among the border population and prevent trans-border crimes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bsf-to-compliment-and-assist-state-police-45-drones-sighted-in-this-year-says-bsf-punjab-frontier-ig/articleshow/87689744.cms||I P Singh

The value of the rupee is touching a record low. The BJP should not worry about 2024 (general elections) but answer people’s questions in 2022 (assembly elections),” the SP chief said while addressing people during his Vijay Rath Yatra near Koni Chauraha in the city. Yadav alleged that the BJP government is selling state’s institutes. “If the government sells all the institutes, the youth would be left with no jobs. Earlier, the BJP government was a ‘pheku sarkar’ (government that made false promises), but has now become a ‘bechu sarkar’ (government that sells),” Yadav said, claiming that the “BJP government is going and no one could stop it.” The SP chief also took up the issue of rising fuel prices. He claimed, “In three months, the profit of the oil companies went up 600 times. The BJP should tell people where the profit is going. It is burning a hole in the pocket of the poor and filling the pockets of the rich.” He also criticised the government for “not helping the labourers and the poor during the Covid-19 lockdown”. Speaking on farm laws, Akhilesh said, “The farmers are protesting for the last many months, but the government is not listening to them , instead it is crushing their protest. Protests are a way of making the government listen in a democracy, but this government is silencing their voice. It has insulted the farmers and will take their land.” The SP chief also ridiculed Chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “Baba ji (Yogi) laptop chalana nahi jante, isliye laptop nahin de rahe (He is not distributing laptops among the students because he can’t operate one himself),” Yadav said. Claiming of initiating various schemes during his government, Yadav said people of Gorakhpur are waiting to see development. “People of Azamgarh know who has done development work. Development has stopped in Gorakhpur during the BJP regime. Boats sailed on roads here. The BJP even deceived the Nishad community, the people who row boats. Now, the people of Gorakhpur will bring down the fever of arrogance of the BJP.” Watch Our support can turn the tables in UP polls 2022, says SBSP chief OP Rajbhar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-shouldnt-worry-about-2024-answer-peoples-queries-in-2022-says-akhilesh-yadav/articleshow/87689671.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Joint inspection of Panje wetland by Raigad officials and greens on Tuesday||NAVI MUMBAI: A joint inspection of Panje wetland will take place next Tuesday by the Raigad district officials and local citizen groups. The team will visit Panje in Uran to check and resolve certain pending issues such as the tidal choke points and a recent fire incident at the site. The Raigad district collector had recently stated to the National Green Tribunal that all the choke points and sluice gates at Panje have been reopened; but this has been contested by the greens. Hence, the joint inspection will also see if any choke points are still shut, and thereby try to resolve it. NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have been raising concern over the attempts to ``sabotage'' the wetland, rendering it dry to suit the needs of vested interests planning to convert the biodiversity property into a concrete jungle. ``It is important to protect the wetland not from an environmental point of view but from the safety angle of flights to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport,'' NatConnect informed the state chief minister, by quoting BNHS study reports. The revenue sub-divisional officer (SDO) Rahul Mundake said he would personally look into the environmental concerns and report to the district collector. “We appreciate this positive attitude, to carry out the joint inspection,” said NatConnect director BN Kumar and expressed the hope that this would lead to the protection and conservation of the wetland. Following NatConnect’s series of complaints to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the official team got into action with Raigad collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar asking his officials to check the ground realities. Some reportedly miscreants set fire to dry grass at the Panje Wetland earlier this week apparently to chase away hundreds of migratory birds. Earlier, two miscreants had exploded fire crackers making the birds fly helter-skelter. The forest department has served notices to concerned parties and the investigation is still incomplete. The culprits’ action was video-recorded from a distance. Kumar has requested Thackeray to scrap the lease deal done by Cidco allotting the wetland to Navi Mumbai SEZ and the CM asked the urban development to check this. “This is important to save the wetland as time is running out,” he said. Studies after studies by BNHS have clearly cautioned that the thousands of birds might fill up the skies if they miss their destinations - the wetlands that they are used to - and pose threat to the flights. NatConnect has also drawn the attention of the fresh fire incident to the High Court appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee. “These non-stop attempts to sabotage the wetland are alarming,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan. ``The authorities have been lethargic in implementing the Environment department’s orders, and also the NGT directive. This really a serious matter,” Pawar said. Recording the complaints from Shri Ekvira Aai Prartishtan and NatConnect Foundation, the collector has informed the NGT that now there is no blockage of water. The 70 sluice gates adjoining the wetland have also been lifted, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-joint-inspection-of-panje-wetland-by-raigad-officials-and-greens-on-tuesday/articleshow/87689635.cms||Vijay Singh
---||India||India strongly objects to coal and fossil fuel subsidies' phase-out references in Glasgow text as COP26 enters final hours||GLASGOW: As new draft text of the Glasgow (COP26) decision on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies created deep anguish among countries where fossil fuel use continues to be the mainstay of their economy and welfare measures, India on Saturday strongly opposed to the reference in the text asking the conference Presidency how can anyone expect that the developing countries make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they have still to deal with development agenda and poverty eradication. Highlighting gaps in issues of sections relating to finance and mitigation, the country said the Glasgow cover decision text lacks the balance and the consensus "remains elusive", saying those concerns must be addressed in the final decision -- hinting at a tough road ahead for compromise. "Fossil fuels and their use have enabled the path for the world to attain a high level of wealth and well being. The UNFCCC refers to the mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources. It has not been directed to any particular source. When we have taken the economy-wise targets, targeting any particular sector is uncalled for," said India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav. Yadav, while making an intervention during an informal stocktaking plenary by the UK COP26 president Alok Sharma, said, "Every country will arrive at 'net zero' as per their own national circumstances, strength and weaknesses. Developing countries have rights to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope". Underlining that the developing countries have to deal with their national development agenda and poverty eradication, the minister said the fossil fuel subsidies "provides much needed social security and support towards this end" and he cited India's example where the government under 'Ujjwala' scheme provides subsidised gas cylinders to poor households. He said, "We are giving subsidies to use LPG to low-income households. These subsidies have been a great help in almost eliminating biomass burning for cooking and improved health from the reduction in indoor air pollution." The minister's remarks come in view of a full paragraph on coal and fossil fuels in the text which the European Union and many other countries have been pitching for being included in the final decision. The text in the current form, released on Saturday morning after the Conference overstepped its schedule time of conclusion, calls upon countries "to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support towards a just transition." Though Yadav appreciated the COP26 presidency for making efforts to build consensus, he said, "I am afraid the consensus, however, remains elusive. India stands ready for constructive debate and equitable and just solution in this forum" and highlighted in his intervention the points on finance and the mitigation centric approach of the text. Clearly calling out affluent nations on their resistance to any monitoring mechanism on finance where they are supposed to contribute $100 billion per year for supporting developing countries, Yadav said, "Mitigation (emission cut) sections include annual minister-level roundtables, annual NDC synthesis reports and new long-term synthesis reports. It also requests for revisiting NDCs in 2022.. and work programmes for enhanced mitigation ambition in 2030 and so on. None of the same urgency in convening high-level meetings or commissioning annual reports or progress in meeting the financial needs is mentioned in the finance part." Referring to such references in the text, he said, "Covered decision should not overwrite or introduce extraneous elements in the Paris Agreement process that is already well established and agreed to. There is a well-defined cycle for the submission of NDCs. There is no need to deviate from it. We need to respect the (Paris) agreement and not overwrite it through the 'cover decisions' of the supreme bodies. These clear concerns in the cover decision must be addressed" The minister also narrated how India has been consistently focussing on clean power generation and energy efficiency and been not only aligned with those suggestions and references but also has taken initiatives such as International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the 'One Sun One World One Grid' (OSOWOG) initiative. "For the world, India proactively created ISA, CDRI (Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure) and OSOWOG initiatives as examples of international collaboration to combat climate change. We are walking the talk. We must see concrete action in this decisive decade and translation of commitment to action." He also said climate-friendly lifestyles and climate justice are enshrined in the Paris Agreement and these are the key to solving the climate crisis. Referring to the historical responsibility of affluent nations who emitted substantially in the past and indulged in overconsumption, Yadav said, "The (climate) crisis is caused by an unsustainable lifestyle and wasteful consumption pattern. The world needs to awaken to this reality."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-strongly-objects-to-coal-and-fossil-fuel-subsidies-phase-out-references-in-glasgow-text-as-cop26-enters-final-hours/articleshow/87690691.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Mehbooba asserted that the real Sanatan Dharma doesn't teach communalism and accused RSS-BJP combine of hijacking Hinduism and Hindutva, and making people fight against each other all over the country. “Those who make Hindus and Muslims fight in the name of religion can be compared with ISIS or any other (terror group) because both of them kill people in the name of religion," Mehbooba said. Referring to 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family, as taught by Hindu scriptures), she said: “Sanatan Dharma teaches us that the world is one family. What BJP and RSS are trying to teach us is neither Hindutva nor Hinduism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehbooba-mufti-backs-khurshids-hindutva-stance-in-new-book/articleshow/87690834.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Delhi||With COVID cases consistently low, the big fat wedding returns to NCR||From venues to caterers and bandwallahs, everyone says they have been double booked for the first time in two yearsEver since the pandemic hit, one of the major changes in our society has been the way we organise and approach weddings. Due to social distancing demands and restrictions on public gatherings, the big fat Indian weddings we were used to gave way to smaller, intimate dos, sometimes even at the houses of the groom or bride. This is all set to change this month. November 14-15 is the first saaya – the traditional auspicious date considered good for Hindu weddings – of this wedding season. Wedding industry insiders estimate that there will be over 20,000 weddings in Delhi-NCR alone over the two auspicious days, and a further one lakh over the next one month. This has finally brought some cheer to the beleaguered wedding industry in the capital. From venues to caterers and  bandwallahs, everyone says they have been double booked for the first time in two years. Manish Singh, who operates three wedding venues in Gurgaon, says, “The numbers of bookings are almost back to the same level as it was before the pandemic. Of course, with COVID-19 restrictions and protocols in place, our operating costs are a bit higher but it is still a welcome trend.” The increase in the number of weddings this season is also partly due to many people postponing their weddings earlier due to COVID-19. Akshay Rajput, a wedding planner, says, “In the last one-and-a-half year, a lot of people postponed their wedding due to lockdowns, restrictions and the second wave. They see this season as a good opportunity and don’t want to wait further. COVID-19 can be unpredictable, so people are taking advantage of cases being low right now.” Many, whose plans were on halt for months, have now decided to get married at the first available instance, which happens to be the first saaya. “Many people who had booked earlier in the year but cancelled when the second wave hit are also re-booking now. November14-15 this year is busier than some of the pre-pandemic years,” says Ranjit Kapoor, who looks after wedding decoration and catering services in multiple wedding venues in Gurgaon. Wedding Bands in NCR say they are fully bookedDuring all of last year and much of this year post the second wave, bands were absent in baraats because of rules and people’s unwillingness to spend on them for smaller weddings. But now, bands say they are fully booked for the season. Ashish Nassa of the Haryana Band Association says, “For November 14, many bands in Gurgaon have two-three bookings. This is very different from last year when we hardly had any work.” While there is still a cap on the number of guests at wedding functions in NCR, venue owners and wedding planners say the hosts are not limiting the scale of celebrations anymore. “It’s not as if there were no weddings last year but the numbers were down drastically. This year, even if people are limiting guest numbers, they are not compromising on the scale of the wedding. The bands are back for the baraats, even live music and other things are being requested,” says Ashish, a wedding planner. ‘This is the first time since the pandemic that an auspicious day has low COVID cases’The eleventh day after Diwali – known as the Dev Uthavani Ekadashi – is considered auspicious for weddings and other ceremonies, as per the Hindu calendar. It traditionally marks the beginning of the wedding season. This year, the date marks the first time in almost two years when such a saaya is coinciding with very few active cases and eased COVID-19 restrictions in Delhi-NCR. Sunil Singh, who operates wedding venues in south Delhi, tells us, “People in Delhi wait for saayas and mahurats. This is the first time since the pandemic that an auspicious day has relatively fewer active cases and very little restrictions. So, there is a huge rush for bookings. The first  saaya – November 14-15 – is particularly busy. Most people made their bookings months in advance.” Limits and guidelines for weddings in NCR Delhi: In October-end, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) increased the number of people allowed at weddings from 100 to 200.  Gurgaon: A gathering of only 50% of the venue capacity with a cap of gathering of 100 people in indoor spaces and 200 people in open area venues is allowed. This is for all social gatherings, including weddings. Noida: The cap is at 100 guests for both indoor and outdoor spaces. Many expect further relaxations from November 15 onwards.  In all three cities, venues have been asked to ensure sanitisation, thermal screening and adherence of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Most venues like lawns, banquet halls and farmhouses in the city say that they have made arrangements to comply with the administration’s guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-covid-cases-consistently-low-the-big-fat-wedding-returns-to-ncr/articleshow/87691255.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

The change from ‘phase-out’ to ‘phase-down was agreed upon during the last-minute change to build the consensus. India forced the Presidency to change the para by including points even on national circumstances in the para on coal and fossil fuel even as Switzerland and EU objected to it and then reluctantly agreed. Besides including a decision for the first time on accelerated ‘phasing down of unabated coal power and ‘phasing-out of “inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies in the final outcome, the Conference also agreed to further boost 2030 climate targets by next year and double adaptation finance by 2025.

Coupled with the “increasing inflow” of illegal Chinese-made weapons like AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns, anti-tank mines and grenades into Myanmar, which are also making their way to Indian insurgent groups with hideouts along the border, the ambush set alarms bells clanging in the Indian security establishment here.

Col Tripathi’s convoy was ambushed while returning to the battalion headquarters at Khuga on Saturday morning. “Along with advance reconnaissance for the ambush, the insurgents must have kept a close watch on the convoy’s movement. There was first an IED blast and then heavy gunfire from different directions at the convoy,” said the official. With the internal security situation improving in Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya and large parts of Assam over the last few years, the Army has gradually de-inducted over 14 infantry battalions, along with two division headquarters, from counter-insurgency operations to focus on the Line of Actual Control with China in the eastern sector. The counter-insurgency operations in these areas have been taken over by the Assam Rifles, which is under the Army’s operational control but administratively comes under the ministry of home affairs. The paramilitary force guards the border with Myanmar as well as undertakes counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with the Army.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipur-terror-attack-well-planned-precision-strike/articleshow/87691436.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||India||Army Colonel, his wife, son, 4 personnel killed in Manipur ambush||GUWAHATI: Militants of the banned People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Manipur Naga People’s Front (MNPF) on Saturday jointly carried out the deadliest ambush in the northeast in six years, killing an Army Colonel officiating as the commanding officer of 46 Assam Rifles, his wife and their six-year-old son along with four personnel of the paramilitary force near the India-Myanmar border in Churachandpur district. Col Viplav Tripathi’s convoy, comprising a quick-reaction team of the Assam Rifles, was passing by Sehken village in Singngat subdivision around 10.30am when an IED blast set them up for a volley of indiscriminate firing from the forested hillside that not only felled the Army officer from Chhattisgarh's Raigarh but also his wife Anuja and their son Abir. The four other Assam Rifles personnel killed in the ambush were identified as Suman Swargiari, Khatnei Konyak, RP Meena and Shyamal Das. Four personnel in the convoy were critically injured. "The blast was targeted at the CO’s vehicle and then the firing started. It was sudden and ferocious," a defence source said. PLA and MNPF issued a statement late in the evening claiming responsibility for the killings. The last such ambush on security forces in the militancy-ravaged region had also taken place in Manipur in 2015, when 18 soldiers were killed in Chandel district. Col Tripathi, on deputation from the Army's Kumaon Regiment, was returning along with his family to Churachandpur from a forward post at Behiang on the India-Myanmar border. He had attended a civic programme there on Friday. Behiang is about 120km from the state capital of Imphal. Churachandpur is the southern extension of the Manipur valley, with the ambush site having ample cover for the attackers to fire at the approaching convoy from camouflaged positions. The thinly populated area is mostly inhabited by the Zomi tribe. "Strongly condemn the attack on the Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur. I pay homage to those soldiers and family members who have been martyred today. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of sadness," PM Narendra Modi tweeted. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, took to Twitter to condemn the "cowardly attack" and term the deaths "extremely painful & condemnable". "The nation has lost 5 brave soldiers including CO 46 AR and two family members. My condolences to the bereaved families. The perpetrators will be brought to justice soon," he wrote. Sources said Col Tripathi’s convoy was possibly targeted because he had recently intensified patrolling of the area, making it harder for militants based in neighbouring Myanmar to move to and from the state. Another theory is that Manipur outfits are rattled by the state government's plan to develop the Imphal-Behiang road that is the state's link with Southeast Asia in preparation for a second border trading point like Moreh. According to the Assam Rifles, Col Tripathi had a successful stint in Mizoram before he was transferred to Manipur about four months ago. A defence source said Army Chief Gen M M Naravane had been briefed about the attack and operations launched in the area to trace the attackers. A close watch is being kept on the Myanmar border to prevent them from escaping into that country. The Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force under the MHA, operates along the long porous India-Myanmar border in the hill ranges of Chandel, Ukhrul, and Churachandpur districts under the supervision of the inspector general (south), based in the Imphal headquarters. Manipur is due to go to the polls early next year. CM Biren Singh tweeted, "Strongly condemn the cowardly attack on a convoy of 46 AR which has reportedly killed few personnel including the CO & his family at CCpur today. The state forces & paramilitary are already on their job to track down the militants. The perpetrators will be brought to justice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-colonel-his-wife-son-4-personnel-killed-in-manipur-ambush/articleshow/87691512.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||India||Government concerned over crypto use for laundering, terror||NEW DELHI: The government is looking at “forward looking and progressive” regulation of cryptocurrency with government sources making it clear that an unregulated market for digital currency cannot be allowed to become avenues for money laundering and terror financing. Following a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi on Saturday, it emerged there was a strong view that attempts to mislead the youth through non-transparent advertising, that “over-promises”, needed to be stopped. While the government and the RBI have been discussing legislation for several months now, there has been a spurt in interest in cryptocurrency with many individuals, including senior citizens investing in private digital currencies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently maintained the need to ban private digital currency. The PM’s meeting comes in the backdrop of expectations that the government may soon pilot a Bill, something it had planned during the Budget session to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India”. Following the meeting, official sources said, the government will keep a close watch and take proactive steps as it was cognisant of the fact this is an evolving technology. While looking to engage with experts and other stakeholders, those who attended the meeting were also of the view that regulation will require global partnerships and collective strategies. The sources said that the PM held a comprehensive meeting on the way forward for cryptocurrency and related issues. This followed a consultative process as the RBI, finance ministry and the home ministry had carried out an elaborate exercise on the issues and consulted experts from across the country and the world. Global examples and best practices were also looked at. In 2019, the government had appointed an inter-ministerial panel headed by then economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg which had backed a ban on private cryptocurrencies. Since then there has been intense discussions on the issue while the sector has lobbied hard to prevent a complete ban. Earlier this year, the RBI had conveyed its decision to seek a ban on such instruments after having already expressed its serious concerns. While asserting that the technology of blockchain should be encouraged, the central bank has questioned the purpose of cryptocurrencies to be labelled as a currency. It has said that a currency is a sovereign right and cannot be assigned to any individual entity. The issue of these instruments being legal is also yet to be settled. Besides, there are concerns about volatility in their price apart from their impact on the economy. The central bank has also raised security risks linked to cryptocurrencies, saying it could give rise to money laundering and terror financing because of the anonymity of the transactions. The RBI has also pointed to the dangers to macroeconomic management if these instruments are allowed as they would pose “serious risks” to the financial system of the country. Earlier this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told a TV channel that not all windows for cryptocurrencies will be shut down and a cabinet note was being readied to formulate the next steps on the issue.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a high-level emergency meeting at Delhi secretariat on Saturday evening and announced a series of week-long measures to check the worsening air quality. All schools, colleges, and educational institutions will be closed for a week from Monday, all construction activities will be banned for three days from Sunday and all government offices, excluding those engaged in emergency services, will switch to work-from-home mode while private offices have also been advised to opt for work from home. The measures may be extended if the capital continues to be in an air emergency. While schools will be closed, virtual classes will continue so that the students do not suffer any further learning loss. Physical classes in schools had resumed only earlier this month after nearly a year-and-a-half due to the Covid pandemic. 'This is becoming a nightmare': Smog engulfs Delhi-NCR, pollution board issues advisoryAbout the possibility of Delhi going into another lockdown, CM said the government was working on a “lockdown proposal” but it would be implemented only after taking into account all the aspects of such an extreme step. “We are not imposing a lockdown at this moment, as assessing the impact of such a move first is paramount. We are drafting a proposal about this prospect and will place it in the court in the next hearing. This will be the most extreme step, if it is taken, so all agencies concerned will be consulted at length. The Centre, along with the CPCB and SAFAR, will be taken into confidence prior to such a decision. If a lockdown-like situation comes into place, then all vehicular, industrial and construction activity may be shut. This is still in the proposal stage and would be placed in front of the court first,” Kejriwal said.

The SC made the observations while hearing a case in this matter.

Virtual classes would continue for students in the meantime. This measure would particularly protect children from inhaling toxic air while outside the confines of their homes,” Kejriwal said, adding that the government wants to overcome the emergency-like situation that has fallen upon Delhi due to rising pollution. “Our goal at this moment is to protect this family of the two crore Delhi residents, especially our children, who need utmost care and prevention right now,” CM said. A view of the Supreme Court of India, shrouded in smog, in New Delhi on Saturday (Photo: PTI)CM said that a three-day construction ban was necessary because the weather forecast has indicated the situation during this period will be worse than the present situation. “Winds are not really being expected during the 14-17, and we all know that stubble burning pollution would, in any case, penetrate into Delhi, creating a fatal situation. Thus, we have taken the hard step of having to pull the plug on construction activities for now,” CM said. #Delhi | Air Quality Index (AQI) at 499 (overall) in the 'severe' category, as per SAFAR-India(Visuals from Conna… https://t.co/PsXooJHNkm— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1636788092000Kerjriwal said, “All Delhi government offices will function in a work-from-home manner for a week. All the government offices will be shut, but it is important to state that it is not a holiday. The entire workforce will continue to work remotely for this week. The officers will have to be available in the situation of an emergency call. An advisory on similar lines would be issued for the private offices to work from home as much as they can.” The CM stated that the pollution levels had significantly risen in the past few days. “The data clearly states that the air was not as polluted in Delhi before September 30 and was within the ‘satisfactory’ level, even on the bad days. Until then, the AQI was around 100, but since then, the AQI has been steeply rising. This is taking place primarily because farmers in our neighbouring states have been forced into a situation where they had to helplessly burn their stubble. However, the Delhi government does not intend to waste crucial time in this situation by entering into a blame game,” Kejriwal stated, adding that the sole motive of the Delhi government at this juncture was to overcome the air emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-schools-shut-for-a-week-construction-ban-for-3-days/articleshow/87691681.cms||Alok KN Mishra
---||World||Pakistan’s ISI backing small jihadi outfits in Afghanistan to hinder Taliban, says report||NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s ISI is sponsoring and putting together an alliance of smaller jihadi groups in Afghanistan, distinct from the Taliban and the ISKP, according to a new report. These new jehadists are distinguished by their even more extreme ideology and apparently undermine the Taliban. A new report in Foreign Policy says the Islamic Invitation Alliance (IIA) has been funded by the ISI and was created in 2020, and has been on the radar of US intelligence for over a year. At the time, the idea was to ensure the Taliban’s victory. But now, this alliance is apparently being used to undermine the Taliban. Read AlsoIslamic State violence dents Taliban claims of safer AfghanistanThe Islamic State violence has fuelled fears that Afghanistan could collapse into anarchy and even return to a new phase of civil war, creating a haven for militant groups to launch attacks in neighbouring countries and the West.The intensification of internal factional fights within the Taliban may be coming to a head in the coming weeks as per assessment shared by the group of national security czars who were in Delhi this week for the NSAs’ dialogue. Most of the discussions were behind closed doors but the group reached some key understandings on the evolving situation in Afghanistan. In fact, the seriousness of the situation is believed to be much more grave than is being publicly reported or acknowledged.

Despite many of the participants remaining engaged with the Taliban, there is little trust in the regime at present. “There was a consensus that the Taliban would have to gain internal legitimacy first before external recognition,” said a participant. It's unlikely that would happen peacefully. There is an expectation of a power struggle between the Doha group led by Mullah Baradar and the more extreme Haqqani group — one perceived to be close to the US and the other considered to be close to Pakistan. The top concerns shared by the NSAs were first, refugee flows from Afghanistan, which could export the Taliban ideologies into their countries as well as rampant proliferation of weapons left behind after the US withdrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/isi-backing-small-jihadi-outfits-in-afghanistan-to-hinder-taliban-says-report/articleshow/87691765.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Four commandos suffered gunshot wounds. Sources said that Milind Teltumbde, a central committee (CC) member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) in charge of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh zones, had also been killed in the gunfight. Teltumbde was considered a pioneer of the concept of “urban Maoism”. Sources also claimed that divisional committee members (DVC) Shuklal Parcheki and Prabhakar of the Maoists’ Company No. 4 formation were among the ones slain. Between April 22 and 24, 2018, commandos had gunned down 37 Naxalites, including 19 women. Saturday’s encounter is the second-biggest in terms of slain Naxals. “The number could be higher and among those killed could be some women too,” Gadchiroli SP Ankit Goyal said. The CC is the apex body of the rebel movement in which Teltumbde occupied a top post as far as the Maoist movement in central India is concerned. Observers say Saturday’s encounter was a big blow to the three-decade-old Naxalite movement. Sources said Teltumbde was being escorted to the Maharashtra border by the Chhattisgarh-based Vistar “dalam” and was received by Korchi dalam members and Company No. 4. “There were at least 40-45 Naxalites camping at the site,” they added. Around 16 C60 teams cordoned off the camp. The commandos formed layers and attacked. Maoist sentries opened fire and the C60 retaliated. Outnumbered, the Maoists tried to flee into Chhattisgarh but were trapped as their escape routes had been plugged by the commandos. The injured jawans were first brought to Dhanora and then airlifted to Nagpur where they are being treated at a private hospital. “All four are stable but two jawans have critical injuries,” said Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital and Research Institute. Goyal said the bodies need to be identified “following standard operating procedures”. “We have heard that Teltumbde is dead but the information is yet to be confirmed as the jawans are yet to return,” he said. Once the bodies are brought to the district headquarters, surrendered Naxalites will be called in to identify the corpses. It is learnt that the encounter started at 6.30am and went on till 4.30pm. When it ended, the commandos launched search operations in the forest as the Maoists are known to take away their dead and injured to nearby villages. Sources said this could not continue for long as darkness had set in. Early reports said a large quantity of arms and ammunition was seized after the encounter, considered one of the longest in the history of the state’s fight against Maoist insurgency. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil congratulated the Gadchiroli police in a tweet. Naxal range DIG Sandip Patil, who is also in charge of state anti-Naxal operations, couldn’t go to Gadchiroli as the state government had rushed him to Amravati city to tackle the law and order situation that arose there on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/26-maoists-gunned-down-by-cops-in-10-hour-operation-near-maharashtra-chhattisgarh-border/articleshow/87691824.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Bengaluru||Hacker misled us, no bitcoins seized: Bengaluru cops||BENGALURU: Under fire for the way it has handled the alleged bitcoin scam, Bengaluru city police on Saturday admitted to being taken for a ride by hacker Srikrishna alias Sriki while recovering stolen bitcoins from him. The U-turn comes 11 months after joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil announced they had seized 31 bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore from Sriki, who had allegedly hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, online gaming sites and the state e-procurement portal. Patil had told media that “we opened a new account and transferred the 31 bitcoins to that account”. But on Saturday, the police said though a government order was obtained to transfer the bitcoins, they were not touched. “The account, claimed by accused Srikrishna as his, was actually a live wallet and he did not have a key to it.” Account opened for investigation: CopsSriki was first arrested by city police on November 18, 2020 in connection with a drug trafficking case. With opposition parties training their guns at chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as the hacking-related arrests and seizures happened when he was home minister, city police on Saturday issued a statement describing how they were outsmarted. The statement read: “Neither any bitcoins were transferred from the account of hacker Srikrishna nor any bitcoin was lost. For the purpose of investigation of cryptocurrency, it was felt necessary to open a bitcoin account. Accordingly, the government order (dated December 8, 2020) to open bitcoin account was obtained. During the process of identifying and seizure of bitcoins, accused Srikrishna showed a BTC (bitcoin) wallet, which contained 31.8 bitcoins. The wallet password was changed in the presence of cyber experts and government panchas (witnesses), and entire procedure was recorded under mahzer and submitted to the court. The court’s permission was obtained to use the password to transfer the said bitcoins to the police wallet account. On reaching the said wallet shown by the accused Srikrishna, it showed 186.811 bitcoins. Cyber experts opined the account, claimed by Srikrishna as his personal account, was actually a live wallet of an exchange and he did not have a private key for this. Hence, the said account was left untouched and, as a result, no bitcoins were transferred to police wallet.” ‘FSL tests showed no traces of drugs’ Countering Congress’ allegations that ‘mind-altering drugs’ were administered to Sriki, city police said he tested negative for drug consumption during the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) tests conducted during his custody with the Central Crime Branch in January. Sriki’s father had earlier approached the court with similar accusations and the Ist Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court had directed cops to conduct a test . The blood and urine samples were taken on January 13. The FSL dispatched the report on May 3, stating no drugs were found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hacker-misled-us-no-bitcoins-seized-cops/articleshow/87691877.cms||---

Tomatoes, which were available for Rs 30 per kg a fortnight ago, now cost Rs 80. Their supply to Bengaluru is from Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara and Chikkaballapur, but tomato-growing areas in these districts have been witnessing heavy rain. While the produce is beginning to rot on fields because of excess water, what has compounded the problem is non-availability of labourers to work during rain, farmers said. The retail price of beans has increased from Rs 40 a kg to Rs 80, while that of brinjal from Rs 30 a kg to Rs 90 in the past week. The likes of KR Market, Malleswaram, KR Puram, Yeshwantpur and Gandhi Bazaar are barely finding customers because of exorbitant prices. BL Shankarappa, president of APMC Varthakara Sangha, said, “We are getting only half the actual produce. This is the primary reason for increasing prices. This is usual during monsoon, but we have crossed that period. Frequent cyclones are affecting the market.” Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur, Tamil Nadu, Salem and Ballari are among the places from where Bengaluru gets most greens. Ramesh Babu, a vendor from Gandhi Bazaar, told TOI, “There are veggies in markets but we can’t purchase them because of high price. A quintal of tomato costs Rs 6,000, when earlier it was Rs 2,000.” With the impact of the pandemic reducing in recent times, weddings and festive occasions have become more frequent, and with it the purchase of bulk vegetables has gone up, said T Vanajakshi, a vegetable and flower vendor at Gandhi Bazaar. “When vegetables are purchased in large quantities, prices generally go up and the common man has to bear the brunt of that,” she said. Supriya Soman, a resident of Chickpet, said it is best to grow vegetables in one’s own terrace garden. “Growing vegetables in your home works out cheaper considering these fluctuating costs,” she felt. Malini Prathap of Malleswaram said she would wait for a week before going out to buy vegetables. “It is better to buy after a week rather than spending thousands of rupees now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rain-pushes-up-veggie-prices/articleshow/87691880.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Shah Rukh Khan—Women’s quest for independence, escape from patriarchy||BENGALURU: What’s common between women agarbatti workers of Ahmedabad, a young girl from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, in-flight attendant from Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer and swish ‘girls in pearls who lunch’ of Jor Bagh, Delhi? Long answer: Their search for financial empowerment and escape from stifling patriarchy. Short answer: Bollywood heartthrob Shah Rukh Khan. How does a Bollywood star fit in the equation? Shrayana Bhattacharya, economist with the World Bank and an author with extensive work spread over 15 years to her credit, says love for an icon like Shah Rukh Khan was the common thread that inspired many to share with her their economic struggles, expectations from men, and strife with the patriarchal system when she tried to collect data on wages and women’s participation in the job market as a young research assistant.  Shrayana BhattacharyaBhattacharya said women across the country related to Khan in diverse ways – from looking at him as a masculine ideal, to providing escape and comfort from daily struggles. “The project was with agarbatti workers and I had designed a questionnaire. But when I asked questions, they stared blankly at me,” she recalls. Those women were in fact fighting for their labour rights and were aware of their realities, but did not want an outside researcher to come and tell them what they already knew. Keeping aside her formal questions, Bhattacharya slipped into a ‘survey recess’ and began chatting with them. Soon enough, their talks veered into a discussion on their favourite actors and a man most women seemed to adore – from rural Uttar Pradesh to the tribes of Jharkhand – Shah Rukh Khan. Suddenly, the tone changed, opening up conversations that revealed how even fandom is economic, she says. “The women told me how none of them had watched a film of Khan. They knew of him from snippets of his interviews, songs, etc. They neither had the money nor the leisure to watch his movie. According to the National Family Health Survey, only 8 percent of women in India watch a film every month,” she says, adding conversations around Khan offered a sneak peak at their economic struggles too. It also helped in finding paths to discuss the idea of masculinity and women’s idea of an ideal man. “Women in rural UP complained that men around them are like Salman Khan and they preferred Shah Rukh Khan,” Bhattacharya says, adding that in addition to the crisis of a job, women faced a crisis of love and they wished men in their lives spoke to them as Khan does. “The word that they kept repeating was ‘Tameez’ (mannered).” “When women step outside their home and do what society prefers them to not do, they face isolation. They are lonely in the workforce and also in the kitchen,” she says. India, along with South Korea and Pakistan, is in the bottom-five list globally in women getting help from men in doing household chores, she adds. Author Manu Pillai who was in conversation with Bhattacharaya at an event at Bangalore International Centre, says: “Women who manage to get out of home, work and occupy space in economic areas juggle dignity, deadlines and dishes.” Khan’s imagery of helping women in the kitchen or even his wife off screen makes him widely popular, he adds. Bhattacharya is sure that for the current generation the Shah Rukh-equivalent would be a woman. “They no longer want a Shah Rukh in their lives. They want to be him with his opportunities, earning capacity and potential. Increasingly, the women today look at a Priyanka Chopra or a Deepika Padukone,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/srkwomens-quest-for-independence-escape-from-patriarchy/articleshow/87691882.cms||Farheen Hussain

---||Bengaluru||‘Ward panels must handle more than basic issues’||Bengaluru: Lalitha Mohan from Radhakrishna Temple ward is disappointed that ward committee meetings have become grievance-redressal platforms. “They are used for firefighting basic issues. Things need to move to the next level. Awareness about ward committees is limited to WhatsApp groups now,” she said.Lalitha was one of 400 citizens who attended a Janaagraha workshop on Saturday and shared their views on ward committee meetings held in the city.Wards are supposed to conduct two meetings a month (on the first and third Saturdays) at 10am at the ward committee office. Over 4,219 meetings were held across 198 wards in the past year. Janaagraha, a city-based NGO, had undertaken a study to evaluate how Bengaluru’s ward committees performed between August 1, 2020, and September 4, 2021. The key insights were revealed at the workshop. (See box)Kochu Shankar from Ramamurthy Nagar said in his ward, the meetings were mainly for grievance redressal in pre-pandemic times. But after that, the meetings helped citizens bond and communicate with BBMP. “The bonding got better with vaccination drives, humanitarian assistance and other problem-solving activities,” Shankar said.However, Savita from RR Nagar said their meetings were not even good enough for grievance redressal. At the beginning, they were at least compulsory but now the problems remain unsolved, she said.Ramamani, deputy commissioner (IT), BBMP, and nodal officer of Gottigere ward, credited the active participation of resident welfare associations and citizen groups for making ward committee meetings effective. She said meetings should be held regularly and before each one, an agenda should be drawn up.Thulasi Maddineni, special commissioner (finance), said, “BBMP allotted Rs 60 lakh to each ward committee in Bengaluru. This is not a big amount, but it is a start. If we see success, we can work towards increasing funds,” Maddineni said, adding that the money is for three core areas – fixing potholes, borewells and footpaths. “Janaagraha has conducted a walkability index and we are working towards repairing footpaths. I request all citizens to partake in ward committee meetings,” Maddineni said.Srinivas Alavilli, head of civic participation at Janaagraha, said to revive non-functional ward committees, likeminded citizens and civic groups must be identified, groups on WhatsApp formed for interaction and social media activity increased, while citizens should meet nodal officers in groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ward-panels-must-handle-more-than-basic-issues/articleshow/87691889.cms||---

Yogesh Kumar of Kamakshipalya, is a travel agency owner. The theft occurred on October 3 when the complainant, P Aravind of Lingadeeranahalli, a businessman, had gone out with his family. “We found that one of the keys of the front door had gone missing a few months ago. Yogesh had frequented Aravind’s house during that period. We caught Yogesh on CCTV footage of a neighbouring area.

The accused, Aryan Khan, is from Sakleshpur and lives in Kattigenahalli, near Yelahanka. KG Halli police said they detained Khan when he was trying to sell antiques behind the BDA Complex at KG Halli. Among the seized items were an elephant paw, a book, milk jug, teapot, Bhutanese showpiece, Irish tea maker, sugar pot, small milk jug, German silver scoop, two German silver ashtrays, five mustard trays, two small machetes, two African wooden spoons, and spoons made of animal bone. Khan told police he used to work for an Anglo-Indian family earlier settled in Sakleshpur. When the head of the family died, his wife moved to Bengaluru as her daughter was settled in England. Khan and his family also shifted to the city. According to Khan, the elderly woman went to England last year and gave the antique items to him before she left. Renowned taxidermist Edwin Joubert Van Ingen had given them to her as a gift in 1934, she had said. Khan’s claimed the elderly woman died in England during the second wave of Covid-19. “I realised I could make a lot of money by selling the items. I needed the money for the medical expenses of my nephew and for paying house rent and clearing loans,” Khan told police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-arrested-with-antiques-worth-1-crore/articleshow/87691892.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bitcoin scam gets murkier, Congress demands SC-monitored SIT probe||BENGALURU: Continuing its tirade against the ruling BJP, the Congress on Saturday alleged attempts to cover up the alleged bitcoin scam and sought an independent probe by the Supreme Court-monitored special investigation team (SIT). “The scam has international ramifications as several bitcoin exchanges across many parts of the world were allegedly hacked. The state police are not equipped to investigate such a case. Only an SIT probe monitored by an SC sitting judge involving Interpol agencies will reveal the truth,” Congress general secretary Karnataka in-charge Randeep Surjewala said in Delhi. He alleged that Sri Krishna was involved in the alleged hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges and websites that include Bitfinex, registered in a noted tax haven, the British Virgin Islands, and reports suggest that it was hacked on August 2, 2016, and 1,20,000 bitcoins were stolen. “In his voluntary statement, he admits to having taken 2,000 bitcoins. Sriki was arrested in November and released on bail on April 17. But the Interpol wing of CBI was informed 10 days after his release. Why did police remain silent for five months after the arrest? Why were NIA, ED and SFIO not involved? What was the role of Basavaraj Bommai since he was the home minister between August 20, 2019, and July 28, 2021?” he asked. Quoting Whale Alerts (a twitter account that tracks largescale cryptocurrency transactions), he said on December 1, 2020 and on April 14, 2021, the stolen bitcoins worth Rs 5,200 crore were transferred to another account. “There is a need to verify these transactions since Sriki was in the custody of Bengaluru police during this period. Only on April 24, 2021, more than five months after the initial arrest, did the commissioner of police, Bengaluru, write to the Interpol Liaison Officer (CBI),” Surjewala alleged. Surjewala also claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi was told by the FBI about the hacking and sought a probe during his recent visit to the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bitcoin-scam-gets-murkier-cong-demands-sc-monitored-sit-probe/articleshow/87691894.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Money bags set to rule the roost in MLC polls||BENGALURU: Political parties are facing a dearth of potential candidates for the legislative council polls from local bodies as many are hesitating to enter the fray owing to the growing poll expenditure. Elected members of local bodies across the state, barring zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat whose tenure expired in June, will vote to elect 25 MLCs from 31 districts on December 10. A common complaint is that electioneering has become too expensive, with voters expecting huge amounts of money, costly gifts and liquor parties from the candidates. The functionaries in-charge of poll campaigns said the tough competition among parties to lure voters has resulted in the rising demand and there are constituencies where candidates have to shell out a whopping Rs 1.25 lakh per vote. Each district on average has 4,000 voters, of which members of gram panchayats, who technically have no political affiliation, form a major chunk. For instance, there are 3,385 members across 250 gram panchayats in Hassan district and 196 cumulatively from other local bodies, including corporations, city municipal councils and town panchayats. “Many competent candidates are refraining from contesting elections because they cannot spend so much money and this is why we can’t expect people like MC Nanaiah (former MLC known for his oratorial skills) in the upper house in future,” said senior BJP MLC Lahar Singh Siroya. “What’s most disheartening is that the voters seeking money are elected representatives themselves.” He said major political parties should sit together to find a solution to this problem, adding that a few like-minded legislators have already started reaching out to BJP, Congress and JD (S) functionaries. The MLC polls are significant for the ruling BJP since they need to win 12 of the 25 seats to gain a majority in the upper house. Sources said senior MLCs from Congress, including N Narayanaswamy, C Raghu Achar and Gopalaswamy, have already made it clear that they don’t want to be part of the MLC elections since they are exploring the option of contesting assembly polls in 2023. “The kind of resources we spend in MLC elections are not worth it compared to the privileges we get. We can serve people better if we become members of the assembly since we will have more say in the administration,” said Raghu Achar, who is seeking the Congress ticket from Chitradurga assembly seat. BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath said the demand of voters is growing in terms of development as well, and MLCs with limited resources will find it difficult to fulfil them. “A solution to this is to increase the area development fund allocated to an MLC from Rs 2 crore to Rs 5 crore on the lines of MP grants,” said Kavatagimath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/money-bags-set-to-rule-the-roost-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87691895.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: ZP-TP members can’t vote in council elections||BENGALURU: For the first time, members of zilla and taluk panchayats will not vote in the December 10 legislative council elections to 25 seats. Reason: There are no elected representatives in 229 taluk and 30 zilla panchayats. All members of rural and urban local bodies are voters in these elections. Thanks to the government’s decision to set up a delimitation commission to redraw boundaries of wards of zilla and taluk panchayats, the power earlier was with the state election commission . By not holding taluk and zilla panchayat elections, around 5,000 elected representatives have been denied voting rights. The panchayat and urban local bodies elections are not being conducted on time for the past few years owing to political reasons. The tenure of the sitting members of zilla and taluk panchayats got over in May 2021 but owing to the pandemic, the election commission deferred the elections till September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/zp-tp-members-cant-vote-in-council-elections/articleshow/87691897.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC: Planning authority chief’s appointment is at govt’s pleasure||Times News NetworkBengaluru: It is purely an appointment covered by “doctrine of pleasure”, the high court said while dismissing a public interest litigation challenging the appointment of A Ravi as chairman of Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority.T Narasimha Murthy, a Bengaluru-based social activist, had questioned the appointment on grounds that Ravi was a minister’s relative and did not have requisite qualifications. However, a division bench comprising chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted the legislature by bringing in an amendment to rule 5 of the Karnataka Planning Authority Rules-1965, intended to include persons even from the field of social work. “Therefore, the appointment is at the government’s pleasure. Even otherwise, the material on record indicates the jurisdictional tahsildar and also experts of the authority have recommended to consider respondent no. 3 (Ravi) for the post,” the bench added, while pointing out as per records, the petitioner is a local resident and a social worker, fulfilling the required criteria.‘Close relative of min’The petitioner had contended that Ravi is a close relative of revenue minister R Ashoka and that the latter and SR Vishwanath, MLA and political secretary to the then chief minister had recommended his name. According to him, the appointment runs contrary to the procedure contemplated under the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act-1961. Also, Ravi does not possess the qualifications as contemplated under rule 5 of the Karnataka Planning Authority Rules-1965 and changed his residential address prior to the appointment, he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-planning-authority-chiefs-appointment-is-at-govts-pleasure/articleshow/87691898.cms||---

Most youngsters have their own aspirations and dreams, which can be realised only by acquiring proper knowledge and skill sets,” he said.“It is a false notion that NEP implementation will lead to commercialisation of education.

---||India||Extended Covishield dosage gap more potent, show studies||NEW DELHI: The extended gap of at least 12 weeks between the two doses of Covishield has resulted in better immune response among majority of vaccinated Indians, subsiding any immediate requirement for booster shots, an official assessment of real-life data from sero prevalence studies has shown. Citing the findings, experts have also ruled out any possibility of reducing the gap between two shots of Covishield. The findings will soon be submitted to the health ministry for further consideration for policy making, an official source said. “We have been reviewing the data on a regular basis and now since large scale data of vaccinated people is available, we have studied that too. Any decision will be driven by these scientific facts,” the source said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Policy on booster shot soon, says panel memberDr NK Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium set up to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2, urged people not to take a booster dose right now as it won’t be considered for any certification. “We have been working on the policy document for the past three weeks, and firming it up. ItAccording to the source, there is “no question of reducing the gap because the data shows that the immune response has improved with a gap of three months between two doses of Covishield”. Of the total more than 112 crore doses of Covid vaccine administered in the country so far, 88% are Covishield, a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZencea. The vaccine is manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India. India is currently administering the second dose of Covishield at 12-16 weeks gap. While more than 79% of the eligible adult population has received at least the first dose of a Covid vaccine, around 39% are fully vaccinated with two doses. Read Also5 reasons why India should allow a booster doseWith much of the population still waiting for the second Covid vaccine shot, should India be thinking of booster doses? It may make sense, at least for healthcare workers and others on the frontlines of the battle against the pandemicWhile there are around 12 crore people overdue for a second dose, a major reason for the slow progress of second-dose coverage is also the long gap between two jabs of Covishield, which constitutes the majority of vaccination. As the majority of eligible population is now covered with the first dose of the vaccines and there is also adequate stock, some states, as well as public health experts, have written to the Centre asking it to reduce the gap so that people have increased protection with two doses of Covishield. However, the government has maintained that any such decision will be driven by scientific recommendations from experts evaluating the same. Assessment of the sero-prevalence data also underlines no immediate requirement for booster dose, rather full vaccination is essential for long-lasting immunity, the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/extended-covishield-dosage-gap-more-potent-show-studies/articleshow/87691908.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Proposed after 26/11, India to finally get maritime coordinator||NEW DELHI: India will now finally have a national maritime security coordinator (NMSC) to ensure effective coordination and cohesive policy-making among the disparate central and state authorities dealing with maritime affairs from the coastline to the high seas. The Cabinet Committee on Security has approved the post of the NMSC, who will also act as the interface between military and civilian agencies to strengthen the country’s maritime security, energy and ‘blue economy’ needs, sources said on Saturday. A retired or serving Vice Admiral of the Navy (equivalent to a Lt-General in the Army) is likely to be appointed to the post. The NMSC will work in the National Security Council Secretariat and report to national security adviser Ajit Doval. TOI had in April reported that the government was working towards creating an apex federal body, the National Maritime Commission (NMC), and the post of the NMSC. While the NMC “is still a work in progress”, the NMSC post has now become a reality. “It’s a long overdue reform. The NMSC’s charter of duties will soon be notified,” said a source. “The basic charter will be ensuring coordination among the multiple authorities largely working in silos, and often at cross-purposes. They range from central ministries and departments (external affairs, defence, home, shipping, fisheries etc) and state governments to the Navy, Coast Guard, customs, intelligence agencies and port authorities. He will also look at some technology aspects,” he added. The urgent need for an effective federal maritime mechanism has been repeatedly stressed over the years. The 2001 Group of Ministers’ report on reforming the national security system after the Kargil conflict, for instance, underlined the need for “an apex body for management of maritime affairs for institutionalised linkages among the Navy, Coast Guard and ministries of central and state governments”. After the deadly 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, which exposed the lack of “critical connectivity”' between intelligence agencies and security forces, the creation of a maritime security advisory board (MSAB) with a maritime security adviser as its chief had also figured on the CCS agenda. But it could not take off due to turf wars and general politico-bureaucratic apathy. India has a long 7,516-km coastline including island territories and a two million sq km exclusive economic zone. “Moreover, with 90% of our trade by volume and 70% by value transiting through the seas, India is also looking at securing its ‘blue economy’ activities in the years ahead,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/proposed-after-26/11-india-to-finally-get-maritime-coordinator/articleshow/87691943.cms||Rajat Pandit

The deceased jawan, Rfn Rajendra Prasad Meena, hailed from Dilawarpur village in Dausa district. He has left behind his wife and two children. The official statement by Assam Rifles said, “A convoy of Assam Rifles was ambushed by insurgents in Thinghat, Manipur on November 13 at 1100 hrs. Five soldiers including Col Viplav Tripathi Commanding Officer of 46 Assam Rifles have made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. The family of commanding officer (wife and child) also lost their lives in the incident. DG and all ranks of Assam Rifles offer condolences to the brave soldiers and families of the deceased.” Meena who joined the force at a young age was in his late 20s and had less than a decade of service. Talking about his cousin, Mahesh Meena told TOI, “He wanted to join the force since a young age and when I met him few months ago, he told me that he did not realise that so many years have passed since he joined the defence forces.

---||Visakhapatnam||‘Is the kothimeera loaded?’ Code words run marijuana trade in Vizag Agency||VISAKHAPATNAM: An ever-changing lexicon of words is in use among ganja peddlers who procure and transport the weed from tribal pockets of Visakhapatnam district and the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB). Codenamed ‘kothimeera’ (coriander leaves), peddlers also shift between other names in a bid to throw enforcement agencies off track. In the more remote areas of Vizag Agency and AOB, code words such as ‘cereals,’ ‘millets’, ‘beans’, ‘rajma’, ‘chans’, ‘chawal’, and ‘turmeric’ are in vogue. Recently, peddlers have started using ‘dhaniya patta’ or ‘kothimeera’ (coriander leaves) to refer to ganja. Citing an example, officials of enforcement agencies say that if a peddler wants to know whether the ganja has been procured, he would ask, “Kothimeera loaded or not?”. Similarly, they would use the code word ‘cabbage’, instead of ganja, to know the status of a delivery of cannabis. In a few instances, drug peddlers have used also ‘grass’ as a code word. Apart from changing the vocabulary for the green drug, peddlers, particularly interstate smugglers, change their modus operandi from time to time in order to transport the weed from the hilly areas to various parts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, New Delhi, Kerala, as well as other parts of the country. But ganja cultivation and smuggling are not new to the Vizag Agency or along the AOB. Tonnes of dry ganja have been seized by enforcement officials in the past. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg, claim activists, pointing out that a majority of cases go undetected as the smugglers adopt new strategies to transport the contraband from the Agency. “As parts of Vizag Agency and AOB also grow a variety of green plants, cabbage, ginger and other vegetables, the ganja is kept hidden in goods vehicles along with sacks of fresh vegetables. Smugglers prefer some specific days for transportation of the weed, especially on the days of the weekly market (shandies) to give the impression to enforcement officials that the vehicle is transporting fresh vegetables,” said K Raja Rao, a resident of Vizag Agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/is-the-kothimeera-loaded-code-words-run-agencys-marijuana-trade/articleshow/87690160.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh to raise power dues from Telangana issue at zonal meeting||VISAKHAPATNAM: The AP government will apprise Union home minister Amit Shah of the outstanding dues to the tune of Rs 6,015 crore from Telangana power utilities during the 29th southern zonal council meeting in Tirupati on Sunday. It will also request the Union government to prevail on Telangana and facilitate payment of arrears to APGenco at the earliest. The state government also plans to pitch its proposal to the Centre to alternatively direct Telangana to include the generator dues to APGenco under tranche II loan of Atma Nirbhar scheme that is being availed by Telangana discoms. According to energy department sources, the Rs 6,015 crore outstanding is for electricity supplied to Telangana following the bifurcation of the state, up to June 10, 2017. As power generation in Telangana was not enough to meet the demand at the time of bifurcation, APGenco had supplied the deficit power to Telangana discoms. APGenco distributed 8,890 million units from June 2, 2014 to June 10, 2017 to Telangana as per AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. For the same, an undisputed due of Rs 3,441 crore and Rs 2,841 crore towards late payment surcharge, which is the cost of power supplied during that period, have remained unpaid. The two states agreed on payment of these dues on different occasions, including at a joint meeting between the power utilities of both states on August 19, 2019. The issue was also raked up during the meeting of chief secretaries of the two Telugu states on January 30, 2020. But the dues have remained unpaid. “It can be seen that such huge receivables turning into bad debts will not only affect the financial viability of APGenco, but will also have serious implications for the lenders — Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). Since the above power was supplied as per the directions of the Union government, it is requested that the dues receivable may be liquidated and paid to REC and PFC,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-raise-power-dues-from-t-issue-at-zonal-meeting/articleshow/87690179.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

His wife Anulika Singh is a sitting zila parishad member. The locals blocked road on Saturday to protest the murder. “Sarsi police station SHO has been suspended. Raids are on to nab the assailants,” Purnia SP Daya Shankar told this reporter on Saturday. Sources said Rintu was also the deputy district president of the Congress. He was planning to contest the 2025 assembly election from Dhamdaha. An attempt on his life was made ten days ago, but he had escaped unhurt. An FIR was lodged against a hardcore criminal with the Sarsi police station in this connection, but he was not arrested. This region is infamous for political killings in the past several years. Meanwhile, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lashed out at the state police over the murder. The RJD leader said Rintu had lodged a written complaint to the police alleging that he had threat from the nephew of Bihar minister Lesi Singh. Calling the state police as JD(U) police, Tejashwi tweeted that in spite of a written complaint lodged by Rintu, police failed to react.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-zila-parishad-member-shot-dead-in-purnia-district/articleshow/87689634.cms||---

The authorities have initiated the process to engage an agency to take up the project. An estimated Rs 9.1 crore has been pegged for the proposed project which the selected agency will need to complete within 120 days or four months. NKDA officials said the project has been planned to further develop the use of solar energy in New Town. “Urban land has become costlier to install solar panels. Previously, we had installed solar panels and set up floating solar plants on water bodies and stress has been given on installing rooftop solar panels. Now we are exploring if the pavements could be used,” said an NKDA official. Officials said the plan is to use a small portion of the pavement to install solar paver blocks on the sides. “The technology is seen in many places abroad. Solar panels will be integrated with the paver blocks and will be covered with a kind of toughened glass that will not get damaged if one steps on it,” said an official. “The stretch in front of Rabindra Tirtha is one of the busiest intersections. The plan is to have a few EV charging units which will be integrated with the solar paver blocks for easy availability on the main arterial road,” an official said. NKDA has developed a 400m service road from Swapno Bhor park to New Town mela ground with internet hot spots, solar benches, solar trees, water ATMs and plastic-laid road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-plans-smart-footpath-with-solar-paver-blocks/articleshow/87690605.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Footfall may rise after dip in liquor prices||KOLKATA: Leading bar-cum-restaurants in the city are gearing up to change its menu card, trying to make it more pocket-friendly for customers following the news of a slash in liquor prices next week.  Liquor, for long, has been a major sales component for all bar-cum-restaurants in the city. In some cases, liquor constitutes more than 80% of the earning mix. According to Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar, liquor constitutes 55%-60% of sales of bars. “In case of my MS Bar and Lounge, almost 60% is liquor sales,” he said. “If there is a fall in liquor price, we shall pass on the benefit to customers. It will boost footfalls and there will be a positive impact on food sales as well,” he added. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city and its outskirts with a combined revenue of Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 crore annually. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata alone had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic. It employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone. Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu? owner Nitin Kothari also believes it will have a major impact for bars-cum-restaurants. “It will be win-win for all customers, government and the industry. For us, almost 80% is food and the rest is liquor but even then, liquor price slash will have a positive impact on us,” he said. Speciality Restaurants chairman Anjan Chatterjee welcomed the state government move. “It will be more pocket-friendly and we shall pass on the benefit in due time,” he said. T S Walia, the former national president of FHRAI and director of Xrong Place and Walson, agreed. “It is the peak season, so this price slash will have a real impact,” he said. Chapter 2 MD Debaditya Chowdhury was happy with the development. “We will surely pass on a part of this percentage to the customers as discounts. And further, we are looking forward to increase our liquor sales as well,” he said. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, and Rahul Khanna of Go Where in Sector V also decided to pass on the benefit. “Our selling price will come down,” Rozario said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-may-rise-after-dip-in-liquor-prices/articleshow/87690612.cms||---

Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad and DGP Sanjeev Kumar Singhal have held a series of high-level meetings with the DMs, SSP, SPs and public prosecutors via videoconferencing in the last few days, including the one at the state police headquarters on Friday. Prasad told TOI over phone on Saturday that directions have been given to arrest the accused and liquor smugglers from other states, increase conviction rate in courts and intensify raids in border areas. “We will have a meeting on the issue even on Sunday,” he said. A senior IPS officer said the figures were being compiled to present a clear picture of prohibition before the CM during his review meeting. A home department officer said the focus was now on intercepting trucks and vehicles carrying IMLF from outside the state. “Earlier, 65% of IMLF was smuggled through Uttar Pradesh border. Now, the situation has changed,” he said. The focus is also on country liquor manufacturing and smuggling as it is unorganised. “Micro-level action is required. Liquor seizure and arrests made this year are almost 1.5 times more than last year,” he said. At a meeting held by ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar and ADG (law and order) Vinay Kumar on Friday, the field officers were directed to conduct targeted raids and arrest repeat offenders. “The example of Gopalganj hooch incident was cited as the main accused was a repeat offender and had already been to jail twice in liquor smuggling cases,” a senior IPS officer said, adding installing GPS in police vehicles and landline phones in police stations were the other issues which were discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/senior-cops-plan-strategy-to-check-liquor-smuggling/articleshow/87689538.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The incident took place when the puja committee members insisted on taking out a procession before immersing the idol in a local pond. The police opposed it on the ground that no prior permission was sought by them for that. The police lodged an FIR against 20 named and 25 unknown persons and arrested Om Praksh Choudhary and Mithilesh Choudhary of Aayar village in this connection. Later, the villagers gheraoed the Aayar police station demanding immediate release of the arrested persons. They alleged high-handedness by the SHO and the local police. “The villagers perform Chhath puja at a local pond situated just behind Aayar police station. The SHO had cooperated with the committee members in the arrangements. They had installed an idol of Sun God. When the SHO asked them to seek permission and get a licence as is required by the law, they promised to immerse the idol in the pond itself without taking out any procession. But at around 11:30am on Friday, they took out a procession with loudspeakers blaring,” Jagdishpur SDPO Shyam Kishore Ranjan told this newspaper. “When the police tried to reason with the agitators, they turned violent and attacked the police with ‘dandas’ in which one jamadar and two constables sustained minor injuries,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-bhojpur-cops-injured-in-clash-with-puja-committee-members/articleshow/87689579.cms||---
---||Patna||Chirag to CM: Fix accountability for lapses in enforcing prohibition||PATNA: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Saturday urged CM Nitish Kumar to fix the accountability of the officers for their failure to check liquor smuggling in ‘dry’ Bihar. He demanded Rs25 lakh compensation and a government job to a family member of each victim of the hooch tragedies in the state. Talking to reporters after his return from Gopalganj, Bettiah and Muzaffarpur where more than 40 people died after consuming spurious liquor recently, Chirag said he was in favour of the prohibition, but the law should be enforced strictly. Referring to CM Nitish’s proposed November 16 meeting on the prohibition-related action, the LJP (Ram Vilas) chief said those who died in hooch incidents were the earning members of their families belonging to the lower strata of the society. The CM should extend the disbursement of free ration to the poor for the next six months. “We have written to the CM to think over the proposal in the larger interest of the people,” he said. Chirag said it was wrong to put the onus on those who consumed spurious alcohol and died. Referring to the CM’s statement that those who consume bad things are bound to suffer, Chirag said, “I differ from the CM. They would not have consumed liquor, if it were not available in the region. Innocent people are being sent to jail.” Taking a swipe at the action taken against the families of the deceased, he alleged that the children and women were spending nights in the open as their houses had been sealed by the officials concerned. “Biharis are being harassed and penalised in the name of prohibition law. I would like the CM to meet the affected families before his review meeting on prohibition,” he added. Chirag also alleged that the liquor smugglers were operating with the tacit support of the ruling party leaders. “We were in the opposition when prohibition was imposed in Bihar,” he said. Reacting to Chirag's allegations, JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said the Jamui MP should provide evidence before making such “baseless” allegations against the government. “I think he has no knowledge about the proceedings of the legislature. The prohibition law was passed with the support of all political parties,” he asserted. The JD(U) principal spokesperson said that the anti-dowry law or child marriage Act were enforced years back. Yet offences under these laws continue. Moreover, the government has taken strict action against the violators of prohibition law, he pointed out. ‘Confer Bharat Ratna on Ram Vilas’: Chirag said his party demanded from the Centre to confer Bharat Ratna on former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. He thanked PM Narendra Modi for giving Padma Bhushan (posthumously) to Ram Vilas for his contribution in public life for more than five decades. Chirag also said his party would launch a ‘ratri vishram’ programme in rural areas to listen to the grievances of the people. Around 250-300 villages have been identified for the purpose, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-to-cm-fix-accountability-for-lapses-in-enforcing-prohibition/articleshow/87689554.cms||Ramashankar

These include ‘Objectionable Articles in Al-Hilal’, ‘Proposal to Expel Azad from Bihar and Odisha (Part I)’, ‘Internment of Azad (Part II)’, ‘Papers Related to Azad’, ‘Release of Azad’, and ‘Request of Al-Hilal to be Placed on Approved List of Newspapers’. Mahendrapal Singh, the director of the BSAD, told this reporter on Saturday that many interesting documents and papers related to Azad had been digitized. “During World War I, Azad was accused of publishing several objectionable articles against the Britishers in the Al-Hilal. When he took a dig at the country’s situation, he was placed under house arrest in Ranchi which was part of undivided Bihar back then. He was not allowed to meet people or take part in political activities. His house was also searched by police and his belongings were confiscated. During his detention, Azad concentrated mostly on religious and educational activities,” Singh said. He added, “Azad also drew people’s attention towards the coherence of religion and science and was against any form of discrimination in society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bsad-digitizes-documents-related-to-abul-kalam-azad/articleshow/87689336.cms||Faryal Rumi

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said a proper notification in this connection was awaited. The ECR is running 274 mail and express besides 389 local passenger trains daily. According to sources, the ‘special’ word and the first ‘0’ of the train number will be withdrawn from all mail and express trains. Officials said the decision has been taken following overall improvement in the Covid-19 situation as well as record 100+ crore vaccinations across the country. The Bihar Daily Passengers’ Association (BDPA) has welcomed this decision. “A notification to this effect was issued by deputy director coaching (Railway Board), Rajesh Kumar, to all zonal railways on Friday to restore services of regular mail and express passenger trains with immediate effect and bring the fare tariff down to pre-Covid days,” BDPA secretary Shoaib Quraishi said. Railways had suspended all passenger trains from March 22, 2020 due to Covid-19. However, ECR had started running 22 pairs of long-distance trains as ‘special trains’ from July 1, 2020 by charging at least Rs300 more per ticket in the AC class and Rs150 per ticket in sleeper class. Railways has not made it clear whether it is going to restore the services like providing meals, bedsheets, blankets, mineral water bottles and other facilities to passengers. When contacted, IRCTC senior public relations officer (PRO) A K Jha said the Board guidelines lack clarity on the issue of providing services to passengers in regular mail and express passenger trains. “IRCTC is ready to serve passengers if it gets clear guidelines from the Railway Board,” he said. According to sources, the ECR was earning revenue about Rs9 to 10 crore per day in the passenger trains segment alone during the pre-Covid period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/decision-to-restore-regular-trains-to-benefit-passengers/articleshow/87689377.cms||Kumod Verma

Sources said the BJP’s central leadership had asked the JD(U) to submit the list of UP constituencies where it wanted to contest in the upcoming assembly polls. “Most of our identified 35 seats are located in the eastern and central UP. Only a few seats are in the western UP,” JD(U) Uttar Pradesh state president Anoop Singh Patel told TOI over phone on Saturday. Patel said he would soon submit the list of 35 seats to JD(U) national secretary general and the party’s in-charge for UP affairs, K C Tyagi, who would forward it to the party’s central leadership. Sources said the JD(U)’s central leadership would soon submit the list to the BJP’s central leadership for beginning the seat-sharing talks. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh had earlier made it clear that his party would contest the upcoming UP assembly polls alone, if the BJP was not interested in forming a pre-poll alliance with his party. On being asked to reveal the names of the assembly seats identified by the JD(U), Patel named a few like Barabanki Sadar, Badaun, Chunar, Prayagraj and a few other seats in Mirzapur, Balia, Kushinagar and Ghazipur districts. “Most of our identified seats are located alongside Bihar-UP border where people are influenced by the development works of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-identifies-35-seats-in-up-to-contest-with-bjp/articleshow/87689513.cms||Madan Kumar

Education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, told this newspaper on Saturday, “Since the educational institutions have started functioning in full swing due to a sharp decline in Covid-19 cases, efforts are being made to start catch-up courses in schools to compensate for the learning loss. The modalities of these courses are being finalized and will be notified by the department soon.” He continued, “The academic interest of the students will be safeguarded at all costs and their requirements fulfilled. It will also be ensured that schools function properly and teachers work with sincerity and dedication.” Talking about the 3.5 lakh contractual teachers appointed by the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies, Choudhary said, “They will get their salaries at an enhanced rate with effect from January 1, 2022.” The education department has already released a detailed guideline of pay fixation in the revised scale with a 15% hike in salary. The minister pointed out, “On August 19 last year, the state cabinet had decided to increase the salary of all the contractual teachers and librarians by 15%. The education department had also issued a notification in this regard. The pay hike was supposed to come into effect from April 1 2021, but it could not materialize due to the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/catch-up-courses-for-students-soon-bihar-education-minister/articleshow/87689323.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar BJP chief gives credit to RaGa for saffron victory||PATNA: State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal on Saturday said former Congress president Rahul Gandhi (RaGa) and others of his ilk had made a “significant” contribution to the victory of his party in the last two parliamentary elections by making “adverse” comments consistently against Hindus and Hindutva. “There has been an immense contribution of PM Narendra Modi and lakhs of the BJP workers in the party gaining absolute majority in the last two parliamentary elections, but the important contribution of Rahul Gandhi and others cannot be denied in making that victory possible,” Dr Jaiswal said. “Whenever he (Rahul) opens his mouth, he accomplishes the task and work for bringing together the people of Hindu ‘samaj,’ who recognize the forces with whom they have to align with (read the saffron BJP),” he added while indicating that the BJP would gain immensely from the repeat of what Rahul and others have done this week ahead of the assembly elections in UP, Punjab, Manipur and Goa early next year. As it is, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid got his new book ‘The Sunrise on Ayodhya’ released on Wednesday in which he has likened the RSS and its affiliated organisations to the Islamic State and Boko Haram. Subsequently, on Friday, Rahul Gandhi explained that Hinduism and Hindutva were two different things and concepts, inviting concerted attack from BJP. Calling Rahul “convener of the so-called national secular organization,” Dr Jaiswal grouped him with AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, calling the latter “its co-convener”. He also put Khurshid, Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal, all Congress leaders, in the same bracket of the “so-called national secular organization”. Dr Jaiswal fell short of calling Rahul a sick person, as he, quoting a dialogue from the film ‘Munna Bhai’, wished for him, “Get well soon,” besides getting personal in his attack. Jaiswal said he would send the Bhagavad Gita to Rahul, since the latter says that “he is a Hindu, his mother a Christian and his father a Parsi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-bjp-chief-gives-credit-to-raga-for-saffron-victory/articleshow/87689527.cms||Abhay Singh

Many, in fact, are not interested in switching to other crops because of poor marketing facilities and unremunerative prices. In the Vizag Agency and along the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB), cultivation of ganja dominates over more traditional crops such as rajma, turmeric, millets and cereals. Three varieties of cannabis are cultivated in Vizag Agency and the AOB belt—Raja Hamsa, Kala Pathri and Sheelavathi. Demand for the Sheelavathi variety is highest and has a booming market in the country. Some ganja growers on condition of anonymity said the input cost for cultivating ganja on one acre is around Rs 2 to Rs 4 lakh and the return on investment in a year is between five to six times. Traditional crops, on the other hand, would give a maximum profit of Rs 50,000 from one acre of land. Locals said some ganja farmers earn between Rs 2 to Rs 5 lakh from an acre, making the crop as much as three times profitable than a conventional crop like turmeric. Agents lend a helping hand by paying the input cost and supplying fertilizers to enhance production. “It is a fact that ganja crop gives more profits than any other conventional crop, but growing ganja is illegal and punishable under the law. We are educating the growers to lead a peaceful life by switching to alternative crops such as turmeric,” said DIG of Visakha Range, LKV Ranga Rao. Middlemen procure cannabis from growers by paying between Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per kilo, depending on the quality. The Sheelavathi variety has a market value that ranges anywhere between Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000 per kilo in cities and metros. “The weather condition in Vizag Agency and AOB is suitable for cultivation of exotic fruits such as dragonfruit, strawberry and avacado. These crops would give good returns, too. But the input cost is high. We have been holding discussions with officials of horticulture and agriculture departments to find out suitable crops for hilly areas that ganja farmers can switch to,” said ASP, Chintapalle, Tushar Dudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/high-returns-vs-illegal-biz-conundrum-in-agency/articleshow/87690123.cms||Nalla.Babu

State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said initially they will be carrying out mass awareness programme in the urban areas as model code was implemented in villages due to the panchayat elections. “We will interact with people on important issues like corruption and inflation. Apart from organising marches, we will hold talks with small groups of people and spend night at some places to make people aware of the problems the country was facing,” said Jha. When asked whether the Congress was trying to make some space in Bihar after its poor performance in the recent byelections, Jha replied, “This awareness programme has nothing to do with the byelection results. Our party is carrying it out across the country and we have always raised the issues of public interest.” When asked whether the bitterness with the RJD during the bypolls got over and the two would join hands again, he said, “Our relationship is the same as it was during the byelections. The gap is there.” However, he said, the future course of action will be decided by the Congress high command. Congress and RJD were in alliance in the 2020 assembly elections. However, in the recently concluded bypolls, both fielded candidates on the two seats and lost the elections to JD(U).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congs-mass-awareness-programme-from-today/articleshow/87689573.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The rain could be light to moderate over the next two days, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “The low-pressure trough moved into Bengal as expected and has resulted in clouds and rain. The rain will continue and could get moderate either on Sunday or Monday,” said RMC director GK Das. While the cloud cover is set to persist till Tuesday, the low-pressure trough will start weakening from Tuesday. “It will lose steam and should fizzle out,” added Das. The cloud cover has pushed the minimum temperature well above 20 degrees while it has pulled the maximum down.

---||Ahmedabad||In another age, silver had gold crown in value and exchange!||AHMEDABAD: On a day when gold price surged to nine-month record high of Rs 51,000 per 10 grams on Saturday, it may be difficult to imagine that once gold price was the same as that of silver! This dream scenario prevailed in Vedic and post-Vedic period (about 3,500 to 4,000 years ago) as documented by scriptures. By the time Alexander’s army returned home from the western borders of India circa 4th Century BCE, the ratio was 2 silvers to 1 gold. Seven centuries later, it increased to 6 silvers to 1 gold and today it is roughly 80 silvers to 1 gold. While the gold price slid from Rs 58,000 per 10 grams in August 2020 to slightly below Rs 50,000 ahead of Diwali 2021, for the past few days the gold prices are witnessing a steady rise due to the factors such as surge in international demand and strengthening of the US Dollar against Indian Rupee, said experts. In his latest paper titled ‘Gold is Old: Noble Metal in Indian Economy through Ages’ Prof Satish Deodhar teaching economics in IIM-Ahmedabad tracked the precious metal's history and obsession over it in India. “Written accounts indicate that gold was aplenty during the Vedic era and people would even get alluvial placer gold dust from rivers such as Sindhu, Saraswati, Jambu and Ganga. For a very long time, the non-corrosive and malleable nature of the metal made it the favourite medium of trade and exchange,” said Satish Deodhar, a professor of economics at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A). “But even as India’s own gold reserves depleted, our obsession with the Yellow Metal refused to subside. Today we buy gold as a store of value rather than use it as a medium of exchange.” Prof Deodhar has dug up some interesting nuggets from the past. “We have found more than 40 names for gold found in Sanskrit literature, mostly as adjectives. In Vedic and post-Vedic literature such as Brahmanas, we find mention of both unmarked button-gold (hiranya pinda) and punch-marked bullion named Nishka, Satamana, Suvarna and Krishnala as currency,” he said. In fact, the radiant yellow hue of the metal even evoked the concept of Hiranya-garbha (golden egg, womb or seed) as the starting point (Big Bang) of the universe in Hindu concept of creation. The connection between gold and Goddess Lakshmi is also as old as Vedas. The Shri Sukta hymn in Rig-Veda describes her as the one who shines with golden hue wearing golden garlands. Till date the earliest excavations of gold coins with the imagery of Goddess Lakshmi belong to the Gupta dynasty in 4th Century CE. But Prof Deodhar points at a larger issue. “Over the millennia, Indian households have accumulated an astounding stock of about 24,245 tonnes of gold. Since India does not produce any gold , about 9% of the value of our annual imports consist of this precious metal alone. We must devise ways to re-channel the idle gold stock through the gold monetization schemes (GMS) initiated by the government of India,” he said. “Today households don’t earn any interest on the gold they possess. In fact, they pay fees to keep it in bank lockers. Instead, GMS gold deposits can be used efficiently to recycle idle gold stocks, finance gold inventory of jewellers, and reduce imports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-another-age-silver-had-gold-crown-in-value-and-exchange/articleshow/87690764.cms||Parth Shastri

Vendors demonstrated outside the Ahmedabad collector’s office on Saturday, claiming they would launch a statewide agitation if Trivedi fails to apologize for his remarks. The vendors demanded that before branding them as ‘land grabbers’ and ‘illegal’, the revenue minister must explain why municipal corporations were dragging their feet on implementing provisions of the protection of livelihood and regulation of street vending Act, 2014. On Friday, Trivedi had told media in Vadodara that footpaths were meant for pedestrians and nobody should do business there. Trivedi had said that the footpaths should not be encroached upon and using them for business was a type of land grabbing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vendors-demand-apology/articleshow/87690626.cms||---

His family members are consulting doctors in Singapore as well as in London. Lalu is suffering from multiple ailments, including kidney, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac issues. Because of kidney malfunction, he has been advised to limit the intake of liquid, including water and juice. The RJD founder was rushed back to Delhi from Patna on November 3, after his creatinine level had increased and his blood report showed some abnormalities. Sanjay Yadav, who is the political advisor of Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said, “Doctors in Singapore and London are being consulted for the transplant. We are sending them whatever reports they are asking for. The decision on transplant will be taken after going through the reports.” Sources said the Lalu’s family is in consultation with the same same hospital where former BJP Rajya Sabha member R K Sinha and former Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh had undergone treatment. Sinha had even met Lalu on October 29 to inquire about his health and suggested about the doctors who had treated him in Singapore. In India, noted nephrologist Dr Bhalla at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is closely monitoring Lalu’s kidney ailment and his cardiac issues are being taken care of by the unit led by Dr Rakesh Yadav at AIIMS-Delhi. Presently, Lalu is at the official residence of his elder daughter Misa Bharti. Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi is staying with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-may-undergo-kidney-transplant/articleshow/87689401.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Delhi||UP police takes Delhi YouTuber to Mathura for Vrindavan film||AGRA: Mathura police in UP on Saturday booked a YouTube content creator from Delhi, bringing him for “questioning” here, for uploading a film on the beliefs behind ‘Nidhivan’ in Vrindavan -- where Krishna and Radha are believed to still do 'raaslila' at night -- on his web channel three days ago. His Mathura-based friends have also been hauled up. The videographers, allegedly "with their shoes on", had entered the premises by climbing over the wall at midnight and had shot the film. Police said no one is allowed to enter there at night as people believe that Lord Krishna and Radha still perform raslila when the city sleeps. The purported video was deleted on Saturday. Though the YouTube channel is run by Gaurav Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Vihar in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, under the name of 'GauravZone' with 44.9 lakh subscribers, the FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station. In the FIR, complainant Rohit Krishna, who is a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, stated that some "anti-social elements violated limits of Nidhivan", which is considered the most prominent site dedicated to Lord Krishna-Radha and their 'gopis'. The complaint added that the men tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs. He demanded "exemplary deterrent". Superintendent of police (city) MP Singh told TOI that a police team was sent to Delhi to identify the suspects and the matter is under investigation. Civil judge (junior division) Archana Singh also directed police to ensure deletion of the video from all social media platforms after the priest approached the judge. She directed police to present a compliance report in court. A group of priests in Vrindavan staged a protest and later purified Nidhivan by sprinkling holy water. “We will launch an agitation if police fail to arrest the accused,” said Saurabh Gaur, president of Dharam Raksha Sangh. Sharma was arrested by Delhi police a few months ago for animal cruelty after he posted a video showing his dog floating in air with helium balloons strapped to its back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-police-takes-delhi-youtuber-to-mathura-for-vrindavan-film/articleshow/87691105.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Deadly virus on prowl, felines in Kolkata at risk||KOLKATA: A deadly feline parvovirus (FPV) has been raging among cats in the city, killing several domesticated cats, especially those that have a habit of going outdoors. According to vets and pet owners in the city, multiple cats have developed loss of appetite, severe lethargy and weakness, which in some cases have developed into vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and dehydration. Due to poor diagnosis, by the time the disease is discovered, many affected animals go into shock from dehydration and sepsis, often resulting in sudden death. “FPV attacks the cells that line the small intestine and causes severe immunosuppression among cats. Early diagnosis is very important for a proper cure of the disease. Several cats are facing casualties because of diagnostic ambiguity,” said veterinarian Subir Bhattacharya. FPV is highly contagious and is spread through the faeces of infected cats. Cats do not need to have direct contact to spread the virus. It can be transferred from anything that has come in contact with contaminated faeces, including shoes, clothing or other objects, such as toys, said feline experts. “Our seven-month old cat Simbu was perfectly fine until she suddenly stopped eating from November 1 and started passing blood mixed stool. We took her to a vet who got her tested and diagnosed her with haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and put her on drip. She was under treatment for almost a week but her condition continued to deteriorate and on November 7, she collapsed,” said Nishita Rakshit, a coding instructor from Garia. Doctors opined while no specific treatment is available for FPV, the treatment protocol varies from case to case depending on the kind of symptoms. It is also vital that any suspected cases are nursed in isolation. In absence of any specific treatment protocols, doctors stress that FPV can be much better prevented than treated and demanded all cats and kittens be vaccinated. “There is still reluctance among a large section of cat lovers to get the felines vaccinated. Every kitten should be vaccinated with CRP vaccine, which acts as a shield against diseases like calicivirus, rhinotracheitis virus and panleukopenia virus,” said doctor Krishanu Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deadly-virus-on-prowl-city-felines-at-risk/articleshow/87690608.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

DCP crime, Amrita Duhan said that city police had picked up a crucial intelligence input about suspicious people with criminal antecedents, who were living alongside city streets while posing as nomads to evade regular surveillance. The crime branch dispatched a team led by inspector Khalil Ahmad which kept a close eye on the accused and raided their hideouts. “The most violent member of the gang that has at least six murders under his belt becomes the gang’s chieftain. That is the reason why it’s called Chaimar gang,” Duhan told TOI. Kidnapping gang busted: Ram Nagariya police Saturday arrested three members of a loot and abduction gang.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Engineer shifts gears, hopes to be doctor at 35||MUMBAI: Twenty-nine-year-old Aakriti Goel completed her engineering from BITS Pilani in 2015 and dabbled into several projects and start-ups till she landed, what she believed was her dream job. Two years of devoting over 14 hours a day in this health-related start-up, Goel fell sick. Due to extreme stress, she suffered a hormonal imbalance forcing her to quit her job soon after the outbreak of the pandemic. A year after the health episode, Goel has bounced back into what she calls the 2.0 version of her career. She studied for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and bagged an enviable all-India rank of 1118 - a feat that many find unbelievable, including her parents. An official from the Directorate of Medical Education and Research claimed that in the state rank list, which is yet to be released, she could easily be in the top 100. Goel is all set to join a leading government institution and pursue a career in medicine. She will probably end up being a doctor at the age of 35 and a surgeon around 40, but she takes life as it comes and is not worried about her future right now. “Age should not be a bar to achieve anything in life. We tend to have more faith in the stereotypical belief that ‘what’s done is done’ and that ‘we cannot re-start our career again’. Or ‘we are too old’. Or ‘if you are a woman, it is still harder'. It is not true. People can still discover things they like at the age of 30, 40 or even 50 and pursue it. It is never too late to find the purpose of your life,” said the Thane resident. Goel never liked working in an MNC. She wanted to join smaller firms and make a significant difference. “I am not a 9 to 5 person,” she says. She opted out of her campus placements in 2015 and started looking for unconventional roles in start-ups. After working in a couple of them, she decided to experiment with something on her own. With little success, she looked for an operations job in another start-up in 2018 and made her way to the top in no time. “It was pretty hectic, but I learnt a lot. Toiling for 14-15 hours a day eventually took a toll on my health and I decided to quit in March last year,” said Goel. She relaxed at home for a few months, did yoga, painting and slowly bounced back. Once she fully recovered, the ‘what next?’ question troubled her. She could have easily gone back to her hefty-salaried job, but she realised it was not her calling. “Though I learnt a lot in that firm, it never gave me full satisfaction,” she said. Goel was always interested in women empowerment issues and wanted to start something on her own, like an NGO. But the pandemic-imposed lockdown, put a spoke in her wheel. She then decided to approach an old friend, a life coach, who asked her to take the Ikigai exercise, a Japanese concept to figure out the purpose of one’s life. On doing it for the second time, she figured medicine is where her heart is. “I wanted to become a doctor as a child. I was good at biology in school. But when the time came to choose between the two, I did not wish to lose the opportunity of being called a woman engineer. I do not regret that decision too. In fact, after being an engineer for over 10 years, I now know how passionately I want to become a doctor,” she said. Going back to studies was easier said than done. She had studied physics and chemistry in engineering but had lost touch with biology. She put in 10-12 hours every day in the last year and joined a coaching class. "Initially it was tough. I had no friends to discuss and classes were online too. But eventually, I managed. I gave over 100 mock tests. In the beginning, I was getting around 590, but towards the end, I breached the 700 mark," she said. In NEET-2021, Goel scored 676 out of 720. Her parents were initially surprised but were very supportive later. She is hoping to get into one of the peripheral AIIMS or a government college in Mumbai. She has no qualms about joining a bunch of youngsters in her MBBS pursuit. "I will never get old in their company. They will have fresh energy and vibe and I am sure I will be able to absorb and make use of it," she added. "I am in this for the next 12 years, including my PG and super speciality. I am ready to slog to become something worthwhile," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-engineer-shifts-gears-hopes-to-be-doctor-at-35/articleshow/87690646.cms||Yogita Rao

Justice Prateek Jalan said that the political outfit, which sought ‘Tractor Chalata Kisan’ as its election symbol, approached the court with “unclean hands” and directed that the cost be deposited with Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within two weeks. The petitioner party informed the court that it had applied to the Election Commission for allotment of a common symbol, stating that ‘Tractor Chalata Kisan’ and ‘Letter Box’ were its first and second preferences, respectively. The Election Commission, however, contended that the petitioner was suppressing material facts as the symbol in question was not a free symbol and the same had also been notified by it. The high court opined that “suppression in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be countenanced” and observed that the petitioner annexed “an older version” of the EC documents to support its claim that the symbol was a free symbol and refused to accept the petitioner’s submission that the omission was unintentional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-1-lakh-fine-on-party-that-challenged-its-poll-symbol/articleshow/87691121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government has allowed the temple management committee to melt the gold and silver offered to the temple. The temple has over 28 kg of gold and 996 kg of silver. The government has set standard operating procedure (SOPs) to melt these metal offerings. Gajanan Gurav, the executive officer of Shri Vitthal-Rukhmini Mandir Samiti, said, “The ornaments with the temple were transferred to the management committee after the government took over in 1985. The government has allowed the melting of these ornaments and it will be done at the refinery of the government mint at Mumbai. The sorting of the ornaments will be videographed. The ornaments will be covered by insurance. After removing impurity, the pure metal will be converted into bricks and as the necessity arises, fresh ornaments will be designed.” He added that some ornaments have historical value and need conservation. The temple management has the records of gold and silver offerings made in 18th and 19th centuries, including those by Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore and the Peshwas of Pune. Former head of the temple management committee Anna Dange has claimed that the temple has ornaments donated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as well and he has written to the committee to not melt such offerings and instead preserve them. Gurav said, “We have no record of ornaments offered by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or during his reign in 17th century. However, we don’t deny that the ornaments may have been donated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. We have decided to preserve the ornaments of historic value.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/govt-okays-melting-of-gold-silver-offerings-made-to-pandharpur-temple/articleshow/87689833.cms||---

---||Delhi||Stop farm fires, ban vehicles, declare lockdown for a few days: SC||NEW DELHI: “How will people breathe?” asked the Supreme Court on Saturday while pushing the central government and the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent measures to reduce the AQI levels in the National Capital Region from the dangerous current levels of 500 to 200-300. The court added that if needed, a lockdown could be imposed besides getting the farmers to stop stubble burning for a few days. Track the pollution level in your citySolicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that as per the India Meteorological Department forecasts, the situation wasn’t going to improve till November 18 and that the governments had to take urgent measures to tackle the issue as per the policy devised. “The Centre has called an urgent meeting of the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to discuss emergency measures to be taken in the next few days,” Mehta said. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said all it wanted was to ensure cleaner air for the citizens. “You must tell us on Monday what steps were taken and the result thereof,” the court told the Centre and the states concerned. The bench said Delhi government appeared to be doing little to address the alarming air crisis in the capital. The CJI asked Delhi government, “We heard you had installed some smog towers. Are those towers working?” Justice Chandrachud added, “Delhi government has opened the schools and is exposing little children to this severe weather. Are the schools still open?” Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra pointed out that the AQI in the city was in the ‘good’ category till September 30 but deteriorated alarmingly since then to ‘dangerous’ levels. “Stubble burning is the main reason for this,” he said, discounting the bench’s apprehension that stubble burning coupled with pollution from other sources had weaved a toxic cocktail of atmosphere over NCR. Justice Surya Kant, who said that he and the CJI were farmers, objected to Delhi government blaming the farmers for the mess. “Be it petitioner or Delhi government, it has become a fashion today to indulge in farmer bashing. Has Delhi government imposed any ban on factories and construction activities in the past seven days? What is Delhi Police doing?” he asked. The CJI said, “Without indulging in blame games or politics, the Centre and state government must work in tandem to provide relief to the citizens. We all must be able to breathe.” Addressing Delhi government, the bench asked, “Why don’t you think of banning plying of vehicles except emergency vehicles? You find a way and talk to the central government for implementing this across NCR.” The Centre responded through Mehta, “The colour of the political party does not matter. It is a joint responsibility. Implementation has to be at the state level. We are coordinating and every state is cooperating. We are focussing on emergency response with the chief secretaries of the states.” Detailing the multi-mode action plan to curb stubble burning, the solicitor general said Uttar Pradesh planned to use the IARI, Pusa, bio-decomposer over 10 lakh acres of rice fields, Haryana in around a lakh acres, Punjab in 7,413 acres and in Delhi, 4,000 acres. “The application has been used so far in around 6.6 lakh acres in UP, including 91,500 acres in NCR districts, 1,357 acres in Delhi and 34,000 acres in Haryana,” Mehta informed. “Besides, Nurture Farms, a subsidiary of United Phosphorus Ltd, as CSR initiative, has sprayed the bio-decomposer in 1,71,449 acres in Punjab and 2,36,109 in Haryana.” The solicitor general added that under the In-situ Crop Residue Management Scheme, 2,00,000 baling machines were available. “Statutory directions for utilisation of paddy straw pellets/briquettes for co-firing in thermal power plants have been issued to all 11 thermal power plants within 300 km of Delhi,” he said. The SC agreed the policy decisions were fine but the problem lay in implementation. “Who will collect the stubble? What is the mechanism to put the stubble together and transport it for use as fuel in power stations and other industries? What is the economic arrangement?” it asked. “Whatever mechanism you create for collecting and transporting stubble, it must reach the farmers within a short window of 20 days. The policy is there. The problem is how you are implementing it. You appear to be still in the process of inviting tenders and other things.” Justices Chandrachud and Kant said, “So far as farmers are concerned, the problem is not enforcement, but incentivising. If they are adequately incentivised, why would farmers not switch to stubble disposal? You cannot enforce these things.” They added, “Landholdings in Punjab and Haryana are less than three acres and you cannot force farmers to purchase machinery. Why can’t the Centre and states provide stubble management machines?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-stop-farm-fires-ban-vehicles-declare-lockdown-for-a-few-days/articleshow/87691543.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The first-year students have to carry ward duties as part of their studies. There are about 100 seats for super-specialty courses in the state. The exam was earlier to be held on November 11 but it has been postponed to January 10, 2022. The MD doctor quoted earlier said he was offered a job at a corporate hospital in Ahmedabad but he could not join due to repeated delays in NEET SS exam. “The term for first-year students starts in September-October, but this time it is not likely to start before March next year. So, the second-year students will have handle duties of junior doctors for another six months,” he said. Another aspirant who wants to join the three-year super specialty course said his studies for a PG medical programme ended in July and he is waiting for the NEET SS exams. “For the last ten years there has been some issue or the other during exams,” said the PG qualified doctor. The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences had originally planned to conduct the NEET SS 2021 in a new pattern. Forty-one PG-qualified doctors moved the Supreme Court of India, stating that the last-minute changes will have an adverse effect on the candidates. The Supreme Court came down heavily stating that it cannot make last-minute changes to such an important exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neet-ss-delay-senior-residents-bear-juniors-load/articleshow/87690642.cms||---

UFERWAS has chosen a theme on ‘climate change’ and presented a paper titled ‘Pray for Hyderabad’ at the two-day annual NCRWA meet. “As Hyderabad had witnessed a massive flood in October 2020, we have focused on climate change. Floods in various parts of India, landslides, cloudburst in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, excessive rainfall in terrains collectively indicate the increasing intensity of the extreme weather events across the Indian landscape,” UFERWAS general secretary BT Srinivasan said. “Experts warn that we can no longer ignore the climate change footprint, as it is going to be a part of our daily routine. They say the monsoon rains would increase further with an increase in the global temperatures,” he explained. UFERWAS said residents must ask their elected representatives in Parliament and assembly constituencies as well as civic body councillors and city mayors to take measures against climate change. “A prosperous future depends on their decisions on environment, green spaces, roads, cycling infrastructure, waste and recycling, air quality and energy-efficient homes. Ultimately, steps to reduce carbon emissions will have a positive impact on local issues, like improving air quality and public health, creating jobs and reducing inequality,” a member of UFERWAS said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uferwas-to-take-part-in-up-meet-focus-on-climate-change/articleshow/87690643.cms||Sunil Mungara

If they don’t cough up their dues, the water board will disconnect their water and sewerage connections. The water board’s revenue dipped by Rs 80 crore per month post the launch of the 20-KL free water supply scheme. Though the board is unable to clear nearly Rs 1,500 crore power dues to TSSPDCL, it is paying regular monthly power bills to avoid interruption in the water supplies. To improve revenue collection, HMWS&SB management has asked general managers of 20 operation and maintenance (O&M) divisions to collect pending dues by December. “We are mounting pressure on the defaulters to pay up,” a senior HMWS&SB official, who tackled the revenue wing earlier, said. In O&M Division-III (Tolichowki & Gudimalkapur), the water board used to receive Rs 60 lakh revenue per month, now for the past couple of months, it has gone up to Rs 1-1.5 crore per month. “A reputed women’s college at Mehdipatnam had been paying Rs 700 per month under domestic category for more than three decades. Now, we have changed the water connection to commercial category and issuing Rs 60,000 bill per month,” deputy general manager (NRW), O&M Division-III, MA Kabir told TOI. A register was being maintained to receive complaints from consumers and resolve them, the official added. In this division, nearly Rs 300-500 crore worth dues were pending and now the water board staff started collecting them on a case to case basis, the deputy GM said, adding that they hope to collect it within three to six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-board-eyes-defaulters-to-fill-coffers-over-2l-under-lens/articleshow/87690653.cms||Sunil Mungara

This crucial link will connect Metro services from PCMC to Shivajinagar (between Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune).

---||Nashik||Chandrakant Patil: MVA govt unable to control violence||Nashik: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Saturday alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had failed to control the violence that took place at Malegaon, Nanded and Amravati on Friday. Patil was in Nashik city on Saturday to inaugurate a Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) school building in the Satpur area. Addressing a gathering, Patil claimed that when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra, no one dared to unleash any violence. “But the scenario has changed under the MVA. The present government was unable to act tough against the elements responsible for Friday’s violence due to vote bank politics. Patil also criticised Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who blamed BJP for the violence. “For every problem that the MVA government faces, it conveniently blames the BJP, and not resolve them. Be it the MSRTC employees strike or Friday’s violence, the MVA leaders hold BJP responsible. In fact, had Balasaheb Thackeray been alive, he would have been tough on Raut for making irresponsible statements,” said Patil. According to him, former CM Devendra Fadnavis, during his tenure, had done remarkable development work. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi could transform Gujarat as he was the chief minister of that state for 15 years and had adequate time. If Fadnavis gets such a long duration, he would surely transform Maharashtra. Shiv Sena, our alliance partner in the previous government, broke the trust and walked away from that alliance,” he added, Stating that the MVA government is unable to undertake any development work, Patil criticized the MVA for the alleged corruption by some ministers, rise in women’s harassment cases and youths being addicted to drugs. “BJP will come to power in the state. And our party will win the next parliamentary polls with a convincing margin,” he claimed. ‘BJP will win NMC polls’ Patil said that the BJP, which is in control of the Nashik Municipal Corporation, will win the civic polls next year. He claimed the party will win more than 100 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chandrakant-patil-mva-govt-unable-to-control-violence/articleshow/87689854.cms||Tushar Pawar

SMS Medical College doctors said obese people, who just got diabetes, can get rid of it by losing a lot of weight. "It is a general conception that diabetes is not reversible. But, it can be reversed in case of obese people. A recently diagnosed obese person can get rid of it after reducing 10-15 kgs. It can be done by controlling diet and working out," said Dr Prakash Keswani, a senior professor at SMS Medical College. "While doing so, the person has to keep in mind that he or she should not develop hypoglycemia, a condition in which blood glucose falls suddenly below the prescribed limits," said the doctor. "In patients, who did not have diabetes before they got infected with Covid-19, reversal of diabetes is possible. Such patients have transient diabetes and it gets reversed with time. Covid-19 affects the beta cells in the pancreas, which causes diabetes. Also, use of steroids can cause diabetes," said Dr Sailesh Lodha, senior endocrinologist at a private hospital.He said during the pandemic a lot of patients, who had borderline diabetes, got full-blown diabetes due to the Covid-19 infection and use of steroids. "Steroids stimulate glucose production by the liver and inhibit peripheral glucose uptake resulting in insulin resistance. There aren’t any studies yet, but there have been cases where the patient got diagnosed with diabetes recently after a Covid19 infection," said, Dr Manoj Khandelwal, consultant at a private hospital’s endocrinology department.Doctors appealed to the people not to lead a sedentary lifestyle as it increased the risk of lifestyle diseases. "Due to diabetes, there has been a rapid increase in heart-related diseases. High blood sugar is directly related to heart diseases. A diabetic patient always needs to be careful. Diabetic patients have to take care of routines and regular eating habits," said Dr Ankit Mathu, a senior cardiac surgeon at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-triggered-diabetes-can-be-reversed-considerably-say-docs/articleshow/87691552.cms||---

The district units of Madurai City, Trichy city, Trichy Urban, Karur, Perambalur, Villupuram, Chengalpet and Coimbatore (North) have got new presidents. Former MLA P Saravanan, who quit the DMK and joined the BJP ahead of the assembly polls, is the president of Madurai city unit. Yet another revamp is expected on Sunday, said party sources.“In a phased manner, presidents of 20-30 units will be replaced to infuse young blood. The new appointments will be made with the concurrence of the national leadership. The number of party district units will be increased by bifurcating party district units like Chengalpet and Villupuram. The number of units will be increased to keep it on a par with the DMK (77) and AIADMK (75),” said a core committee member.Another state-level leader said functionaries with RSS background would be given more responsibility in the party. “The whole exercise is being carried out keeping the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in mind,” he said.

---||Ahmedabad||Pharma firms’ US revenues shrink again||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat-based top pharmaceutical companies’ revenues from the US market have remained under pressure for the third consecutive quarter in 2021. Increased competition and subsequent price erosion in existing products adversely impacted their sales in the US market for the quarter ended September. Vadodara-based Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited (APL)’s revenues from the US market declined40% to Rs 348 crore in September quarter from Rs 582 crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited’s revenues from the US eased 13% to Rs 284 crore in the quarter ended September 30 from Rs 327 crore in the same quarter last year. Another pharma major from Ahmedabad, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group, registered a 12% drop in revenues in the US, the world’s largest pharma market, at Rs 1,498 crore during the September quarter. The company had clocked a revenues of Rs 1,709 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year. These companies had also reported lower US market sales in the previous two quarters as well. These companies attributed heightened competition and tough pricing scenario to the muted sales from the US market. According to Alembic Pharma’s investor presentation, increased competition in the US market led to price erosion in some large products during the first six months of the current financial year. “Sales (from US market) were lower due to price erosion in the base business and lack of new approvals pending re-inspection of facilities,” Torrent Pharma had said while announcing its financial result for the quarter. According to industry players, the competition in the US market has intensified with more and more generic products being approved. The new players are pricing their products aggressively, which is exerting pressure on the existing players to reduce prices of their already approved products. The pharma firms, however, posted healthy growth in the domestic market, which helped them offset lower US revenues. Alembic Pharma’s India business revenues surged 23% to Rs 509 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal. Torrent Pharma’s India market revenues rose 13% to Rs 1,087 crore and Cadila Healthcare’s sales (human formulations and consumer wellness) rose 12% to Rs 1,591 crore during the quarter under review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pharma-firms-us-revenues-shrink-again/articleshow/87690702.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Chennai||Mullaperiyar is a matter of continuous supervision: SC||NEW DELHI/CHENNAI: The issue pertaining to the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam is a matter of “continuous supervision,” the Supreme Court said on Saturday, and asked the Tamil Nadu government to keep the seepage data of the dam ready for the court’s perusal, if required. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar observed that there should not be any adversarial approach in the matter and it would look into the issues and then take a call. “You must appreciate that this is not a one-time consideration matter,” the bench told senior advocate Shekhar Naphade appearing for Tamil Nadu. Naphade told the bench that all the data and details were there before the supervisory committee which has considered them from time to time. “It does not matter. You keep it ready for our perusal, if required,” the bench told the senior advocate. “Our only difficulty is that your lordships will find that petitions after petitions are being filed only to keep us harassing,” Naphade said, adding, “This is one more attempt to keep the pot boiling.” “If there is some evolving situation, how it has been addressed or how it will be addressed, are matters which will be looked into,” the bench observed. “If there is some input available, we will have a look at it and then we will proceed,” the court said, adding, “Ultimately, we will go by the expert committee opinion.” Naphade said Tamil Nadu was not taking anything adversarial in the matter. “This is part of campaign in social media. This is nothing else,” he said. The counsel appearing for the petitioner Joe Joseph and others who has raised issues including on seepage data, said the matter relates to lives and properties of about 50 lakh people and while five districts of Tamil Nadu need water, five districts of Kerala need protection from the dam, which he claimed was not safe. Based on the request of Kerala government’s counsel, the court posted the matter for further hearing on November 22. Meanwhile, the interim arrangement would continue based on the water level notified by the expert committee, the court said. The Kerala government had recently told the apex court that “no amount of rejuvenation” can perpetuate the dam and there is a limit to the number of years one can keep dams in service through maintenance and strengthening measurers. It had said the only permanent solution for removing the “eternal threat owing to the safety concerns” of the dam and for protecting the safety of lakhs of people living in the downstream of Mullaperiyar dam is to build a new dam in the downstream reaches of the existing dam. Tamil Nadu, in its affidavit filed on Friday, said Kerala was giving scant regard to the directions of the Supreme Court’s supervisory committee. It said Kerala was continuing with its “obstructionist attitude” and preventing the state from carrying out activities related to the safety of Mullaperiyar dam. The state government said that it was regulating the reservoir as per the Upper Rule Level finalised by the Central Water Commission of the Union Jal Shakti ministry. It said that cutting of trees for enabling strengthening of the baby dam was not permitted by Kerala despite repeated directions of the supervisory committee. “The permission is eluding. In the minutes of the meeting held on October 26, Kerala government agreed to expedite all pending forest clearance for maintenance of approach road and carrying out the balance strengthening works,” Tamil Nadu said. It also recorded the receipt of the tree-felling order from Kerala’s principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden dated November 5. But it was subsequently cancelled by Kerala government. Tamil Nadu said that strengthening works at the Baby dam has been thwarted by Kerala for over 16 years since the apex court’s ruling in February 2006. Despite repeated follow up on power connection to Mullaperiyar dam since 2000, the same was restored only in 2021. While Kerala agreed in 2015 to install rain gauge stations in the catchment areas of the dam for inflow forecasting system, the state installed it only in 2020 but had not shared the data till date. Kerala did not allow collection of data regularly from Thanikodi and Mullaikodi rainfall stations installed by Tamil Nadu. Repeated assertion of Kerala and petitioners from the state filed from time to time, among other things, seek decommissioning of existing dam and construction of a new dam, which was “wholly impermissible” in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court on the safety of the dam. “The dam has been found to be hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe,” Tamil Nadu said, pointing to three apex court orders in 2006, 2014 and 2018. The supervisory committee had been regularly recommending strengthening measures to the Baby dam as per court orders. Tamil Nadu government said the dam was checked for seismic forces that would possibly occur in the zone, where the dam was situated and it was found to be safe by the Central Water Power and Research Station, Pune, a Central government agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mullaperiyar-is-a-matter-of-continuous-supervision-sc/articleshow/87691179.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Agra||'Unknown policemen' booked for murder as dad accuses 5 cops in complaint||Agra: Four days after the death of Mohammad Altaf, 22, in police custody, his father Chand Miyan met the superintendent of police (SP) of Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod, to file a complaint on the basis of which an FIR has now been lodged against "unknown policemen" who have been charged with murder under IPC section 302. Miyan has accused five policemen for killing his son. They are station house officer Virendra Singh Indolia, sub-inspector Chandresh Gautam, sub-inspector Vikas Kumar, head moharrir (clerk) Dhanendra Singh, and constable Saurabh Solanki. All five had earlier been suspended for “negligence on duty” after news of Altaf's death in custody spread. Altaf's uncle, who accompanied Miyan to the SP's office, alleged that they were not provided with a copy of the complaint and were told to "go home". "They said that a copy of the FIR will be provided to us soon," he added. Police claimed that the FIR was lodged on the basis of an "earlier complaint received from Altaf's father by post". The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, is dated November 11 and doesn't mention the names of any policeman. “We were not aware of the names of the policemen at the time the first complaint was sent by post,” said Altaf's uncle. The SP explained: "The fresh complaint will be included in the existing FIR. Following an investigation, the names of all the policemen involved in the matter will be added. A special team has been constituted to investigate the case.” Chand Miyan said, “It is now clear that the FIR against my son was registered after his death. If he was found hanging at 2:30 pm, as the police claim, why was he taken to the hospital after 90 minutes? The police proposed a wrong theory about him being depressed and committing suicide to hide their crimes. My son was brutally murdered in police custody. I have filed a police complaint and the SP has assured me that he will take suitable action.” According to the police, Altaf, accused of kidnapping a Hindu girl, was found hanging in the lock-up's bathroom at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead after roughly 15 minutes. The FIR against Altaf says that the case was registered on Tuesday at 4 pm, much later than his time of death. Earlier in the week, a letter with the thumb impression of Chand Miyan went viral on social media. It stated, “My son Altaf committed suicide when he was taken by the police for questioning in a case. He was depressed. The police took him to the hospital but he died there. I don’t have any complaints against the police, nor do my family or I want any investigation in the matter.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said he was "detained" at the Goraha police outpost after the death of his son. “The police made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by policemen. I was asked to give a thumb impression and was told that if I don't do it, the dead body of my son will not be handed over to me and I will not be allowed to leave. I had no idea what was written in it,” the complaint said. “I was pressured to put a thumb impression on the letter.” Miyan's complaint says Altaf's height was more than 5.5 feet. However, the FIR says that his height was "around 5 feet.” The police had earlier claimed that Altaf had “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." The tap was less than 3 feet in height. Azad Samaj Party (ASP) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who had accompanied the family along with a delegation of local leaders to file the complaint, said, “The case was registered after Altaf's father met the SP and handed over a fresh complaint letter. Not naming the accused policemen is highly condemnable." On the basis of a complaint by a Rampur-based RTI activist, Danish Khan, the National Human Rights Commission has registered a complaint into the custodial death. Taking suo motu cognizance, the National Commission for Minorities has also issued a notice to the UP government and state police chief, seeking a detailed response on the death of Altaf at the Sadar Kotwali Police Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/unknown-policemen-booked-for-murder-as-dad-accuses-5-cops-in-complaint/articleshow/87690699.cms||Deepak Lavania

Jha, who was also a web portal reporter, had been kidnapped by four men near his house at Lohia Chowk on November 9 night. His body was handed over to the family after autopsy on Saturday. His brother Chandra Shekhar had lodged an FIR suspecting that Jha was kidnapped by those illegal healthcare clinic owners whom he had exposed, the police said. Jha had filed RTI applications and reportedly written articles on his web portal against illegal and unauthorised clinics, hospitals and healthcare establishments in his area. He had even submitted several petitions to Madhubani DM against such establishments running without any licence after which many of them were either shut by the administration or fined, police sources said. When asked, Benipatti SDPO Arun Kumar Singh on Saturday told this newspaper that raids were on to nab those involved in Jha’s killing. A police officer from Madhubani said Jha was strangled. “It was revealed in the postmortem. The body was identified by family members on the basis of a ring he had in one of his fingers, a mole in his leg and charred remains of his red shirt which he had been wearing on November 9,” he said. The officer said it seems he was murdered somewhere else and the criminals burned his body there as the grass and bushes were also charred. The officer said two persons, including the one who runs a private clinic, had been detained for interrogation on Saturday. “Prima facie we suspect that Jha was murdered due to his RTI activities which had resulted in action against several private clinics in Benipatti,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rti-activist-killed-in-madhubani-dist/articleshow/87689908.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Increased pollution, weather causing serious illnesses among citizens: Doctors, weather experts||PRAYAGRAJ: With the onset of winters, the danger of pollution has increased in the city which are causing various ailments among the denizens. From breathing related problems, which are damaging heart and lungs, to heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory infections as well as infections of eye and skin, pollution coupled with the weather are causing serious health issues. In this backdrop, TOI spoke to number of medicos, officials of transport department and weather experts to bring out a clear picture on what harm the pollution can do to us. Dr MK Madnani, former president of AMA, says, “Asthma is a respiratory disease caused by environmental pollution wherein the person feels difficulty in breathing, a feeling of pressure in the chest and cough, causing phlegm. These are caused from allergies, quality of air being foremost of them.” Air pollution could be fatal for the eyes too. According to ophthalmologist, Dr Kamaljeet Singh, “Pollution affects the cells of the eyes, due to which the problem of dryness, redness and pain increases in the eyes. Due to the presence of elements like nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the polluted air, there is more damage to the eyes.” He says that it is very important to protect the eyes from poisonous air. Avoid stepping out of the house unnecessarily due to excessive pollution, he added. According to kidney specialist Dr Anurag Singh, “Environmental pollution is extremely dangerous for the kidney as well. Heavy metals floating in the air and reaching the body through food get trapped in the kidneys. In recent times, the prevalence of kidney diseases has increased due to pollution. If we start getting clean air and water, then not only the kidney but also the spread of many diseases will be reduced.” Senior dermatologist of the city, Dr KG Singh says, “Pollution in the air is dangerous for the skin as this devoids the skin of its moisture and leads to various problems including redness, rosacea and eczema. Due to this, fine lines, wrinkles and spots start appearing before time. There are also dark spots on the face.” Pollution from vehicles too is a major contributor to air pollution. “Vehicles are being checked regularly but still lot of awareness has to be spread. People should participate in the workshops conducted by us and understand how they can save the environment. The department is continuously taking action in collaboration with the Pollution Control Board,” says Regional Transport Officer (RTO), Prayagraj, RK Maurya. According to Regional Environment Officer RK Singh, “Weather too is deteriorating air quality index in the city as because of lack of a bit strong winds (blowing at a speed of 10-15 kmph) pollution could have been less. Firecrackers in Diwali too are responsible for this.” Still the situation is improving as incident of stubble burning has come down drastically in the district and we are monitoring the constructions sites too, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/increased-pollution-weather-causing-serious-illnesses-among-citizens-docs-weather-experts/articleshow/87689321.cms||---

Inaugurating the seminar, Justice Saral Srivastava, Allahabad High Court said, “The surveyor is an important link between the insurance company and the insurance holder. The insured can be satisfied only by their fair and quick loss assessment. For this, continuous organisation of training seminars is necessary.” Bipin Kumar Shukla, national treasurer of ISLA, while presiding over the function, said the Parliament has made a provision in the Insurance Act that only a member of ISLA can be an insurance surveyor and due to this responsibility, the institute has organised a seminar to give updated information to its members. He said even during the Corona period, ISLA conducted more than a hundred online trainings. He said due to the functioning of IRDA at present, insurance surveyors are facing problems in renewal of licenses. For this, the MPs have also complained to the Finance Ministry.

---||Goa||Para-teachers now claim last 6 months’ salaries not paid||Poinguinim: The 129 para-teachers, scattered across Goa, have resumed their protest at Azad Maidan in Panaji, claiming that the state government has not paid them salaries for the past six months. The teachers had begun their protest earlier this month but suspended it on Diwali eve after chief minister Pramod Sawant assured to hike their salaries. The teachers, however, state that their demands go beyond a hike in salary. The para-teachers said that besides their salaries being pending over the last six months, their jobs should be considered for regularisation given the long period for which they have rendered their services, albeit on contractual basis. The para-teachers’ spokesperson Smita Desai said that the chief minister had made a promise on the floor of the legislative assembly to resolve the teachers’ issues. However, nothing has changed in reality, she said. The teachers said that they have been working for the last 15 years, alternating between teaching in two schools, but the government has not considered regularisation of their services. “The CM had announced in the House in July this year that our salaries would be hiked and that we will be paid for 12 months a year, instead of just 10. It is, however, sad that we have not even been paid for the last six months,” said Desai. The para teachers are employed under the Goa Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, funded by the central government. The teachers said they have been appointed starting 2006 after successfully completing the directorate of education’s selection process, meeting the set criteria. They have later also undergone in-service training, said Desai. “As the para teachers are appointed under a Central government scheme, there should be sufficient funds available for payment of salaries, yet it is hard to understand why we have not been paid for six months,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/para-teachers-now-claim-last-6-months-salaries-not-paid/articleshow/87691206.cms||---

---||India||Turkey protests COP26 ‘special treatment’ to India||NEW DELHI: During the Glasgow climate summit, while the focus obviously was on the challenge facing humanity and the inadequacy of efforts to tackle it, a sideshow was also unfolding. The UK, the host, found itself in an awkward spot when Turkey protested against the “special treatment” accorded to one “country” — its ire was directed at India. With Glasgow lacking in wherewithal to host a mega global event of this scale, the UK government has urged delegations to share hotels. Likewise, buses were organised to take the heads of governments to the venue of the conference. Exceptions, however, were made for three countries — the host, the US and India. They were allowed to stay in hotels they had booked exclusively for themselves, while their leaders — Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Narendra Modi — reached the venue on November 1 in motorcades. The protocol differential did not go down well, at least with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who, according to sources here, made his displeasure known. The Turkish leader, who, many observers feel, has meticulously been outfitting himself as the new Caliph, questioned what he considered to be the privileged treatment of India, sources said. Sources said the Turkish leader stayed aloof from the proceedings as a mark of protest, in what can further strain the already tense bilateral equations. Officials, however, justified the asymmetry by saying that it was an acknowledgment of the efforts India has lately made to shake off “part of the problem” tag in respect of the climate crisis and to transit to among those who are seen as earnestly working for its resolution. It launched the International Solar Alliance — the US chose to join the grouping during the Glasgow conference — in 2015 ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure at the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in 2019. Besides, PM Modi has assiduously projected his initiatives — Swachh Bharat, Ujjwala, Namami Gange — as part of the fight against the threat to climate and environmental degradation. The PM, being a veteran on the global circuit with enough familiarity with the “summit craft”, was of course, also a factor. In any case, few could have grudged the attention India grabbed after setting the bold target to bring down projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030. The ambitious goal came as a surprise, but, sources said, was absolutely necessary to come out of the unhappy situation where the country was getting tarred as the “third-largest polluter” despite having a measly 4% share of global greenhouse emissions between 1870 and 2019. Though dishonest, it could not have been ignored in view of the potency that climate threat has acquired in the global discourse and which gets reflected in the influence of outfits like the Green Party, celebrity activists as well as the emergence of “green concerns” as a factor in shareholder activism in the West. But even as he engaged with it, the PM reminded the leading polluters, China and the US, as well as the developed West of their commitment to “common but differentiated responsibilities” or, simply put, the moral obligation of the rich countries to provide “measurable” funds to poor and developing countries for adaptation and mitigation. India, which also took up cudgels for the island countries who are facing existential threat because of the rising ocean levels, is obviously hopeful of getting a fair share of the funds from developed countries and benefiting from the gradual switch to the green era characterised by renewables, electric vehicles, green hydrogen and other technologies which are sure to spell more jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/turkey-protests-cop26-special-treatment-to-india/articleshow/87692009.cms||---
---||World||Turkey protests COP26 ‘special treatment’ to India||NEW DELHI: During the Glasgow climate summit, while the focus obviously was on the challenge facing humanity and the inadequacy of efforts to tackle it, a sideshow was also unfolding. The UK, the host, found itself in an awkward spot when Turkey protested against the “special treatment” accorded to one “country” — its ire was directed at India. With Glasgow lacking in wherewithal to host a mega global event of this scale, the UK government has urged delegations to share hotels. Likewise, buses were organised to take the heads of governments to the venue of the conference. Exceptions, however, were made for three countries — the host, the US and India. They were allowed to stay in hotels they had booked exclusively for themselves, while their leaders — Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Narendra Modi — reached the venue on November 1 in motorcades. The protocol differential did not go down well, at least with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who, according to sources here, made his displeasure known. The Turkish leader, who, many observers feel, has meticulously been outfitting himself as the new Caliph, questioned what he considered to be the privileged treatment of India, sources said. Sources said the Turkish leader stayed aloof from the proceedings as a mark of protest, in what can further strain the already tense bilateral equations. Officials, however, justified the asymmetry by saying that it was an acknowledgment of the efforts India has lately made to shake off “part of the problem” tag in respect of the climate crisis and to transit to among those who are seen as earnestly working for its resolution. It launched the International Solar Alliance — the US chose to join the grouping during the Glasgow conference — in 2015 ahead of the Paris Climate Change Conference, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure at the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in 2019. Besides, PM Modi has assiduously projected his initiatives — Swachh Bharat, Ujjwala, Namami Gange — as part of the fight against the threat to climate and environmental degradation. The PM, being a veteran on the global circuit with enough familiarity with the “summit craft”, was of course, also a factor. In any case, few could have grudged the attention India grabbed after setting the bold target to bring down projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030. The ambitious goal came as a surprise, but, sources said, was absolutely necessary to come out of the unhappy situation where the country was getting tarred as the “third-largest polluter” despite having a measly 4% share of global greenhouse emissions between 1870 and 2019. Though dishonest, it could not have been ignored in view of the potency that climate threat has acquired in the global discourse and which gets reflected in the influence of outfits like the Green Party, celebrity activists as well as the emergence of “green concerns” as a factor in shareholder activism in the West. But even as he engaged with it, the PM reminded the leading polluters, China and the US, as well as the developed West of their commitment to “common but differentiated responsibilities” or, simply put, the moral obligation of the rich countries to provide “measurable” funds to poor and developing countries for adaptation and mitigation.

---||Allahabad||Principals in fix over new OMR sheet mandate for class 9 exams||Prayagraj: The principals of government and government-aided secondary schools, which are recognised by the UP Board, are in a fix over the Board’s decision to conduct the half-yearly and annual exams of class 9 partly on OMR sheets as no extra budget has been allocated for the new system. As per the principals who would be holding the exams as per the Board directives following a government order, they are now needed to get the question papers printed, procure answer-sheets for descriptive questions and OMR sheets for answering of multiple choice questions by the students, all within Rs 25 that they are allowed to collect from students as exam fee. In such a situation, the principals have already expressed their inability to conduct the examination partly on the OMR sheets to UP Board. State president of the Principals’ Council, Brajesh Sharma said that though the principals welcome the new system, for implementing it the state government should also provide a specific budget. “Already, the expenses of all online work are being borne by the institutions and it is not possible to bear extra expenditure of OMR sheets also by them,” he claimed while talking to TOI on Friday. Under the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020, the UP Board has made it mandatory to conduct a part of half-yearly and annual examination of class 9 on OMR sheets from this academic session. This has been done so that the students can be prepared for future competitive examinations. Under this new system, now the class 9 question paper of 70 marks for the written examination has been divided into two parts: The first part of the question paper will have multiple-choice questions of 20 marks which students will have to answer on the OMR sheet while the second part will have descriptive questions of 50 marks which students will have to answer on conventional answer sheets. In these question papers, questions related to higher-order thinking skills will also be included. UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla has already sent instructions in this regard to all the district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) on November 2. According to the annual calendar released by the UP Board on August 14, the half-yearly examinations are to be held in November and the annual examinations are to be held in February 2022. Though UP Board officials are reluctant to comment on the issue as any decision with regard to a budget for government-aided schools in this regard can be taken by the state government only. A delegation of principals of government-aided institutions did meet UP Board secretary on November 9 in this very regard, said Murarji Tripathi, principal of Sarvarya Inter College, Bahadurganj, who was part of the delegation “The UP Board secretary has said that the sample of OMR sheet to be used in class 9 examinations from this session has been uploaded on the Board’s official website. He made clear that for this, no provision has been made by the government for charging any additional fee, which is also an area of concern for us,” Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/principals-in-fix-over-new-omr-sheet-mandate-for-class-9-exams/articleshow/87689325.cms||---

The general body of the NMC, during its meeting on Friday, gave its nod to the civic administration to go ahead with the project. During his visit to Nashik last month, Union highways and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had suggested the local administration to come up with a transport logistics park to decongest the city roads. He had also assured help from his ministry for the same. NMC officials said there is an existing parking lot for trucks built on 60 acre land in Adgaon. NMC is in the process of acquiring another 15 acre for its expansion. The civic body will scout for the remaining 45 acre land, which will be used for the logistics park where proper infrastructure will be set up.Mayor Satish Kulkarni said, “We already have the truck terminus land in Adgaon on Mumbai-Agra National Highway. We are planning to provide this land for the proposed logistics park to be set up by the Centre through its funds. According to the transporters, the proposed logistics park will help ease traffic congestion due to the heavy vehicles. Moreover, warehouses in the logistics park will enable storage, processing and transportation of the various agricultural produce. It will also boost the transportation of industrial goods using the expressway. The park will be at the intersection of the Mumbai-Agra National Highway and Surat-Chennai corridor, which will help in better transportation of the goods. It will not only help the businesses, but also increase employment opportunities. The corridor will pass through Nashik district. It will enter Nashik district through Surgana taluka and exit through Satana taluka after crossing 122.1 km through 61 villages in six talukas of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/logistics-park-planned-at-adgaon/articleshow/87689324.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||State may integrate Covid vax drive into regular immunisation plan in Dec||Panaji: The state government may shut all centres that exclusively offer the Covid-19 vaccine next month, and integrate the inoculation drive into its regular immunisation programme. The directorate of health services has moved a file to the government in this regard, so that its staff can productively be used for the implementation of other national health programmes, now that over 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. The integration will mean that citizens won’t be able to walk into any vaccination centre in their vicinity on any day of the week, as immunisation takes places on fixed days at various health centres. On Saturday, the government conducted a mega-vaccination drive that saw over 9,000 persons get the jab, almost twice the 5,000-odd who receive the vaccine on other days. The first dose was administered to 1,365 people and the second to 7,496. In centres that saw very few people turn up for the jab, health staffers went to the homes of people with disabilities and those of advanced age. As of Saturday, 9,68,961 persons in Goa are fully-vaccinated and 2,81,156 have taken just the first dose. Health centres are drawing up lists of names of those who can’t make it to vaccination centres, so that there’s no wastage once the team is out on the field. “Once there is a long list in hand, healthcare workers can move from house to house to vaccinate beneficiaries so that there’s no vaccine wastage,” a doctor said. One vial of the Covishield vaccine contains at least ten doses, and once opened, must be used within four hours. The state government has relied on the Covishielf vaccine for its drive. The health department also plans to have a survey done to find out where 100% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated. This data will be shared with the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-may-integrate-covid-vax-drive-into-regular-immunisation-plan-in-dec/articleshow/87691209.cms||---

The state recorded 23 new infections on Saturday, with 2,705 samples tested. New infections have remained under the 50-mark for three weeks now. Active cases, too, have been under 300 for the sixth consecutive day. Over the past week of November 6-12, South Goa’s positivity rate fell below 1%, to 0.76%. North Goa’s was slightly higher, at 1.76%. One of the day’s two mortalities, a 68-year-old who had hypertension and tested positive on the day he was admitted, died within 24 hours of admission. He had symptoms eight days earlier. The second mortality was that of a 65-year-old woman from Sindhudurg, who died after 25 days in hospital. She was morbidly obese and also had type-2 diabetes. She tested positive the day she was admitted, and had complained of symptoms four days before that. In North Goa and South Goa, 59% and 60% of the positive cases respectively were detected via rapid antigen testing, and the rest via RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, four more persons were hospitalised, and 18 opted for home isolation. Two were discharged, and 36 recovered over the past 24 hours, the recovery rate rising to 97.96%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-more-succumb-to-covid-recovery-rate-nudging-98/articleshow/87691207.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||All that glitters is still gold||AHMEDABAD: Right from the gold standard to the maxim “old is gold”, and from the golden ratio to gold pass for events, the luminous treasure is ubiquitous. It is found in film titles such as “Mackenna’s Gold”, “Goldfinger”, and “The Gold Rush.” It serves as a pejorative noun, “gold digger”; marks out a champion who gets a gold medal; and defines an era of prosperity as the “golden age”. What makes the ‘noble metal’ so alluring? Satish Deodhar, a professor of economics at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), in his latest working paper ‘Gold is Old: Noble Metal in Indian Economy through Ages’ tracks India’s obsession with the metal and its religious and social significance. He says that while Hinduism has a deep connection between gold and Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess even finds mention in other India-originated religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. The goddess is often depicted as a deity with a stream of gold coins flowing from one of her hands. Minting gold coins may have started before 7th century BCE in India, experts believe. But the Vedas and Jataka tales, thought to be much older, mention gold coins. However, after the easily panned gold deposits primarily found from the riverbeds dried up, silver and copper became the predominant materials to mint coins in the subcontinent. But over the centuries, the lure of the yellow metal has remained undimmed. Kings hoard it, philanthropists donate it to socio-religious institutions, and people rush to buy it on days considered auspicious such as Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras. “We have a concept of stree-dhan (wealth of the woman) associated with gold. In many cultures, the right over gold rests with a woman and not the household,” said Prof Deodhar. “Thus, gold became an integral part of dowry in the Indian society as a cushion against adversity.” But the multi-millennia association of gold with sacredness, the continued obsession of Indians with gold jewellery, and their perception of gold as a permanent store of value has come at a cost, mentions the paper. Even today, Indian imports of gold account for Rs 2.5 trillion annually. The new uses for gold are pushing up its price. For example, a modern smartphone contains about 0.034 gram of gold as an efficient and corrosion-free conductor of current. It’s also used in other electronic goods and appliances and even in space tech. “Thus, from ayurveda to the space shuttle, the requirement of gold may increase,” mentions the paper. “Given this context, most of the gargantuan stock of India’s idle gold cannot be viewed as accumulated savings but hoardings,” said Prof Deodhar. “Possessing gold is considered as an auspicious act and Indians seem to view gold as a ‘permanent abode of purchasing power’.” The professor added: “Therefore, the government will have to adopt an effective economic policy that recycles the stock of idle gold and channels it for productive purposes through financial markets.” Prof Deodhar suggested revitalizing the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS) which, till 2018, had been able to attract only 11 tonnes of gold. “The nudging could happen by providing information that the gold deposits are not only secure with banks but they earn an interest of about 2.5%,” said the paper. “[It can also be pointed out] that there is no wealth tax, capital gains tax, and income tax on valuation, appreciation and interest, respectively and that customers have the flexibility either to take cash or gold at the end of the deposit tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/all-that-glitters-is-still-gold/articleshow/87690750.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Rs 40 crore misappropriation alleged in Ganga Kalyana Scheme||BALLARI: Ganga Kalyana is one of the welfare schemes to facilitate poor and small farmers to dig borewells so their dry land is made fit for irrigation. But irregularities in its implementation have deprived many beneficiaries of its benefits. In Ballari district, about Rs 40 crore is said to have been misappropriated. The council parliamentary committee, led by chairman Y A Narayanaswamy, has discovered the scam during its recent visit to the district. The committee members also visited some farmlands and inspected the borewells. Besides expressing their disappointment over the irregularities, they have directed the ZP CEO to send a detailed report regarding the irregularities. According to sources, Dr B R Ambedkar, Valmiki, D Devaraj Urs, Adi Jambhava, and Tanda development corporations have dug over 6,000 borewells to individual farmer-beneficiaries since 2015. The corporations were also supposed to provide submersible pumps, pipes, and electricity connections. The committee has found that over 2,000 beneficiaries in different taluks could not lift water from borewells due to the absence of electricity connection and submersible pumps. Narayanaswamy said the Ganga Kalyana Scheme is supposed to help poor and backward farmers in getting water for irrigation. “But in Ballari district, the scheme has lost its meaning because of the scam by officers and borewell agencies. During physical inspection of borewells in different taluks, we found over 99 % borewells with false measurement in documents. Private borewell agencies have have claimed to have dug 620 feet while in reality it is 420 feet. The agencies have also siphoned off government funds meant for casing pipes,” he explained. He also cited the example of a borewell dug for a beneficiary of D Devaraj Urs Development Corporation at Halkundi village in Ballari taluk. Even when the agency had dug to a depth of 340 feet, it mentioned 540 feet. Despite laying 24-foot-long casing pipe, it claimed 80 feet to make extra money. “The agency had also used low-quality cables and materials. Several such cases are in Ballari and Vijayanagara districts,” Narayanaswamy said. The MLC said a big network is behind the scam, and grants to the tune of Rs 40 crore have been misused in Ballari and Vijayanagar districts alone. “We will initiate stern action against private borewell agencies and also officers who have connived with them,” he said. Efforts made to contact Ballari ZP CEO K R Nandini for a response did not yield results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rs-40-crore-misappropriation-alleged-in-ganga-kalyana-scheme/articleshow/87688740.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

This time around, the police have planned to make the helmetless bikers appear for a test, clear the same and only then proceed towards their destination. The police hope that since the test would be a time-consuming affair, most bikers would prefer to wear a helmet instead of risking being caught without one and then having to appear for the exam. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey told TOI, “An order in this regard will be issued in a few days and the new system to conduct tests will be implemented.” “Wearing helmets is already compulsory for those looking to buy fuel at petrol pumps, and counselling sessions are being held at the Children’s Traffic Education Park for bikers who were found without the head safety gear. Now, we have decided to set up centres to conduct tests on traffic rules for the bikers caught without helmets,” said Pandey. He said helmetless bikers would be taken to the examination points set up by the police. The biker concerned will be given a booklet on traffic rules to read for two hours and then appear for the test. He/she would need to get at least 50% answers right to pass. If the person fails, he/she would be given the traffic rules booklet again to read for another two hours and then reappear for the exam. The police would be setting up seven to eight such centres across the city. Currently, as per the orders issued by the police commissioner, bikers without helmet are not entertained at petrol pumps. The police have also written to various establishments, institutions, etc. to not allow bikers without helmets inside their premises. Abhay Kulkarni, chairman of Nashik First organization that operates the Children’s Traffic Education Park at Mumbai Naka, said more than 4,000 bikers have been counselled over the past two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/testing-time-ahead-for-bikers-caught-without-helmet-in-nashik/articleshow/87689339.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Allahabad||UP Board to give one more chance to promoted students of class 10 and 12||PRAYAGRAJ: Taking an important decision in the overall interest of the students of class 10 and 12 (of the last academic session), the state government has decided to give one more chance to the students who were promoted in high school and intermediate exams without examination in 2021 during the pandemic. These students can appear in the board examination of 2022, without any special fees, if they are unsatisfied with their results. The last date for advance registration of classes 9 and 11 and online filling of class 10 and 12 examination forms, meanwhile, has also been extended yet again, this time till November 20. A notification in this regard has also been made available on the official website of the UP Board— https://upmsp.edu.in. The certificate-cum-mark sheet of 2021 will only be provided to the registered students for 2021 who opt to appear in the 2022 edition of the high school and intermediate exams, informed UP Board secretary, Divyakant Shukla. Earlier, a chance had already been given to the students of high school and intermediate exams promoted in 2021 by allowing them to appear in the marks improvement examination held from September 18 to October 6, 2021. All the promoted students, except those who have passed the marks improvement examination-2021, will again be given an opportunity to appear in the class 10 and class 12 examination of 2022 without paying any fees, officials made clear. In the board exam results of 2021, a total of 1,44,744 students including 82,238 students of high school and 62,506 students of intermediate, got their results which depicted no marks. However, these students have been running to their schools as well as the offices of the respective district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) and regional offices of the UP Board and even the UP Board headquarters, demanding that the issue be resolved. The decision by the board comes as a major relief for these students. It is also worth noting that earlier the last date for advance registration of class 9 and class 11 as well as for filling up the forms for class 10 and class 12 examinations-2022 was November 8, following two extensions already given. More than 51.27 lakh students have registered to appear in the UP Board High School and Intermediate Examination-2022 till November 8. Over 27.70 lakh students have registered for the high school exams-2022 while another over 23.56 lakh students have registered for intermediate exams, informed UP Board officials. In terms of advance registrations, around 31.78 lakh students have registered in class 9 and a little over 26.62 lakh students have registered for class 11, accounting to a total of 58,40,608 total advance registrations, by November 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-board-to-give-one-more-chance-to-promoted-students-of-class-10-and-12/articleshow/87689335.cms||---

The institute, which had witnessed a Covid outbreak during March this year, was deserted until the latest arrival of cadets of the new batch along with their parents. Speaking on the occasion, Colonel (retd) Amit Dalvi, the SPI director, said cadets can achieve their dream of joining the defence services of the country through devotion and hard work. “Even during the pandemic, 23 of our cadets cracked the necessary examinations and joined the defence services. The success of these cadets is an inspiration for the new cadets of the 45th batch,” he said. Stating that all routine schedules of the 45th batch will be carried out by following Covid-prevention norms, SPI authorities said adequate measures were in place to ensure the safety of students. “The preventive and safety measures against Covid have been arranged at our classrooms, hostels, playgrounds and the entire campus. All cadets have been instructed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in letter and spirit,” Dalvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/spi-campus-abuzz-with-cadets/articleshow/87689333.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Recruitment for post of principals in govt-aided schools to start soon||Prayagraj: Preparations have begun to undertake the recruitment of principals and headmasters in more than 4,500 government-aided secondary schools spread across the state through a written examination. At present, there is a system of recruiting principals directly through interviews after short-listing the candidates vying for the posts on offer. But on the orders of the state government, the officials of the Directorate of Education, Prayagraj, have prepared a proposal in this regard which will soon be sent to the government for formal approval, said a senior education department official requesting anonymity. Under the changes proposed, assistant teachers will now be able to apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. Till now, assistant teachers or trained graduate teachers (TGTs) teaching in high schools could only apply for the post of headmaster in government-aided high schools while post-graduate teachers (PGTs) could apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. But the new proposal aims at removing this barrier against assistant teachers applying for the post of principal in government-aided intermediate colleges if they possess the requisite eligibility as specified, he added. The development comes close on the heels of a meeting chaired by the special secretary of the state government, Jai Shankar Dubey on October 11 in Lucknow with representatives of the UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group) in which the latter had demanded recruitment of the principals through written examination and an opportunity to assistant teachers to apply for the posts of principals in government-aided intermediate colleges. State general secretary of UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group) Lalmani Dwivedi said that post this meeting, the process of duly amending the UP Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules-1998 to make the changes possible have been started by the state education directorate. As per the proposal, henceforth for the selection of principal and headmaster, a written examination of 300 marks (60 per cent marks) out of the total 500 marks will be conducted. The remaining 200 marks will be earmarked for experience and interview, another senior state education department official confirming the development said. The written exam will witness aspirants being tested through objective type questions regarding their general knowledge, educational aptitude, educational administration, school environment and health etc., he added. Principals will be selected based on a merit list prepared at the state level instead of the divisional level as done presently, he further explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/recruitment-for-post-of-principals-in-govt-aided-schools-to-start-soon/articleshow/87689332.cms||---

The old-age home was housed in an existing 40-year-old building along the Chimbel road for a few decades. Being run by the Institute of Public Assistance (IPA) – or better known as Provedoria – it was shut after being declared unsafe. A tender issued by Provedoria for axing 30 trees for a new asylum at the historic site triggered a controversy. The villagers opposed the felling of trees at a new site within the compound, suggesting instead demolition of the building for it. “We have learnt from sources that, despite our protests and gram sabha resolutions, Provedoria has sought police protection for felling 30-odd trees,” Ana Gracias, a local activist said. The site within the Provedoria compound is a historic site. One of the ruins, among a few structures that existed there in decades past, is a exquisite façade of a 17th century chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. It was at this site that the first indigenous religious order of Goan priests was set up. A few decades back, Goa’s first psychiatric care institution was established at the site. The government has recently notified the ruins as a heritage site. Initially, Provedoria planned the project near the ruins. But after protests, the authorities agreed to relocate it away from it, but the new site has upset locals over the tree-felling. “We are not opposed to the project, but only the location, as it would needlessly destroy the trees,” Tukaram Kunkolkar, a member of Chimbel Manch said. In a recent letter to Provedoria authorities, Ishwar Shirvoikar, vice-president, Chimbel Manch, stated that global climate change dynamics necessitate protection of green cover. In one of the protests, the villagers and children had hugged trees symbolically to protect them from felling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/felling-of-trees-for-chimbel-old-age-home-sparks-protests/articleshow/87691210.cms||---

Locals questioned the paying water charges to PWD when they get water supplied through tankers. A resident of New Vaddem, Shashikant Dhole said, “We are tired of the assurances that the problem will be resolved. We are relying on private tankers for water supply. We don’t get water supply even for an hour a day. It is a pathetic situation.” For drinking and cooking purposes, he said his family spends Rs 80 daily to buy packaged water. Adding, “When our children go to work they fill water from their offices in bottles and bring them home.” Another resident Manisha Gosawi said, “We keep a vigil at night to check the supply of water. We don’t get water supply, but we end up paying bills to PWD and bear added expenses for water tankers.” Festival time ends up doubling the trouble for these residents as water requirements go up. Vaibhavi Mehta, a local said, “We are troubled more during festivities. We are working people and yet we have to waste hours only to check the water supply.” The state convener of the newly-formed Goencho Avaaz Party, Capt (retd) Viriato Fernandes questioned the water scarcity in Dabolim constituency on a regular basis. He also raised doubts if there is any link between government officials and the private water suppliers. He said, “Mormugao constituency being at the tail end has no water issues, but Dabolim which falls in the centre has water shortage and irregular supply.” Fernandes said the panchayat minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho and the state government have set wrong priorities and in future there will be no water even to drink if corrective measures are not initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/why-are-we-paying-water-charges-when-supply-is-irregular-ask-vasco-residents/articleshow/87691236.cms||---

The very heavy rainfall warning continues for Sunday and orange alerts have been issued for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki and Kasaragod. Even though only an orange alert has been sounded, the warning said it could also become a red alert depending on the intensity of the northeast monsoon and the westerlies. Yellow alert has been sounded for all the other districts. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a Facebook post said in view of the heavy rains, emergency relief camps would be opened in landslide/landslip and floodprone areas. “Directions have been given to show extreme vigil in high ranges, riversides and tourist centres,” Vijayan said The districts’ disaster management authority has been directed to keep vigil in hilly areas, river banks and tourist areas. Overall, rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over south peninsular India. Meanwhile, a fresh lowpressure area is likely to form over south Andaman Sea and adjoining areas by Saturday evening. It will move in the west-northwest direction and may become more marked as a depression over east central and southeast Bay of Bengal by November 15. Southern railway has informed that train schedules were disrupted as the heavy rainfall on early hours of Saturday caused landslides in Neyyatinkara–Parassala rail tracks and also along Eraniel - Kulithurai section. There will be a little relief for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta on Monday as the system moves northwards bringing rainfall to the remaining districts. Orange alerts have been issued for north Kerala including Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-issues-orange-alert-for-heavy-rains-in-seven-districts/articleshow/87690718.cms||---

The new bridge will reduce travelling distance by 12-13 km between Bicholim and Panaji. Several people from these villages who travel to Panaji for work prefer the Chorao-Ribandar ferry route as it cuts down travelling time. The distance between Bicholim and Panaji is about 33 km, however, travelling via ferry service reduces the distance to 18-20 km. However, despite three to four ferries plying along this route, commuters have to wait for long durations during the morning and evening rush hours. Also, motorists face tremendous hardship during heavy rainfall and gusty winds in the monsoon. In times of medical exigencies, people are forced to use the ferry service to shift a patient to Panaji. The student community is also inconvenienced when they get stranded in traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chorus-grows-louder-for-chorao-bridge-to-ribandar/articleshow/87691218.cms||---

The delegation said the sweeper woman could have been transferred, instead of being suspended. However, Thorat told them it was impossible to roll back the suspension order. The pregnant woman, Kira Gare, was admitted in the hospital on November 9. In the hospital, Gare was stopped from going to the toilet by the sweeper. This was followed by a scuffle between the two women. Later, Gare delivered a baby, who died on November 11. Her husband Kailas accused the sweeper of assaulting his wife. He also alleged that when Kira was taken to the labour room, no doctor or nurse was available to help her with the delivery. When contacted, the hospital’s gynaecology department officials refuted the allegation. “Nurses were present during the delivery, and the procedure was guided by Dr Promod Chaudhari. It was a case of premature birth of a baby with extremely high blood pressure. The baby was shifted to the neonatal department for further treatment,” added the civil hospital’s gynaecology department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/class-iv-staff-seek-rollback-of-sweepers-suspension/articleshow/87689360.cms||---

Seven persons were arrested with 52 unfinished semi-automatic countrymade pistols and 32 butts, which were to be brought to Munger for finishing and selling to criminals. The police also seized two lathes, two milling and two drill machines, one motor and two bikes besides raw materials for manufacturing pistols from the gun factory near Saat Mile Chowk in village Vishnupur under the same police station area in Hazaribag district. However, the two smugglers travelling in a car whom the STF team followed could not be arrested. Those arrested were identified as Mohammad Sonu, Mohammad Imran Hassan, Mohammad Nasim, Mohammad Imran, Mohammad Mushtaq Mustafa, all native of Kasim Bazaar in Munger, and Mohammad Shamim Akhtar and Mohammad Akhtar of Nawadih in Bokaro, Jharkhand. “The factory was set up to manufacture and supply firearms in Bihar. The illegal arms manufacturers of Munger and other districts in Bihar have shifted their base to neighbouring states following continuous crackdown against arms smuggling,” a senior IPS officer said. He said the two arms smugglers were scheduled to bring all the 52 pistol sets and butts to Munger. “Expert arms manufacturers would have given the finishing touches by fitting barrels, triggers, loading and reloading mechanism,” he said. He said due to panchayat elections in Bihar, one pistol would have fetched at least Rs50,000 to the arms smugglers. “The price increases before or during any election or due to crackdown on the manufacturing units,” he said. The officer said the STF had earlier busted illegal arms factories at Dumka, Deoghar and Giridih in Jharkhand where partially finished pistols were being manufactured for sales in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-stf-team-busts-gun-factory-in-hazaribag/articleshow/87689948.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The patient was flown on advanced mechanical ventilator support, with the journey spanning over 15 hours. Evaluation revealed multiple complications including severe drug-resistant brain malaria along with brain complication, kidney failure, post-cardiac arrest, sepsis and a tracheal rupture,” said cardiothoracic surgeons Dr Dasari Prasada Rao and Dr Ravi Raju CH who operated on him along with a team from Apollo Spectra Hospital. After 47 days of ICU care, the patient was put on hemodialysis till his kidneys recovered and then a tracheal repair surgery was carried out. “Post repair, the patient was kept on lung ventilation and was gradually weaned off from the ventilator.

His family alleges that this was because the police "misbehaved" and "threatened" them. The deceased, identified as Bhura, was a resident of Bilaspur and was accused of illicit liquor marketing. The police had pasted a notice according to section 82 of CrPC (proclamation for person absconding) outside his house. A case was ongoing in a local court, registered against him in 2010. According to the police, Bhura had not been appearing at court hearings due to which the police approached his family. The police said that the man wasn’t at home and had gone out for work. The mother of the deceased, Somwati, alleged that the police barged into their house in search of Bhura and after he couldn’t be found, threatened to beat up the male members of the family. She said that the police "misbehaved" and "hurled abuses" at them. Cops later pasted a notice at the door of their house and left. The family claimed that once Bhura learnt about what happened he was severely stressed. They said he subsequently committed suicide by consuming poison. The family also alleged that had the police behaved in a more "respectful" manner, Bhura wouldn’t have committed suicide. Inspector Tajvir Singh of the Bilaspur police station, Rampur said, “The notice was put up according to section 82 of CrPC and the police worked according to directions received from the court. There is no role of police in his death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-accused-in-illicit-liquor-marketing-case-commits-suicide-family-accuses-police-of-abetting-the-act/articleshow/87690727.cms||Maria Khan

Locals complained that patients do not find doctors in the Basti Dawakhana, forcing patients to visit private clinics or hospitals. The Basti Dawakhanas were opened amid much fanfare but the absence of doctors has become a bane for the locals. With only one nurse to see patients and distribute medicines at the clinic, locals alleged that the matter was brought to the notice of senior officials but no efforts have been made to appoint doctors. “We have enough medicines here. We are giving medicines to patients with complaints of fever, cough and cold. But there is no doctor to treat patients,” said the nurse. Congress leader Osman bin Mohammed Al-Hajri told TOI that many complaints were made to senior officials but the issue has not been resolved. He urged the state government to appoint a doctor immediately. He said that in the absence of a doctor, locals are forced to visit private clinics and cough up more money. One of the patients, Anwar, said that whenever he visits the clinic, he finds only one nurse to prescribe the medicines. “I have never seen a doctor in the dawakhana,” he said. When contacted, Dr Rukma Reddy, programme officer for Basthi Dawakhanas, said the doctor posted at Gunge ki Bowli Basti Dawakhana was shifted to Hakimpet Basti Dawakhana. He said that a doctor would be posted at the Karwan clinic soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/absence-of-doc-ails-dawakhana-patients-return-sans-treatment/articleshow/87690726.cms||Omar bin Taher

The big cat had given birth to two cubs in a sugar cane farm at Lambe Wadgaon village. However, human presence during cane harvesting forced the adult leopard leave and she was able to take only one cub with her. Vivek Desai, the honorary wildlife warden, said a farmer named Prakash Patil alerted them about the presence of a leopard in his farm. “When we reached the spot along with the forest department officials, we found only one cub,” he said. The deserted cub was offered care and was kept in a plastic container. Later, two trap cameras were installed and the area was cordoned off by the authorities. “On the same night, the leopard was spotted in a trap camera approaching the plastic container. The leopard, however, did not take the cub with her then. After two days, the leopard took her cub away on November 9,” said Desai. Honorary wildlife warden Rajesh Thombare, deputy conservator of forest VV Hoshing, assistant conservator of forest SK Shisav, forest officer SB Nagrale, guard SB Chavan and round officer GS Pinjari were part of the operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-experts-help-leopard-reunite-with-cub/articleshow/87689370.cms||Prasad Joshi

We will unveil our plan to re-liberate Goa from this second colonisation by having meetings with like-minded people,” Sardesai said, addressing a press conference held to induct an anti-coal activist, Vikas Bhagat, into the party. The Fatorda MLA further said that if his party comes to office, the requirement of NOCs from MPT will be done away with. “We will keep MPT completely out of the picture when it comes to erecting shacks on Goa’s beaches,” he said. Welcoming Bhagat into his party, Sardesai assured the people that if his party comes to office and forms government, all cases booked against the protestors who agitated against coal and linear projects will be withdrawn. The GFP president said that booking offences against coal protestors by the police ran contrary to PM Narendra Modi’s pledge of net zero emissions by 2070 by India at the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow. “There’s a direct contradiction in this — the Prime Minister assures the world of not using coal, and here the Goa government is making Goa a coal hub and filing cases against those who are fighting against coal pollution,” Sardesai said. He also said that his party would work towards an “accelerated coal exit”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-will-fight-to-liberate-goa-from-2nd-colonisation/articleshow/87691233.cms||---

A bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice C T Ravikumar observed that there should not be any adversarial approach in the matter and it would look into the issues and then take a call. “You must appreciate that this is not a one-time consideration matter. It is a continuous supervision matter,” the bench told senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who appeared for TN. The issue of seepage data cropped up when an advocate, appearing for one of the petitioners, said that the apex court must look into its details. Naphade told the bench that all the data and details have been considered by the supervisory committee from time to time. “It does not matter. You keep it ready for our perusal, if required,” the bench told the senior advocate. Naphade said Tamil Nadu will be ready with all the data for the perusal of the court. “Our only difficulty is that your lordships will find that petitions after petitions are being filed in this court only to keep us harassing,” he said, adding, “This is one more attempt to keep the pot boiling.” “If there is some evolving situation, how it has been addressed or how it will be addressed, are matters which will be looked into,” the bench observed. “If there is some input available, we will have a look at it and then we will proceed,” the court said, adding, “Ultimately, we will go by the expert committee opinion.” Meanwhile, regarding Kerala’s demand for the construction of a new dam, the TN government told the court that “repeated assertion” by Kerala to seek decommissioning of the dam is “wholly impermissible” as it has been found to be hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe. “The repeated assertion of Kerala and petitioners from Kerala in writ petitions filed from time-to-time inter-alia seek decommissioning of the existing dam and construction of a new dam, which is wholly impermissible in the light of judgment of this court on the safety of the dam,” the Tamil Nadu government has said. The bench then posted the matter for hearing on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mullaperiyar-a-matter-of-continuous-supervision-sc/articleshow/87690734.cms||---

He went on to state that attempts are being made to fuel anger against the state government, so that it becomes easier to impose President’s rule in Maharashtra. He said: “The BJP cannot do politics without hatred or riots.” He said these riots are a part of a major conspiracy to destabilize the state government, as the BJP could not achieve desired results by using agencies like CBI, IT, ED and NCB. Shiv Sena stages protests on Saturday in Aurangabad He said: “If BJP is orchestrating such violence, the Maharashtra home department is capable of bringing the perpetrators to book.” “The BJP government is working like Nizamshahi. The most important issues for the countrymen are unemployment and inflation, but the BJP has diverted attention to issues like India-Pakistan, surgical strikes and China,” he said. Raut, along with minister for employment guarantee scheme and horticulture Sandipanrao Bhumre and state minister for revenue Abdul Sattar, was in Aurangabad to lead to a mega protest against central government policies causing spiraling inflation. The agitation was organised by MLC Ambadas Danve. Sena MLAs Sanjay Shirsath, Pradip Jaiswal, Udaysinh Rajput, Ramesh Bornare and many supporters joined the agitation. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta told reporters, “No permission had been granted to the protest march.” Kranti Chowk police have registered a case against Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve and other organisers for holding the mega protest march without permission. Senior inspector Ganpat Darade said, "An offence has been registered for unlawful assembly and for unlawfully doing any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/violence-riots-in-parts-of-maharashta-is-bjp-conspiracy-says-sanjay-raut/articleshow/87689380.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Deesa, Indrajitsinh Bhatti, has directed Banaskantha superintendent of police (SP) to conduct an inquiry against 10 cops following a complaint filed in court by one Harshad Thakkar. The complainant has alleged that the accused cops not only framed him, but also extorted Rs 1.5 lakh from him. According to case details, in May when the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak, Thakkar was asked by his firm to work from home. So Thakkar was returning home in Deesa in his car when the cops stopped him at Chhapi check-post and booked him and three others for blackmarketing of remdesivir injections. Thakkar alleged in his court complaint that he was in jail for 45 days. During his two-day police custody, Thakkar, alleged that he was abused and insulted by the cops. He further alleged that the cops extorted Rs 1.5 lakh from him. Soon after getting bail, Thakkar had filed a complaint against the cops who were posted with Banaskantha local crime branch and Chhapi police station. However, no action was taken against the cops. As a last resort, Thakkar filed a complaint in court last month against the 10 cops accusing them of falsely framing him and abusing their power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/deesa-court-orders-inquiry-against-10-cops-for-filing-false-case/articleshow/87689972.cms||---

Water resources minister Roshy Augustine said that due to the reduction in rainfall presently there was no need to open the shutters of the reservoir. “As per the rule curve, the red alert level is 2,399.03ft and upper rule level is 2,400.03ft. But we will not wait for the water level to reach in the upper level. When it reaches the red alert level, if needed, the shutters will be opened to control the water level in the reservoir,” said the minister. KSEB assistant engineer Saju MP told TOI that the new rule curve in Idukki was applicable from Thursday. “The present rule curve will end on November 20. After that, the level is 2,403ft which is the full reservoir level (FRL). To reduce the water level in Idukki, power generation will be continued at the maximum level,” he said. The opening of dam shutters will be after consideration of the rainfall fall pattern, said Saju. The water level on Saturday at 4pm was 2,392.52 ft which was 94.74% of the total storage. The power generation at Moolamattom plant was 17.334mu on Friday. The water level at the Mullaperiyar dam continued to increase after Tamil Nadu reduced the discharge level and it rose to 139.6ft at 5pm on Saturday. The tunnel discharge was 556cusecs. The inflow into the dam was 4,056cusecs at 3pm on Saturday. The upper rule curve level fixed by the central water commission till November 20 is 141ft.

Hakim later asked civic officials to ensure a repair drive was taken up for all cratered roads across 144 civic wards. Sources in the KMC roads department conceded the condition of several roads were bad as adequate repairs could not be carried out before the Puja due to persistent rain till late September. “Though we started repairing roads before Puja, we could not work properly due to the torrential rain at that time,” said a KMC roads department official. Some stretches of major roads that need the civic body’s attention include APC Roy Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, Rabindra Sarani, M G Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road, Motilal Gupta Road, Diamond Harbour Road, Taratala Road, NSC Bose Road in Tollygunge and Dum Dum Road. “We have asked our officials in each borough to take note of battered stretches. Once the identification is done, we shall ask the borough engineers to set a deadline and take up repairs,” said a official at KMC headquarters. The official hoped that unlike the drive before the Puja, the work this time would have lasting results. “We have no dearth of hot-mix materials or labourers,” said a KMC roads department senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/repair-cratered-roads-in-all-144-wards-hakim/articleshow/87690761.cms||Saikat Ray

On October 9, the residents filed a complaint before the district magistrate stating that the nightclub located on a hill in Ximwaddo has been playing loud music throughout the night and day too, in complete violation of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. As no action was taken on their earlier complaints, the residents alleged that the management of the nightclub has been emboldened to carry out their activities fearlessly causing “immense stress, mental tension and considerable inconvenience” to the locals. Residents said the club had a three-day non-stop music party from October 29-31 with loud music day and night, and another similar event is being held with top DJs from November 10-13, which is likely to be extended. They urged the district magistrate to stop issuing permissions for such events and to conduct a site inspection of the club, and also take necessary action to stop the nuisance, failing which they will file a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court of Bombay at Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-not-acting-against-nightclub-noise/articleshow/87691247.cms||---

His Mathura-based friends have also been hauled up. The videographers, allegedly "with their shoes on", had entered the premises by climbing over the wall at midnight and had shot the film. Police said no one is allowed to enter there at night as people believe that Lord Krishna and Radha still perform raslila when the city sleeps. The purported video was deleted on Saturday. Though the YouTube channel is run by Gaurav Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Vihar in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, under the name of 'GauravZone' with 44.9 lakh subscribers, the FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station. In the FIR, complainant Rohit Krishna, who is a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, stated that some "anti-social elements violated limits of Nidhivan", which is considered the most prominent site dedicated to Lord Krishna-Radha and their 'gopis'. The complaint added that the men tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs. He demanded "exemplary deterrent". Superintendent of police (city) MP Singh told TOI that a police team was sent to Delhi to identify the suspects and the matter is under investigation. Civil judge (junior division) Archana Singh also directed police to ensure deletion of the video from all social media platforms after the priest approached the judge. She directed police to present a compliance report in court. A group of priests in Vrindavan staged a protest and later purified Nidhivan by sprinkling holy water. “We will launch an agitation if police fail to arrest the accused,” said Saurabh Gaur, president of Dharam Raksha Sangh. Sharma was arrested by Delhi police a few months ago for animal cruelty after he posted a video showing his dog floating in air with helium balloons strapped to its back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-youtuber-booked-brought-to-up-for-shooting-film-in-mathuras-nidhivan/articleshow/87690757.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||CM: Never left people to fend for themselves during Covid||Margao: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday reiterated that his refrain ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ was actually meant to reassure Goans that the government was committed to doing whatever it takes to help them get through their difficult times during the pandemic. “Despite the raging pandemic that saw the government’s resources stretched to the limit, the government didn’t let people fend for themselves and will never do so. And that’s why I kept reassuring people ‘bhivpachi garaz na’,” he said, speaking at the ‘sarkar tumchea dari’ programme at Curchorem. Referring to criticism that the ‘sarkar tumchea dari’ initiative has been done with an eye on elections, Sawant said that the programme was planned to be held two years ago, but the pandemic caused the delay. Sawant appealed to the people to develop a self-sustainable lifestyle by availing benefits of numerous welfare schemes initiated by the state and central government. Sawant also lauded local MLA and power minister Nilesh Cabral for his drive and initiative in completing various infrastructure development projects in Curchorem.

---||Hyderabad||YS Vivekananda Reddy murder: Killers bought axe from Kadiri||HYDERABAD: Killers of former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy meticulously executed the murder plan and even made him write a suicide note forcibly after injuring him. In his statement to the CBI, one of the accused, Shaik Dastagiri of Pulivendula, who later turned into an approver, said: “On March 14, 2019, my accomplice Sunil Yadav told me to purchase an axe from Kadiri (a town in Anantapur) to kill Vivekananda. We did not buy the axe from Pulivendula as we were scared that people may identify us on the next day of the murder. So, I purchased the axe from Kadiri.” Recounting the events leading to the murder on March 15, Dastagiri said: Yadav, another accomplice Umashankar Reddy and I reached the house. Umashankar had already dropped Yerra Gangi Reddy at Vivekananda’s house. Later, we all entered an empty plot behind his house. We entered the house by jumping the compound wall. ” Explaining the killing, Dastagiri said: “After seeing all three of us, Vivekananda questioned our presence at that odd hour. Gangi Reddy managed the situation by saying that some important matter needed to be discussed. Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy entered into a heated argument over sharing of money and went into the bedroom. We also followed them.” “At this point, Umashankar signalled to me to get the axe. Yadav, on the instructions of Gangi Reddy, held Vivekananda from behind by blocking his arms. We all beat up Vivekananda. Umashankar took the axe from my hand and hit Vivekananda on his forehead. He fell on the floor. He tried to get up but Umashankar hit him on his rear side with axe,” Dastagiri recalled. He further said: “Yadav, who was aware of a stent in the heart of Vivekananda, punched him on his heart. Viveka shouted in pain. In the meanwhile, Umashankar and Yadav searched the house for a piece of paper. Yadav gave a pen to Vivekananda and asked him to write what was told to him. When Vivekananda refused, he was beaten up. Vivekananda pleaded with us to spare him and agreed to write the letter. At 5 am, we went to Gangi Reddy’s house where he assured us that Devireddy Shiva Shankar Reddy will take care of everything. Gangi Reddy even asked us to keep quiet as Shiva Shankar and other politicians of Kadapa have interest in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/viveka-murder-killers-bought-axe-from-kadiri/articleshow/87690760.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The issue can be solved only if door-to-door garbage collection is strictly enforced.”When contacted, a corporation official said they were intensifying door-to-door garbage collection. “Recently, we had received five more light commercial vehicles and they are being used for collecting garbage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-cleans-gandhi-managar-streets-residents-dump-garbage/articleshow/87690788.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa govt plans to begin free pilgrimages for elderly next month||PANAJI: As part of BJP’s electoral strategy to target the senior citizen vote-bank ahead of the forthcoming assembly election, the state government has commenced implementation of the Mukhyamantri Dev Darshan Yatra Yojana (MDDYY) for pilgrimages to religious places within and outside the state, free of cost. The state government is planning to send the first batch of pilgrims before December 19. The scheme will also provide free transportation to senior citizens who wish to visit prominent temples, churches, mosques and other religious places within the state. A senior officer said that they have finalised three places of worship outside the state. Shirdi and Trimbakeshwar will be covered under one circuit, while the Velankanni trip will be undertaken on another circuit. The officer said that the government will soon finalise the religious places in Goa under the scheme. Recently, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had promised Goans free pilgrimages to Ayodhya, Shirdi, Velankanni and Ajmer Sharif if the party forms the government in the state. “In today’s hectic life struggle, people have very little time for themselves and their families. It is only the religious and godly feelings that sometimes individuals seek for a few moments of peace and happiness,” states the objective of the scheme. “It is believed that by visiting sacred places, individuals obtain real happiness. However, due to their economical condition, the wishes of some people remain unfulfilled. The Goa government, therefore, endeavours to help such people, particularly senior citizens, to have blessings of the almighty God,” states the scheme. The scheme will provide a one-time travel assistance on pilgrimage in a lifetime to senior citizens to sacred places outside Goa as per the itineraries periodically decided by the government. “The pilgrimage will be conducted under the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) package as per MoU signed by the government with IRCTC. The pilgrimage tour will be organised for a group of not less than 750 persons who wish to visit the holy places as per itineraries decided by the government,” the scheme states. As per the criteria, persons should not be less than 60 years of age at the time of submitting applications under this scheme. Applicants should be a resident of Goa for at least 15 years certified by the respective deputy collector. The annual family income of the applicant shall not exceed Rs 3 lakh per annum from all sources. The applicant should be physically and mentally sound to perform the journey and shall not be suffering from any communicable diseases viz TB, heart diseases, leprosy, Covid, etc, and the same shall be certified by a doctor from the state health department, not below the rank of chief medical officer or health officer. Under the scheme, one attendant can accompany the pilgrim, provided that he/she is above the age of 60 years. Preference shall be given to the husband and wife, provided both of them are senior citizens. The scheme will also provide free bus transportation to visit the places of worship within Goa through Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL). The routes will be finalised by the government in consultation with KTCL. The directorate of social welfare will reimburse the transport charges to KTCL. Transportation will be arranged for a minimum of 40 senior citizens, while the tour will be conducted for an entire day. Senior citizens are entitled to avail benefit to visit the places of worship within Goa irrespective of their income status.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-plans-to-begin-free-pilgrimages-for-elderly-next-month/articleshow/87691248.cms||---

There have been instances of tiger movement in the district and this has led to police forming teams to go around, even inside habitations in the forest areas, to take precautions. Police said this was not to either lay a snare to poach the tiger or kill it. “We are advising people not to venture into the interior areas of the forest,” assistant SP P Sai Chaitanya said. He told TOI that villagers were being informed that if there was a cattle kill by the tiger, they would get compensation from the government. He warned them against laying any traps to kill a tiger. Sai Chaitanya warned that non-bailable cases would be booked against anyone trying to harm the tiger, capture it or poach it. He reminded that those who resorted to such a thing had been jailed last month. Last month, police detected that a tiger had been killed by the poachers. They were arrested and the case was handed over to the forest department. The presence of a big cat is detected either from the cattle kill, pugmarks or camera traps. Police teams are going around in autos and using loudspeakers to warn people against venturing into the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/big-cat-scare-in-mulugu-police-warn-villagers/articleshow/87690787.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Will not form alliance with BJP at any cost: MGP||Panaji: Stating that BJP representatives continue to approach them and are trying their best to form an alliance with his party for the upcoming assembly elections, Maharastrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar on Saturday said that MGP will not forge an alliance with BJP at any cost. “Every day one or two BJP or RSS representatives come to our place to meet us, but we are firm on not forming an alliance with BJP,” he said, adding that MGP is in talks with other political parties, but nothing has been finalised yet. Dhavalikar was reacting to the statement made by BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade that Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis is in talks with MGP to form an alliance. The MGP president said that his party has helped BJP form the government many times, but it has always tried to use and throw MGP. In 2007, when MGP joined BJP to topple the Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, MGP MLAs were disqualified. Later, in 2012, MGP had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and the alliance had won an absolute majority. However, after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was elevated as the defence minister, MGP had differences with then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, and Dhavalikar was later dropped from the cabinet. In 2017, after the assembly election results, MGP again supported BJP to form the new coalition government under Parrikar’s leadership, but after his demise, chief minister Pramod Sawant split MGP. Out of MGP’s three MLAs, two joined BJP, and Dhavalikar was again dropped from the cabinet. BJP’s Goa unit had invited regional parties to discuss pre-poll alliances for the upcoming assembly elections and had said that they are open for talks with MGP and Goa Forward Party (GFP). Recently, MGP had said that there was no progress on alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-not-form-alliance-with-bjp-at-any-cost-mgp/articleshow/87691266.cms||---

But people are hesitant to give away trash to domestic breeding checkers (DBC) who visit houses as part of dengue control programme as they want to sell them to trash collectors. But many could not do so as they remain away from home for work or can’t find trash vendors. To ensure that unused items are removed from houses, health staff are identifying trash vendors to visit houses to collect waste,” the official said.It will be a win-win situation for residents and vendors as residents can earn money from waste and vendors will get business, said S Mariappan, a resident of Mopperipalayam. A couple of dengue cases were reported from Mopperipalayam town panchayat five days ago.The drive will be carried out as part of the massive dengue source reduction campaign that is under way across the district. The campaign, launched on Friday, will go on for a week.The staff are collecting discarded tyres from households and public spaces. “We have instructed owners of automobile repair shops, who have displayed discarded tyres in front of their shops, to drill holes on them to drain water,” Aruna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/health-department-to-launch-waste-monetization-drive/articleshow/87690790.cms||Sampath Kumar

Rumour mills have gone into overdrive in the last few days, with unconfirmed reports of the winter session being held in Mumbai doing the rounds.Deshmukh, a former MLA, cited these “discussions” as the reason for him writing the letter. “As per the Nagpur pact, there is an obligation of the state government to hold one session of the state legislature here,” Deshmukh wrote in his letter sent on Saturday.On the same day, Ajay Patil, whose wife Pragati is a BJP corporator, too posted on Facebook that the Nagpur assembly session won’t be held this year. TOI reached out to some government officials about these reports but they refused to speak on record, citing “privileged information”. One such official said, “The committee which will take the final call is expected to meet in a few days. I believe that its earlier meet this week was postponed due to the CM’s surgery.” CM Thackeray underwent a surgery related to a cervical spine issue this week, and is currently recuperating.There were messages circulating on social media that a cabinet minister made the statement about Nagpur assembly session being cancelled, but the same could not be verified. Another government official said that earlier this month, legislature senior officials had visited Nagpur to oversee the preparations. “Local authorities discussed how things will be managed, considering this will be the first session in Nagpur after pandemic struck. A draft list of standard operating procedures too was prepared,” he said. But the official added that regardless of the prior preparations, the final decision is always taken by the business advisory committee (BAC). “The right to take the call is with the government and it’s handled by the BAC. We expect the pending meet to be held soon after the CM’s health is better,” the official said. In his letter, Deshmukh has hit out at this point too. “As per rules, the BAC meet must be held at least 45 days in advance, but it is pending till now. Issues related to Vidarbha are thus pending and need the government’s involvement for speedy resolution. The assembly session here must be held for at least a month,” stated the Congress leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/uncertainty-shrouds-nagpur-winter-session-amid-cancellation-rumours/articleshow/87690043.cms||---

An affidavit filed by GMR Energy explains the restoration work taken up under the supervision of Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Kakinada. Dredging work and dumping of waste material had damaged the mangroves near the Coast Guard office. After former IAS official EAS Sarma filed a petition on August 27, the National Green Tribunal issued orders appointing a joint committee which had given specific recommendations to restore the mangroves. GMR Energy spent Rs 22 lakh on restoration work. “Currently, mangrove saplings are healthy. The height of the saplings varies from 110 cm to 120 cm which indicate that mangroves are well restored,” said GMR Energy in the affidavit. Additional saplings will be planted between November and March 2022 in areas devoid of natural regeneration. The joint committee in its report said: “The mangrove area falls under Coastal Regulatory Zone-I area which is ecologically sensitive and plays a key role in the maintaining the integrity of the coast. As per CRZ notification 2011, no new construction is permitted.” An affidavit filed by GMR Energy explains the restoration work taken up under the supervision of Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/green-activism-mangroves-restored-in-coastal-andhra/articleshow/87690796.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Eating out turns costlier as restaurants in Pune jack up menu prices||PUNE: Eating out has become costlier. Many restaurants in Pune have recently jacked up menu prices by about 10-30% as commercial cooking gas rates, prices of vegetables, meat and cooking oil have soared. The United Hospitality Association (UHA) told TOI that most restaurants in Pune hiked menu prices in the last one month, with commercial cooking gas prices having soared to Rs2,000 for a 19 kg cylinder, oil prices doubling, and meat prices rising significantly. Restaurants are already operating at 50% capacity due to Covid norms and hiking menu rates is the only option to meet the rising cost and offset losses, industry sources said. Lovely Narang, president, United Hospitality Association, and owner, Food Music Love, said, “Prices of meat have gone up by about 30% in the last six months, while oil and cooking gas prices have also increased exponentially. Procurement rates of all raw material have increased consequently, thus menu prices had to be hiked. Restaurants were already working at a 20% margin prior to the spike, therefore, increasing the price was the only option.” Narang said that many restaurants have already increased prices on the menu by 20-30%. Ravish Arora, director, Incognito Restaurant, Bar & Cafe on Balewadi High street and Polka Dots, told TOI, “Restaurants that have not hiked menu prices so far may do so by the start of December as cost of all raw materials have gone up. We have been trying to cushion the rise in prices for the time being, but eventually prices of all items on the menu will have to be increased. We are in the process of drafting new prices. Restaurants may hike prices by about 10-20%. Restaurants that had underpriced menus may hike up to 30%.” Arora, who is also the director of Baker’s Basket, said that bakery products may also see a rise in price s. “We were hoping that the prices of raw material would come down post-monsoon , but that did not happen. Bakery packaging cost has also gone up due to shortage of paper. All this is going to have a cascading effect on the cost of eating out,” he said. Vikram Shetty, owner, Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said the price of commercial cooking gas per cylinder has gone up to Rs2,000 , edible oil prices have doubled, while meat vendors have hiked prices citing increasing feed costs. “Restaurants which have not increased menu prices may do so by the first week of December. Increasing the menu prices is necessary for survival as the pandemic has already had an adverse impact on business,” he said. The owner of a restaurant in Koregaon Park said, “A commercial cooking gas cylinder used to cost around Rs1,100 before the pandemic, but now it costs Rs2,000. A tin of oil was Rs1,300, but it has now gone up to Rs2,300. As diesel and petrol prices have shot up, raw material and transportation costs have also increased. Alcohol prices have also gone up. Hence, prices have been increased for both food as well as liquor on the menu by 10-12%.” Citing an example, he said, “A pint of a high-end beer now costs Rs260 at our restaurant as against Rs240 last month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eating-out-turns-costlier-as-restos-jack-up-menu-prices/articleshow/87690802.cms||Neha Madaan

Police have formed two special teams to nab the principal, who is on the run. Police booked the school principal, Meera Jackson, under Section 21 (punishment for failure to report or record a case) of the Pocso Act, after the parents, students and members of various associations staged protests at the victim’s house and the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), stating they would receive the girl’s body, which is kept in the mortuary since Thursday night, only after arresting the principal. The protesters said the principal had failed to take stringent action against the teacher based on the girl’s complaint and demanded the school management to issue a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the victim’s family. It is to be noted that the school management had transferred Meera to another school a few months ago. Police had arrested the teacher, K Mithun Chakravarthy, on Friday night on charges of sexually harassing the girl and abetting her suicide. T Jayachandran, city deputy commissioner of police (north zone), said Mithun was lodged in Udumalpet sub-jail in Tirupur district under judicial custody on Friday night itself. “The investigation is on. The school principal failed to take action against the teacher after receiving the complaint from the victim. We have registered a case against Meera and formed two special teams to nab her.” Chief minister M K Stalin, meanwhile, assured to arrest the culprits and bring them to justice. “The death of a Coimbatore student has made the mind sad. The perversion and cruelty of some human beasts have taken a life. School administrations need to ensure that sexual violence does not occur. We will arrest the culprits and bring them to justice; Let’s ensure the safety of women!” he tweeted on the day. Police said while the autopsy was carried out at the CMCH on Friday afternoon, the girl’s family members hadn’t received the body yet. “They are saying they will receive the body only after the arrest of the school principal.” DCP Jayachandran, Coimbatore MP PR Natarajan, AIADMK MLA Amman K Arjunan visited the victim’s house on the day and consoled her parents. In a tweet, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder president Kamal Haasan said the people who were reasons for the suicide of the minor girl should be punished severely. Pattali Makkal Katchi founder S Ramadoss said the school teacher had created a bad name for the entire teacher community. “The school teacher was only arrested by the police. It is not enough. The school management failed to prevent the suicide and people in the school administration should be arrested by the police,” he tweeted. DMK MP Kanimozhi also demanded action against the school management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/girls-suicide-school-principal-booked-under-pocso-act-on-run/articleshow/87690797.cms||A Subburaj

Earlier, registering a case of accidental death, police had started investigation as it was not clear whether the girl had been murdered or if she took her own life. Talking to TOI, Parikshita Rathod, in-charge superintendent of police, Western Railway, Vadodara, said that the victim alleged “she was raped on October 28 in Vadodara by an autorickshaw driver and his aide”. “In her diary, the victim described details of being sexually assaulted by two men when she was going on her cycle from office to her hostel. She, however, did not mention clearly that she had been raped, but has described details of how she was sexually assaulted. We are also trying to gather scientific evidence that proves that she was raped. She did not inform her friends in Vadodara or her family members in Navsari,” Rathod added. “When she was returning from her office, she felt that someone was following her and she also dropped a message on her office WhatsApp group. However, none of her colleagues at the NGO saw the message then,” a police officer told TOI. The auto rickshaw driver and his aide kidnapped the girl and brought her to the Vaccine Institute ground where they raped her. The victim also wrote in her diary how a bus driver had helped her reach home in Vadodara after the incident. Meanwhile Vadodara cops have identified the bus driver and are questioning him for details, cops said. “Preliminary post mortem findings revealed that compression of the airway led to the girl’s death. Police are awaiting the forensic science laboratory report for exact details,” cops added.

The man allegedly misbehaved with the staff after he forcefully entered the premises and broke the glass of an office table. A video, recorded by an ASI worker, shows the man threatening to assault the staff and using “objectionable” language with them. A written police complaint was filed against the PAC personnel, who identified himself as Jagjeevan Sharma. Circle officer (Taj Security) Jagmohan Singh said that they are trying to identify the personnel, as no one with this name is posted in Agra PAC. He said the FIR will be registered after investigating the matter. When contacted, superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Raj Kumar Patel said a complaint to register an FIR has been given to the police. The complaint, filed by a senior conservation assistant, Amar Nath Gupta, stated that four- five tourists along with a policeman reached the East gate of Taj Mahal in the afternoon and tried to enter the premises without buying tickets. “When an ASI staffer, Suresh Chandra, asked him about tickets, Sharma allegedly misbehaved with him and threw his mobile phone at him,” the complaint reads.

More than 750 residents and 1,600 junior doctors did not join their duties throughout the day. However, they continued to work in emergency, ICUs and Covid wards. By Saturday evening, Yavatmal police arrested three murderers in this case, after which the doctors lit candles in memory of Pal. “They will continue to raise the issue of safety of medical students and doctors on the premises of medical colleges,” said the office-bearers of MARD.Meanwhile, a screenshot, reportedly from a mobile phone of one of the protesting female students of the GMCH Yavatmal claiming that they are getting rape threats from the local goons, went viral in the afternoon. However, it could not be ascertained if the screenshot was genuine. The protesting doctors told TOI that some of them were threatened by unknown people on Thursday and Friday. “We have informed the police teams about the threats while they were recording our statements. Strict action must be taken against those goons who issued threats to us,” said a junior doctor. “The strike on Saturday was a symbolic one. By evening, police claimed that they had nabbed the murderers and the arrested goons had accepted their crime. We want thorough interrogation of this case,” said Dr Sajal Bansal, president of MARD at GMCH Nagpur. Central MARD President Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale said that the family members of Ashok Pal should have been given monitory help by now. “The doctor was murdered while he was in the campus of his college. He hails from a poor family. The government must have announced compensation by now. Is this the value of Covid warriors life?” Dhobale said.According to the protesting junior doctors in Yavatmal, although the three murderers, including a juvenile, have been arrested and police claim that the murder happened due to road rage, there is much scope of political pressure and involvement of local goons in this murder. “We will insist the police to interrogate from all angles. We are feeling neglected by administration and political leadership. We need concrete steps to ensure safety of doctors in campus,” said Dr Saket Mundhada, MARD president at Yavatmal GMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-murder-docs-protest-in-ngp-akola-march-with-candles-after-cops-nab-accused/articleshow/87690060.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said 28 dengue cases were reported in the corporation limits so far this month. “Compared to last year, it is an “alarming increase” in the cases. There is a new case every day. In order to curb the spread, we have decided to implement precautionary measures strictly.” He said the frequent spells of rain was one of the reasons for the increase in dengue cases this year. “We are conducting more tests as well and hence more cases are being identified. An area with a dengue case will be considered a hotspot and from there we will collect serum samples for testing.” The officer said 64 medical camps were being conducted in the city daily by 32 urban primary health centres. “Apart from distributing tablets, ORS sachets are also being distributed, as there will be loss of body fluid if one contracts dengue.” He said 800 domestic breeding checkers were deployed to fight dengue. “Each worker is allotted 600-700 houses, where they will check for mosquito breeding grounds. They have been asked to cover all the houses once in a week.” Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara has instructed the domestic breeding checkers to fine the residents, who fail to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds on their premises. “If they identify mosquito breeding sources at a house, the domestic breeding checkers will first warn the residents and ask them to clear the same for once and all. The residents will be fined if such conducive environment for dengue mosquito breeding were to be found on their premises during the next inspection,” a corporation official told TOI. The official said all the 70 handheld fogging machines and the five mounted on vehicles were being pressed into service daily to eliminate the aedes mosquitoes. “Fogging is done twice a day for a week in hotspot areas. We are closely monitoring both the normal and dengue fever cases in private hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dengue-cases-spike-officials-step-up-vigil/articleshow/87690817.cms||V Devanathan

---||Nagpur||NU Senate witnesses stormy debate over 50:50 exam scheme||Nagpur: Nagpur University’s adjourned Senate meeting on Friday witnessed a stormy debate on the circular issued by it, asking colleges to conduct first, third and fifth semester examinations of undergraduate courses. The members asked the NU top brass led by vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari to withdraw the circular and table the issue once again in the Academic Council for a broader consensus.The issue is not new to the university as Chaudhari’s predecessor SP Kane had also introduced a similar scheme naming it as “50:50 exam system”, which he had made his dream project when he took over in 2015. However, due to stiff opposition from affiliated colleges, the scheme never saw light of the day till expiry of his five-year tenure last year.Chaudhari tried to bulldoze the scheme and managed to clear it from the Academic Council and Board of Deans (BOD) on the basis of sheer numbers from Shikshan Manch and nominated members. However, it again hit a roadblock after Senate members, particularly the elected ones, fiercely opposed the VC’s move.Raising the issue, veteran member Baban Taywade, who was instrumental in opposing it when Kane was VC, said poor students would ultimately suffer if colleges hiked exam fees. He explained about trust which the students have in the NU exams as compared to colleges.“There will be a big difference in the scores of exams conducted by the university and colleges, as the latter are likely to show some leniency to the students. We need broader consensus on the issue before being implemented,” he said.Endorsing his views, Ajit Jachak demanded to withdraw NU’s notification. Other members, including Chetan Kumar Masram, Dhanshree Borikar, Manmohan Bajpayee, Sharayu Taywade, and Praveen Udapure also raised various points related to the topic during the marathon discussions.Chaudhari then entrusted commerce faculty dean Sanjay Kavishwar to clarify NU’s side. The latter explained that many universities like Mumbai had already implemented the system for many years where it only conducted final year papers while first and second year exams were held at the college level.He added that under the ‘New Education Policy’, the government was also bringing the same pattern where colleges would have more autonomy. Citing AICTE guidelines, he further explained that the apex body promotes autonomy among colleges so that those could accommodate latest changes in the industry.Taywade and others strongly countered his arguments by clarifying that Mumbai and NU could not be compared as there was a big difference between the number of students and colleges. They questioned who will set and evaluate papers where there was a big shortage of NET/SET and PhD qualified teachers across all colleges and even NU departments.They added that professional colleges cannot be compared with traditional ones offering arts, commerce and science courses, as a majority of students hailing from the lower strata of society study there.About 50:50 exam schemeFirst, third & fifth semester exams | To be conducted by collegesSecond, fourth & sixth semester exams | To be conducted by universityNU flays actress statement on ‘India’s independence’The NU Senate condemned a statement made by Bollywood star Kangana Ranaut on India’s independence. However, her name was omitted on the request of NU administration. The members flayed any attempt to undermine the nation’s democratic system by anyone. Ranaut had created a storm in her recent interview to a news channel stating that India’s independence in 1947 was not real freedom, but was ‘bheekh’ and real freedom was achieved after 2014. Dinesh Sheram first mentioned about the proposal after which Taywade raised the issue asking the chair to flay such statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-senate-witnesses-stormy-debate-over-5050-exam-scheme/articleshow/87690073.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Even as no action has been taken against the violation so far, the civic body has entertained yet another application from BJP seeking city buses for a rally. BJP city general secretary Narendra ‘Balya’ Borkar told TOI that there is nothing wrong in using city buses for BJP’s rallies and programmes. A couple of days ago, Borkar had submitted an application with NMC’s transport department demanding 100 city buses for a rally organized on November 15. NMC additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena has already told TOI that city buses cannot be allotted to political parties for their rallies and events. But Borkar, also a BJP corporator from East Nagpur, said that NMC has decided to rent out city buses for events. “We are ready to pay the charges. It will give additional revenue to the city bus service which is in loss,” he said.BJP has organized a rally from Yashwant stadium to Akashwani Square in Civil Lines to protest against the state government’s decision to stop foodgrains to a particular section of ration card holders. The transport department has sent Borkar’s application to higher officials suggesting that city buses should not be allotted for the rally. The department cited code of conduct for MLC elections and requirement of buses for smooth operations. Still, the NMC administration forwarded the application to collector’s office seeking opinion whether city buses can be allotted for a rally during code of conduct.Sources in NMC said that collector’s office has sent the application to the state election commissioner for its opinion.NMC officials said reply from collector’s office is awaited. “City buses will not be alotted till the collector office’s gives green signal,” they said.TOI on October 28 had reported about allottment of 60 city buses to BJP for a rally organized against the government based on an application by BJP corporator and chairman of legal consultative committee Dharampal Meshram.A show cause notice was issued to two officials of city transport department but later no action was taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-again-entertains-bjp-plea-to-use-city-buses-for-rally/articleshow/87690069.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Pravin Datke, the party’s city president, said that the state government has not distributed foodgrains recieved from the Centre, to the eligible beneficiaries. Datke said, “Orange card holders are being denied ration even though the Centre has made ample provision. During lockdown, the central government, under leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had sent enough foodgrains to Maharashtra. These foodgrains were to be distributed to needy citizens.” “To highlight this injustice we will take out a morchar from Yeshwant Stadium to district collector’s office. We request maximum people to join this rally because ultimately it is for the benefit of the poor,” said Datke. Apart from Fadnavis, all other senior leaders like Chandrashekhar Bawankule and party’s MLA and corporators are expected to join in. Datke said, “We have a list of demands but the prime ones are to provide immediate foodgrains to all orange card holders, as per the quota received from the Centre.” He also said the online card registration process must be simplified. Speaking to TOI separately, Datke also expressed concern over the violence in Amravati. “We appeal to everyone that peace must prevail at all costs. We are all confident that there will be no spill over of this in Nagpur as citizens here are peace loving and accommodating. All communities concerned here are mature enough to avoid any kind of confrontation. In fact, we appeal to everyone that full cooperation must be accorded to the police in such situations,” said Datke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/denial-of-foodgrains-fadnavis-to-lead-bjp-morcha/articleshow/87690083.cms||---

He slammed the previous government for wreaking havoc by releasing surplus water from Chembarambakkam lake without prior notice in 2015. “A total of 174 people died. More than 1.20 lakh people had to vacate their residences because of the floods then,” he said.“DMK government saved the people of Chennai by taking precautionary measures. DMK took proper steps before the onset of northeast monsoon. Over 19,500 branches of trees were cut so that incidences of tree falling could be prevented,” he said. As soon as the DMK came to power, the government desilted 4,000km of canals at a cost of Rs 65 crore resulting in Cauvery water reaching the tail-end areas, he said. The CM promised to evolve a permanent solution to minimize damages caused by heavy rainfall and flood in the state.However, he maintained that he did not want to politicise the flooding issue. He said a total of 68,652 hectares of cultivated land had been submerged in the rainwater. “Necessary steps will be taken to provide compensation to the farmers for the crop loss,” he said. Stalin said the Union government has not responded to the state government’s demand to extend the deadline for paying premium for crop insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/will-probe-flaws-of-aiadmk-in-desilting-water-bodies-cm/articleshow/87691270.cms||---
---||Goa||Malik’s missing letters indicate large-scale corruption, says AAP||Panaji: Letters by former governor Satya Pal Malik to the Prime Minister and the home minister not available at the Raj Bhavan indicate that the government is trying to cover up the large-scale corruption and protect chief minister Pramod Sawant, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Saturday. “In absence of the letters, it was the duty of the PIO (public information officer) to contact the former governor and request him to hand over copies of his letters for the Raj Bhavan’s record. Instead of doing his duty, the PIO tried to give justifications for the absence of the letters. This clearly shows that he was under pressure to brush the issue under the carpet,” AAP’s state vice president Valmiki Naik said. He added that the PIO for Raj Bhavan, while stating that the information was not available, surmised that there is a separate system of direct communication between the governor and the higher authorities and hence such letters may not have been kept on record. “The PIO is hiding the letters on the instructions of the chief minister,” Naik alleged. Last month, Malik, who is now the governor of Meghalaya, levelled corruption allegations against the Goa government and the chief minister. He had said that “there was rampant corruption in anything and everything the Goa government did”. “Corruption in Goa has become a pressing issue. Goans are now realising the negative impact corruption has on the basic amenities provided to them by the government,” Naik said. While stating that the state government was busy doing corruption even in Covid times, Naik said, “Having seen this, the former governor had sent letters to the Prime Minister seeking action against those involved in it. Unfortunately, the central government took action against Malik and transferred him to Meghalaya.”  “It is the duty of the PIO to lodge a complaint if letters went missing. This is a serious matter. The central and the state governments and the PIO are trying to cover up large-scale corruption,” AAP functionary Amit Palekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/maliks-missing-letters-indicate-large-scale-corruption-says-aap/articleshow/87691280.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid-19: Experts bat for persuasion for last-mile vaccination coverage||PUNE: Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said “top down” approach towards Covid vaccination coverage without engagement of residents could prompt propensity to evade immunization and produce fake certificates. “Mandates always backfire in the long run,” said Dr Kang, a professor with the Christian Medical College (Vellore). Batting for the community involvement, she said it would only help health teams identify areas where vaccination rates were low and cover them by involving people in the last mile coverage. The central health officials also stated on Friday that health workers would knock at every door, check, inspire and motivate people to vaccinate themselves under the “Har Ghar Dastak” programme. “Every individual has a role and NGOs, too, will help,” said a central health officials. A total of 110 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India so far. Of them, 74 crore are first dose and 36 crore are second. The national goal is to cover all eligible people with single dose of Covid vaccine by November 30. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, senior advisor to Public Health Federation of India (PHFI) and a member of the national Covid task force, told TOI that that the country was not in the last mile of vaccination coverage yet. “There is still a lot of distance to be covered to complete vaccination in the country. While the cumulative has crossed 108 crore, we need to have more people completely vaccinated. For this, we have to make efforts to vaccinate those hesitating to take their second dose by using judicious incentives and wherever needed, disincentives, to ensure that the entire population is covered at the earliest,” he said. Dr Salunkhe also said community involvement was critical and a proper communication strategy should be drawn up to ensure that the percentage of vaccination improved in all states. Former state health director Dr PP Doke, also a public health expert, said persuasion was a key factor to ensure that maximum beneficiaries were covered at the earliest. “Some reluctance has been observed among people, especially in those due for their second dose. Some of them have started believing that Covid is over and there is a sense of complacency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-bat-for-persuasion-for-last-mile-vax-coverage/articleshow/87690829.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The classroom block at Government Co-Ed Sarvodaya Secondary School will be equipped with facilities to aid online learning, including smart classrooms, combined desks and projectors. The building is also set to be environment-friendly with solar panels installed on the roof to meet the power consumption of the block, officials said. Stating that there is an increase in the trust that parents are placing with government schools, Sisodia said that 2.7 lakh children have moved from private schools to government schools in the current academic session. “Seven years ago, it was difficult to even imagine that people would have so much faith in government schools that they would take their children out of private schools and enroll them in government schools. The governance model of the Kejriwal government has made this a reality. This is a result of the hard work of our teachers and education department,” Sisodia said. The new building is expected to be ready by July next year and the education department is also planning to expand the school building to increase the number of students who can come to the school from nearby areas, officials said. Highlighting the government’s quest to provide world-class quality education to students of Delhi government schools, Sisodia said, “It is the priority of the Kejriwal government to ensure that every child of Delhi gets access to good quality education. This will promote our children to get educated and lay the foundation stones for a developed India.” “If this school is allotted some land from the adjoining MCD school, the Delhi government will prepare a magnificent playground with sports facilities as well as swimming pools. This will further an all-round development of children and future Olympians may also emerge from this school,” Sisodia added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-7l-kids-shifted-to-govt-schools-this-session-sisodia/articleshow/87691277.cms||---

Following tough measures by administrations, districts having low vaccination percentage are now going full steam with the drive. While some districts are vaccinating more than their daily targets and estimates, others have also reported good numbers, as per data on the Co-Win system. Over 7 lakh have been inoculated in a span of just six days from November 8 to 13 in Vidarbha. The region on Saturday recorded a tremendous jump in vaccination with 1.56lakh taking the jab, which is twice the average daily requirement of 75,000 to meet the November 30 deadline of covering maximum eligible beneficiaries with at least 1st dose. Amravati division recorded 4.4 lakh vaccination while Nagpur saw 2.6 lakh people getting vaccinated in this period. As on November 7, the first dose backlog of Vidarbha stood at 57 lakh vaccination which requires at least 40 days to meet the target. As the pace picked up, the time required can easily come down to 30 days if same figures are achieved on a daily basis. Districts administration have taken a slew of measures such as making vaccination compulsory for entry in government offices, using public transport, availing benefits of schemes etc. Some have warned of discontinuing free first dose while others have tried to lure people with electronic gifts. Amravati division, which is having bulk of unvaccinated eligible population, has been achieving new records after passage of each day. It started with the week at 81,000 jabs and ended on even higher note at 1.56 lakh jabs. Amravati, Buldhana and Akola have been given an average daily target of 15,000 jabs each. On Saturday, Buldhana jabbed 40,000, probably one of its best ever achievement. Amravati too scaled up to 24,000 jabs. Nagpur district alone covered 29,000 more beneficiaries in a day while rest of the districts in this division returned good numbers as per their backlog. TOI had reported that Nagpur division has backlog of 17 lakh. It needs 32,000 jabs per day to vaccinate the remaining 19% targeted beneficiaries with first dose by November 30 deadline. Over 70% of unvaccinated population is from Amravati, Yavatmal and Buldhana. Over 9 lakh are yet to receive their first dose in Amravati while unvaccinated beneficiaries totaling over 5 lakh belong to Akola. Amravati was the epicenter of second wave. Alleged official apathy had let to the rapid spread of Covid-19 from February onwards in the division. The administration now seems to have been successful in convincing people to get jabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-7-lakh-jabbed-in-six-days-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87690114.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Recommendations were made by representatives of resettled families, researchers and NGOs who attended it.The meeting was organized by the college in collaboration with People Development Initiative (PDI), Trichy and Madras School of Social Work. Until the policy is finalised, NGOs urged the state government to insist that authorities offer a moratorium before initiating evictions. They wanted more consultations in all districts involving women and community members to seek their demands. NGOs sought posting of community development officers from social studies background to streamline the livelihood of the population to be rehabilitated and relocated. “We urge the state government to revive and strengthen the community development wing of the urban habitat development board for improving the livelihood of the urban poor,” Dr I Ambalavanan, director, PDI, said. It was pointed out that authorities involved in evictions and relocations should sensitise the community about its need. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/experts-hail-draft-rehab-policy/articleshow/87691272.cms||---

However, recruiters are skipping the event saying the venue for the screening process is crowded. “We skipped the recruitment drive this week as arrangements were not convincing,” a recruiter from the manufacturing sector said. Dozens of recruiters scout for potential candidates every Friday at the district employment office near Bharathidasan road. As the employment office is conducting training for youths to crack competitive exams simultaneously, both the floors were occupied by hundreds of people at a time. Recruiters said that such an environment may push them to postpone or opt for alternative recruitment options.After relaxations were introduced post the second wave, the district employment office near Trichy corporation main office resumed the weekly recruitment drive. Apart from youths, people who lost their jobs also appear in the recruitment process. Recruiters from staffing solutions, manufacturing, marketing and stock market sectors are actively recruiting youths. However, with over 300 people attending the event, inadequate space inside the employment office is making the recruiters feel unsafe. “We were given a very small room, there is no scope for social distancing. Dozens of job seekers were packed in a small cabin,” a recruiter under the conditions of anonymity told TOI. A senior official from the district employment office said that from next week they will consider suspending competitive exam classes on days when recruitment drive is in session. “For mega job fairs, we will conduct the event in school or college campuses,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/weekly-job-fair-at-employment-office-crowded-in-trichy/articleshow/87691276.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Study to evaluate risk of allergy to Covid vaccine in sensitive group||PUNE: A study to evaluate risk of allergy to Covid-19 vaccines among people with a history of food or drug sensitivities will soon be undertaken by the researchers from Mumbai-based Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital. It will be conducted by employing unique methods, such as skin prick and intradermal tests (see box). It will be done under the aegis of the product development centre of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) set up at the hospital. Dr Sunita Chhapola Shukla, founder and director, Mumbai Allergy Centre and Honorary Consultant Allergist, KEM hospital, spearheading the study, told TOI, “The contention of the trial is to exhort the government to not exclude people with a history of allergies from the vaccination drive. All such persons can be tested for an allergic reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine using such tests (skin prick/intradermal) and go ahead with the vaccination if no such reaction occurs,” she said, adding that the study is set to begin shortly. As per Union government guidelines, contraindications for Covid-19 vaccination in India includes people with a history of immediate or delayed-onset anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccines, pharmaceutical products, food-items etc. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI, “The study addresses a specific public health issue. How can the individuals with history of some form of allergy be assessed for safer vaccine administration, pertaining to first as well as second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, is what the investigators have proposed to investigate” Dr Shukla said, “A large part of the Indian population with a history of allergy or documented allergy are either not getting Covid-19 vaccine protection or not taking it due to the fear of adverse allergic effects. This is because the excipient Polysorbate-80 (a derivative of Polyethylene glycol), used in Covishield, could be the possible culprit for an allergic reaction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/study-to-evaluate-risk-of-allergy-to-covid-vaccine-in-sensitive-group/articleshow/87690832.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Two societies in Pune take to care, compassion & awareness to overcome testing times||PUNE: Self-care to stay fit, awareness to bust myths and testing to check Covid-19 spread. These were the tools that helped the residents of two Pune housing societies tide over the medical and health emergency brought in by the pandemic. Arranging the groceries, vegetables and making available tiffin (dabba) for the security guards were few of the other initiatives undertaken by the members of the 17-year-old Hari Ganga Cooperative Housing Society on Alandi Road. a vegetable stall for society members<p><br></p>“It was indeed a mammoth task to get everything together during the initial phase of the pandemic. We faced a lot of difficulties during the first Covid wave due to lack of clarity on almost all fronts. Resultantly, people were scared and not ready to step out of their houses. Arranging essential items for them was the most challenging thing. But each member of the society put in the sincere effort, helping in overcoming the Covid challenge,” Shekhar Bongir, chairman of the society, told TOI. The federation of River Residency Society on Dehu-Alandi Road also took several efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Prakash Jukantwar, vicechairman of the society who works as a psychiatrist at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital, said, “We helped the Covid-infected families by providing them essential items at doorstep during the two waves of the pandemic. This not only helped them get confidence, but also contained the spread of the virus in and outside the society.” The housing society has a total of 1,300 flats. Hari Ganga society’s chairman Bongir said they put in extra efforts for the benefit of the senior citizens. “Such residents were among the high-risk people and were restricted at home. So, right from their groceries, gas cylinders and regular medicines, we made them available everything at the doorstep. It was a tough task, but we did manage it,” he said. He said the society members engaged themselves in creating awareness about Covid-19 since the first wave of the pandemic. “To get the positive response and clear the doubts regarding the virus and its spread, we had roped in two doctors. They explained the medical aspects clearly to all the residents and also cleared their doubts,” Bongir said. The society also focused on sanitizing common areas of the premises, for which a contract was given to a private agency. “We have even arranged a vaccination camp for the residents of the society a few weeks ago,” Bongir said. The members of the River Residency Society gave paramount importance to Covid-19 testing. “We have so far carried out six rapid antigen Covid-19 testing drives to identify any possible infected patients,” society’s vice-chairman Jukantwar said. The residents also helped the infected families by arranging hospital beds, plasma and blood for the patients, while taking care of themselves. Talking about the mental support, Jukantwar said, “This was very crucial for all the infected families. We maintained personal contact with them to build confidence in them.” Over 90% of the society residents have been vaccinated now. “Residents continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour sincerely in all their daily activities now also,” Jukantwar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-societies-take-to-care-compassion-awareness-to-overcome-testing-times/articleshow/87690830.cms||---
---||Kochi||League warns of legal action against govt, calls meeting||Kozhikode: Muslim League said it would take legal action against the state government over its decision to entrust Public Service Commission (PSC) with the task of making appointments to Kerala Waqf Board. IUML state general secretary PMA Salam on Saturday said the Left government has been acting as if it harboured some hostility towards the Muslim community ever since it came to power. “The other day the government passed a law which entrusts appointments to the Waqf Board with the PSC. There are merely 100 posts in Waqf Board and they are leaving the appointments to them to the PSC. At the same time, there are over 10,000 posts in the Devaswom board and those postings have not been left to the PSC. Instead, they set up a special recruitment board for devaswom. Why can't they create a similar one for Waqf board as well,” Salam said addressing the media at Malappuram. He added that the stipulation that only Muslims would be appointed to the Waqf Board was a deception and that since the appointments are made through PSC, in future, inevitably, those from other communities as well would be appointed. He said a meeting of Muslim organisations has been called on November 22. Salam added that a decision on the further course of action would be taken after a discussion with other organisations. On Friday, the Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema had lashed out against the government over its decision saying that the LDF government, which secured a second term in office, has hastened its anti-Muslim moves. In an editorial published in its mouthpiece Suprabhatham, Samastha said a joint protest by Muslim organizations has become inevitable to put an end to the alleged anti-Muslim actions of the government, including the decision on appointments to the Waqf Board. It said that the government was repeating the same deception it carried out in the case of scuttling minority scholarship ratio in Kerala. “The government initially said that it will entrust both devaswom and Waqf board appointments to PSC. But after the proposal met with strong opposition from the majority community, it formed a special recruitment board for devaswom appointments and stipulated that those believing in Hinduism and temple worship should be the members of the board. The government seems to have moved ahead with entrusting Waqf Board appointments to PSC on the belief that Muslim community in state has become a section for whom there is no one to raise a voice,” the editorial had said. “It will lead to alienation of Waqf properties. Also the focus on social welfare schemes could get scuttled and aid for marriage, treatment, education and pensions for Qatibs and Imams could be denied by citing various reasons," the editorial had said. It had also alleged that the LDF government was moving ahead with anti- Muslim moves and policies even outmatching the BJP thinking that it can hold on to its last remaining bastion by appeasing majority communalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/league-warns-of-legal-action-against-govt-calls-meeting/articleshow/87690856.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat’s circular economic model presented at COP26||SURAT: After becoming a model city in the country for its circular economy — generating revenue through reuse of waste water — Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is now aiming to become a net Zero Liquid Discharge city. City municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani highlighted the city’s achievements at COP26 organized by Global Resilient Cities Network, Glasgow. Pani explained how the city is generating funds of Rs 140 crore by selling 115 MLD water recycled from waste water. The city aims to generate Rs 500 crore through selling the treated water for non-potable uses. “Surat city’s model of recycling and reuse of water has been widely appreciated by the participating members at the global conference. We have shown how a circular economy model can work in a city where we are generating revenue by selling treated water,” Pani told TOI. Along with recycling and reusing waste water, SMC also demonstrated the model of protecting its natural water resources. SMC’s efforts in blocking 44 outlets of wastewater that used to be released into Tapi river and thus preventing 370 MLD waste water mixing with river water was highlighted at the conference. “Surat city is generating 1,000 MLD waste water and we are aiming to treat and reuse it entirely. We have discussed the ideas of how we are going to adopt technology to recycle and reuse the waste water,” he added. It should be noted that the city was recently awarded Water+ certification as part of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and became the first in the state to get the status. The certificate was issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) for best practice in waste water management. Only those cities which were declared ODF++ (open defecation free) were eligible to qualify for this certification. Taking a step ahead, the city also scored higher points in managing the sewage water as per the global standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surats-circular-economic-model-presented-at-cop26/articleshow/87690137.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation plans to resume OPD services at its hospitals||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation is planning to start general OPD and other medical services at its four hospitals following a drop in Covid-19 cases. Officials said that the general OPD facility is likely to be started at Dalvi hospital in Shivajingar area, Khedekar hospital in Bopodi, Laigude hospital on Sinhagad Road and Sonawane hospital in Bhavani Peth by next week. The preliminary planning for providing required staff and medical officers at these hospitals has started. The number of patients admitted for Covid treatment has reduced at the PMC-run hospitals. Citing an improvement in the situation, local corporators have demanded that the administration start other medical services at the hospitals. Officials, however, said that a plan has been kept ready for re-utilisation of hospitals for treatment of Covid patients in case of a surge in cases. “We have a plan in place to tackle a possible third wave of infection. The hospitals will be pressed into service for Covid-19 treatment in a phased manner,” officials said. The PMC has also set up a dedicated wing for Covid positive children at one of the hospitals in Yerawada. A senior official said, “The next two weeks are crucial. We will be monitoring surge in cases post-festive season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-resume-opd-services-at-its-hospitals/articleshow/87690833.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation moots app-based system for supply of drinking water||KOCHI: City corporation authorities have mooted an app-based system for ensuring supply of quality drinking water in the city. All those who require potable water in the city should buy water only through the new system to be introduced by the corporation. Water from Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers will be distributed. Water will be dispensed from the plants of Kerala water authority (KWA) at Maradu and Aluva. The system would function like an online cab service. Once a person books water, the system will automatically send messages to the driver of the tanker truck, which is nearest to the fetching station. Once the driver accepts the order, the system will generate a pass which consists of date, location etc. “As of now, there are many incidents of contaminated water being supplied. The new system is to ensure that residents in the city get quality drinking water at affordable prices. As water would be dispensed from the KWA plants, where there are adequate quality checking devices, the consumer can be assured of pure potable water,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf. A Thiruvananthapuram-based firm has been assigned to operate the system on a trial basis. “Once the system is found to be a success, we will make it a permanent arrangement,” Ashraf said. Besides the mobile app, other modes like web, Akshaya centres in the corporation limits, corporation health circle offices, etc also can be used for booking. Water quality module of the app will help regular monitoring of the quality of water being supplied. Random samples will be collected from the trucks which transport water. The number and other details of the trucks from which samples are to be collected on a given day will automatically be communicated to officials who monitor the quality aspects via SMS or WhatsApp. The samples will be sent to the quality testing labs and authorities will take measures as per the outcome of the testing. There will be a vehicle owners’ portal where all details of the vehicles including registration, permit and other mandatory certificates should be uploaded. If a vehicle’s documents are found to be expired, then the system will not issue passes to such vehicles until the documents are renewed. There will be facilities for tracking the vehicles as well. The rentals of the trucks would be sent to the owner’s account on a weekly basis. “The decision to float an app-based system for ensuring distribution of quality water in the city is a welcome move. But, there doesn’t seem an alternative if the app-based system becomes defunct. So, there should be an alternative plan as well,” said opposition leader Antony Kureethra. “Moreover, consumers will have to pay a service charge to the corporation. This may increase the price of drinking water. Corporation authorities should take such issues also into consideration,” Kureethra said. There is also a plan for using the facility for collection of sewage from the households and establishments in the city for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-moots-app-based-system-for-supply-of-drinking-water/articleshow/87690164.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

On Friday, Delhi’s AQI touched 471 on a scale of 500, higher than 462 reported a day after Diwali. Smog with cocktail of noxious gases engulfed Jaipur’s sky affecting visibility. Health experts said it was causing breathing discomfort and respiratory illness among most people on prolonged exposure. As Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have been over 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 17 and 19 hours, respectively, states have been told to be ready to roll out “emergency” steps under the Graded Response Action Plan. Bhiwadi’s AQI was the worst in Rajasthan at 446. Kota’s air quality was also in ‘very poor’ category clocking 337. At 4pm, suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) at the Jaipur commissionarate was measured at 337 micrograms per cubic metre while PM10 was recorded at 238 micrograms per cubic metre. At Adarsh Nagar, PM2.5 was 361 while PM10 was 198. At Shastri Nagar, PM2.5 was 342 and PM10 was 157. The safe limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. “The main reasons for smog is that with the arrival of winter, velocity of air decreases. And when the velocity of air decreases, pollutants do not disperse in the air easily. When the velocity of air remains normal or high, pollutants disperse easily and does not create any sort of smog,” said an expert at Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The city had witnessed its worst-polluted day of the season on November 5 and since then the air quality improved till November 10 as it turned from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ to ‘moderate.’ It remained moderate till November 12 but again deteriorated on November 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/citys-air-quality-breaches-very-poor-category-again/articleshow/87691302.cms||---
---||Delhi||Restaurants in Delhi need single licence for liquor||NEW DELHI: Ahead of the implementation of new excise policy, the Delhi government has merged four separate licences. Now, a single licence is needed for serving liquor at restaurants in the capital. The move is aimed at cutting down on paperwork and at facilitating ease of doing business, said officials. Meanwhile, a major shortage of liquor has hit the capital with the existing government shops getting ready to wind up their business while the private shops have already been closed to make way for big liquor stores. Many of the government stores are reporting shortage of various brands and they are no longer replenishing their stocks. The new liquor stores are permitted to open from November 17 and many shops are in the final stage of completion. According to a notification issued by the excise commissioner, existing L-17, L-17 F, L-18, L-18 F licences will be combined into a L-17 licence as per the report of a group of ministers that was released earlier this year. The L-17 licence was meant for service of Indian liquor in restaurants, while L-17F licence was meant for service of foreign liquor there in restaurants. The L-18 and L-18F licences were required for serving different liquors like wine and beer in the restaurants. The notification explained that the annual licence fee of L-17 licence will be Rs 5 lakh for restaurants with up to 1,000 sq feet area, Rs 15 lakh for 1,001 to 2,500 sq feet area and Rs 25 lakh for above 2,500 sq feet. The L-17 licence holder may serve any Indian or foreign liquor at any area, including balcony, terrace or open spaces or lower areas of the restaurant. They are, however, required to make sure that the area where the liquor will be served is screened off from public view. A liquor trader, who did not want to be identified, said that the capital was headed for a liquor crisis because while all the existing shops would be closing down from November 17, the 850 new liquor stores would not open in a single day. “Many of the shops are ready but only a handful of shops are likely to open on November 17,” said the trader. The trader also added that only 35 liquor brands were registered under the new excise policy till a few days ago while Delhi had around 400 registered brands under the old excise policy. “The excise department must speed up brands’ registration before November 17.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurants-need-single-licence-for-liquor/articleshow/87691287.cms||AlokKNMishra

As a channel that carries surplus rainwater often damages the mud road, local people sought the district administration to build a bridge on the road. S Saravanan, 30, who suffered injuries in an accident, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday, and his relatives at Nakkambadi village in Ariyalur conducted final rites and were taking the mortal remains to the cremation ground. But on the way, the mud road was found washed away by surplus water from the Big tank of Nakkambadi that was flowing to the Kuzhumur tank for irrigating maize and cotton in six villages. As it was impossible to cross the damaged road, the relatives cremated the body around 200m before the cremation ground.  Although a concrete road was established near the cremation ground, it was not fully completed to help villagers access the site. On information, revenue department officials and representatives of the ruling party visited the village. The locals have also petitioned the district administration seeking a bridge to approach the cremation ground in Nakkambadi village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/road-washed-away-in-flood-kin-cremate-deceased-midway/articleshow/87691278.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Thane police serve notice to Sameet Thakkar amid drama||THANE/NAGPUR: Thane police has registered a criminal case against Nagpur resident Sameet Thakkar for tweeting defamatory/offensive messages about NCP leader Nawab Malik and housing minister Jitendra Awhad. On Friday, a team of Sitabuldi police with senior inspector Atul Sabnis had landed at the Thakkar family’s residence in Wathoda to record a statement. Sameet’s brother Rishi said the cops wanted his younger sibling to step out of the house but relented after former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule assured to bring Sameet along the next day. “On Saturday around 180-200 cops landed up at our house, which is questionable,” he said. Rishi added that a senior journalist issued threats to his brother for “exposing” a politician. “My brother is a citizen activist and a freelance journalist without any party affiliation,” he said, adding that Sameet was being targeted for exposing the truth and “black deeds” of some politicians in power, and cricketers. Nagpur police chief Amitesh Kumar said city police only provided assistance to a team of Kalwa police that visited Thakkar’s place to serve him a notice for the registration of an offence. “Nagpur police only accompanied the team from Kalwa,” said Kumar, adding that all the steps taken were in strict adherence to the law. Sources said Bawankule and hordes of BJP workers reached Thakkar’s place when Thane cops, along with city police, went to his place to serve the notice. Sources added that Thane police were contemplating arresting Thakkar, who already has similar offences against his name for targeting politicians on social media in the past. Thane police relented after sensing BJP may resort to agitation, the sources said. A police officer said the offence was registered by one Dinesh Bane, who is a youth NCP functionary from the Kalwa-Mumbra assembly segment. In his complaint, Bane said that at around 3pm on Friday, he found Sameet’s “objectionable” tweet. The tweet reportedly stated, “Mumbra Maharashtra resident Sajjad Dhosi who was arrested in Dwarka Gujarat Drug haul case with 88 cr drugs in bags is an aide of Maharashtra Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad. Hello Miya @nawabmalikncp you your party are truly Narcotics Congress Party.” Bane mentioned that the tweet was posted on 11 November at around 3.59pm. The complainant added that there is currently a war of words among the political parties and hence a possibility that such tweets are posted with the intention of “creating more tension”. The complainant also called the tweet “instigating”. An offence was registered at Kalwa police station under Section 505 (2) for ‘statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes’, said Kalwa police senior inspector Manohar Awhad. Subsequently, a Kalwa police team was dispatched to Nagpur reportedly to nab Thakkar, but with the BJP leaders allegedly resisting, Thakkar was given notice under Section 41 of CRPC and asked to produce himself within five days before Kalwa police, said Awhad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thane-police-serve-notice-to-sameet-thakkar-amid-drama/articleshow/87690870.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Pune||Minister for participatory model in dists with low immunization||Pune: Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pawar on Saturday pushed for participatory model of vaccination for districts recording below 50% imminization against Covid-19 so far. “People should come forward and take the responsibility as the Centre has done its duty and provided enough doses to all states,” she told TOI. The minister said some districts in 11 states had registered less than 50% vaccination and it was a concern. These states would have to take responsibility and ensure that an environment was created to encourage more vaccination, she said. “Some states have announced Tika Mahotsav and some have launched Tika Vali Naav vaccination mahotsav to reach interiors and cover the people left out. The administration should work with people to ensure that they themselves come forward and help in these programmes,” Bharati Pwar said. The Union minister’s statement assumes significance while many state cabinet ministers are pushing forth a coercive model for pacing up the vaccination in Maharashtra, especially in laggard districts, like Aurangabad, Amravati, Beed, Akola and Nandurbar. Parrying questions on if coercive methods should be used to ramp up vaccination, Bharati Pawar said, “Why should anyone compel, why can’t citizens take responsibility, come on their own and get vaccinated?” She said earlier the states had complained about not receiving enough vaccines. “Today, many big states have one crore doses pending with them. Now, it is up to them how they increase the participation of the community to speed up vaccination,” she said, adding that many states such as Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Ladakh were inching towards 100% vaccination and they should be set as examples for other states. On some states’ demand (including Maharashtra) to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield, Bharati Pawar said, “Any decisions on it would be based on the advice of the task force.” She said, “As of now the focus is to ensure complete vaccination because currently about 79.2% of India’s adult population has received one dose of Covid vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minister-for-participatory-model-in-dists-with-low-immunization/articleshow/87690858.cms||Nisha Nambiar

ABVP functionaries, accompanied by the two students who sustained injuries in Friday’s baton charge incident, demanded that CO City be removed from his post for allowing violence against students. “We held a discussion with the principal of MBPG College today (November 13) and put forth our demands. Students have been demanding an increase in the number of admission seats for a long time now. So, that should be done. Besides, CO City, at whose behest the students were baton-charged, should be removed from his post,” said Devendra Bisht, district convenor, ABVP. Echoing a similar sentiment, Gaurav Sambal, one of the students who sustained injuries during the baton charge, told TOI, “The police action was uncalled for as the students were protesting peacefully. Thus, CO city must be sacked at the earliest.” On the other hand, police have dismissed allegations of baton charging students. “The students were not baton-charged. A few of them, who were not letting CO City’s vehicle pass by, were only removed from the path,” said Jagdish Chandra, SP City. Notably, the admission process has come to a standstill at MBPG College due to the ongoing protest. The agitating students have forcibly closed the college office, stopped professors from taking classes, and ransacked the examination department. Meanwhile, several college students staged a sit-in protest at Gandhi Park in Dehradun on Saturday against the state government for not allowing student union elections in higher education institutions across the state. The students said that both the central and state governments are holding their respective elections but when it comes to student union polls, then the excuse of the Covid-19 pandemic is put forward. The student union elections in various colleges and universities of the state were last held in 2019. The office bearers, who were selected then, are still occupying the positions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-baton-charge-abvp-members-students-hold-protest-against-police-administration/articleshow/87690182.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Dehradun||U’khand govt declares holiday on Igas, state’s own Diwali; Cong calls move 'politically-driven'||Dehradun: Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami's decision to declare a government holiday on Igas (Budhi Diwali) - celebrated 11 days in Uttarakhand after the Diwali festival – has brought the BJP and the Congress face-to-face yet again ahead of 2022 assembly polls. While the Congress claimed the announcement was politically motivated and it would make Igas a holiday when voted to power, the ruling BJP has slammed the opposition party maintaining that in the “Congress tenure holiday was announced for Friday, for offering namaz.” CM Dhami recently announced the government holiday for Igas, which he said was aimed “to promote tradition and culture of the state". However, soon after, former CM Harish Rawat posted a message on social media questioning the motive behind announcing a “holiday on Sunday as Igas is on November 14”. Thereafter, the government order was issued and a holiday was announced for Monday, November 15. Addressing a gathering in Pithoragarh on Saturday, CM Dhami said, “I have declared a holiday for a festival which is widely celebrated in the state. Igas is celebrated 11 days after Diwali. People from far off places will reach their homes. There is a leader who has a problem with the decision. We announced a holiday on Monday so that people got time to celebrate. When he was the CM, he announced a holiday for Friday and you must be knowing the reason why.” On the other hand, Rawat maintained that the BJP is in power and can easily find the copy of the order where he had declared a holiday on Friday. “There was no such decision. They are declaring holiday for Igas in the election year, if voted to power Congress will announce holiday on Igas each year,” Rawat said, adding that the move was “politically driven and aimed to please the BJP vote bank”. Uttarakhand Congress vice-president Surendra Kumar termed Dhami as “pinch hitter" who was trying to cover up the failures of the two "TSRs" – Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat. Kumar said, “The BJP government woke up on Igas now and was sleeping silent for the last four years.” Igas is celebrated 11 days after the country celebrates Diwali. It is widely believed that the news of Lord Ram returning to Ayodhya came 11 days late to this part, therefore Diwali is also celebrated in the form of Igas or Budhi Diwali in the Himalayan state. Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni has been running a campaign for the last few years to encourage Uttarakhand people living in other states to return to their native villages to spend the festival with their family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-declares-holiday-on-igas-states-own-diwali-cong-calls-move-politically-driven/articleshow/87690184.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Ramesh, Chandy to meet AICC leaders||Thiruvananthapuram: Senior leaders in the Congress party would approach the party high command against KPCC president K Sudhakaran’s decision to go ahead with the party revamp entailing appointment of new KPCC secretaries and functionaries of district Congress committees. The group leaders and those claiming neutrality in the party are of the view that since the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) has already declared elections in the party and the membership drive has begun, the restructuring should be stopped. It is learnt that senior leaders Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy will be meeting AICC president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi in the coming week to register their protest against the decision of the KPCC president. In the last KPCC meeting Sudhakaran had said that the reorganization of the party will be continued only after consultations with the AICC leadership. However, in the executive committee meeting that was held recently, the KPCC president said he is going ahead with the party revamp, which has irked the group leaders. Since the elections have been declared in the party, the leaders are of the view that there is no point in appointing the new committees. They will be replaced by the new ones once the elections are completed. Hence, the group leaders and managers want the revamping procedures to be stopped with immediate effect. Senior leaders in the party, including Mullappally Ramachandran and V M Sudheeran are already unhappy with the way the party restructuring has been going on despite the AICC declaring the elections. Several group managers have submitted a memorandum before the AICC leadership against the KPCC president in this regard. As the party high command is yet to respond positively on the issue, Chennithala and Chandy took the decision to meet the AICC president personally to register their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-chandy-to-meet-aicc-leaders/articleshow/87690866.cms||---

Bidhuri, who also participated in the meeting, said that under the new excise policy, liquor shops would be opened in many areas of the capital. “It will entangle the younger generation in the quagmire of liquor consumption and put the safety of women in danger. But the AAP government is not concerned about it,” said Bidhuri. The Badarpur MLA claimed that liquor shops are being opened in densely populated areas and it will become difficult for women and children to pass through the streets where liquor shops are located. The villagers are planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal with a memorandum and demand that the liquor policy should be withdrawn.

---||Visakhapatnam||GVMC novel plan to make Vizag water shock resilient||VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time for any city in India, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has decided to develop a city-level water resilience plan for Visakhapatnam. For this initiative, the GVMC will seek the technical assistance of Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA). The CWRA-City Water Resilience Approach has been developed by SIWI and applied to various cities across the globe, for the preparation of their respective city water resilience plans. The water resilience plan will be prepared under the Sustainability and Resilience Programme (SRU) of the GVMC, which has been started to continue the activities of the United Nations Development Programme-Government of India project. A city water resilience plan was suggested by the NIUA of the ministry of housing and urban affairs. The NIUA selected Visakhapatnam city for the water resilience plan preparation by involving SIWI. This plan will be prepared as part of the SRU activities by involving engineering, city planning and public health sections of the GVMC. GVMC commissioner G Lakshmisha said Vizag is in a constant state of negotiation between adversities and advantages in order to excel towards becoming a resilient city. “We invited foreign experts to Visakhapatnam to extend their technical assistance in preparation of the water resilience plan for the city,” said Lakshmisha. As per ‘The City Water Resilience Approach’ developed by SIWI, water resilience relates to how well a city is prepared to face any water-related stresses and shocks. This is important considering the increasing number of water-related stresses across the globe, such as depleting ground water, poor water quality, water scarcity, salinity intrusion, increasing water demand, poor sanitation, low-lying areas, drainage problems etc., and shocks such as cyclones, heavy rains, urban flooding, heat waves, coastal erosion etc. A water resilient city can survive and thrive through various shocks and stresses related to water. To carry out the UNDP-GoI (USAID) project’s activities and city initiatives for long-term, Sustainability and Resilience Programme (SRP) has been started by the establishment of SRU in December 2020. This serves as an autonomous and self-sustained entity under the commissioner, GVMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-novel-plan-to-make-city-water-shock-resilient/articleshow/87690191.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said the device did not have any explosives or detonators but contained small batteries and a few nails. The series of events began shortly after 4.30pm when an e-rickshaw driver arrived with the cake in a box at Vibhu Gupta’s shop. The driver handed over the box to Gupta which had a small message on the top saying “Gupta tere liye surprise hai” (There is a surprise for you inside). When Gupta opened the box slightly, he saw some wires jutting out of it and a note, which asked him to travel in the same e-rickshaw with Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh. The letter also threatened that if he failed to pay, the bomb would explode. Shaken after reading it, Gupta refused to take the box and returned it to the driver. According to Lamba, the driver took the cake home and found a digital watch, batteries and wires inside it. “Shocked, the driver threw the box in a culvert. About the same time, we received a complaint at Jawahar Nagar police station from the trader,” Lamba said. SHO Panna Lal examined CCTV footage outside Gupta’s shop and tracked down the rickshaw driver. “We also found the box and the device in a culvert and brought it to the police station,” said an official. The driver claimed that a woman near a hotel in Raja Park paid him Rs 50 to deliver it to Gupta. The driver claimed he could not identify the woman, but police have constituted a special team to track down the woman. ‘Bomb’ design leaves cops perplexedThe bomb-like device contained three batteries, a ticking digital machine and three batteries usually used in home appliances. “The design indicates that it was a rookie job because it was a complete prototype of a bomb sans any explosive materials or anything to trigger it,” said an official. Hunt on for the woman who sent the giftA police team was examining CCTVs to ascertain the identity of the woman who asked the driver to deliver the box to Gupta. Despite an intensive search, police said they don’t have anything to confirm who the woman was.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-trader-gets-fake-bomb-in-cake/articleshow/87691309.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Health dept, Doon admin to crack down on pharmacies flouting norms||Dehradun: Following allegations of pharmacies in Dehradun not adhering to prescription guidelines and flouting drug-distribution laws, the health department and Dehradun district administration have said they will take action against any establishment found violating the law. According to provisions, no pharmacy is allowed to sell Schedule H, H1 drugs, lifesaving medicines, psychotropics, among others, over the counter. The license of any pharmacy, selling these drugs without a prescription, can immediately be suspended, as per the law. Neeraj Kumar, senior drug inspector, Dehradun, told TOI, “It was brought to our attention that some pharmacies may be selling such drugs without a prescription. Therefore, our teams are now conducting random inspections throughout the city. On an average, 20-25 inspections are conducted monthly and about 10 samples are collected. We will be conducting more inspections soon.” According to the district drug department, there are around 3,500 registered pharmacies in the city. In the last two days, the chief medical officer of Dehradun, along with drug department officials, inspected three pharmacies and two clinics. Samples were also collected for testing from these establishments. “While there was no evidence of sales without prescription, we found issues with the registration documents of two of the establishments we inspected. We have issued notices to them. The clinics were also not up to date with their papers. As this is a serious medical lapse, we instructed them to fix the issue and follow all norms of the Medical Establishment Act,” said CMO, Dehradun, Dr Manoj Upreti. The sale records and stock register of the pharmacies were also scrutinised during the exercise. Officials are especially concerned about the illegal sale of addictive drugs around the educational institutions of the city. “We don’t want the younger generation to have access to any pharmaceutical without a doctor’s recommendation for fear of addiction. Our staff will be on the lookout for any violations. Strict action will be taken against all offenders,” said the CMO. While a majority of pharmacy owners scrapped the allegations of selling addictive drugs over the counter, a pharmacist at a Dalanwala-based shop, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “Big pharmacy brands are very particular about prescriptions but the smaller companies don’t pay that much attention to it. Over the years, we have become familiar with a lot of our clientele. So, we make exceptions for them every now and then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/health-dept-doon-admin-to-crack-down-on-pharmacies-flouting-norms/articleshow/87690294.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Delhi||GK-1 market to get multilevel parking to ease congestion||New Delhi: Keeping in mind the acute shortage of parking space in the city and residents struggling daily, South Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to construct a multilevel shuttle car parking facility in Greater Kailash-1 M-Block market. With an estimated total cost of over Rs 63 crore, the parking facility will have the capacity to hold 399 vehicles on seven floors. The corporation in the past has constructed other automated parking lots in Lajpat Nagar and Green Park areas. When it was first planned in 2017, this shuttle parking lot was supposed to have a capacity of 200 cars. In October, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti wrote a letter to the standing committee, stating the M-Block market is prone to traffic congestion due to lack of sufficient parking space. “The new kind of shuttle parking system will park the vehicles at a floor wherever there is space after the car is left at a designated spot. The automated parking system will select the floor as well as the available vacant spot on that floor where the vehicle can be parked,” said an official. SDMC has finalised the agency, which will construct the parking lot and be responsible for its operation and maintenance for 10 years. The work is expected to be completed in the next 18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gk-1-market-to-get-multilevel-parking-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/87691318.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ind-NZ T20I: ‘Curating’ it right for special debuts||Jaipur: The statistics at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium heavily favours India. In 13 matches, 12 ODIs and a solo Test, India have won eight and drawn one. A happy hunting ground for the home team it seems. But the fact that India will be back at the venue after eight long years, makes these results irrelevant. More so, because with the India-New Zealand match on Wednesday, T20 internationals make their first appearance at the stadium. Other high-profile debuts on the day would be of former captain Rahul Dravid as India head coach and Rohit Sharma as the full-time T20I skipper. The day will herald a fresh start for so many involved and to ensure the hype is matched and the standards are met, the central zone pitch curator Taposh Chatterjee has been ‘protecting’ the wicket well. “As we were aware of the match date, we have protected the pitch from overuse and underuse to ensure the juice remains and the pitch is not slow. It has been tested during Colvin Shield, Under-19 matches, practice matches for state senior team and senior women challenger trophy,” the curator said. He added that the strip at the centre will be used for the match. “The simple reason behind using the fifth strip was to make sure that the seats are not killed and the dressing room is easily visible. These permutations and combinations have to be kept in mind. Since it is only one match, we could make it possible. During the IPL we invariably have to keep rotating the wickets to avoid overuse,” Chatterjee said.The USP of the shortest format of the game is its high-scoring nature, and what’s it without skyscrapers? “People should get value for money they spent on tickets to watch a T20 match. Expectation is of witnessing good high-scoring matches. So keeping that in mind a wicket has to be readied. In T20s if there is no consistent bounce, it cannot be a high-scoring pitch or if there is lateral movement it becomes difficult to score,” the curator mentioned. The match night will be a ‘special occasion’ for many and Chatterjee will be one of them, “For Rajasthan it is a very happy moment as an international match is happening after eight years. Since it is my home state I am putting in extra effort to ensure everything goes well,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ind-nz-t20i-curating-it-right-for-special-debuts/articleshow/87691315.cms||---

Elaborating the acronym ‘JAM’, Shah said, “Akhilesh has come in the field with JAM that means Jinnah (Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan), Azam Khan (SP member) and Mukhtar (jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari). While Yogi Ji’s ‘JAM’ means Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar cards and Mobile for everyone to eradicate corruption from its root. Now, people have to decide which JAM they would prefer.” He also publicly endorsed Yogi’s leadership and portrayed him as the next CM after polls. “I’m appealing you to give all Vidhan Sabha seats in Azamgarh to BJP so that Yogi could be made CM again,” Shah added.

He was speaking after inauguratingLaying the foundation of a university, Shah suggested it be named after Hindu warrior king and Rajbhar icon Suheldev, who fought battles to oust the invaders, in a clear message to woo the Rajbhar community and politically decimate the nascent OP Rajbhar-Samajwadi Party electoral alliance. Yogi announced that the university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev. “On behalf of the state government, I announce that the state university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev,” he said. “A place which had turned into a hub of extremists and a harbour for terror modules in the past several years, is now going to be converted into a place of Goddess Saraswati. The era of change for Azamgarh, which had converted into ‘adda’ (den) of anti-national activities, has begun,” Shah said. “We expected seats from Azamgarh in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly polls but failed to get them.

The health department will carry out a massive door-to-door survey to create the data bank of the lifestyle diseases among the people in the state and to study the reasons behind it. A mobile application is being readied under the ehealth programme for this, said the minister. This will be a comprehensive survey comprising data of people living with lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, COPD, oral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. The campaign is intended to create an awareness among the people on the diseases caused due to our lifestyle. Unhealthy eating habits, use of tobacco, addiction to liquor and lack of exercise are causing the lifestyle diseases among the youth. When a data bank is created, the health department will be able to launch campaigns focussing specific target groups for creating awareness, said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lifestyle-diseases-registry-in-the-works-minister/articleshow/87690887.cms||---

Saturday’s bandh call was in response to Friday’s protest rallies by Muslim organisations to condemn the recent violence in Tripura. The rally witnessed stone pelting in which shops were damaged, leading to the bandh call. Internet services will remain suspended for three days to prevent the spread of rumours that fuel violence, said city police commissioner Arti Singh. On Saturday, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags and raising slogans, came out on the streets in Rajkamal Chowk area. Some people hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, police said, adding that the cops lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control. To aid the police force there, about hundred cops and 10 officers from Nagpur have been sent. Also, One or two companies of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) are expected to reach Amravati soon. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. The Nashik rural police have so far booked close to 1,500 people on charges of rioting, robberies, attempt to murder and assault . Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it was wrong to organise rallies in the state for an incident that “never occurred”. Meanwhile, the ministry of home affairs has said that news reports circulating on the social media about vandalism at a mosque in Tripura are fake and are a complete misrepresentation of facts. There has been no damage to the mosque in Kakraban area of Gomati district of Tripura, the MHA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curfew-in-amravati-after-fresh-violence/articleshow/87692043.cms||---

This is the first time in the city that a corporation is going to send its teachers to study abroad. Corporation schools, which have a relatively poor image regarding the quality of education, hope that the new learning styles acquired by teachers will fill in any teaching gaps. “We will be sending our teachers to foreign universities to study in teacher training-related programmes. EDMC will sponsor their entire education,” said Vikas Anand, commissioner for the corporation. Foreign training of government staff like civil servants has been taking place since 2001. Delhi government also has sent teachers to foreign universities to gain international exposure. As per the scheme, EDMC will sponsor two teachers for training at a reputed foreign university in the first year. There are around 5,000 teachers in corporation schools, including principals. Only regular teachers employed at corporation schools for more than 10 years with an impeccable professional record and not more than 42-years-old are eligible for the sponsorship. The teachers will get admissions in the top 100 institutes as per the Times Higher Education World University rankings published every year. They can take up subjects like public education, special education, developments in education and the use of digital technology in education. The maximum time allowed for a course is three years. Teachers will have to send reports of performance back to the corporation for further funding. Under the scheme, the maximum amount of funding approved by the corporation is Rs 75 lakhs per annum per teacher, including tuition fee, accommodation, living allowance, books and study material and travelling to and fro. If the person fails to complete the foreign study programme, then the person will have to return the funds spent by the corporation. EDMC has now started inviting applications for the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-send-teachers-abroad-to-upgrade-skills/articleshow/87691339.cms||---

A consumer court in the city on Friday made this observation while not only asking United Insurance Company Ltd to pay the entire treatment bill to a resident of Harni-Warasia Ring Road, who was infected with Covid-19, but also directing the civic body and state government’s health department to inquire and act against hospitals which charged more than the capped treatment rates set by VMC. Alpa Fadia had approached Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum after the insurance company did not pay the claim amount of Rs 1.2 lakh for her husband Mayank’s Covid-19 treatment. Mayank was admitted to a private Covid-designated hospital in April and had paid over Rs 2.2 lakh for the treatment. The couple had submitted a claim to the insurance company to reimburse the treatment expenses as Mayank was covered under the Corona Kavach policy. But they were paid only a part of the bill amount by the insurance company as it cited VMC’s notification. The notification had capped the ward rates at Rs 8,500 for a day which would also include pathology and medicine charges. During the hearing of the case, the couple’s lawyer argued that they are entitled to get the full amount as they had nothing to do with the VMC’s notification. It was also argued that if the insurance company believes that the hospital had charged more, then it should complain to the VMC against the hospital. The consumer forum presided by I C Shah upheld the arguments and also noted that the insurance company is duty-bound to reimburse the full amount to the claimant as per the contract of insurance. “If at all the insurance company feels that the hospital has charged an exorbitant amount as against the package charges fixed by the VMC then the insurance company should initiate appropriate legal proceedings against the hospital and should approach the authorities of VMC,” the court noted. The court directed the insurance company to pay the remaining amount to the couple with 9% interest and a compensation of Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/reimburse-entire-covid-bill-court-orders-insurer/articleshow/87690267.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The victim lodged a complaint with the Kondhwa police on Friday. Police inspector Gokul Raut of Kondhwa police station told TOI that on October 13, the man received a text message stating that the bank application had been blocked as he had not updated his PAN card details. “There was also a link in the text message asking the receiver to update his PAN details online using a form which will pop-up once he clicks the link,” said Raut. “The man clicked on the link and a form opened on his cell phone. He filled in his bank account details and pressed submit. Within a few minutes, he received a call from a man who claimed to be a representative of the bank. He asked the victim if he had received a text message with a four-digit OTP. The victim then told the fraudster the OTP following which the suspects siphoned off the money from his account,” said Raut. “Police are trying to establish the money trail. Details of the account to which the money was transferred has been sought from the bank,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudster-siphons-off-rs-5-lakh-from-businessmans-account/articleshow/87690892.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Three-fold rise in digital eye strain in kids, say studies||HYDERABAD: With children and teenagers spending more time on the computer or mobile phone, thanks to online classes in view of Covid-19 pandemic, city eye specialists have reported increase in the number of cases related to digital eye strain (DES). Compared with the pre-pandemic period, the DES cases have increased by about three-fold among students. This is because they are spending about six hours a day on an average before the screen as against two to three hours a day in the pre-Covid-19 era. Various research studies, including those in Hyderabad in the last 20 months, reveal that DES has become a common eye problem in the city. The common ophthalmological problem encountered by children and adults due to DES is itching in the eyes. Other DES problems are double vision, headache, dry eye and seeing halos around things. One such study published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology reveals that the most common digital device used during the pandemic was smartphone. Computers and laptops come the next. About 60% of subjects studied as part of the research had said they use smartphones. And about 50% of the users had complained of DES. The research study suggested that “parents should be considerate about duration, type and distance of digital device use by their children to avoid DES”. Dr Narahari Y, consultant eye surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, said digital eye strain has emerged as the most common problem. “Constant staring at screen for long time, more so for children, does cause lot of ill effects on the eyes,” he said. Stating that for a normal individual, blinking rate is 10 to 12 times a minute, he said when one uses computer or mobile phones, the blinking rate drops to five or six times a minute. “This is the main reason for the DES. To overcome this is, try blinking frequently. The rule is to look at any object at 20 feet distance after 20 minutes of screen time for 20 seconds,” Narhari suggested. Dr Suresh Kumar Panuganti, expert in paediatric critical care and paediatrics, said one in four children who spend more than three hours before digital devices complain of DES or computer vision syndrome. He advises that one should use screens in proper lighting and change the resolution and increase the font size.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-fold-rise-in-digital-eye-strain-in-kids-studies/articleshow/87690899.cms||Syed Akbar

The increasing number of jellyfish at the beach is posing threat to tourism as people hesitate to venture into the sea for joy rides on water bikes, kayaks or scuba diving. Scuba divers found the presence of jellyfish at the beach while they were giving training to students. Jellyfish stings are usually harmless to humans but cause irritation and in a few cases, sting from a toxic jellyfish could require medical care. “ Here, most of them are yellow jellyfish. Exactly two years ago, Goa beaches were invaded by jellyfish swarms and around 90 people were stung at various beaches in 48 hours,” a scuba diver, Balarama Naidu, told TOI. He said jellyfish stings can cause a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Around 150 million people are stung by them each year across globe. He said scuba divers have found yellow jellyfish swarms in recent times. Yellow jellyfish are less dangerous than Australian box jellyfish. Their increasing numbers have been attributed to sea warming and increased pollution. Jellyfish bloom was reported off the coast of Visakhapatnam for first time in 2018. Around three to five thousand people visit Rushikonda beach every day on an average and it would be more than 10,000 on weekends or tourist season. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Mumbai beaches spot jellyfish bloom post-monsoon. However, there are jellyfish invasions throughout the year. “The rise in numbers of jellyfish indicates reduction in fish population. Jellyfish swarms also damage fishing nets. Jellyfish population is at its peak between September to January meaning monsoon season to non-monsoon season,” a researcher, P Srinivasa Rao, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/watch-out-for-jellyfish-killjoys-at-rushikonda-beach-next-time/articleshow/87690247.cms||Siva G
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Promotion of 18 engineering college principals reversed||Thiruvananthapuram: Left with no other choice to circumvent a high court order that directed the state government to follow the AICTE norms strictly for promotion of principals in government engineering colleges, the higher education department has reversed the promotion of 18 engineering college principals with retrospective effect from 2009. Through an order dated November 11, 2021, the higher education department has also promoted with retrospective effect 43 engineering faculties as engineering college principals. However, almost all the faculties who have been given back their due promotion have already retired from the service. But they would be eligible to claim the monitory benefits with retrospective effect. Those who have been demoted from service include Kerala Technological University vice-chancellor Dr M S Rajashree and Dr Byjubai T P, in-charge of director of technical education. Under the pressure from Left teachers’ union, the state government had been flouting AICTE norms in promotions. Instead of the competitive norms of AICTE, the Left union used to bat for seniority-based promotion. Though selection of eligible candidates through a selection process, including interview, is what AICTE recommends for the promotion to principal post, the Left unions never let the government follow the norms. When the UDF government adopted the AICTE norms and conducted the selection process, the Left union leaders boycotted the same. Further, when the LDF government came back to power in 2016, those who were promoted via the selection process was demoted and the seniority wise promotion was brought back. However, the high court struck down the seniority wise promotion in 2019. As the Supreme Court too refused to quash the HC order, the government was left with no other choice but to implement the order in letter and spirit. Following the retrospective promotion and demotion, several engineering college principals will have to pay back the excess salary they had received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/promotion-of-18-engineering-college-principals-reversed/articleshow/87690901.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘New vax manufacturing capacities could be of little use’||HYDERABAD: With the past one and a half years seeing the creation of massive manufacturing capacities in India to churn out millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines, what happens once the pandemic is over? Some feel that these new capacities created to fight the dreaded SARS-CoV-2 virus could help the world be better prepared to tackle any future pandemics, especially when it comes to mRNA vaccine technology where players like Biological E and Bharat Biotech are injecting investments. “Our mRNA (investment) is in early stages but the technology platform can be utilised not just for Covid-19 but also for other infectious diseases and immunotherapeutics in the future,” said Mahima Datla, managing director, Biological E Ltd. However, there are others who feel that much of new capacities could end up being a dud investment, especially for the pharma players that jumped into vaccine bandwagon to cash in on the Covid-19 rush. Here, vaccine industry experts pointed to the integrated vaccine complex set up by state-run HLL Biotech Ltd (HBL) at Chengalpattu on Chennai’s outskirts nearly nine years ago that has not produced a single vaccine and has been lying idle even through the Covid-19 pandemic when capacity shortages were hampering the government’s vaccination drive. “Those who got into the vaccine business from the Covid point of view will find it difficult to sustain as they don’t have any other vaccine,” said Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella. “We will also have excess capacities (Covid-19) everywhere but we are not relying on Covid vaccines (for revenue). We have children’s vaccines for sustainable revenues. So whatever (revenues) comes with Covid is just a bonus,” Ella added. Agreeing, Indian Immunologicals Ltd managing director Dr K Anand Kumar pointed out that while existing vaccine manufacturers will find some way to use excess capacities either through expansion or for new vaccines in their pipeline, but for the new players it may turn out to be a waste as vaccine manufacturing is not their core competency. The top honcho of another vaccine company pointed out that many of the new entrants, who have bought a lot of raw material like filters, media for growing virus and other plastic consummables, may have to end up selling them to existing vaccine manufacturers as they don’t have any vaccine pipeline. However, Ella felt that overcapacity would be unsustainable and could even be dangerous. “This problem (Covid) whenever it is gone all these capacities are going to be idle. There is no way of replacing it with another product and that could be downright dangerous.” He cited the example of China where excess capacities in the 1990s in government-run vaccine facilities in various provinces proved to be unsustainable and led to their merger into China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPGC) or Sinopharm as it is more commonly referred to today. Bulk Drugs Manufacturers’ Association (BDMA) national president (emeritus) M Narayan Reddy said it was too early yet to say how long the capacities created for Covid-19 would be utilised as there was no clarity on whether it would require an annual booster or not. Reddy’s company Virchow Biotech is one of the manufacturers of Russian vaccine Sputnik V in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-vax-mfg-capacities-could-be-of-little-use/articleshow/87690905.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

One of the minister who met Nadda is Mahender Singh Thakur, in charge of Mandi parliamentary seat, but the BJP failed to put an impressive show and lost the seat to the Congress candidate. The other minister who met Nadda was Ram Lal Markanda. It is assumed the both ministers apprised Nadda about the reasons that had led to the debacle of party in Mandi parliamentary seat.In the 2019 parliamentary election, BJP had won Mandi seat by a margin of 4,05,459 votes, but in the recently held by-election the BJP lost this seat by a margin of 7,490 votes. The party had appointed jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur as in charge for the by-election of Mandi parliamentary seat and education minister Govind Singh Thakur was appointed as the co-incharge while Sundernagar MLA Rakesh Jamwal was the coordinator. While the BJP was confident of winning this seat for consecutive third time, party failed to perform impressively in tribal areas, including Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur district beside Kullu, especially in Manali assembly area represented by Govind Singh Thakur himself.The ruling BJP’s dream of victory in Mandi parliamentary seat was shattered in nine out of 17 assembly constituencies as in nine assembly constituencies Congress took the lead while BJP could take lead in eight assembly constituencies only. The BJP high command has called a report from the state leadership on the reasons for the defeat in the by-election. The BJP high command has already held a meeting in Delhi before summoning the report. Apart from the state leadership, separate reports have been sought from the in-charges, office bearers, district and divisional presidents of parliamentary constituencies as well as party candidates who entered the election season in the by-elections. After receiving the report, the BJP high command will brainstorm on the reasons for the defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/poor-show-in-byelections-2-hp-ministers-meet-nadda/articleshow/87691338.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and private water operator — Orange City Water Private Ltd (OCW) have discontinued the supply citing that the connections are illegal. Congress corporator Sneha Nikose, BSP corporator Mamta Sahare and some residents staged ‘Jal tyaag’ agitation in front of the office of OCW from 9.30am for three hours and later in front of the office of guardian minister Nitin Raut at 5pm. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) members lodged a complaint against the private operator with Jaripatka police station on Saturday. According to Nikose, the 2,000 houses in “the three oldest localities in the city” were drawing water without meters for the last many years from an old pipeline. “OCW laid new pipeline and gave connections to houses having water meters and disconnected supply to old pipeline. Thus, around 2,000 houses stopped getting water,” said Nikose. The corporator claimed that the 2,000 houses were ready to complete formalities and take water connection from the new pipeline. “OCW demanded Rs6,000 for new connection, which is a big amount for these people. Discussions were underway with NMC to give instalment facility but OCW disconnected supply without any intimation,” she said. Nikose also said that Raut has directed NMC officials to restore water supply within 24 hours. “His staff contacted the minister who was not in the city and informed him about the issue. Raut also said that new connections will be given from new pipeline before November 30 and payment of Rs6,000 can be done in three equal instalments,” she said. Nikose, Sahare and others ended their agitation by having water after Raut’s directives to NMC officials. NMC superintending engineer Manoj Talewar did not respond to TOI calls and messages while OCW chose not to comment on the matter. AAP members in their police complaint alleged that OCW discontinued water supply from old pipeline without any intimation to the people, leaving large number of families without drinking water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/supply-cut-4-days-ago-no-water-to-2000-houses-in-3-areas/articleshow/87690906.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Senior inspector Ashok Kadam of the Cantonment police said, “Gaikwad runs a placement agency in the Camp area and refers job aspirants to Gosavi. Three job aspirants, who had lodged a complaint with the police, claimed that Gosavi and Gaikwad duped them of Rs4 lakh in 2020 by promising them employment in the hospitality industry in Malaysia. Gaikwad had gone to Dubai and we arrested her as soon as she came back.” The Cantonment police on Thursday took custody of Gosavi in the cheating case. He was arrested on October 29 from a lodge in Katraj in the job fraud case registered with the Faraskhana police. Kadam said, “The duped job aspirants were unemployed and approached Gaikwad seeking placement in the hospitality sector. She charged money and referred them to Gosavi. The trio visited Mumbai and Gosavi processed their documents in February-March 2020. Gaikwad and Gosavi failed to provide jobs to the trio, though. When they demanded their money back, Gosavi issued threats to them.” The Pune police have registered three cases against Gosavi with the Faraskhana, Cantonment and Wanowrie police stations. The first case of cheating was registered against him in Faraskhana in 2018 and had been evading arrest since then. The police swung into action after a selfie of Gosavi with actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan during the cruise drug bust went viral. He was arrested on October 29 and is still in judicial custody||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-more-held-in-cheating-case-involving-ncb-witness-gosavi/articleshow/87690902.cms||---

The CM has deputed home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali and senior officers including chief secretary Somesh Kumar and special chief secretary K Rama Krishna Rao to the meeting. The 29th SZC meeting will be chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah and attended by chief ministers, ministers and officials from southern states — AP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Union territories, apart from Telangana. KCR was supposed to attend the meeting to be held in the neighbouring state. But due to the friction with the Centre over various issues including the recent fight over paddy procurement, the chief minister has decided to depute his minister and other officials, sources said. “KCR feels that even if he participates in the meeting it would be of little use as many decisions taken in earlier meetings have not been implemented,” a senior TRS leader said. This is not the first time that KCR has skipped meetings involving the Centre. Earlier, he skipped Niti Aayog meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February this year. Official sources said the Telangana government has firmed up an agenda with 26 items for the council meeting. “The major issue that has been listed in the agenda is irrigation projects such as Palamuru-Ranga Reddy and Nakkalagandi project on Krishna river. While AP and Karnataka have complained that Telangana has not submitted a detailed project report (DPR), the state government may raise an objection saying this issue needs to be raised at the KRMB and Apex council meeting and not in SZC meet,” a senior official said. During the council meeting, Karnataka is likely to raise objection to Sangambanda project, which was taken up by the Telangana government with 3.3 tmc ft capacity as many of its villages were submerged due to this project. But the Telangana government claims it was constructed after sharing DPR with Karnataka. “The AP government is claiming Rs 3,000 crore power dues from the Telangana which is completely unacceptable and we are going to raise the issue. Apart from this, long pending distribution of assets and liabilities of schedule IX and X institutions and funds for Kovvur-Bhadrachalam railway line issue will be discussed,” an official, who is going to take part in the meeting said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-paddy-war-with-centre-kcr-to-skip-szc-meet-today/articleshow/87691343.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Nagpur||Treatment plant not must for hosps if wastewater is flowing into STP: CPCB||Nagpur: In an RTI reply, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has said that health care facilities are required to install effluent treatment plant (ETP) if waste water generated by them is not connected with city’s public sewerage network leading to terminal sewage treatment plant (STP). Amid ambiguity over norms, the CPCB also stated that in case the waste effluent is connected with public sewer which leads to terminal STP, the healthcare facility does not require to install separate/individual ETP. Doctor-cum-lawyer Dr Pradeep Arora had filed the RTI application as the MPCB’s regional office insisted that the hospitals are required to install STP/ETP as per Biomedical Waster Management Rules, 2017 and its amendments.The MPCB has withheld its consent stalling license renewal of several private hospitals on the premise that they lacked ETP or STP.MPCB sub-regional officer Anand Katole said gazetted notification issued by ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) mandates STP at hospitals.“As per the notification, OPD and IPD waste has to be treated by disinfectant before releasing in sewage line. Without STP, it is not possible to comply with environmental norms,” he said.Katole said serial number 8 (clause 3) clearly states, “STP is also mandatory for hospitals below 10 beds by the year 2019. Hospitals want to directly discharge their waste in city’s sewage line. Already, the city’s doesn’t have proper sewage treatment facilities. Sewage water is randomly lifted and not all of it is getting treated. The notification is clear,” he said. The MPCB officer said bigger hospitals have set up STP while only smaller ones having 25 to 50 beds are opposed to it. “Those running in a single building don’t have enough space. We have been appealing to them to install STPs. They face problems during license renewal,” Katole said.Dr Arora explained the interpretation of the two clauses of Rule 8 in the MoEFCC notification which has led to misunderstanding and was now settled with reply of RTI’s filed by him.What Dr Arora says and what the clause say The Clause 1 states, “Above limits are applicable to the occupiers of health care facilities (bedded) which are either connected with sewerage network without terminal sewage treatment plant or not connected to public sewers”.Dr Arora explained that Clause 1 exempts any hospital from setting up its own STP if the public sewerage system is connected to a common STP. Like in case of Nagpur the common STP at the terminal end of Public sewerage of huge capacity is at Bhandewadi. So the hospitals located within jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation Nagpur are exempt from installing own STP or ETP.The Clause 1, therefore, gives the same inference as the reply of CPCB to RTI request filed by Dr Arora.Clause 3 , states, “The health care facilities having less than 10 beds shall have to install STP by December 31, 2019”,  Dr Arora said that it doesn’t make any sense because it leaves out bigger hospitals. “What about hospitals with 10 or more than 10 beds,” he asked. Dr Arora added, “Absurdity of this clause is much too clear, which is why I filed an RTI and now the reply of CPCB which is same as Clause 1 is absolutely binding on MPCB.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/treatment-plant-not-must-for-hosps-if-wastewater-is-flowing-into-stp-cpcb/articleshow/87690296.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The police said that the two accused were part of a gang that used to procure expired cement from Delhi and Haryana and then mix it with good cement at the factory in Patel Nagar to earn more profit. Police are now procuring records of people who have been supplied the inferior quality cement to prevent any accidents. SSP/DIG Dehradun, Janmaijai Khanduri, had constituted a team to raid the factory where the inferior quality cement was found. After the arrest, the accused -- identified as Nadeem and Mohammad Rashid -- told police that they used to procure cement for Rs 250 and then sell it for Rs 450 per bag (comprising 20-25 kg cement) after adulteration.

---||Dehradun||Kumbh test scam: Haridwar Police prepares to summon technicians of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories, another lab accused of being involved in the scam||Haridwar: Based on fresh findings in the Kumbh Covid-19 test scam, Haridwar Police will now interrogate technicians of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories, whose role is also being probed in the fake Covid tests. According to the special investigation team (SIT) handling the case, a clean chit has not been given to the owner of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories either. Investigation officer Rajendra Singh Kathait told TOI, “As far as the role of Dr Lalchandani Laboratories is concerned, we have not given a clean chit to its owner. Based on some crucial fresh findings, we will soon summon the lab technician of the Dr Lalchandani Laboratories for questioning. Action will be taken accordingly.” Notably, Mallika and Sharat Pant, owners of Max Corporate Services and the main accused in the scam, were arrested from Noida earlier this week. Max Corporate Services, tasked by Uttarakhand government to conduct Covid-19 tests during Kumbh, had roped in two other labs — Dr Lalchandani Laboratories and Nalwa Laboratories. After it was found that more than 1 lakh fake Covid-19 tests had been conducted in Haridwar during Kumbh, all three establishments were booked. However, while the police secured a non-bailable warrant for Mallika and Sharat Pant and Dr Navtej Nalwa (of Nalwa Laboratories), no such action was taken against Dr Lalchandani Laboratories, which had produced a little more than 10,000 test reports before the health officials during the Kumbh Mela. Meanwhile, police are also trying to catch Dr Navtej Nalwa, who is at large. In fact, two teams have already been sent to Hisar (Haryana) to nab him. The Hisar-based firm conducted more than one lakh fake tests during Hardiwar Kumbh, according to official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-test-scam-haridwar-police-prepares-to-summon-technicians-of-dr-lalchandani-laboratories-another-lab-accused-of-being-involved-in-the-scam/articleshow/87690297.cms||MS Nawaz

Following this, the professors’ association has called a meeting on November 16 to discuss ways to address the issues and retain the image of the university.Meanwhile, vice-chancellor S C Ramesh has written a letter to the syndicate, seeking formation of a fact-finding committee to look into the allegations made against him. He has termed the developments as a conspiracy to bring a bad name to him.Dr M Mallikarjunagouda, head of the department of Kannada literature studies, told TOI that the VC is demanding a bribe of Rs 6 lakh for promotion of teachers under Career Advancement Scheme. “He is deferring promotions of those who refuse to bribe him. He has also promoted those who have paid. After I asked him to share the guidelines for promotion, he transferred me to International Vachana Literature Study Centre in Kudalasangama. My tenure as the HoD here was to end on June 26, 2022,” he said, adding that he has complained the same to the higher education department in Bengaluru.Thirty-seven students have charged the university's administration with transferring many professors to units located outside the university and changing the responsibilities of some professors for no reason. “We are forced to pay commission/ bribe of up to Rs 50,000 to get scholarship, colloquium and other facilities. Our signature campaign is to counter the same,” they said.Requesting anonymity, some professors said they are being pressurised to pay their salary of eight months to declare their probationary period “successful”.M Chandra Poojary, a retired professor, said: “The university authorities say that some percentage of commission should be paid to get our benefits. So we (nine retired professors) have written letters to the varsity, higher education department and the governor...”Meanwhile, Kannada Vishwavidyalayada Adhyapakara Sangha will convene a meeting of teaching and non-teaching staff on November 16. They want to discuss ways to resolve the issues and maintain the university’s image. Sangha officebearers said they will launch an agitation if the administration fails to address their concerns.VC rejects chargesTerming the allegations as baseless, VC Ramesh said there is a conspiracy to assassinate his character. “For promotions, we have followed UGC norms. A committee checking UGC criteria will oversee this issue, and I have never interfered in its affairs. As far as pension is concerned, the varsity is running short of funds. The government has released Rs 12.5 lakh as against the sanctioned Rs 50 lakh. We have written to the government about our funds requirement to meet other overheads, and awaiting its response.”The VC said 10-15 professors have retired in the last 1-2 years, leaving them amidst financial constraints. “Following allegations against me, I have written a letter to the syndicate members seeking formation of a fact-finding committee to probe the charges. I have asked them to prosecute those who erred.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/profs-students-decry-maladministration-at-kannada-varsity/articleshow/87690307.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Pune||Maharashtra: GR soon on non-agricultural land conversion, says Balasaheb Thorat||PUNE: The state revenue department will soon issue an order to simplify the process of converting agricultural land to non-agricultural land soon, said state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Saturday. Thorat was addressing a press meet on the conclusion of a two-day revenue conference in the city that discussed innovative techniques adopted by the revenue machinery for citizens’ benefit. Thorat told TOI that the new guidelines would be issued in a couple of weeks. The conversion of land has become an important issue against the backdrop of increasing urban population and expansion of cities and towns. “The main aim is to eliminate complexities in the conversion,” he said. Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game made a presentation on this issue at the conference. Nashik has already granted powers to tehsildars to allow land parcels that have already been marked as residential areas in the development plan. The tehsildars need only issue a notice to these landowners, ask them to pay a challan and issue the non-agriculture permits, Game said. Thorat said the government will also issue a GR to simplify the sand auction process in a fortnight. The use of GPS-based rover machines for land measurement is an option under consideration, he said. The state would require enough machines to ensure comprehensive land measurement. “These machines can be used in a pilot project in city areas and then implemented in rural areas, Thorat said. The minister further said the state department of registration has exceeded its revenue target, driven by the sops announced last year in the form of stamp duty waiver. He said Rs3,200 crore was collected as revenue in October — the highest ever for a month — and clarified that the government had no plans to give any more sops. Thorat said the increased revenue collection was a sign that the state economy was gradually returning to normalcy. He said the high revenue collection in October was despite no benefits being offered by the state. Further, Thorat said the registration department’s initiative on e-registrations has gained momentum. He expressed confidence that the initiative would garner good response from RERA-registered developers, as it would allow them to register properties from their offices and to reduce footfalls in the sub-registrar offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gr-soon-on-non-agri-land-conversion-thorat/articleshow/87690907.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The civic body has taken up the project as part of the Vizag smart city project. The ABD area, chosen under the smart city project, comprises wards 19, 21, 27 and 29. The major components of the project include 24x7 water supply in the ABD area, reducing the extent of non-revenue water and fixing high precise, tamper-proof water meters. A new ground-level service reservoir is being constructed near the Commissioner’s Bungalow to pave the way for the 24x7 water supply. About one lakh people live in the ABD area. As part of the project, 26 quality sensors will be installed to monitor the water quality. The project would also fix bulk flow meters at the reservoir that supplies water to the ABD area. The distribution network of pipelines, spanning 58 kilometres in the ABD area, will also get a major revamp. According to GVMC officials, the project has achieved about 70% progress. “The project will be completed in the next four to five months. A private agency has bagged the tenders for Rs 71 crore. The trial run was completed in several parts of the project area. Needed interventions to control leakages/losses are being taken up to accomplish desired performance parameters of the project,” said a GVMC official. On the other hand, as part of the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), the Asian Development Bank is funding a 24x7 water supply project in the northwest area of Vizag city with about Rs 350 crore. Currently, about four lakh people live in the northwest area of the city which has a water demand of 67 MLD each day, which is expected to go up to 94 MLD by 2029. The civic body has taken up the project as part of Vizag smart city project.

---||Nagpur||‘Excessive use of mobile phones is impacting kids’ dialectic memory”||Excessive use of mobile phones by school-going kids has been an issue for the last couple of years, but the pandemic-induced lockdown and isolation has brought it to the forefront of mental health and studies pertaining to behavioural sciences. Well-known psychiatrist Dr Shailesh Pangaonkar talks to TOI about how excessive and inappropriate use of mobile phones by children is shaping their personalities because of the impact on the brain.Excerpts... Q. Many kids and adolescents, who are great communicators on their family Whatsapp groups, are unable to mirror that ability when meeting the same people in person.A. It’s a phenomenon which we see regularly. Someone who can write fantastic novels or make excellent video content is unable to express himself/herself properly when communicating in person. That is because these are two different skills. From childhood we see physical and mental development and there are various aspects to the latter. So social, cognitive and academic are all part of that and how all these come together affects a person’s communication skills. Usually when we are daydreaming, there is no limit to what we can imagine. We can dream of being the President to a famous cricketer because our identity is not a challenge during daydreaming. Similarly, when we are communicating in digital mode, the person is behind the screen which leads to less stress. So speaking or operating in a comfort zone, which in this case is the digital screen, helps these youngsters communicate better. Q. But does this comfort zone apply even when in midst of relatives and friends. After lockdown, when most families got together, they noticed that their kids were unable to have a long conversation with other relatives.A. Specifically with regards to lockdown and how it has impacted behaviour among youngsters, we need to look at it differently. Those kids who have been spending eight to nine hours on the mobile phone may have slowly become conditioned to being alone. This lockdown-enforced isolation and enjoyment of games etc in the mobile phone has led the young mind to believe that this is a safe environment, this is a comfort zone. But when speaking before a group of people that comfort zone is gone and feeling of one’s identity being challenged can make people nervous. Q. Did the lockdown-induced isolation make matters worse for youngsters?A. There’s no practice happening for the brain during social interactions. Ultimately, we always train our brain on what to say and to whom. It is this training, over a period of time, which informs the brain about how much information we can share with whom and similarly, learning what not to say to whom. The lockdown has impacted different age groups differently, because the development phase is connected to one’s age. For those who are around 11 years, it’s important to make a differentiation between themselves and the outside world. This usually happens in a natural way, when the child keeps interacting with people outside the home, like in school or a sports camp. But due to the lockdown-enforced isolation, this part has got hampered. And if no training is happening for the brain regarding emotional and social behaviour, then that ability recedes very fast. Kids who are spending hours on end watching mobile phones face difficulty in expressing themselves to parents. That environment of isolated mobile indulgence provides a false perception of security to the child. S/he starts believing that I’m safe and secure in this environment, and it’s scary to now move into a group of people and interact. Q. Has the ability of kids to form relationships taken a hit?A. Relationship is an integration of all senses. Visual, spoken communication, being clear in expressing thoughts etc are the key parameters. Our brain has a dialectic memory which is very dynamic. It’s different from the temporal and procedural memory which are often discussed, related to learning driving skills and remembering it or remembering names of your relatives etc. The best example of dialectic memory is knowing how to behave in different situations. While talking to a one-year-old baby, we too speak like a toddler but immediately shift to an adult tone when speaking with the parent. So these things like how loudly to speak in which place, what words not to use in front of people are also dependent on this dialectic memory. But this memory needs constant practice, unlike its other counterparts. You have to keep updating it regularly. Q. Dialectic memory training is definitely not happening for many kids right now.A. The process of conditioning that memory in kids may have changed during this lockdown and hence, that discomfort in communicating in a physical space with other people. That ability to integrate all senses needed for relationship building has now congregated in the small screen of a mobile phone. The earlier physical canvas or platform where relationships were being formed has now changed to mobile phones. Q. Is this a permanent loss or a negative impact on dialectic memory?A. It’s a difficult question to answer because the impact is connected to the age group we are addressing. Kids between ages 6-9 will take more time, but they will definitely recover. However, there will be some things that will always remain and hamper the next level of growth. Q. As mobile phones are here to stay, we can’t keep kids away permanently.A. Yes, so now the focus should be on judicious use. I prefer that kids read some text on the mobile like these e-books etc. Fast moving graphics and videos on mobile games are dangerous because of the impact they have on our kids’ brain. Also, parents must involve kids in using mobile phones for some practical purpose, like let’s say you want to book tickets for a movie or a plane, get the kids to search for it under your supervision. These youngsters are very smart in the use of technology, much better than parents. Also, keep their brains busy by always having a no-phone hour wherein the whole family gets together. Even if your kid is not going to school due to the lockdown, make sure that the schedule is not disturbed. A fixed time should be there for getting up, breakfast, bathing etc. And most importantly, parents must lead by example. You cannot be holding a phone in your hand and tell your child to stay away from it. The biggest challenge and top priority is to wean away kids from excessive and inappropriate use of the mobile phone. Just like in de-addiction centres we take away the object of addiction, a similar process will have to be followed. Focus on physical activity with a lot of aggression. Q. But decades ago we used to spend hours reading comics and parents would disapprove the practice. Are we over reacting?A. No, the dangers of screen time are well documented and researched. Loss of concentration and impatience has increased a great deal because of mobile screens. The games you play on mobiles result in immediate satisfaction, as in you press a button and something happens according to what you want. Slowly your brain is getting tuned to receive this instant ‘gift’ and in our brain two vital things are getting impacted. First is ‘postponing of immediate gratification’ and ‘frustration tolerance’. These two things are being destroyed in kids who indulge in hours of gameplay on mobile phones, which will never happen if you are reading a comic or a novel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/excessive-use-of-mobile-phones-is-impacting-kids-dialectic-memory/articleshow/87690941.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

On the occasion of Children's Day, the KSRTC issued a circular instructing conductors to consider the proof of age of children rather than their height when issuing half-tickets or allowing them to travel for free.The previous circular, dated October 30, 2004, instructed conductors to collect full fare if the child is at least 140 cm tall and half fare if the child is at least 117 cm tall. Children, both boys and girls, with a height of 117 cms or more were considered to have completed 6 years, while those with a height of 140 cms or more were considered to have completed 12 years. Following the circular, officials had marked a gauge inside the buses to measure the height of children if there was any doubt about their age. In a recently issued circular, the chief traffic manager (operations), KSRTC, Bengaluru, has clarified that conductors do not need to check children's height if they have proof of age. There is no need to use another criterion once the age has been confirmed.The same circular has been issued by KKRTC, while NWKRTC is still considering it. “We are deliberating on it and will issue a statement within 2-3 days,” said Rajesh Huddar, CTM (operations), NWKRTC, Hubballi.Welcoming the circular, Ravi Bhandari, coordinator, District Child Helpline, said that some children had complained about the issue. “It was unscientific to measure the height. Demanding a document to determine one's age is acceptable. In the absence of age-proof, benefit of the doubt should be given depending on the case,” said Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee, Bengaluru Urban District.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/height-no-more-a-criterion-for-kids-to-avail-half-ticket/articleshow/87690310.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Madurai||Heavy showers submerge Kanyakumari||Kanyakumari: Kanyakumari district faced a grim flood situation on Saturday as heavy rain for three days led to widespread inundation in all the six taluks with many areas getting marooned. One person is feared to have been washed away at Mullaiyaru while state disaster response force and police rescued 2,267 people from 755 families and relocated them to 48 rescue centres. Thovalai, Agastheeswaram and Killiyoor taluks bore the brunt. Vehicles stuck in water, stranded people being rescued on boats and youths playing in neckdeep water stagnated in their residential areas were the scene in the district. Draining of water from low-lying areas, agricultural lands and residential areas posed a challenge to the authorities as heavy downpour continued across the district during the day. “More than 40,000 cusecs of water flowed through Thamiraparani river at Kuzhithurai on Saturday evening against the river’s capacity of 20,000 cusecs,” an official said. The district recorded an average rainfall of 100.48 mm in 24 hours till 8 am on Saturday. Holiday was declared for schools and colleges in the district for the second day. Videos of water flowing like a river through the ramps and stairs of a private hospital near Thirupathi Saram (Thiraviyam Hospital) and water covering the entire ground floor of houses behind the hospital in Therkalputhoor were among those which went viral on social media. In all, 65 huts were damaged, seven fully and 58 partly.  The heavy downpour that began on Thursday went on till Friday when the district recorded an average 77.2 mm rainfall. Though there was no rain during the day on Friday, heavy rain lashed the district from evening throughout the night. Kolipurvilai (205 mm) recorded the highest rainfall, followed by Aanaikidangu (187.4 mm).Though there was not much flooding in the rivers initially, the continuing downpour led to breaching of tanks and channels. Fire and rescue services along with SDRF carried out rescue. The maximum relocation of people (379) was from 10 low-lying places in Thovalai taluk, while 304 were relocated from five places in Agastheeswaram, 66 from Kalkulam and 35 from Killiyoor. Tangedco said 34 transformers were turned off in low-lying areas due to inundation. This disrupted power supply to 2,367 connections. District collector M Arvind and IT minister T Mano Thangaraj visited the affected areas and discussed restoration and rehabilitation measures.“There is water everywhere in all the six taluks. There is no difference between tanks and fields,” a senior disaster mitigation official said. Officials said that they are yet to take stock of the damages caused to properties and for farmers as focus is to ensure that people of low-lying areas are rescued to safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/heavy-showers-submerge-kanyakumari/articleshow/87690917.cms||---

Shah was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan, organised by the Rajbhasha department of the home ministry at the Trade Facilitation Centre, Bada Lalpur. Citing the example of Savarkar, Shah said, “Agar Veer Savarkar Ji na hote to shayad hum Angrezi shabdon ka hi prayog kar rahe hote (had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only),” said Shah, adding that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary, and introduced many new words. The time has come to make Hindi flexible for the wide acceptance of people,” Shah added. Shah said that the country which loses its ‘swabhasha’ (native language), also loses its original thinking and culture. The original thinking can only come from native or the mother tongue, he added. Shah said that Gandhiji converted the freedom movement into a people’s movement with three pillars: Swaraj, Swadeshi and Swabhasha. “Swaraj was achieved, but Swadeshi and Swabhasha were left behind,” he said, adding that the government has set a target to establish the glory of Swabhasha and Swadeshi in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ (next 25-years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav) when the country will celebrate its 100th Independence Day. Shah said that the Central government has given special emphasis to Rajbhasha under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “One of the main points of the new education policy is the promotion of native languages. The new change that the Prime Minister has made will change the future of India,” he said, adding, “For the first time since independence, the convention of Rajbhasha has been taken out of Delhi and organised in Kashi, which immensely contributed for the enrichment of Hindi.” “I am a Gujarati and speak in my native language, but I love Hindi more than Gujarati. We need to strengthen our Rajbhasha,” said Shah, adding, “There is no conflict between Hindi (Rajbhasha) and local languages, rather they are complementary to each other.” Rajbhasha can prosper only when the local languages are protected. It is the responsibility of the Rajbhasha department to promote and protect the local languages, he added. Shah also made an appeal to all guardians to talk to their children in their own native language. “It does not matter in which medium they are studying, talk to them in native language in your home in order to increase their confidence levels, so that they have no hesitation in speaking their own mother tongue,” Shah said adding that speaking in native language would not only benefit the language, but also benefit the children because original thinking could only result from native language. “Attempts were made in the past to spark controversies on Hindi language, but now it is over,” said Shah, adding, “There used to be a time when we were afraid, but a new era has started when we would be proud. This transformation of fear to feel pride and honour has been a huge achievement of Narendra Modi’s administration.” “We have set a goal to promote Rajbhasha and local languages in the fields of education, administration, judicial work, technical work, communication and entertainment,” he said and made an appeal to all to create a conducive atmosphere in the country for this purpose. The event was also addressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-rajbhasha-meet-shahinvokes-veer-savarkar/articleshow/87690315.cms||---

---||Delhi||Worried parents relieved over school closure||New Delhi: There’s poison in the city air. So, while schools resumed classes only recently, there was relief for parents when Delhi government announced on Saturday the closure of schools for a week. While attending classes in person was important for their children, the parents also felt that the deteriorating air was something they could not ignore. Arijit Basu, father of an eight-year-old who studies in a private school, said, “It had only been a day since my daughter’s attended school in person and we got the news of schools shutting down once again. She has not taken this well. However, it is important to factor in the pollution when thinking of school going. Physical classes should remain suspended if the pollution level deteriorates because it is the children who will end up suffering. In fact, at home due to the pollution, we are even restricting our daughter from going to the park.” In a bid to deal with the toxic air, many schools had gradually curbed outdoor activities for the time being. Sudha Acharya, principal, ITL Public School, Dwarka, reported, “We are ensuring that the students stay indoors when they come for classes. Activities like yoga or stretching have all been discontinued. At times, for activities like aerobics, we form small groups and we have the children performing these in the basement to avoid outdoor exposure. We have also kept N95 masks in the school because they are the best against pollution.” Mount Abu Public School, which was scheduled to reopen from November 15, had already decided not to allow outdoor activities, said principal Jyoti Arora. “Even before the school reopened, we had given appropriate directions to teachers and parents not to allow outdoor activities due to both the pandemic and the pollution,” she said. “We also want to focus on and engage children in discussions around the environment and climate change. It is important for them to ponder on the current air crisis.” Some parents demurred. Mohit Goel, father of two school-going children, argued, “Staying at home and attending online classes have impacted the children adversely in terms of developmental aspects. Pollution is here to stay until drastic steps are taken in the future to bring the levels down. So, after deciding to bring back the kids to school, the pollution should have been the lowest priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/worried-parents-relieved-over-school-closure/articleshow/87691344.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Kochi||Congress workers attack journalists in Kozhikode||Kozhikode: Media persons who tried to cover a meeting of Congress workers held at a hotel at Kallai Road in Kozhikode were verbally abused and assaulted by the latter on Saturday. Though there were reports that the Congress workers became provoked as the meeting was a secret A-group meeting, Kozhikode district Congress committee claimed that the meeting was held with the knowledge of the party. Kozhikode Kasaba police have registered a case against around 20 people in connection with the incident. Mathrubhumi daily’s senior news photographer Sajan V Nambiar sustained injuries to his neck in the attack. Sources said that the Congress workers dragged Nambiar into the meeting hall and manhandled him. When he fell down during the attack, the workers stamped on him. The accused grabbed his mobile phone as well. A portion of the gold chain that the photographer was wearing got broken off in the melee. He later sought treatment at a private hospital. The workers also tried to attack C R Rajesh of Asianet News and Megha Madhavan of Kairali TV when they tried to intervene. Deeptesh Krishna of Manorama News, who came to the spot, was also attacked by the group. The gang dispersed after seeing video cameras. Group activities within the Congress party have been on the back foot ever since the new leadership took charge. The meeting was attended by former DCC president U Rajeev and 25 others. Soon after the incident happened, Kozhikode DCC president K Praveen Kumar rushed to the spot and expressed regrets over the incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/congress-workers-attack-journalists-in-kozhikode/articleshow/87690944.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Open cantonment roads: Telangana minister K T Rama Rao to defence officials||HYDERABAD: A day after holding protests against the Centre over paddy procurement issue, municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao on Saturday gave vent to his anger at the defence ministry over continued closure of roads in Secunderabad cantonment. “The defence department is behaving as if it was running a parallel government in the state. The department is functioning as per its whims and fancies and closing roads in the cantonment area. This is completely unacceptable,” the minister said. KTR has raised the issue at a time when residents have complained that at least 21 roads in the cantonment have been closed for nearly five years now. TOI has been running a sustained campaign to merge Secunderabad Cantonment Board areas with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation so that road closure and other such issues can be resolved. KTR added that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and requested them to help in road widening and allotment of defence land for construction of flyovers. The state government gave tens of representations to the Centre. But the Modi government has not been cooperating with the best performing state, KTR alleged. “Traffic congestion on Patny-to-Shamirpet road and Paradise-to-Kompally route has become common. The roads are completely choked during peak hours,” KTR said. He alleged that defence officials were responsible for submerging of colonies near Shatam Kunta at Lungar Houz during recent heavy rains as the military officials constructed a check dam. Though Telangana is a performing state, the Centre is not giving any additional funds for developmental works. “For instance, Bangalore metro got Rs 17,000 crore for metro rail project. But our state is getting funds only for constitutionally mandated ones,” the TRS working president said. “The BJP government and ministers are giving awards and heaping praises on rural and urban bodies in the state, but not giving any funds. We will take up all these issues with the Union government,” KTR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/open-cantt-roads-ktr-to-def-officials/articleshow/87691361.cms||Koride Mahesh

We have not been able to bounce back ever since the lockdown until a few days before Diwali. This is the first time since the lockdown in March 2020 that people are going out and celebrating a festival, and the wedding season is also bringing in many customers, women as well as men,” said Kanika Solanki, who runs a beauty parlour in Viman Nagar. “I had to cut down on staff strength since we were catering to just about 30% of prepandemic clientele. Since the end of October, the number of clients has doubled, and we had to call back some of our staff members who were working on a freelance basis,” said Nisha Singh, who owns a parlour at Wagholi. Customers are opting for hair treatment, colouring and skin treatment, said parlour owners. “After we reopened in June, clients were most turning up for low-cost services such as threading, waxing, facials. Now, we are seeing a surge in appointments for Keratine treatments, hair straightening and contouring,” said a stylist at a nationwide salon chain. “The metrosexual revolution started a long time ago, but salon trips took a backseat as people wanted to spend their money on essentials Now, that some normalcy is returning, clients are coming and asking for various types of beauty treatments ahead of the wedding season,” said Jitendra Kumar, a salon owner in Kondhwa. “Not just to-be brides and grooms, but their family members and guests are also opting for various types of beauty treatments,” said make-up artist Sonali Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wedding-season-boosts-business-of-salons-and-beauty-parlours/articleshow/87690923.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Varanasi||In Azamgarh, Amit Shah asks people to choose between Akhilesh Yadav’s JAM and Yogi Adityanath’s JAM||AZAMGARH: Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday launched a frontal attack on Akhilesh Yadav in Samajwadi Party (SP) citadel Azamgarh, asking the people to choose between SP chief’s ‘JAM’ and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘JAM’ in the upcoming UP assembly elections. Elaborating the acronym ‘JAM’, Shah said, “Akhilesh has come in the field with JAM that means Jinnah (Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan), Azam Khan (SP leader) and Mukhtar (jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari). While Yogi Ji’s ‘JAM’ means Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar cards and Mobile for everyone to eradicate corruption from its root. Now, people have to decide which JAM they would prefer.” Shah also publicly endorsed Yogi’s leadership and portrayed him as the next chief minister after elections. “I am asking you to give all Vidhan Sabha seats in Azamgarh district to BJP so that Yogi Adityanath can be made the Chief Minister again,” Shah added. Laying the foundation of a university, Shah suggested it be named after Hindu warrior king and Rajbhar icon Suheldev, who fought battles to oust the invaders, in a clear message to woo the Rajbhar community and politically decimate the nascent OP Rajbhar-Samajwadi Party electoral alliance. Accepting Shah’s suggestion, Yogi announced that the university in Azamgarh will be named after Maharaja Suheldev. “On behalf of the state government, I announce that the state university in Azamgarh will be named after great Hindu saviour Maharaja Suheldev,” Yogi said. Shah, who was addressing a charged gathering near Azam Bandh, about 15kms from district headquarters, after laying the foundation of the university, said, “A place which had turned into a hub of extremists and a harbour for terror modules in the past several years, is now going to be converted into a place of Goddess Saraswati. The era of change for Azamgarh, which had converted into ‘adda’ (den) of anti-national activities, has begun.” Targetting Akhilesh, Shah taunted, “With the arrival of elections Akhilesh has started considering Jinnah as great. These are the people who divide the society on the lines of caste and community and believe in fanning riots.” “We expected seats from Azamgarh in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 assembly elections, but failed to get them. It’s enough now. Now, nobody’s account except the BJP should be opened from here. Each seat should go to Modi Ji to make Yogi ji CM again,” said Shah asking the people to go to the field with a pledge to bring BJP back in UP again with 300-plus seats. Shah said today UP is free of both the menace of mafia and mosquitoes. “East UP districts in the vicinity of Gorakhpur suffered from the deadly Japanese encephalitis due to apathy of previous governments towards sanitation. Yogi Ji not only ended the problem caused by mosquitoes by executing all schemes and programmes of the PM promptly, but also forced the mafia to seek shelter outside UP. The state has been rid of mafia elements and Azamgarh is an example. Thousands of acres of land has been freed from the mafia and is now being used for development work.” Telling people how the promises of construction of temple at Ram Janmabhoomi and abrogation of Article 370, which were in agenda since inception of Jan Sangh, were fulfilled, Shah said that 10 universities were opened in BJP regime while number of medical colleges went up from 10 to 40 in the same period. He also highlighted the growth in GDP, improved economy, investments in defence corridor, increased number of airports, activeness of state government in purchase of paddy and other crops and efforts for employment generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-azamgarh-shah-asks-people-to-choosebetween-akhileshs-jam-and-yogis-jam/articleshow/87690329.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The death, falsely certified as “still born”, led to the family’s alleged discovery that neither the accused, Qayamuddin Khan, was registered with Maharashtra Medical Council nor the medical facility, New Lotus Hospital, was running with BMC permission. Refusing to grant bail to Khan, the court held that acts of all accused did not fall within medical negligence as contemplated under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of IPC. While this attracts a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment, the more stringent charge under culpable homicide is punishable with up to 10 years jail. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sessions-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-doctor/articleshow/87692103.cms||---

The 27.64-km-long channel will fill up 35 tanks through its 22.17-km-long sub-channels. “The water release has been done on the request of people of Pappapatti and Keeripatti when the chief minister was there recently,” the minister said and added that efforts are under way to desilt the channel to enable water to reach the tail-end.On Saturday morning, water level in the dam stood at 69.29 feet against the full reservoir capacity of 71 feet. A senior official said water can be released for the scheme only when the level is more than 67 feet. The scheme will primarily benefit Usilampatti area with surplus water from the dam. The dam had an inflow of 1,495 cusecs against the outflow of 1,269 cusecs. Meanwhile, water level in Periyar dam climbed to 139.35 feet against the permitted maximum storage limit of 142 feet. The inflow and outflow were 1,797 cusecs and 556 cusecs respectively. Water level in both the dams is in a very comfortable position compared to last year when Vaigai dam had only 48.62 feet and Periyar dam 122.75 feet of water.District collectors of Madurai, Dindigul and Theni were present when water was released in the channel. Former revenue and disaster management minister R B Udhayakumar of AIADMK said water should be released in the channel till all the 33 tanks are filled up. Welcoming water in the channel with a floral tribute at Usilampatti, the Thirumangalam MLA told reporters that water used to be released in the channel when the level in the dam touched 67 feet during the AIADMK government’s tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigai-water-released-in-58-channel-scheme/articleshow/87690928.cms||---

The one-and-a-half years old animal was hit by a bike while crossing a road in the Otur forest range. Some passers-by contacted the forest department. A team rushed to the spot and brought the animal to the rescue centre. Upon arrival, the forest officers discovered that the hyena was injured and unable to move. A thorough examination by veterinary officer Nikhil Bangar of Wildlife SOS, a non-governmental organisation, revealed that the male hyena had suffered complete hindquarter paralysis and was unable to bear its own body weight. “He was placed under intensive care and treatment. The hyena is now showing signs of improvement,” said an official from the forest department.

It also released data to show it has promoted physical activity by setting up ‘open air gymnasiums’ at 488 public spaces. As the theme of World Diabetes Day is ‘access to care’, an official from BMC’s gardens department said the open-air gyms are part of various medical services to diabetic patients. According to National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-20), about 17.5% of people over age 15 in Mumbai have blood sugar higher than the prescribed level. BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said people should adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent diabetes. “It includes regular and timely proper diet, exercise at regular intervals, adequate sleep including walking, cycling, as per medical advice. At the same time, everyone above 30 should get their diabetes tested at least once a year,’’ he said. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said that while the concept of open gyms is good, once these are set up in civic gardens, they are not properly maintained. “Therefore, they lie unused in gardens. There is no instructor to teach people the right way to use these. BMC can consider keeping a trained instructor across civic wards. The person can also inform the civic body if any equipment has gone bad," said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-lakh-to-be-tested-for-sugar-to-mark-world-diabetes-day/articleshow/87690958.cms||---

Addressing a public meeting following the university’s foundation laid here by Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday, Yogi said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of development and Union home minister Amit Shah’s work has changed the image of Azamgarh. There is no doubt that this university will soon turn Azamgarh into Aryangarh. This university will become operational by the next academic session and students from 400 colleges of Azamgarh and Mau will get degrees from here.” Mentioning that Azamgarh had remained the area of concern for him, Yogi recalled there was a time in Azamgarh when people were killed on demanding reciting Vande Matram. But, can anybody now show the courage of killing anybody in full public view here? “In 2007, one Ajit Rai, an ABVP student leader was killed in front of the principal office of Shibli National College for demanding recital of Vande Mataram on occasions like Republic Day. Time of over a month was taken to register even an FIR in this case,” said Yogi, mentioning how he too was attacked during his visit to Azamgarh. “No one could commit crimes like this here now,” said Yogi highlighting the achievements of his government on the law and order front. “Those, who used to harass girls and women, are well aware that they will be treated like Duryodhan and Duhshashan of Mahabharata for their act,” said Yogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/azamgarh-could-be-renamed-as-aryamgarh-hints-yogi/articleshow/87690344.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The young Asiatic lions are being brought to the city from the Sakkarbaug Zoo in Junagadh. The Sayajibaug Zoo presently has two ageing lions. The lion Kunvar and lioness Gel are around 13-year-old. They have been recently shifted to new enclosures. The zoo has space for more large cats as two of the five moat enclosures are vacant. The moat enclosures that are as per Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI) norms were inaugurated in December last year. The two existing lions that had to be kept in separate enclosures earlier are now in the same enclosure. Zoo curator Pratyush Patankar said that two lions that are scheduled to arrive from Junagadh will be kept together in one of the enclosures. “They are around two-year-olds and will be shifted soon,” he said. The formalities for the transfer have been completed and is expected to take place later this month. Patankar said that the transfer was made through a tripartite arrangement. The Sayajibaug Zoo had given a pair of blue crown pigeons and love birds to the Sardar Patel Zoological Park in Kevadiya. In return, the young lion pair was to be given to Vadodara from Sakkarbaug zoo. With the arrival of the pair, one moat enclosure in Sayajibaug Zoo will remain vacant. The zoo is expected to get a white tiger for the enclosure. It has already started formalities for the same for quite some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-zoo-to-get-lion-pair/articleshow/87690351.cms||---

---||Goa||Youngsters at Kerala Blasters need a spark, we expect a lot from some of them this season: Ivan Vukomanovic||Ivan Vukomanovic knows the expectations at Kerala Blasters FC are high, but hasn’t forgotten the fact that the team finished tenth among 11 teams in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season. With a new set of foreign players, a clutch of promising youngsters and a lengthy pre-season, the Serbian coach is hoping to write a new chapter. Excerpts from an interview with TOI… Given that the league is very short, the focus is always on results, rather than the process. Will you need time with this team to prove what they can achieve? Every coach, team needs time. In football, if we only speak about results then football will always be concentrated on a short-term idea. At the end of the day, every club will suffer, the national teams will suffer. Getting results for a club is always a process. Everyone wants to have results, that’s our goal too, but we need time to complete the puzzle. Kerala Blasters is a great club with a huge army of fans and they deserve to be on top of the table. But in football, you can never have success overnight. You have to go through the process. The process is particularly important for the young players at the club? Yes, of course. They have to start somewhere. They have to be developed to be able to play for many years at the level of ISL, which will improve every year. I think we managed to sign some good guys, good players, who can bring something extra and also help these young players play an important role. Kerala Blasters always have high expectations, but the club hasn’t managed to qualify for the playoffs for the last four years. Last year, the team finished tenth among 11 teams. A top-four spot will still be a realistic target? We don't know. Nobody knows how ISL (new) players will develop. Teams have been undergoing changes. The most important aspect is the momentum. Teams which start well will be at the top of the table. If you collect points and there are (only) 11 teams, you will be at the top and stay there. In the ISL, anything is possible, and from what we have seen, anyone can beat anyone in this league. Small details will make the difference. Which teams are more likely to succeed? Those who are organised. With the reduction in foreign players, teams who possess the best group of Indian players will be on top. That’s why we are developing our (young) players. Kerala has one of the youngest domestic squads. They have lot of promise, but are they ready to deliver? All of them need one spark, one moment that will take them to the next level. Kerala Blasters have gathered interesting young players who can develop. Some have already started playing in ISL and are part of the national teams. We expect a lot from them. We will do our best to help them improve their game, develop and grow into better players. Is it an advantage or a disadvantage to have all new foreign players? Both. Because, again, we don’t know how it will pan out. I think we have signed some good foreign players, all of them. This year we have no problems with communication. All of them speak English, a couple of them speak Spanish between them, so I can speak with them in English or Spanish. As humans, they are quality persons. This is a very important aspect and can have a positive influence. Was it a conscious decision not to sign a foreign defensive midfielder, something that every other ISL club has done? First, we have some domestic players in that position who can be developed and go on to become important players for the national team. From the national team perspective, it’s important to give these players space and time. Tactically, with lesser foreign players, let’s say if during the game you want to add more offensive power to your team from the bench and you want to keep your strikers on the pitch, it means you will have to take off one of your midfielders or one of your defenders. If those guys are having a good game, they will still become victims of the foreign player rule or a tactical substitution. If you push out a midfielder, you have to field someone else there, or maybe change the shape, do certain things that will end up in a mess. From that point of view, our idea was to develop certain players for certain positions. During substitutions, we want to change players, position for position. Don’t want to complicate too much. We need to keep things simple. It’s obvious that there is lack of domestic options in some positions… Our idea is to try and develop some players in certain positions. These players will add value to the club in the future. This year we want to give space and time to some domestic players to develop and become important players, not just for Kerala Blasters but also national team. What are the goals for this season? To win as many games as possible. I like my teams to have a winning mentality, even for small-sided games. This is the mentality we want to have in our team. At one of my previous clubs, when you enter, there is a big sign. It states, ‘victory is not the most important part of football, but what we want to do is teach our players what is winning mentality’. When you have this mentality, victories will follow. We will be able to achieve good things. We have to work hard. We have to be honest. As a team, last season, we were second from bottom. We have no right to speak big. We have to shut our mouths and work hard. That’s our goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/youngsters-at-kerala-blasters-need-a-spark-we-expect-a-lot-from-some-of-them-this-season-ivan-vukomanovic/articleshow/87704227.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

About 600 artisans are displaying their handmade products at about 300 stalls which drew a huge crowd on Saturday. The fair will continue till November 21. The massive entrance with the selfie point demarking the name of the fest in hashtags, dhols and Rajasthani puppet dancers collaboratively worked to give an appropriate ambience to the fest. The Vishwakarma park which was decorated with a massive idol of Lord Vishwakarma as a centre piece highlighted the main incidents from the story of independence. For many of the city folks it felt like a picnic with their families where children ran all over the Haat playfully. The youngsters were engaged in posing for selfies and photographs while the others were fascinated by the beauty of the handicrafts. Ritika Chaturvedi, who visited the Haat with her kids along with a few of her friends and their kids, said, “We brought our kids to the Haat so that we can inform them about the traditional art works of our country. After the entire pandemic this is the first time we all managed to plan out a picnic for the kids.” People were also busy with their cameras posing with different items. One among them was Manisha Sahay, who said, "The Vishwakarma Vatika that showcases aazadi ka amrit mahotsava was the best part of the Haat for me. I could pose for pictures for my social media. I also bought Handcrafted dupatta, vase and paper flowers. I also witnessed the charm or charkha by posing with it." Nisha Pandey, a shopaholic, said, "I have been looking forward to this fest for about a year. I really loved the products which I purchased last year. This year the work of brass seems really incredible.” Ashish Lama, who recently shifted from west Bengal said, “My wife and I found really interesting stuff like the handcraft furniture. The massive wheels and the wood carved mirrors were the best." Arun Sarkar, a seller said, “I have brought hand embroidered and needle works sarees from Tripura." Kolla Subhash, who had a stall on incense sticks and ittars, attracted people from all walks of life. “We have a wide variety of incense sticks which have no chemicals. Instead, they are made with natural things. Some special variants include Rudraksha. We also offer customised ittars at a very economical price."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hunar-haat-draws-craft-connoisseurs/articleshow/87691384.cms||---

The protesters comprising drivers of buses, autos and lorries gathered at the toll plaza under the banner of Kappalur Toll Gate Edhirpu Iyakkam. “Only around 10 days ago, commercial taxes minister P Moorthy along with district collector and revenue divisional officer held a peace committee meeting and fee exemption was allowed for local vehicles from T Kallupatti and Peraiyur. However, now, the toll plaza officials are telling us we have to pay up,” said Andisamy, a co-ordinating member and protester. He further said that this is not the first time that toll plaza officials are seeking fee from them defying the orders of the local administration. The protest led to piling up of vehicles at the toll plaza. The protesters disbursed only after Thirumangalam revenue divisional officer and police held talks. Saying that NHAI has informed that they are allowing exemption only through another road, the officials promised to continue the exemption for local vehicles till a permanent solution is arrived at legally. “This is a long pending issue. Kappalur toll plaza has been built in violation of rules. Friction between locals and toll plaza officials continues as the toll plaza officials keep disobeying local orders and demand fee after a short time,” said Raghunatha Raja, president, Kappalur Industrialists Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/locals-protest-fee-collection-at-kappalur-toll-plaza-in-madurai/articleshow/87690955.cms||---

Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and medical college dean Dr A Rathinavel were also present. Addressing the media, Dr PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan said that the lift was installed as promised by the state government and local authorities. “Madurai Medical College is one among the oldest and historical medical colleges in the state. There is also a vote counting centre here and when we visited in 2014, we found that the lift was not in proper condition. In 2021, the condition of the lift worsened further and a voter, who is a lift operator, had appealed to renovate it as it caters to the needs of medical students,” he said. The minister said that installing a new lift in such an old building is not easy. “It is difficult to remove it completely and get a new lift. Within the same frame, a custom electrical lift that is completely safe has been installed,” he added.  The doors also got a new décor and depicted a photo of the famous Thirumalai Nayakar Palace in Madurai. The inauguration of the new lift has been welcomed by doctors, students and staff at Madurai Medical College.  Some of the lifts located in various parts of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) campus are quite old and require maintenance. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-med-college-gets-a-new-lift-at-last/articleshow/87690948.cms||---

According to sources, ED has registered a case and has approached the state police seeking details regarding cases against Mavunkal. The central agency will be probing suspected violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The move comes after the high court on Thursday directed to make the ED a party in the case against Mavunkal and others involved in the fake antiques scam. The agency would be looking into the possibility of the financial transactions connected with the trade of antiques being a mode of money laundering. Source said that the agency has formally approached the investigation team probing the case to share information relevant to the central agency’s investigation. CB SIT itself had found that transactions worth lakhs were made through non-banking channels without any documentary support. ED will investigate the possible financial irregularities in these deals. The central agency will now summon the complainants and witnesses in the case and record their statements. Petitions will have to be moved in the court concerned to question Mavunkal, who is now in judicial custody. The high court had on Thursday observed that there was more than what meets the eye in the case and the court would not allow a cover-up. Monson was initially arrested based on the complaint by six people that he had allegedly duped them of Rs10 crore by gaining their trust through sharing a fake bank account statement with them. There is also a cheating case to the tune of Rs 6 crore against Monson based on a complaint by Rajendran Pillai of Sreevalsam group. Crime branch has also registered cases against Monson for impersonating as the chairman of a channel and duping a sculptor from Thiruvananthapuram of nearly Rs 80 lakh by not paying for the sculptures he bought from him. CB is also probing a Pocso case against Monson for allegedly sexually abusing his employee’s minor daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ed-probes-monsons-financial-dealings/articleshow/87690964.cms||---

That is the reason booster doses are recommended,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health (Telangana). He said the effect of vaccine waning off has also been observed locally among healthcare workers. India is focussing on completing two vaccine doses, but Rao said people opting for these at the individual level will not break any law. But they won’t get certificates. Health authorities said the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are recommending booster doses but not immediately because of the inequality of vaccines across the globe. “Certain countries have taken a policy decision to give booster doses and are giving booster doses to elderly people and healthcare workers. Citizens going ahead and taking booster doses is ok,” he said. He said the cocktail method is best when it comes to booster doses. “Internationally mixing of vaccines is recommended for boosters, which means that if the first two doses are of a particular company, the booster can be taken of a different company,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-officials-urge-people-to-go-for-third-vaccine-dose/articleshow/87690953.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Approver: Rs 8 crore land deal behind Jagan Mohan Reddy's uncle Vivekananda's murder||HYDERABAD: Was it a Rs 8 crore land deal and political mistrust that led to the murder of AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s uncle and former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy? As per the statements of one of the accused, who later turned as an approver, to the CBI probing the case, it appears so. While political mistrust triggered a rift between killers of Vivekananda, sharing of the property dispute settlement money of Rs 8 crore led to the gruesome murder, it is learnt. The CBI recorded statements of approver Shaik Dastagiri under CrPC sections, which revealed that a Rs 40 crore deal was struck between key accused Yerra Gangi Reddy and suspect Devireddy Shiva Shankar Reddy, a Kadapa politician, to eliminate Vivekananda. Dastagiri was a car driver with Vivekananda from February 2017 to December 2018. He along with three others — Yerra Gangi Reddy, Sunil Yadav and Gajjala Umashankar Reddy — was chargesheeted by the CBI for the murder of Vivekananda. The CBI has moved a petition stating that Dastagiri had turned into an approver in the case. Gangi Reddy was a close associate of Vivekananda and used to be with him all the time. Twenty days prior to committing the murder (on March 15, 2019), Yadav and Umashankar even maimed the dog in the house as they did not want any hurdle in executing their plan. “We even conducted recce of the house several times,” Dastagiri said in his statement to the CBI. Rivalry between Gangi Reddy and Shiva Shankar broke out after the defeat of Vivekananda in the MLC election in 2017 at the hands of BTech Ravi of TDP. Dastagiri in his statement said: “After he lost the poll, Vivekananda was furious with Gangi Reddy, Shiva Shankar and other leaders of Kadapa and warned them to mend their ways. While this was so, Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy visited Yelahanka near Bengaluru several times to settle a land issue.” He further said: “Umashankar was also interested in the land issue as they used to discuss with all of us about the money to be received through this land settlement. In June 2018, during a visit of Vivekananda and Gangi Reddy, there was a heated argument over share of money. Gangi Reddy and Umashankar were humiliated by Vivekananda several times over their alleged role in his electoral defeat. There were arguments over financial matters as well.” Dastagiri was removed from work at the fag end of 2018. However, he ran an auto and maintained contact with Umashankar and Yadav. In his statement, Dastagiri said: “Vivekananda used to tell Umashankar that the latter had cheated him and created differences within the family.” He said the conspiracy to murder Vivekananda was hatched by Gangi Reddy along with Umashankar and Yadav. “When I expressed doubts, Gangi Reddy told me that he has the support of Umashankar and will manage everything. Gangi Reddy said Vivekananda turned greedy and wanted the entire Bengaluru land settlement amount for himself.” “Gangi Reddy said he would be receiving Rs 40 crore from Shiva Shankar. He had already offered Rs 5 crore. Four to five days prior to the murder, Yadav handed over Rs 1 crore to me as an advance for carrying out the murder. Yadav told me that he and Umashankar would also get Rs 1 crore each,” said Dastagiri in his statement. Dastagiri further said: “After receiving Rs 1 crore, I decided to purchase a villa in Pulivendula at a cost of Rs 75 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/approver-rs-8cr-land-deal-behind-viveka-murder/articleshow/87691396.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Local sources play key role in poisoning Delhi’s air: Experts||NEW DELHI: With winds not strong enough to blow away the smog hanging over the city, Delhiites continued to be victims of severely poor air quality. However, while stubble burning in the neighbouring states has exacerbated the situation, Delhi seems to be failing in controlling locally generated pollutants and emissions. On Saturday, the Supreme Court made this point while noting that stubble burning did contribute to the capital’s murky air, it was not the sole reason for it. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to data from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), on Saturday, the city was largely a victim of its own pollution sources, with around 10% of the PM2.5 pollutants locally generated by biomass burning and 24% by vehicles. Other contributors were industries at 7.6%, construction at 3.5% and internal waste burning, 2.2 %. “There are over 29 sources of pollution in Delhi, of which biomass burning is one. While emissions are blown into the city from the 19 National Capital Region districts, local sources are a major component, transport being at the top,” said Shambhavi Shukla, assistant programme manager, air pollution, Centre for Science and Environment. Shukla asserted there was a need for “integrated multisector regional action plan covering all of NCR” by addressing the local sources. An IITM official said, “The data fluctuates. Often, the contribution of internal sources peaks to 65% in Delhi’s AQI, the remaining coming from the NCR cities. The biomass burning share in the PM2.5 is often surpassed by local sources or transport pollution. However, this changes every hour depending on meteorological factors like wind speed. Proper planning for cuts in source emissions can help bring down pollution levels from ‘severe’ to ‘moderate’.” According to a CSE study based on the data from IITM between October 29 and November 8, around 31% of the pollution in the city had local sources. Of the pollution from local sources, around 51% was created by vehicles. CSE observed that the overall contribution of Delhi’s own sources to pollution increased during the evening hours and lasted till the early morning hours. The CSE study said, “The contribution also comes from outside Delhi, including 19 districts in the NCR as well as biomass burning in the neighbouring states. During November 2-6, the contribution from NCR dominated in the initial phase, going up to 70-80%, but the share declined during the smog episode after Diwali when the relative contribution of Delhi’s own sources increased. Similarly, the contribution of biomass burning from other states remained low in the initial pre-Diwali phase but peaked post Diwali.” Gufran Beig, founder project director of the Union earth ministry’s SAFAR forecasting body, noted that the while the extremal sources of pollution spiked during the stubble-burning peak season, their contribution remained lower than local emission. “Under normal conditions, transport causes 41% of pollution in Delhi, industries 22.3% and re-suspended dust, up to 18%,” said Beig. “However, during the stubble-burning period, the external contribution to pollutants reached up to 30%. Even then, a large chunk is locally generated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/local-sources-play-key-role-in-poisoning-delhis-air-experts/articleshow/87691393.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The residents said that the roads in Officers Town have been greatly damaged by heavy vehicles over the years. Further, the rain has also left the roads slushy with stagnant water and potholes. They said that the roads are a constant threat for motorists and there have been accidents as well. “For several years, the road has not been laid. The original road that was laid around eight years ago, was substandard. We have reached out to the civic authorities, district administration and even to ministers repeatedl,” said R Karmegam, president, Officers Town Kudiyiruppor Nala Sangam. The residents’ welfare association has recently submitted a petition to the Madurai district collector as well. “The area also has a private school with a strength of more than 1,000-1,500 students, who have to make use of the roads. We also don’t have many basic facilities in the area and without proper roads, we remain isolated,” said M Muthulakshmi, a resident. The residents also alleged that corporation workers did not come to the area to clear garbage, fogging etc., due to the poor condition of roads. Meanwhile, K P Karthikeyan, Madurai Corporation commissioner said that the government has sanctioned special grants for laying new roads in the city. “The government has sanctioned funds and the first batch of tenders has been floated and we are awaiting approval for the second batch. Once the rain stops, roads will be laid in a phased manner across the city,” he said. The commissioner also said that post Diwali festival, there have been some issues regarding the deployment of sanitary workers in some areas. The corporation helpline no 842842500 can be reached in case of any complaints and action will be taken promptly, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/damaged-roads-continue-to-plague-officers-town-residents-in-madurai/articleshow/87690961.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Her husband and two others have been arrested. As news of the death spread on Friday, BJP Yuva Morcha (BJPYM) members reached the spot and blamed Varsha’s husband and his family for killing “the Hindu girl”. Tension prevailed in the area after members of two communities indulged in stone-pelting and firing. The BJPYM members also staged a protest, demanding arrest of the accused and shouted slogans. They allegedly attacked some shopkeepers in the area. A video that went viral on social media purportedly shows people indulging in abusive language and assaulting one another. In the melee that ensued, some unidentified person opened fire but luckily there were no casualties. Police have registered an FIR against five people, including the husband of the deceased, Mohd Faheem, under IPC section 304 B (dowry death), 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty ) and provisions of the Dowry Prevention Act on a complaint filed by the woman’s family members. Faheem, his father and brother were remanded to judicial custody on Saturday after being produced in court, while his mother and sister are still absconding. Varsha’s brother, Dushyant Singh, said she had married Faheem, a car mechanic, one-and-a-half years ago. He claimed he had received a call from her brother-in-law in the evening, saying that she had committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan. “My sister cannot take such a step,” he said, alleging that she was murdered. He claimed that when he and his family members reached her house, they were attacked by her in-laws. “I was assaulted by them,” he claimed. Sudhir Kumar Singh, SSP, told mediapersons that the situation is under control now and a police force has been deployed in the locality to avoid any further incident. He said the autopsy report revealed the cause of death as “hanging”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/communal-clash-in-agra-after-death-of-an-interfaith-married-woman/articleshow/87690363.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Varanasi||Let BJP take ‘vikas ki aandhi’ forward in UP, Shah tells voters||Gorakhpur: Seeking second term for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday lauded the Yogi Adityanath government for all-round development of the state and asked voters to let the party take forward ‘vikas ki aandhi’ by ensuring a record win in the 2022 assembly elections. “Under Yogi, the state is number one in many schemes. Development is all-pervasive and today UP is a riot-free state... there is a positive change in every sector, from law and order to farming, education, industry and infrastructure,” Shah said after opening Sansad Khel Mahakumbh at Shaheed Satya Mansingh Stadium and inaugurating/laying foundation of 94 development projects of Rs 189 crore in Basti district. Apart from the Chief Minister, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and MP Harish Dwivedi were also present at the event. He said: “A lot has been done by Prime Minister Narendra Modiji and Yogiji, but a lot still needs to be done. For this, blessings of voters is required once again.” Heaping praise on the chief minister, he said, “The Yogi government gave Rs 36,000 crore loan waivers to farmers and paid Rs 80,000 crore directly in the farmer’s account by purchasing of 435 lakh metric ton grains. As many as 2.53 crore farmers in the state got help of Rs 37,000 crore under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme and the government made 45 farm mandis tax free and computerised 27 mandi of the state.” “Today, UP is number one in smart city scheme, PM Awaas scheme, construction of toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission, Saubhagya scheme, Ujjwala scheme, PM SVANidhi scheme, besides production of paddy, wheat, potato, sugar, mango and amla in the country,” Shah said. Lauding Yogi, Shah asked if there are any more mafia elements seen now in the state. “Elections are around the corner. I want to ask you if any mafia is seen now in the entire Purvanchal. Have the mafias not been removed?" Home Minister Shah asked. “Earlier the police was scared of mafia in UP, but now when mafia see police they plead not to shoot them. (Pehle police mafia se darti thi par ab mafia gale mein takhti latka kar kehte hain ki hum sharan mein hain hume goli mat maaro),” Shah said. Unleashing a sharp attack on the erstwhile Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said those responsible for the mass exodus of people have themselves exited the state. The apparent reference was towards Kairana, where scores of Hindu families had left in the aftermath of Muzaffarnagar riots. The issue was raked up by BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and had played a major factor in the party’s resounding performance in the parliamentary polls and 2017 assembly elections in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/let-bjp-take-vikas-ki-aandhi-forward-in-up-shah-tells-voters/articleshow/87690364.cms||Arjumand Bano

It has also been placed in the A2 category for institution academic excellence. Under OBE, the ranking authorities evaluate and measure the objectives of an institution with its ability to meet and deliver these objectives through its outcomes. The framework has been specifically designed to weigh and focus on three essential parameters — inclusion and diversity, internship and placements, and entrepreneurship and innovation. Through effective evaluation of these three verticals, the best performing institutes are recognised and awarded for their ability to meet the standards of quality which are expected in these categories, through an analysis of teaching methodologies and outcome-based models. “These rankings are a testimony to our efforts towards promoting and developing excellence in education,” said PU’s vice president Dr Parul Patel. “From the date of joining, our students are groomed in numerous streams for career development, entrepreneurship, research and internationalisation,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pu-ranked-23rd-for-outcome-based-education/articleshow/87690375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC gives school an earful for expelling pupil over fee row||MUMBAI: A school is a temple of education, observed the Bombay high court on Saturday while directing a Pune school to unconditionally take back a student of class VI whom it had expelled because his parents refused to undertake not to file complaints about increased fees. “This is how you treat students? Why have you set up the school? To behave in this manner with children and parents?” asked a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar angrily on a petition by the 11-year-old’s father. The Orbis School at Keshavnagar issued a transfer certificate on May 7. The school’s advocate said it will take the student back but his father must undertake to withdraw complaints and litigation. “You cannot tell parents of students not to file litigation against you,” said Justice Kathawalla. The advocate said the school wants to resolve the matter amicably. “You throw the student out and then you say this. You will take him back unconditionally,” said Justice Kathawalla. The school’s advocate then said it will take the boy back but the annual fees for 2021-22 must be paid. “We’ll compensate him for six months of loss of studies. The parent must not precipitate the matter,” he said. The judges pulled up the father, a software engineer, saying he must cooperate. “The school also has overheads. You must also know where to draw the line. If parents start fighting with schools, the children will suffer. It appears there is an ego fight,” said Justice Kathawalla. Justice Jamdar said: “Your son suffered because of this.” The father’s advocate, Siddharthshankar Sharma, said there is a petition in the Supreme Court to reduce fees during the pandemic. The judges said whenever there is a general order it will bind the school too. “What will our children learn if we fight with the school? We call it vidyamandir. We call them guru. Then we fight with the school. If we respect the school, the children will respect all teachers,” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges directed the father to pay Rs 91,000 fee. “The school will not only provide study material but will also ensure that extra classes are held for the child,” they said, adding that it will not place any other condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-gives-school-an-earful-for-expelling-pupil-over-fee-row/articleshow/87692118.cms||Rosy Sequeira

At the same time, diabetic eye diseases are also seen on the rise. At the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), over 200 such cases are being seen each month. “Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy have increased significantly in Hyderabad. This is due to the fact that many patients did not come for their regular retina check up due to the fear of the coronavirus during the last one and half year. Their blood sugar control has also not been good due to lack of outdoor activity and increasing option of work from home. At the LVPEI, we are seeing more than 200 patients with severe and advanced diabetic retinopathy each month. Many of these patients are in their 30s and early 40s,” said Dr Raja Narayanan, Director and Network Head, Clinical Research at L V Prasad Eye Institute and Head and General Secretary at Vitreo Retina Society of India It has been estimated that diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in young working-aged (25-40) adults.  “One in 4 working adults (early ’20s to early 60s) have undiagnosed diabetes. Very often, vision problems lead to the discovery of the condition. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of diabetic eye disease. If it is left untreated, these can even lead to complete vision loss,” said Dr Gaurav Arora, regional head- clinical services at Dr Agarwals Eye Hospitals. While in the initial stages, the disease does not have any symptoms. With progression however, blurred vision, spots floating in vision, dark or empty areas of vision and sudden visual loss can occur. “Diabetic education, compliance to the drugs, regular screening for complications and regular follow ups with dialectologists are the key to successful management of diabetes and its complications,” said Dr Shehzad Ruman, consultant endocrinology and diabetes, Kims Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/diabetic-retinopathy-on-rise-during-pandemic-say-docs/articleshow/87690969.cms||Amrita Didyala

Sources said that the central committee (CC) member of the banned Communist party of India (Maoist) Milind Teltumbde, who is in charge of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh zone, is also among those killed. The CC is the apex body of the rebel movement in which Teltumbde used to occupy a top post as far as Maoists movement in central India is concerned. He is also considered a forerunner of the concept of ‘urban Maoism’. Observers say Saturday’s encounter has dealt the three-decade-old Naxalite movement a big blow. On April 22-24, 2018, commandos had gunned down 37 Naxalites including 19 women. Saturday’s encounter is the second-biggest in terms of Naxal toll. Goyal said the bodies need to be identified “following the standard operating procedures”. “We have heard that Teltumbde is dead but the information is yet to be confirmed as the jawans are yet to return,” he said. Once the bodies are brought to the district headquarters, surrendered Naxalites will be called for an identification. At the time of going to the press, the commandos are yet to return to even the Gyarapatti armed outpost. It’s learnt that the encounter started at 6.30 am and went on till 4.30 pm. After it ended, the commandos launched search operations in the forest as the Naxalites are known to drag away those killed and injured to nearby villages. Sources said this could not continue for long as darkness had set in. Four commandos who received bullet injuries were airlifted to Nagpur for medical assistance. According to early reports, a big cache of arms and ammunition was seized after the encounter which is considered to be one of the longest one in the history of the state’s fight against Maoism. Sources also claimed divisional committee members (DVC) Shuklal Parcheki and Prabhakar of company No. 4 formation of the Maoists too were among the ones who died. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil congratulated the Gadchiroli police in a tweet. Naxal range DIG Sandip Patil, who is also in-charge of the state Anti-Naxal Operation, couldn’t go to Gadchiroli as the state government had rushed him to Amravati city to tackle the law and order situation that arose there on Saturday. According to sources, Teltumbde was being escorted to the Maharashtra border by Chhattisgarh-based Vistar dalam. Teltumbde was received by Korchi dalam members and company no. 4 formation. “There were at least 40-45 Naxalites camping at the site,” they added. Around 16 C60 teams reached the place and cordoned off the camp. The commandos formed layers and mounted the attack. Maoist sentries opened fire and the C60 retaliated. Outnumbered, the Maoists tried to flee into Chhattisgarh but were trapped as their escape routes had been plugged by the commandos. The injured jawans were first brought to Dhanora and then airlifted to Nagpur where they are being treated at a private hospital. “All four are stable but two jawans have critical injuries,” said Dr Anup Marar of the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/26-maoists-gunned-down-in-10-hour-operation/articleshow/87690978.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police arrested Heena Begum, 22, and her live-in partner Shaik Mohammed Khadar, 25. Police said that the victim, Mehak, was killed as she was unwilling to beg and also because she disliked Khadar. Mehak had died after sustaining fist punch injuries on various parts of her body. After nabbing the couple, police came to know that Heena got married to one Ahmed, who was arrested in a burglary case, and the couple have three children- Affan, 7, Mehak, 4, and Mahera, 3. After Ahmed went to jail, Heena during her visit to a toddy compound met Khadar and they became friends, while she shared her problems. He proposed to marry her and he agreed to take care of her children too. Later, he took them to Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Manali for begging. “As the child was not happy with Khadar being close to her mother, the victim insisted on going back to her father. Besides, she refused to go for begging. As a result, she was frequently subjected to severe physical torture,” joint commissioner of police (West Zone) AR Srinivas said. Police said on November 3 when the girl and accused were in Bengaluru, she was repeatedly beaten up by the accused with their fist. The victim became unconscious. The couple decided to board a bus to Hyderabad. While they were seated in the bus, the accused realised that the girl has died. Later, they came near NIMS and abandoned her. Police found a couple getting down an auto near Model House. The auto driver gave the lead that he came across the couple at Lakdikapul, where they got down a bus. Using details, they zeroed in on the accused and caught them at Jubilee Bus Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-yr-olds-murder-solved-mother-paramour-arrested/articleshow/87690981.cms||---

Last month, ED attached prime property in Dehradun owned by Iqbal and his family valued at Rs 74 crore under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). The economic intelligence agency also attached seven sugar mills owned by him and his family valued at Rs 1,097 crore under PMLA on March 9. Iqbal’s two sons are embroiled in a scam relating to sale of 21 state-owned sugar mills during the BSP regime, scraping the exchequer of Rs 1,800 crore. An ED official said, PMLA, 2002, was lodged against Iqbal based on investigations conducted by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) of ministry of corporate affairs and relates to acquisition of assets through illegitimate means in 2010-2011. A senior ED official told TOI that a notice has been served on Iqbal and his family for illegal acquisition of land for setting up a private university, which soon be attached. His other properties are under scanner, he said. ED said, Iqbal and his family members fraudulently acquired land at Saharanpur in 2015 in the name of a company, BSS Associates. Explaining the modus operandi, Singh said, big unaccounted money was deposited in bank accounts of the former legislator and his family in 2014-15. “This was quicklyl transferred to the account of a shell firm, Glocal India Industries, which ploughed the money into purchase of shares of BSS Associates. Iqbal also conducted transactions to maintain a carefully-crafted façade to own land in Dehradun. Apart from cash deposits, entries from shell companies were used to infuse tainted money into purchase of shares of BSS Associates by Glocal India Industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ed-to-attach-bsp-ex-mlcs-sprawling-university-campus/articleshow/87691415.cms||---

Addressing the gathering, the governor said that the MC aims at providing the best urban experience to residents. He said that residents would be greatly benefited by the 24x7 water supply project as water quality would improve and households would receive sufficient pressure to fill tanks up to the third storey, which would decrease pumping cost. The governor underlined the need for public participation to understand issues and recognise areas which required improvement. He congratulated the mayor, councillors and the commissioner as well as the team of officers for taking up people-centric steps. The Governor asked the officers concerned of the Chandigarh administration and MC to expedite work on the project. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said that the primary goal of the project is to switch from intermittent supply to a 24x7 continuous, pressurised supply system for health, hygiene and water-conservation benefits. He said the project would involve new water works with 4 million gallon of additional storage, 13,700 smart meters, 20 km of new lines and automated monitoring of system through SCADA. Also, he said that all the 37 tubewells would be phased out and 100% water supply would be shifted to surface water. Dharam Pal, adviser to the administrator, Chandigarh highlighted other crucial projects being carried out by Chandigarh Smart City Limited such as the ‘Im Chandigarh (I am Chandigarh)’ app, Integrated Command & Control center (ICCC) and Public Bike Sharing (PBS) system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/foundation-stone-of-24x7-water-supply-project-laid/articleshow/87690406.cms||---

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: After two decades, Kairana gets its own fuel station||MEERUT: For two decades, Kairana residents would either travel all the way to Shamli or Panipat in Haryana, both 12 km away, to buy diesel and petrol and other petroleum goods as no petrol pump was in the area. Now, a local businessman has obtained a licence to set up and run a pump in the politically relevant town. Vipul Jain, who is building the pump station, said. “There used to be a petrol pump here 20 years ago, but owing to rampant law and order problems, it was shut down. Goons would get their tanks filled up but never paid. As a result, It was people who had to suffer. Now, with better conditions, we think we can have this basic facility here again.” Welcoming the move, Abdul Ahmad, a resident of Kairana, said, “Kairana was only known for crime and politics. Even during elections, better roads and fuel supply were non issues, so no one bothered and the public suffered silently. It's good we'll have at least one pump now.” The facility is currently under construction and will take some time for it to become fully operational. Sukriti Madhav, superintendent of police, Shamli, said, “Kairana has always been in focus because of the high rate of crime. Apart from clamping down on organized crime, we worked extensively towards restoring traders' faith and securing public utility services. Opening of a petrol pump in Kairana is a positive signal and we'll ensure it runs smoothly.” Way back in 2016, the then BJP MP of Kairana, Hukum Singh, had produced a list of 250 families that he claimed had migrated elsewhere due to poor law and order in the town. The issue found mention in the BJP manifesto and Kairana became a poll plank of the saffron party in 2017 UP polls so much so that after winning the polls, a massive crackdown began against criminal elements. Police encounters resulted in the liquidation of dreaded gangsters like Mukim Kala. Several gangsters were either gunned down or were thrown behind bars. The crackdown even drew sharp criticism from the opposition that accused police of indulging in extra-judicial killings. But it did help in improving law and order in Kairana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-two-decades-kairana-gets-its-own-fuel-station/articleshow/87690448.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||50 quintals of solid waste, mostly plastic, removed from Ramganga river in Corbett||DEHRADUN: A 15-day-long cleaning exercise in the Ramganga that flows through the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) yielded almost 50 quintals of trash recently. The trash had come into the river following intense spells of rainfall on October 18 and 19 that left 59 people dead across Kumaon and prompted CTR authorities to shut down the park for two days owing to large-scale soil erosion and waterlogging in several of its zones. Ramganga river houses rich aquatic life, consisting of otters, gharials, crocodiles and fishes like mahseer. Besides aquatic species, the river stretch is also frequented by other animals, including tigers, leopards and elephants since it is a drinking water source for them. Officials said that the amount of muck and plastic waste that trickled down the river after the rain spell was so huge that it could have choked animals. There was also the fear of an epidemic breakout due to the waste accumulation in the river. In the past, too, tigers and leopards have been spotted near the river with plastic in their mouths, indicating the serious concerns raised by plastic pollution. “The waste mostly consisted of polythene bags, water bottles, shoes, slippers and pipes. It made its way to Ramganga in Dhikala, which forms the core zone of the reserve,” said Rahul (who goes by his first name), director, CTR. “To make sure that animals do not drink the polluted water, we conducted the massive cleaning drive in which two truckloads of solid waste were taken out from the river. The amount of waste retrieved from Ramganga also highlights the shoddy waste disposal management in the hills. Much of the plastic waste had come from the villages between Gairsain and Ramnagar as the river flows down from Gairsain in Chamoli,” he added. This year, the annual cleaning exercise, which is usually held for three days in February when the water level recedes, was forwarded by a few months due to the trash choking the Ramganga. The drive was conducted with the help of rafts, inflatable boats, and additional contractual forest staff. Volunteers were also deployed for cleaning the Ramganga reservoir, officials said. Meanwhile, RK Tiwari, warden of CTR, told TOI that the reserve, including all core areas, will be opened fully for tourists from November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/50-quintals-of-solid-waste-mostly-plastic-removed-from-ramganga-river-in-corbett/articleshow/87689680.cms||Shivani Azad

On September 17, the government passed the bill for registration of child marriages by amending the Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act. For which, a PIL was filed by Dr Kriti Bharti, managing trustee and rehabilitation psychologist on behalf of Saarthi Trust of Jodhpur. Simultaneously, another PIL was also filed. Bharti has annulled 43 child marriages and has stopped more than 1,500 child marriages. In the hearing of PIL of Saarthi Trust, it was told that till now the government has not withdrawn the bill, they have only kept it in the review. The process of which has not progressed. In the hearing, the high court sought information from the additional advocate general of the government, C L Saini, about the status of the Marriage Compulsory Registration Amendment Bill. At the same time, instructions have been given to present the actual status in two weeks. The Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by the state assembly had opened a can of worms with legal experts and activists claiming that it is promoting child marriage by giving it validation. Although child marriage is voidable, it is also a punishable as well as non-bailable offence against those persons who solemnise it. While the government claimed that the proposed amendment is to safeguard the legal rights of the children, experts said that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 already does with sections for Custody and maintenance of children of child marriages (section 5) as well as Legitimacy of children born of child marriages (section 6) thereby making the state’s justification fall short. Law experts further added that annulments of child marriages would become more cumbersome as registration certificate would now be a requirement to prove that minors were married off. They also raised the question that in case of children if parents register the marriage then FIR should be filed against them as they solemnised the wedlock. Following this uproar, the government had asked the Governor to return the bill for review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-seeks-status-of-marriage-registration-bill-in-2-wks/articleshow/87691011.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parsi trust sells sea-facing Bandra property for Rs 350 crore||MUMBAI: A Parsi trust has sold its prime, sea-facing bungalow property at Bandra Bandstand to a developer for Rs 350 crore. In late October, Imperial Infra, a Boman Irani-led Rustomjee Group firm, concluded the sale agreement with the Bandra Parsi Convalescent Home Trust for the 1-acre plot near Taj Land's End Hotel, reports Nauzer K Bharucha. The trust has received Rs 234 crore from the sale with part of proceeds going to the suburban collector as collector's fee. The trust will get back a built-up area of 12,000 sqft free of cost when the builder redevelops the land. Rustomjee is reportedly planning a luxury residential tower there. Realty deal makes Parsi trust richer than BPP in corpusThe deal for the property of the Bandra Parsi Convalescent Home Trust was registered a few days ago and around Rs 17 crore was paid as stamp duty. The trust had invited bids in 2019, but it took two years to finally conclude the deal because of the Covid-induced lockdown. There were only three bidders, of whom one was disqualified. The two that remained in the race were Rustomjee and Runwal Developers, whose offer was just over Rs 100 crore. The land deal makes the Bandra Parsi trust now richer than the Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) in terms of corpus. Although the BPP controls land and buildings worth thousands of crores, its corpus is just about Rs 117 crore. The plot currently contains a dilapidated early 20th century bungalow, which was once used as a convalescence home for poor women and children from the Parsi community. It shut down around 15 years ago due to poor occupancy. On Saturday, the trustees said the annual interest earned from the money will be used to expand the trust’s charity work for the Parsi Irani community. The trust currently provides medical help and funds for education and amelioration of poverty. The decision to sell the prime property was also due to the high ground rent charged by the collector, who increased it from Rs 4,600 a year to Rs 16 lakh. The trust found it “unaffordable”. Property market sources said the entire Bandra seafront will open up for construction and redevelopment with the stringent Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms recently diluted. “Builders will now get more floor space index (FSI) to develop plots near the coastline,” they said. The earlier CRZ rules allowed only restricted construction up to 500 metres from the high tide line. The Bandra convalescent home for Parsis was started in 1903 by social worker Shirinbai Mancherji Cama. After being widowed at a very young age, Cama dedicated the rest of her life to public service and community service true to her motto: ‘To serve one’s people is to serve God’. “She toiled night and day for it and considered all in the home as her children. She devoted her attention like a mother for their care, happiness and medical treatment. Sir Dorab Tata donated Rs 50,000, from which she bought Jalbhai Sett’s bungalow at Bandra,” said the Parsi historian Marzban Giara. Bai Avabai Faramji Petit, too, had donated Rs 1,500 to purchase furniture for the home. “The chief aim of this home was to restore the health of poor and weak women desirous of maintaining their family rather than depending on others, but due to poor physique unable to do so. The objective was to empower them so that they could lead an industrious and useful life,” Giara said. In 1932, Shirinbai started another Convalescent Home for Poor Parsi Men and Boys at Bandstand in a bungalow called Sea Breeze. This home is still functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-realty-deal-makes-parsi-trust-richer-than-bpp-in-corpus/articleshow/87692127.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Delhi||Exposure to pollutants may damage kids’ brain||NEW DELHI: The effect of pollution on the heart and lungs is well-established, but doctors say there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to the pollutants can damage a child’s brain. Particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 micrometres in size that are suspended in the air can enter into the brain through the olfactory nerves directly and damage the brain. Also, various components of polluted air like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, etc can dissolve in the blood and reach the brain. According to Dr Sheffali Gulati, professor and head of the child neurology division at AIIMS, the fine particulate matters can activate the microglia, the primary innate immune effector cells of the central nervous system (CNS), on entering the brain, leading to inflammatory response causing accumulation of proteins in the brain. “It can lead to an early ageing process of the brain in children at a very young age,” she said. Dr Gulati added that animal studies have shown that significant inflammatory infiltrates observed in various areas of the brain because of exposure to toxic elements in the air. The AIIMS doctor said another significant effect of air pollution on a child’s brain is seen through mothers. “In children born to mothers who were exposed to significantly polluted air during their pregnancy, the incidence of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, other behavioural issues like anxiety, depression, etc are higher than controls,” she explained. In 2017, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had released a report that warned about serious consequences of children due to prolonged exposure to air pollution. The Unicef report, titled Danger in the air, explained that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matter can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier — a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances. Second, exposure to air pollutant particles like magnetite can lead to oxidative stress, which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. “Not only do pollutants harm babies’ developing lungs, but they can also permanently damage their developing brains and, thus, their futures,” Unicef executive director Anthony Lake had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exposure-to-pollutants-may-damage-kids-brain/articleshow/87691440.cms||---

The contraband was concealed inside their bags, said an officer. One of the women, during interrogation, revealed that a Kenyan national had promised her money in exchange for the delivery of ‘certain goods’. “The Ugandan woman accepted the deal and travelled to Nairobi from Kampala by road where the Kenyan woman handed her over a bag to be delivered in Delhi. She also provided tickets and fake documents to cover her visit as a medical tourist,” the officer said. Zubair Riaz, commissioner (customs), said that the passenger was supposed to deliver the goods to a person who would have contacted her on exit. “When she was intercepted by customs officers, she was found to have a bag with a false bottom cavity wherein 5.4kg heroin was concealed,” Riaz said. About 7.5 kg of heroin was recovered from the possession of another female passenger, who was also posing as a medical tourist. The customs have seized over 100 kg heroin this year so far and nabbed 26 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13kg-heroin-worth-rs-90-crore-seized-from-2-flyers-at-igi/articleshow/87691012.cms||---

Jaipur Child Welfare Committee member Satyapal Chandolia said, "We had recommended that the registration of the private shelter should be cancelled after conducting the inspection. Out of the 20 children aged between 6 to 12, five said they had been sexually abused and will undergo a medical examination. The shelter was registered in 1961 and this is the first time that we received this complaint." It was found that children, who had left the shelter after becoming adults, would also visit at night without anyone’s knowledge and mistreat the younger ones. A video showed that alcohol was also taken inside the shelter. Police had detained two inmates in the case on Thursday and started interrogating staffers. Primary investigation revealed that no registers were maintained for staffers or visitors and no security guards were placed at the entry and exit points. Authorities have been asked to take action against the shelter. The child panel took cognizance of all such complaints. Presently, there are 172 child-care institutions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sexual-abuse-at-shelter-registration-of-pvt-childrens-home-cancelled/articleshow/87691013.cms||---

They demanded immediate action to clean and treat waste in the landfill using scientific and practical methods. Association members submitted that as mothers, they were deeply concerned about the MC’s inaction towards cleaning the landfill, which, they said, violated children’s right to life. “All children have the right to live in a clean and healthy environment. The image of Chandigarh across the country is well planned and city beautiful but the dumping of untreated waste at the cost of our children is very far from the image,” the NGO submitted. They stated that the Daddumajra dumping ground also violates several provisions of the Solid Waste Management Act, 2016. According to this Act, landfilling or dumping of mixed waste must be stopped. It also states that only non-usable, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, non-combustible and non-reactive inert waste can be disposed of in sanitary landfill sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngo-urges-mc-to-clear-dumping-ground-waste-scientifically/articleshow/87690449.cms||---

In all, 12 persons had lost their lives in the gruesome incident, of which 11 had been stuck in the raging fire caught in the bus and were burnt beyond recognition. Police had to collect their charred bones to be handed over to the forensic laboratory for DNA examination in order to establish their identities. Director of the laboratory at Jaipur, Ajay Sharma said the lab had received 11 samples on Thursday, of which identities of eight victims were established through DNA examination. “Report of the remaining three victims would also be handed over to police in next two days as their examination was under process,” said Sharma to the media. SHO (Pachpadra) Pradeep Danga said the mortal remains were handed over to the family members after based on the reports. These victims have been identified as Vibah Dave (22), Kamla Gawaria (38), Mehraram Prajapat (55), Jagdish Rao (42), Mahendra Meghwal (33), Dhanraj Rao (25), Suresh Kumar (17) and Vikram Singh (17). The horrific part of the exercise of identification was that the police had to collect the charred bones of the victims and pack them into cloth bales to be provided to the FSL at Jaipur. All of them had been waiting for these remains since the day of the accident so that they could execute the last rites. On the other hand, taking a serious note of the incident, transport commissioner Mahendra Soni visited the spot on Friday and constituted a committee to inquire into the matter. The high-level committee comprising officials of National Highway Authority of India and Regional Transport Office will submit its report to Soni in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/mortal-remains-of-bus-mishap-victims-handed-over-to-kin/articleshow/87691016.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Regaining relevance in Afghan maelstrom||Afghanistan is reeling under ever worsening humanitarian maelstrom with harsh winter, pandemic and famine. The disaster is compounded by inept Taliban government, struggling to find even basic international acceptance. The stark reality festers, in form of plight of significant number of refugees in the western and the gulf countries. It has also triggered in Europe a feeling of being let down by unilateral US pull out, as also guilt pangs on current plight of Afghan populace, particularly refugees, minorities, women and children. Growing difference in perceptions is diplomatic opportunity that Pakistan and China seek to exploit by according humanitarian crisis overriding importance and relegating other critical issues to background. There is concerted orchestration by Pakistan to magnify projections of crisis, to secure release of frozen funds, amounting to approximately $9.5 billion, thereby whittling down minimal leverages. Pakistan organised an international seminar to coincide with Troika plus meeting to hype up its pro-Taliban agenda. It will be worthwhile to reiterate red lines — inclusivity and pluralism; zero tolerance on terrorism, including proliferation of narcotics and arms; ensuring basic human rights specially for women, children and minorities. Humanitarian relief under the regime, where minorities like Shias and Sikhs are being targeted and women terrorised, mandates incorporation of safeguards to enable just coverage to include marginalised sections. India as likely major donor of wheat needs to ensure international monitoring. Chinks in collective resolve to link diplomatic recognition with compliance with red lines is already manifesting. Taliban appointees have taken over embassies and consulates in Pakistan. The same may happen in China and later Russia. The need is for collective action to retain leverages and incentivise compliance to internationally agreed objectives. Collapse of Doha process has sprouted alternative mechanisms like Troika plus (Russia initiated with USA, China plus - currently, Pakistan and Iran). Moscow format (enlarged regional formulation, including India) and recent Delhi dialogue, amongst others. India is literally at margins, struggling to regain relevance. We are paying heavy price for supporting duly elected regime and not opening parallel channels with Taliban. The US on its part has tried to initiate regional dialogue, concurrently aimed at countering China, through Quad variants. Central Asian one, announced before Taliban take over, is unlikely to take off. USA, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan are the members of this one. Middle Eastern variant has USA, Israel, UAE and India. Ironically, Israel and UAE have long standing security cooperation arrangements with China, including technology exchanges. In these confusing times of plurilateralism, Indian initiative with Russia, Iran and all five Central Asian countries is very timely endeavour. Unfortunately, Pakistan stayed away and even influenced China to do likewise. India has very difficult and complicated choices, starting with need to accept fait accompli and ‘real politik’ of dealing with Taliban. Between inactivity dubbed as strategic patience and smart engagement, the latter is pragmatic option. The harsh reality is that transition has been outsourced to Pakistan, yet, India has to forge consensus to preclude Pindi from hijacking the plot completely. The challenge can be outlined as regaining relevance, cementing consensus to nudge Taliban towards responsible governance, in effect retain leverages till compliance. More importantly, explore shared concerns and safeguard them. In Delhi dialogue, notwithstanding the Russian participation, some back tracking by Moscow on Delhi consensus has been reported. The need to be wary of stance of Zamir Kabulov, Russian interlocutor in Troika plus dialogue and his alleged pro-Pindi leaning. Is Russia utilising Nikolai Patrushev and Kabulov to remain engaged with two differing approaches? Indian opportunities lie with Iran and its ire at continuing marginalising of Shia, Hazaras and Ismailis. Insurgency in Sistan and growing number of refugees from Afghanistan have heightened concerns in Tehran. It is an opportunity to re-energise connectivity projects like Chabahar, Zaranj-Delaram, as part of North-South corridor. Side stepping US antagonism towards Iran and sanctions are the key challenges. Though seemingly tough, India needs to keep chipping at possibilities of reviving stake in Ayani air base in Tajikistan. This is specially critical as China is reportedly secured go ahead for policing and surveillance facility, essentially benign euphemism for military base. Our forays and efforts should include Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan, which is supposedly more autonomous. It may seem non-Kosher but it will be worthwhile to tie up with Americans, including utilisation of operating base, for OTH surveillance of possible areas of operation of ISIS and variants. It can have spin-offs in capability building, technology exchanges and messaging to ward off Chinese designs in Gilgit-Baltistan. It is time USA woke up to mess created due to over dependence on Pakistan and build redundancies through India. Euphoria in Pakistan over Taliban victory is having blow back effect. The government there caved in to self-appointed, anti-blasphemy warriors of TLP by accepting its unreasonable demands. It has resulted in main streaming and virtual carte blanche to the extremist party, whose cadres fired at and killed security personnel. In another incident, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had to appear before Supreme Court to explain amnesty to TTP, perpetrators of massacre of APS Peshawar. The growing perception is that the military has virtually capitulated, in Sirajuddin Haqqani brokered agreement. Repeated assurances on ISIS and TTP being under control are not even worth value of rapidly sinking Afghani currency. It is time world woke up to triggering of Domino effect of competitive extremism by legitimisation of TLP and TTP. The malevolence needs to be capped before, we confront new variants of ISIS, IMU, ETIM and more radical offshoots of Taliban.

---||Lucknow||‘Uro ailments worsen post-Covid infection’||LUCKNOW: As doctors handle surge in cases of worsening symptoms of urology related ailments in patients who had such issues before Covid-19, it is likely that the impact of Covid-19 may not be limited to just the respiratory system or other body organs directly involved with the disease While doctors insist a thorough research is needed to establish a distinct relation between Covid-19 infection and patients with urology issues, they agree that there are patients who are facing aggravated urology symptoms after contracting novel coronavirus. "Patients with post-Covid lower urinary tract symptoms are still coming to the outpatient department (OPD) several months after recuperating from the virus. They complain of having a sense of urgency for urination, increased frequency in urination and similar issues, which were perhaps present previously too, but the symptoms have worsened post-Covid," said Dr Alok Srivastava, faculty, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). "Such situation does arise in certain viral diseases, like Lyme disease, but there is currently no evidence to say the same correlation exists with Covid too," he added. Echoing the presence of a similar trend, urologist at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) Prof MS Ansari said, "There is not a new onset of urology symptoms in post-Covid patients, but for those patients who had a history or those who could not get timely consultation during the Covid period, are turning up with long term ill effects on their urinary system." This, he said, was true for patients with both benign and malignant forms of urology disorders. "A lot of the patients who were earlier dealing with a benign form of stone disease are dealing with an aggravated health situation. Similarly, patients of bladder dysfunction and urinary tract infection (UTI) are also seeing heightened symptoms," said Prof Ansari, while explaining the possible causes for thee trend. "Since treatment of these diseases require regular change in medication, which many could not have been able to get during Covid, there is a possibility that it could have added up to the problem at hand, causing renal failure in several patients," Prof Ansari said. Unfortunately, it is not just outside the urologist’s chamber that these patients are lining up but also the psychologists, who admit getting more patients complaining of urgency in urination and increased frequency. "A group of medical students had visited us with urology problems after doctors at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) referred them. These students were going through urology symptoms because of heightened anxiety and uncertainty in their line of duty with the expected third wave. They were also reliving the time of wearing PPE kits during service wherein they had to hold onto their bladder for long hours," said psychologist Dr Neha Anand. "A 30-year-old male post Covid patient also complained of the same symptoms owing to anxiety caused from the work from home setup," she added. “A 30-year-old male post Covid patient also complained of the same symptoms owing to anxiety caused from the work from home setup,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uro-ailments-worsen-post-covid-infection/articleshow/87691447.cms||Yusra Husain

The district collector said that due to refinery construction, traffic pressure has increased a lot between Pachpadra and Jodhpur, and in such a situation, the transport department and police should set up a permanent check post at the national highway near Pachpadra. Along with interception, vehicles should be deployed on the highway for taking action against speeding vehicles. He directed to put maximum speed limit signboards at the main places on national highways, in which speed limit for cars, buses, trucks etc is mentioned. The collector asked all passenger buses to have an emergency exit and put indicators on them, and directed officials to catch all buses that are running without the emergency exit door. He said that for emergencies, a sharp hammer should be kept so that in case of an accident, the glass can be easily broken. SP Deepak Bhargava said that accident-prone zones should be identified on national and state highways where signboards can be put up and the required technical improvement of the roads should be done. Also, camel carts, bullock carts, tractor trolleys etc should put radium on them and regular campaigns should be run for this. Additional district collector Om Prakash Vishnoi said that an inter-departmental committee has been formed for investigating the bus accident. In the meeting, CEO Mohan Dan Ratnu, additional SP Narpat Singh, district transport officer Sanjeev Choudhary, SE Kapil Verma, JP Suthar were present. Sub division officers at the block level remained connected to the meeting through VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meeting-held-to-avert-barmer-like-tragedy/articleshow/87691022.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid leading to rise in diabetes cases? Doctors try to figure out||NEW DELHI: Sayan Mukherjee, 49, was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 when, to his surprise, tests confirmed he also had diabetes. Mukherjee was, therefore, put on drugs to manage his blood sugar levels. But he is not alone. Dr S K Wangnoo, a senior consultant endocrinologist at Delhi’s Apollo hospital, says data from his OPD shows one out of every four diabetics he has seen over the last two years were diagnosed with the metabolic disease, which causes high blood sugar, while undergoing treatment for Covid-19. It is not yet clear whether the metabolic condition that causes high blood sugar levels was triggered by the coronavirus infection directly or it was diagnosed as a result of thorough testing. However, doctors say, there is going to be a definite rise in diabetes prevalence post-pandemic. “Our hospital is participating in a country-wide study to assess whether Covid-19 has led to a surge in diabetes cases,” Dr Wangnoo said. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body’s systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels, the World Health Organization says. On the brighter side, doctors say, the past few decades have witnessed significant advances in technologies as well as drug discoveries that help to effectively manage the metabolic disorder. According to Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc, new drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepetide help in achieving good weight loss in addition to controlling blood sugar levels. “There are also once a week insulin in the pipeline and new real time monitoring devices,” he said. Dr Sujeet Jha, who heads the endocrinology division at Max healthcare, said research conducted by them also shows that intensive lifestyle intervention delivered by healthcare workers with raised blood sugar levels and waist circumference helped in reducing both weight and waist circumference in one year. Weight-loss surgeries are known to benefit severely obese people who have uncontrolled diabetes. But recent studies show even those with mild obesity– BMI ranging between 30 kg/m2 and 34.9 kg/m2 – and uncontrolled diabetes can benefit from weight loss surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-leading-to-rise-in-diabetes-cases-doctors-try-to-figure-out/articleshow/87691026.cms||---
---||Delhi||AQI a bit better, but Delhi doesn’t get break from its gas chamber||NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to be a gas chamber for the second day in a row. Its air quality remained in the ‘severe’ category despite a slight improvement towards Saturday noon due to supportive weather conditions and drop in farm fire share in the city’s pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityPollution monitoring agencies expect a very slight and temporary relief on Sunday when the city's air quality index (AQI) may reach lower end of ‘severe’ or upper end of ‘very-poor’. According to the weather department, the slight improvement within the severe category on Saturday was a result of increased wind speed. However, the winds are expected to slow down from Sunday evening again, thereby increasing the pollution levels. “The wind speed increased by Saturday afternoon and reached about 12 kmph. This helped in clearing the region and provided some ventilation. The wind speed, however, will drop from Sunday evening leading to increased pollution levels,” said an official at India Meteorological Department. “The humidity may drop slightly tomorrow and the wind speed may remain moderate towards the noon but will drop in the evening. Thus, the relief from pollution may turn out to be temporary,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. The city's AQI spiked to spiked to 471 on Friday, which was worse than a day after Diwali, and improved to 437 on Saturday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. The PM2.5 levels, the major source of pollutant in air, hovered between 354.7 ug/m3 and 252.8 ug/m3. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 ug/m3. The PM10 levels on Saturday fluctuated between 547.9 ug/m3 and 420.2 ug/m3, against a safe limit of 100 ug/m3. Meanwhile, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels were above the dangerous threshold of 300 and 500 microgrammes per cubic metres (ug/m3), respectively, for 36 hours. However, the ‘air emergency’ or ‘severe++’ measures under Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) demand the PM2.5 or PM10 to remain over the threshold for at least 48 hours, under which entry of trucks is barred, odd-even vehicle rationing scheme implemented and construction activity stopped. “There is an urgent need to revisit the GRAP and reduce the waiting time for air emergency from 48 hours to something practical. In the matter of two days, the weather conditions change completely and keep fluctuating. So it is severe today, very-poor tomorrow and severe again. It’s the citizens at the receiving end,” said environmentalist MC Mehta. Following the adverse air pollution situation, the sub-committee of CAQM on GRAP held a meeting on Saturday evening, however, the PM2.5 and PM10 levels had come below the threshold by then. The sub-committee, hence, continued measures under ‘severe’ category that keep the stone crushers, brick kilns, etc, closed; suggest offices to reduce use of private vehicles; and advise citizens to avoid outdoors. The city saw a slight drop in farm fires in neighbouring states from 4,056 on Friday to 3,157 on Saturday, according to SAFAR. The share of stubble burning to the city’s pollution came down from over 21% to 10%. The unfavourable meteorological conditions are likely to prevail for next five days, stated Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-a-bit-better-but-city-doesnt-get-break-from-its-gas-chamber/articleshow/87691463.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Agra||Custodial death: FIR lodged against 'unknown UP policemen' as dad accuses 5 cops in complaint||AGRA: Four days after the death of Mohammad Altaf, 22, in police custody, his father Chand Miyan met the superintendent of police (SP) of Kasganj, Botre Rohan Pramod, to file a complaint on the basis of which an FIR has now been lodged against "unknown policemen" who have been charged with murder under IPC section 302. Miyan has accused five policemen for killing his son. They are station house officer Virendra Singh Indolia, sub-inspector Chandresh Gautam, sub-inspector Vikas Kumar, head moharrir (clerk) Dhanendra Singh, and constable Saurabh Solanki. All five had earlier been suspended for “negligence on duty” after news of Altaf's death in custody spread. Altaf's uncle, who accompanied Miyan to the SP's office, alleged that they were not provided with a copy of the complaint and were told to "go home". "They said that a copy of the FIR will be provided to us soon," he added. Police claimed that the FIR was lodged on the basis of an "earlier complaint received from Altaf's father by post". The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, is dated November 11 and doesn't mention the names of any policeman. “We were not aware of the names of the policemen at the time the first complaint was sent by post,” said Altaf's uncle. The SP explained: "The fresh complaint will be included in the existing FIR. Following an investigation, the names of all the policemen involved in the matter will be added. A special team has been constituted to investigate the case.” Chand Miyan said, “It is now clear that the FIR against my son was registered after his death. If he was found hanging at 2:30 pm, as the police claim, why was he taken to the hospital after 90 minutes? The police proposed a wrong theory about him being depressed and committing suicide to hide their crimes. My son was brutally murdered in police custody. I have filed a police complaint and the SP has assured me that he will take suitable action.” According to the police, Altaf, accused of kidnapping a Hindu girl, was found hanging in the lock-up's bathroom at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead after roughly 15 minutes. The FIR against Altaf says that the case was registered on Tuesday at 4 pm, much later than his time of death. Earlier in the week, a letter with the thumb impression of Chand Miyan went viral on social media. It stated, “My son Altaf committed suicide when he was taken by the police for questioning in a case. He was depressed. The police took him to the hospital but he died there. I don’t have any complaints against the police, nor do my family or I want any investigation in the matter.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said he was "detained" at the Goraha police outpost after the death of his son. “The police made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by policemen. I was asked to give a thumb impression and was told that if I don't do it, the dead body of my son will not be handed over to me and I will not be allowed to leave. I had no idea what was written in it,” the complaint said. “I was pressured to put a thumb impression on the letter.” Miyan's complaint says Altaf's height was more than 5.5 feet. However, the FIR says that his height was "around 5 feet.” The police had earlier claimed that Altaf had “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket attached to a tap in the washroom." The tap was less than 3 feet in height. Azad Samaj Party (ASP) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who had accompanied the family along with a delegation of local leaders to file the complaint, said, “The case was registered after Altaf's father met the SP and handed over a fresh complaint letter. Not naming the accused policemen is highly condemnable." On the basis of a complaint by a Rampur-based RTI activist, Danish Khan, the National Human Rights Commission has registered a complaint into the custodial death. Taking suo motu cognizance, the National Commission for Minorities has also issued a notice to the UP government and state police chief, seeking a detailed response on the death of Altaf at the Sadar Kotwali Police Station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fir-lodged-against-unknown-policemen-as-dad-accuses-5-cops-in-complaint/articleshow/87690504.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Lucknow||Lucknow firm to make parts for Rafale, BAE, Safran||LUCKNOW: Located some 25 km away from the heart of the city, Precision Tools & Castings (PTC Industries), with its 150 engineers and advance army of robots has been silently manufacturing high quality engineering components for various critical and supercritical applications for advance world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile Brahmos missile, ISRO rockets. Now its subsidiary Aerolloy Technologies Limited will develop components for multi-role fighter jets like Rafale , nuclear submarines under advanced technology vessel project, ultra-light howitzers gun and others. Focused on import substitution since 1963 and exporting to nearly 20 countries for over 35 years, in 2017 PTC set up a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility called the Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Centre (AMTC) in Lucknow with an investment of over Rs 250 crore. Under the AMTC campus, on Saturday defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the PTC’s subsidiary and laid the foundation stone for an integrated metal manufacturing facility that will produce key raw materials in titanium and other exotic Alloys for aerospace applications. This facility houses the most advanced manufacturing technologies such as Replicast, Rapidcast, Forgecast, Titanium casting with the latest machineries and a high level of robot-assisted automation for manufacture of metal components and sub-systems. Speaking to TOI, the chairperson and MD of PTC, Sachin Agarwal said, “We are among less than half a dozen manufacturers in the world who have developed indigenous capabilities to manufacture super-critical metal components, subsystems in Titanium, super nickel alloys and other exotic materials which were earlier inaccessible to India for defense and aero-space.” “If the country has to surpass its rivals and develop a strong economy, manufacturing is the key to it. We manufacture components for BrahMos missile, ISRO rockets, and other systems but now will move into production of components for Rafale jet engines, ATVP nuclear submarines, BAE systems, strategy systems for Safran, Honeywell, helicopter engines, drones and US howitzer ultra-light guns. The UP government understands how important manufacturing is for economic growth and is creating an ecosystem to nurture industries like us in a dedicated defence corridor program,” he said. PTC exports 75% products to foreign firms like Rolls Royce, Siemens, GE, Alstom and Emerson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-firm-to-make-parts-for-rafale-bae-safran/articleshow/87691477.cms||Arvind Chauhan

In her police complaint, Konica Sharma, a resident of Pragati Vihar, Pinjore, said that on November 23, 2019, she got married to Atul Sharma, a resident of Abdullapur, Pinjore. She said her father spent Rs 25 lakh on the wedding and dowry. However, she said that soon after the marriage, her in-laws asked her to get a split AC instead of the window AC she got as dowry. Her father got it replaced. Later, she said her husband and in-laws allegedly started demanding a car worth Rs 18 lakh. When she refused to bring more dowry, they allegedly beat her up. She said a compromise was reached when she told her parents but the harassment resumed after a few months. She said her husband also took her mobile phone away but she managed to escape and reach her parental house. Her father took her to hospital but soon, another compromise was struck.

Cinemas and multiplexes were also permitted to operate at 100% seating capacity. As Covid cases have been on the lower side for the past several weeks now, the government asked residential universities to prepare a schedule for students to return to campuses in phases. The state, however, stopped short of lifting the lockdown and extended it by a fortnight till November 28. Cinema owners welcomed the move, saying it would help them tide over the losses incurred during the two subsequent lockdowns. “We are happy with the government’s decision. We are hoping to make some profits this month as there are a few big movies lined up now,” said Sanjay Barjatya, the regional head of Miraj Cinemas. Owners of restaurants are still waiting for corporate houses to call employees to offices.For social gatherings, however, the cap stays. In indoor areas, no more than 200 people would be allowed at a time.

With the region witnessing a dip in Covid-19 cases, the college campuses are abuzz with activities that students missed out on for a long time due to the pandemic. It was either held virtually or cancelled altogether in most campuses. Rajesh Chowta, chairman, Mangalore Institute of Technology and Engineering (MITE), Moodabidri, said that those students who are now in their final year of engineering have attended on-campus classes for only one-and-a-half years. “They have not witnessed college life as others have experienced it. Therefore, the college has planned to conduct all inter-department competitions, including the institution’s biggest cultural programme—Sentia Award Nite—that is usually held in March,” he said. “We may not plan an inter –collegiate festival, since we are not sure if the colleges from other districts and states would come to our campus due to Covid-19,” he said, adding that groundwork for next year’s events have already begun. The demand to start these activities have come from students in a majority of the colleges. Spokesperson of St Joseph Engineering College, Sathyendra Bhat J, said, “Only academics is not enough for students. They requested us to hold all events that were planned in a virtual mode, on campus instead. Due to the pandemic, they have missed the chance to showcase their non-academic talent. The virtual events had made no impact, and were not interesting as the on-campus ones,” said Bhat. On Saturday, the campus held a day-long Milan-2021, an inter-class cultural event. The last Milan fest was held in 2019. “We will resume all other activities which were halted,” he said. The students who were taking online classes are participating more actively in these extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, compared to the days before the pandemic, said St Aloysius PU College principal Fr Clifford Sequeira. “The institution had shifted all the activities, including academics, online. However, from this academic year, we will have them offline. We will also organise the annual sports day and inter-collegiate fest ‘PreUnique’ this year,” he said. “I had imagined that my PU college days would end without getting a stage to showcase my talent. I am happy to be able to spend a few months on campus,” said Fevin D’Souza, a II PU student and budding vocalist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/college-campuses-abuzz-with-co-curricular-activities/articleshow/87689720.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Kolkata||Most parents agree to send kids to school, some wait & watch||Kolkata: Barring a few schools where parents are still taking time to make up their minds, in most others a large number of parents has already consented to sending their children to school on Tuesday. In some cases, 100% consent has come in already. Those that are yet to get satisfactory response from parents are extending the deadline to take last-minute calls. Most schools are keeping the hybrid option open so that children of unwilling parents can stay home and attend online classes and the syllabus doesn’t suffer. Heritage School is among those where almost all parents have consented, not only for the board years but also for classes IX and XI and hence the term exam in this school, starting later this month, will be conducted only in the offline mode. There will be no option for online exam. If a child is sick or there is a genuine reason for absence, they will be allowed to write the test at a later date but that has to be from school, said principal Seema Sapru. South City International School is another one where almost all parents have given consent, said principal John Bagul. “We are starting out with some mock practice tests on OMR sheets for the board year students when school reopens on Tuesday,” he added. Some schools like Rammohan Mission and DPS Ruby Park have just announced the re-opening and did not seek consent letters. In the parent-teacher meetings, however, parents have said that they were in favour of sending children back to school as the online classes have exhausted their utility. “More than 80% parents have said that they were sending their wards back. We did not seek consent because we are reopening by government order, expecting kids to come back. By sending their children to us, they are automatically giving consent,” reasoned Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohan Mission. La Martiniere for Boys School, which is re-opening with classes IX and XI first, not wishing to disturb the board year students, has managed to get consent only from one fourth of the parents. “We have kept the classes hybrid so that no one misses out. I believe that initially parents are apprehensive but gradually the ice will melt,” said acting principal John Stephen. One reason why many parents are reluctant is because children of classes IX and XI will stop coming to school and will go back to online classes when the board exams begin on November 22 for ISC and November 29 for ICSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-parents-agree-to-send-kids-to-school-some-wait-watch/articleshow/87690538.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Villagers of 2 panchayats cast vote to ban liquor||JAIPUR: Two Panchayats, Barar and Weir, have become the fourth and fifth in Rajsamand district to vote for the removal of a liquor shop in the village on Saturday. The voting for the removal took place under the relevant sections of the Rajasthan Excise Act following the movement by the village women since 2015. The voting started at 8am till 5pm saw 64% voting mostly by the women sealed the fate of the sale of liquor in the village. The minimum votes required is 51% of the total registered 5,632 voters. The enthusiasm level in both the panchayats was far high than assembly and legislative polls as women came out in hordes singing and dancing till late in the evening. Sarpanch of Barar, Pankaja Singh along with a group of women ran from one house to another calling women to vote throughout the day. “Our village men are addicted to liquor in high numbers is a reason that women and children in every second household suffer from domestic violence. The addiction has increased the poverty in the village as the men were selling ornaments, land and movable articles to pay for the liquor,” said Singh who recalled that in 2015 for the first time she gave the representation to local administration against the removal of the shop. The pre-condition for the polls is that 20% of the voters must agree to vote by signing a petition. In 2017, the movement received a setback when the village didn’t qualify for the voting as less than 20% of the villagers agree to go for votes. The campaign again intensified in 2019 and the village qualified for the voting in 2021 along with Wier. Arvind Poswal, the district collector of Rajsamand, says, “The application for the voting was seriously pursued by us even after the failure in the first attempt. I gave credit to the resolve of women who have never given up for the past five years.” He informed that this is the fourth village in the district and assured that if his office will come across any such application will be proceeded immediately. Pooja Bharti Chhabra, national president of Sharabbandi Andolan, the provision of removal of a liquor shop in panchayat and ward wise was injected in 2013 in Rajasthan Excise Act by the Gehlot government. “So far, seven panchayats have exercised the special right including five in panchayats, Kachabali, Mandawar, Thaneta, Barar and Wier (Rajsamand), Rozda gram panchayat in Jaipur Rural and Foga gram panchayat in Churu,” said Chhabra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villagers-of-2-panchayats-cast-vote-to-ban-liquor/articleshow/87691043.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Return-to-school plans hit uniform-size hurdle||KOLKATA: Ankita Mukherjee was relieved hearing about the reopening of schools from November 16 as her son, who is in the Xth standard, was growing increasingly restless and had started showing disinterest in other activities. But she was in a for a shock when she discovered he had outgrown his uniform. This is not a one-off case. Several parents are faced with this dilemma where their children have outgrown their uniforms and shoes in the last 20 months since schools and colleges shut down in March 2020. Lack of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and binge eating induced by boredom along with natural growth in mid-teens have meant that many students in the higher classes have outgrown their uniforms. Parents are scrambling to purchase new uniform, blazers, pullovers and shoes at the last moment as none of the schools has said that students can attend classes in casuals. “It did not cross my mind earlier but earlier this week, when I took out my son’s uniform from the closet, I realised he will not fit into it. My fears came true when I made him wear it,” said Mukherjee, a resident of Maniktala. Ankit Pachisia will have to purchase a pair of school shoes and a pair of sports shoes for school. “A couple of days ago, I took out my shoes to polish them and tried wearing them. I realised that they were not fitting me anymore. I wore school shoes after almost 20 months,” said Pachisia. Parents are faced with another dilemma. By the time November starts, most schools shift to winter uniforms with full sleeves and blazers. But this time, schools have not mentioned anything yet about students wearing winter uniforms though morning chill has already set in. “So we are not sure if we should buy the winter uniform or not,” said Sunita Banerjee Sarkar, whose son studies in a school off the EM Bypass. Parents will also have to purchase some spare sets of uniforms due to the pandemic. “If there are three or four sets of uniforms, it will be easier to wash and sanitise them,”said another parent. Schools say they are as much in the dark as the parents about how the situation will unfold in the coming few days. “Everything depends on how the Covid situation is in the next few weeks. Earlier this year, too, we,tried reopening, but the second wave undid all the plans. If we tell parents to buy new uniforms and schools have to be shut again after a few days, students will outgrow even the new uniforms. So, at this juncture, it is meaningless to say anything about uniforms,” said the principal of a central Kolkata school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/return-to-school-plans-hit-uniform-size-hurdle/articleshow/87690541.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In the meantime, two youths on camels came rushing into the Indian border from Pakistan side and tried to throw something tied with stones. The BSF jawans, giving warning, tried to catch them but they ran back to Pakistan. BSF registered strict protest to Pakistan and handed over a protest note, and the two youths caught near the Indian border were handed over to Beenjraad police. Continuous efforts are being made to push heroin consignments across the border adjoining Barmer. But an alert BSF is foiling their efforts. According to information from official sources in BSF, the alert jawans saw two suspicious looking shepherds going towards the fencing at the international border at BKD bop of the 50th battalion in Beenjraad police station area. The BSF caught them but they could not give any satisfactory reply. In the inquiry, they said that they came near the fencing while grazing goats. They told their names to be Awas Khan (25) and Idrish Khan (20), residents of Hasam Khan ki Dhani. BSF held a flag meeting with Pakistan rangers and gave a strict protest note.

The incident came to the notice on Saturday morning only after villagers saw the broken shutter of the ATM. According to police, the information was received on Saturday that the shutter of an ATM of the Bank of India was broken. The looters used a heavy iron rod to lift the shutter of the ATM and broke into it. “When we reached there and entered the ATM after lifting the shutter, it was found to be damaged badly,” said the police. According to bank officials, Rs 25.75 lakh were stacked in the ATM before the loot and the looters decamped with the entire amount. Though the police have started the investigation into the matter, the preliminary investigation has revealed that there were four persons involved in the heist, which was executed sometime late Friday night. According to the information, an unsuccessful bid to loot the same ATM had been reported about six months back. But inspite of that, the bank officials have not put in adequate security measures to safeguard the ATM. As a safety measure, however, they kept the ATM shut at night, possibly to avert repeat of any such incident but even this could not save the ATM from this big loot. The incident took place three days after two unidentified robbers looted Rs 12 lakh from a rural branch of SBI in Gangani village near Jodhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/miscreants-loot-rs-26l-from-atm-near-jodhpur/articleshow/87691047.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Pvt schools look at new ways to keep students engaged in online classes||Kolkata: Although the state school education department is planning to distribute Foundational Numeracy and Literacy (FLN) material among students of junior classes to fill up gaps in learning that may have occurred due to inadequacies of the online method, some city private schools are applying various methods on their own and experimenting to make the teaching-learning process more attractive for young students who may have to continue online classes for several more months. Private schools started online classes immediately after the Covid outbreak. Over the last two years, several disadvantages of online learning, like loss of patience, lack of concentration, spelling mistakes, bad handwriting, reduction in attention span and frequent numerical errors, have been observed by the schools. Rumki Chakraborty, mathematics teacher at a private school, said, “Students have turned restless because they are unable to share their emotions. So, I try to make them share everything with me. Many students have lost interest in mathematics because they are unable to understand properly through the online mode. I have started using entry-exit numeric passes, which actually works to enhance their number knowledge.” Some private school teachers are trying to relate day-to-day life and events with studies. “I asked students to draw rangoli on Diwali, through which they learnt about shapes without unnecessary stress. Sometimes, I ask them to make audio-visual presentations on a particular topic and I have noticed that it really works,” Chakraborty said. North Point Senior Secondary Boarding School is applying Social Emotional Learning or SEL. Director of the school Rita Chatterjee said, “Despite the content of the syllabus, it is more important whether the child is enjoying it or not. Teachers are using various methods. It is important to keep the writing habit, so teachers are instructed to get kids to write regularly.” It has been noticed in some schools that many students are not focusing on the languages, while others have lost the reading habit. Poor handwriting and spelling mistakes are also more frequent. Prapti Bhar, English teacher at a private school, said, “While initially happy to be home, children started missing the school environment within two-three months. So, we try to make the whole learning atmosphere as happy as possible. We have slashed the syllabus and have tried to include activity-based learning. We applied the ‘Dream Journal’ method, where students write about their dreams and read it out in class.” Debjani Das Roy, another language teacher, said, “We noticed that during tests, students get help from parents or the internet. So, we have started giving 50% focus on picture composition, 25% on grammar and 25% on audio-visual presentation.” Most teachers believe schools should be opened for all classes as early as possible. Rekha Baishya, academic director of Salt Lake Shiksha Niketan, said, “We are applying methods to make online learning joyful, but nothing can replace physical classes.” The result of the National Achievement Survey will help find out the loopholes in the teaching-learning method of the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-schools-look-at-new-ways-to-keep-students-engaged-in-online-classes/articleshow/87690545.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Jailed in S Arabia for FB post: Kin approaches MEA for help||Mangaluru: A woman from the city has sought the intervention of the external affairs ministry for the release of her husband, who has been languishing in a jail in Saudi Arabia for nearly 20 months, in connection with a blasphemous social media post. Kavitha, a resident of Barnakatte in the city, said that her husband Shailesh Kottari,52, has been falsely implicated in connection with a Facebook post against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia. The mother of two, Kavitha said that Shailesh was not aware of the Facebook post, which was allegedly shared by miscreants using a fake profile created in his name. Jithendra Kottari, social worker and a BJP leader, told TOI that the issue has already been communicated with Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel. “Shailesh, who was working for a private company in the hospitality sector in Saudi Arabia for the past 20 years, had deleted his Facebook account after he got threat calls for sharing posts in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Indian government. Later, he was shocked to find a FB page in his name on January 23 last year. Posts against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia were shared on the fake page, which was created using his name and picture. Soon, he brought the issue to the notice of his employer, who suggested that he file a complaint. When he went to the police to file a complaint on February 16, he was arrested and a case was booked against him,” he said. MP Kateel has already sent a request to the ministry of external affairs. “In this particular case, only the central government can help the family since Shailesh has been booked for social media posts against Islam and the king of Saudi Arabia. We have decided to bring the issue to the notice of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. We have planned to meet the external affairs minister on November 19 through our MP. Many NRIs and Kannada Sanghas from Dakshina Kannada in Saudi Arabia have contacted us and offered their help,” he added. Kavitha said that they did not allow her husband to make calls to her. “The authorities in Saudi Arabia take him to court regularly, but are not giving any information,” she added. In a similar incident, Harish Bangera, a resident of Goyadibettu in Beejadi village, Kundapur, an air-conditioning technician for a company in Dammam, was arrested for allegedly posting derogatory messages on Facebook against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and a community. He was released in August this year. Several organisations and people’s representatives had worked for his release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/jailed-in-s-arabia-for-fb-post-kin-approaches-mea-for-help/articleshow/87689743.cms||---

A high-level meeting was conducted by the chief secretary to contain the spike. An official present said that the emphasis is on ensuring the best possible monitoring for the next fortnight. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health), told TOI that testing will be increased manyfold. “Before Diwali, about 50,000-70,000 tests were conducted, which came down to about 35,000 during Diwali. We instructed all cities and districts to ramp up testing by setting up kiosks, mobile testing vans and to pay special attention to those entering at bus depots, railway stations, airports and district or state borders,” he said. Aggarwal asked municipal commissioners and collectors to send medical teams to tourist destinations and places with high footfalls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cities-districts-directed-to-screen-all-on-entry/articleshow/87690556.cms||---

---||Pune||Mixing with peers helps in kids’ development: Experts||Pune: With some normalcy into play, children are glad to be able to visit parks, go for movies and be allowed at restaurants. Even so, there are missing out on many activities that are important for their all-round development. Punam Vasudevan, a mother of a six-year-old, said, “My son plays in our housing society with children most of whom are much older to him. I feel he is missing out on the experience of being treated as an equal among peers.” Rahul Agarwal, a father of a five-year-old, said, “I enrolled my daughter for tuition so that she could physically interact and socialise with children of her own age. Her confidence has since gone up. She is learning to be more independent, and there is a sense of healthy competition among her peers when it comes to schoolwork, which she was missing out on when she was only attending online classes at home.” While on-ground classes have resumed for senior students, educators and parents believe that pre-primary students might not be called back to school before next year. The lack of a classroom environment for almost two school years has already affected their social development. “For pre-primary children, a classroom provides an environment for forming bonds, making friends, learning discipline and responsibility, which cannot be taught at home under the supervision of a parent. Things like taking care of one’s belonging, taking out notebooks and pencils for work and putting them back, eating tiffin, going to the toilet by themselves etc are learnt in a school environment. But while we wait for in-school classes to resume for the little ones, parents can help in the development of their independence by giving them simple household chores to do such as keeping the groceries and vegetables by at home, keeping their plate in the kitchen sink after eating etc. This will give them a sense of responsibility,” said Moumita Sarkar, a special educator. Child psychologist Nilanjana Singh said, “Being among peers helps children build their personality. Peer relationships are crucial for development of their emotional, ethical and moral development as well as cognitive and problem-solving skills. Some parents have formed play groups. They bring children from the same class to a playground, park or a common area where they can meet and play, instead of just seeing each other on screen during online classes.” Nelson Fernandez, a pre-primary teacher, has noticed that the classroom environment allows students to make mistakes and learn from them while at home they are assisted by parents to submit perfect assignments, which hinders their evaluation and education. “Parents often help their children complete the worksheets and assignment without realising that we do not expect it to be perfect. We want them to do the work and learn from their mistakes. It makes it difficult for teachers to evaluate how much the student has learnt, where they are lacking, and need help.” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mixing-with-peers-helps-in-kids-development-experts/articleshow/87690559.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The person had purchased a gold coin at a shop in the Gandhi Peth area of Chinchwad on Friday afternoon. “While paying the bill, he showed a fake message to the cashier that he had made the payment using a mobile app. Later, the cashier realised that the person had not paid the bill worth Rs 25,350,” said sub-inspector A Ranavare of the Chinchwad police. The police found the person had used a similar modus operandi for cheating two other shopkeepers in the last few days in Pimpri Chinchwad. “The person is around 38 years old. He comes on a bike and visits jewellery shops under the pretext of buying gold. He creates a message showing details of the payment with date and account number,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jeweller-duped-of-rs-25350-in-chinchwad/articleshow/87690551.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Despite SC directive, security yet to be provided to key witnesses||BAREILLY: Farmers, who are witnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that took place on October 3, have alleged that they have not been given security cover, despite the Supreme Court (SC) directing the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to witnesses in the high-profile case, in which Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish is the main accused. UP police have provided security cover to nearly 100 witnesses as well as to the families of the deceased. However, farmers from Uttarakhand alleged they have not been given any protection yet. Tejinder Singh Virk, farmer leader from Uttarakhand, who sustained a deep head injury and backbone fracture after being hit by Ashish Mishra’s convoy, said that he along with other farmers who are witnesses in the case, was nearly killed but they are yet to get police security despite the SC direction. He added that he has sent applications to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the President of India with a request to provide protection. A member of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the matter said that they are writing to the Uttarakhand police to provide security cover to the farmers. When queried, Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said that he has “no information yet on any security cover to be provided to farmers who are witnesses in the Kheri case.” Meanwhile, Virk said that he was called to Kheri from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand on Thursday and made to sit for almost seven hours without being produced in court. Three other farmers from Uttarakhand accompanying Virk, Gurjeet Singh, Harpal Singh, and Hardeep Singh, who are survivors of the violence and witnesses in the case, were also made to wait for several hours and their statements not recorded in court either, he alleged. Harjeet Singh, the farmers' counsel termed this as “deliberate harassment of key witnesses.” Virk told TOI, “After coordinating with the SIT members, it was decided that our statement will be recorded in court on November 11. I was in the hospital for nearly a month and have had head surgery so it is not possible to travel easily. I somehow reached on time but was made to sit for several hours along with three other farmers who had also sustained injuries earlier." Virk claimed that the SIT officials initially told him that they don't “have anyone to take him to court.” He says he was taken to the court later, but the officials took him back before he could enter the premises, saying that "the magistrate is not there." SIT counsel and special prosecution officer, S P Yadav, when asked about the issue, said, “I was there in court on November 11 and the magistrate was also present but the three farmers were not produced to record their statement. I am not sure why that happened."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-despite-sc-directive-security-yet-to-be-provided-to-key-witnesses/articleshow/87690550.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Varanasi||At Rajbhasha meet in Kashi, Amit Shah invokes Savarkar||VARANASI: Invoking Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the Hindu nationalist ideologue, activist and writer, here on Saturday to put across his views on Hindi, Union home Minister Amit Shah said he (Savarkar) enriched Hindi by inducting many words in his ‘Hindi Shabdkosh’. Shah was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan, organised by the Rajbhasha department of the home ministry at the Trade Facilitation Centre, Bada Lalpur. Citing the example of Savarkar, Shah said, “Agar Veer Savarkar Ji na hote to shayad hum Angrezi shabdon ka hi prayog kar rahe hote (had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only),” said Shah, adding that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary, and introduced many new words. The time has come to make Hindi flexible for the wide acceptance of people,” Shah added. Shah said that the country which loses its ‘swabhasha’ (native language), also loses its original thinking and culture. The original thinking can only come from native or the mother tongue, he added. Shah said that Gandhiji converted the freedom movement into a people’s movement with three pillars: Swaraj, Swadeshi and Swabhasha. “Swaraj was achieved, but Swadeshi and Swabhasha were left behind,” he said, adding that the government has set a target to establish the glory of Swabhasha and Swadeshi in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ (next 25-years of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav) when the country will celebrate its 100th Independence Day. Shah said that the Central government has given special emphasis to Rajbhasha under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “One of the main points of the new education policy is the promotion of native languages. The new change that the Prime Minister has made will change the future of India,” he said, adding, “For the first time since independence, the convention of Rajbhasha has been taken out of Delhi and organised in Kashi, which immensely contributed for the enrichment of Hindi.” “I am a Gujarati and speak in my native language, but I love Hindi more than Gujarati. We need to strengthen our Rajbhasha,” said Shah, adding, “There is no conflict between Hindi (Rajbhasha) and local languages, rather they are complementary to each other.” Rajbhasha can prosper only when the local languages are protected. It is the responsibility of the Rajbhasha department to promote and protect the local languages, he added. Shah also made an appeal to all guardians to talk to their children in their own native language. “It does not matter in which medium they are studying, talk to them in native language in your home in order to increase their confidence levels, so that they have no hesitation in speaking their own mother tongue,” Shah said adding that speaking in native language would not only benefit the language, but also benefit the children because original thinking could only result from native language. “Attempts were made in the past to spark controversies on Hindi language, but now it is over,” said Shah, adding, “There used to be a time when we were afraid, but a new era has started when we would be proud. This transformation of fear to feel pride and honour has been a huge achievement of Narendra Modi’s administration.” “We have set a goal to promote Rajbhasha and local languages in the fields of education, administration, judicial work, technical work, communication and entertainment,” he said and made an appeal to all to create a conducive atmosphere in the country for this purpose. The event was also addressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/in-rajbhasha-meet-shah-invokes-veer-savarkar/articleshow/87691490.cms||---

A simultaneous and sharp rise in the prevalence of diabetes-related preventable vision loss has also been observed. It is estimated that around 1.1 crore people suffer from retinal disorders in India. Alarmingly, about one in every three persons living with diabetes has some degree of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetes-related complication that affects the eyes. The young population suffering from juvenile diabetes, (Type 1 diabetes) is vulnerable to diabetic retinopathy, especially if they have had diabetes for over 10 years. Even people suffering from Type-2 diabetes are at risk of losing their eyesight due to the onset of diabetes-related retinal diseases. Dr Vishali Gupta, professor, Vitreoretinal and Uvea Advanced Eye Centre, PGI said, “In India, the burden of retinal diseases is on the rise. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), for instance, mainly affects the working age population of 35 to 45-year-olds, causing distorted vision. However, DME onset can be significantly delayed if diabetics effectively control their diabetes and blood sugar levels,” she said. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY: The young population suffering from juvenile diabetes, (Type 1 diabetes) is vulnerable to diabetic retinopathy, especially if they have had diabetes for over 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/burden-of-retinal-diseases-caused-by-diabetes-on-the-rise-pgi-doc/articleshow/87690561.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Of the five active patients in the district, two patients are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Igatpuri and two in Malegaon and one in Nashik city.According to the data shared by the state health department, the five districts of north Maharashtra — Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar — have 32 active cases.The total number of active cases in these five districts was 51 during the second week of October. Nashik (23) had the most number of active cases, followed by Nandurbar (14), Ahmednagar (13), Jalgaon (1) and Dhule continued to have no active mucormycosis cases. Dr Sanjay Gangurde, the Nashik district coordinator for mucormycosis and ENT surgeon of Nashik civil hospital, told TOI that active mucormycosis cases are fast declining in the district. “At one point in time, we had around 450 active cases in Nashik. And there was a huge demand for the injection to treat patients suffering from this ailment. But things are under control,” he said. According to him, district collector Suraj Mandhare and district civil surgeon, Dr Ashok Thorat guided the panel set up by the administration to deal with the mucormycosis cases. Nashik had registered 782 mucormycosis cases in the last few months and 84 patients had succumbed due to the infection. About 511 surgeries were performed for removal of eyes, nasal portion etc. “Cases of Covid are declining due to which cases of mucormycosis are also dropping. But more important measures for treating Covid patients like judicious use of steroids and medical oxygen to treat patients have played an important role in reducing mucormycosis cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5-active-cases-of-mucormycosis-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/87689764.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The move came in the wake of a PIL by a Delhi-based lawyer seeking directions for “prior intimation of leave by judicial officers intending to take leave, as is done by the judges of the high court.” The court had then said necessary directions would be passed on the administrative side.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mark-leave-in-advance-hc-to-dist-court-judges/articleshow/87691065.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police on Saturday said the case had been taken under the Case Officer’s Scheme and they would request the court for a speedy trial. On October 5, headmaster Keshav Yadav raped the girl studying in class 7. The girl initially kept mum and later informed her family members who approached the child welfare committee through child helpline on October 13. Thereafter, an FIR was lodged on October 14 at Singhana police station. On October 16, Singhana police in Jhunjhunu arrested Yadav, which was followed by the arrests of two women teachers including Sunila and Sumitra, who allegedly exerted pressure on the girl and her family to keep the case under the wraps. As per the chargesheet filed by Singhana police, Yadav has been charged with Sections 376(2)(H) which deals with punishment of sexual assault of child below 16 years, 354(outraging the modesty) and 506(criminal intimidation) of IPC and sections 5,6,9,10,12 of POCSO Act and also against 67-A of IT Act. On the other hand, the two woman teachers, who are co-accused in the case, were charged with Section 201(Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and Sections 16,17, and 18 of POCSO Act. “Both the teachers had deleted the vulgar messages sent by the main accused,” said an officer. Senior police officers said the case had already been taken under the Case Officer’s Scheme. “We have dedicated an officer who would appear in the day-to-day hearings of the case and we would also request the court for speedy trial,” said a senior police officer. The court has fixed November 16 as next date of hearing in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-file-chargesheet-against-headmaster-for-raping-11-year-old-girl/articleshow/87691061.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Corona warrior’s death: Gujarat HC moved for Rs 25 lakh compensation||AHMEDABAD: A woman has approached the Gujarat high court after she was not given Rs 25 lakh compensation by the state government after her husband, who was a primary school principal and worked as a corona warrior in Covid-19 duties assigned by the authorities, died and the hospitals did not clearly mention the cause of death in his death certificate. After preliminary hearing, Justice Sangeeta Vishen issued notice to the authorities seeking their replies on why cause of death was not mentioned in the death certificate. The court has also asked the Botad district panchayat education department to place on record its decision taken over the widow’s request for compensation for the death of the corona warrior. The case involved Manishaben Bhavnagariya (34), whose husband Dineshbhai was posted a principal in a primary school at Sarva village of Botad district since December 2019. Bhavnagariya has submitted that her husband had to undertake various Covid duties following different notifications issued by the higher authorities. Those circulars named primary teachers as corona warriors and her husband’s name also figured in the list. “After working as corona warrior and serving Covid-19 duty to the government and citizens for so many months, subsequently he started showing symptoms of Covid-19 himself. He was clinically diagnosed and his treatment was done as a corona patient,” the petition reads. The principal passed away on September 13, 2020 after few days of hospitalisation in Sir Takhtasinhji General Hospital at Bhavnagar. The petitioner submitted that her husband was cremated at Gorad crematorium and the fees charged by the Smashan Samiti were also for corona death. He was treated for Covid and his last rites also took place according to the guidelines for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients. The hospitalisation, treatment and finally the handling of the dead body revealed that it was a covid death. However, the hospital mentioned in its certificate that it cannot accord a specific opinion of whether he died due to Covid-19 or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-warriors-death-hc-moved-for-rs-25l-compensation/articleshow/87690568.cms||---

Walking barefoot to receive one of India’s highest civilian honours from President Ram Nath Kovind last week, Padma Shri Harekala Hajabba and Padma Shri Tulasi Gouda stood out among all the awardees and won a million hearts. On Saturday Tulasi aka ‘Vruksha Mathe’ called on Hajabba known as ‘Akshara Santha’ (Saint of Letters) at his house on the outskirts of Mangaluru. Tulasi, her daughter-in-law Venkamma and grandchildren, Shekhar and Hema, visited Hajabba and had breakfast at his house. The orange vendor and his family honoured the green warrior from Honnali village in Uttara Kannada district. Hajabba said that though the two wanted to meet each other during the award ceremony in the national capital it was not possible. “I am happy that Tulasi Gouda has visited this poor man’s house. I consider this as great honour in my life. I could not meet her at the airport either,” Hajabba said. On her part the 72-year-old Tulasi said she intends to support Hajabba in his dream. “ I will extend my support for the development of Hajabba’s school. He should contribute more for society and people must support him in his dreams,” she said. Later, Tulasi was accorded a warm welcome by students and staff of Hajabba’s school. They took her in a procession from his house to the school. Both the Padma awardees were honoured by the students and teachers. Tulasi also interacted with the children much to their delight. She held students in her thrall with her innate knowledge of plants and how she gained it while working alongside her mother from when she was just 12 years old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/barefoot-warriors-catch-up-overbreakfast-at-hajabbas-house/articleshow/87689772.cms||---
---||World||Booster dose is a scandal, must stop now: WHO||At a time when the discourse on booster shot of Covid vaccines has commenced in many countries, including India, the WHO called distribution of booster doses “a scandal that must stop now”. In August, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a global moratorium on boosters that he later extended until the end of the year. But, countries such as Germany, Israel, Canada and US have gone ahead with booster schemes. “It makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults or to vaccinate kids, when health workers, older people and other high risk groups around the world are still waiting for their first dose,” Tedros said as he condemned stockpiling and administration of booster shots. Countries with highest vaccination coverage are stockpiling more vaccines, whereas low-income nations are struggling to get even the first dose for their population. “Everyday there are six times more boosters administered globally than primary doses in low-income countries,” Tedros said. In India, while the government is yet to take a call on booster doses and is focused on ramping up coverage of first and second doses, many states and health experts have started advocating in favour of booster doses, mainly for health workers and elderly who were prioritised to receive the vaccine. WHO officials underlined unequal distribution of jabs can pose risks not only to countries with low vaccination coverage but also to others as economies are opening up, restrictions are being lifted and travel has begun. Noting that over 100 countries are still short of vaccinating even 40% of their population with first dose of the vaccine, the WHO said an additional 550 million doses are required to achieve the target of vaccinating at least 40% of the population of every country by end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/booster-dose-is-a-scandal-must-stop-now-who/articleshow/87692161.cms||Sushmi Dey

It is the fourth such case being reported in the district in the past three months. Incidentally, all other cases were also reported under the rural police district. On August 31, a woman was gruesomely murdered by her estranged husband on a public road by slitting her throat near Pothencode. Suspicion of infidelity was what led to the crime. On August 26, a woman was killed by her husband at home during a domestic dispute. Relatives revealed that quarrels were common between the couple. On August 20, a woman was killed by her husband at Edava during a quarrel. Speaking to TOI, rural district police chief superintendent P K Madhu said that this undesirable trend has come to his notice. “For now, all we can do is to urge the woman to seek help as soon as they sense danger. We have a women's cell that provides counsellors’ service to hear their problems and provide legal guidance,” the SP said, adding that in all these cases, the couple had a history of breaking into quarrels at home, which could be a sign of impending danger. The circumstances that lead to the murder at Palode were also no different. “Unfortunately, many refrain from reporting domestic abuse or seeking help from family, which results in their plight going unnoticed,” P K Madhu said. With the threat of Covid still remaining, the several community related activities of the police are yet to get back to full swing as their primary goal still now is enforcing Covid protocols. There are schemes under Janamaithri community policing initiative which involve officers visiting neighbourhoods and even households and interacting with individuals to learn about their problems. The department is devising plans to relaunch those schemes with improved efficiency. “We believe that many domestic issues can be addressed through good community policing initiatives,” the SP said. Meanwhile on Friday, the Palode police received a letter, apparently written by Abduk Rahim, in which he mentioned that he suspected his wife of infidelity which provoked him to commit the crime. The letter was addressed to the inspector of Palode police station and it arrived on post. “The date on the latter indicates that it was posted a day ago. Which means he posted it while escaping from the house after committing the crime,” Palode inspector C K Manoj said. The police on Friday searched the city for the suspect. This was after they received surveillance camera footage suggesting his presence in the city. His last known location, as per the footage received, was Karamana. Rural SP P K Madhu said that the suspect has made some scandalous allegations against his wife, which the police have not taken into face value. The primary focus of the police is to nab the suspect and bring him before the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cases-of-domestic-violence-homicides-rising-in-district/articleshow/87674024.cms||---

The cadets were on a seven-day midterm break and had gone to their hometowns. On their return, as per the prevailing procedure, they were isolated for three to four days and then tested positive. The infected cadets have been admitted to the Bytco hospital, run by Nashik Municipal Corporation, on Nashik Road. Medical superintendent of the hospital Jeetendra Dhaneshwar confirmed that 22 cadets have been admitted to the Bytco hospital. The official said the cadets were all asymptomatic and that they were hospitalised as a precautionary measure.

In an attempt to boost the vaccination compliance, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has launched a state-wide drive for this. Dr Mehul Shah, secretary of IMA Gujarat chapter, said that thousands of doctors are members of the association. “Through our different chapters, we are amplifying the message of full vaccination. We had a talk with the state health department after which we have conveyed to our members that they should take the vaccination status of the patient and their relatives. If they are due and had not taken it, the doctors should know the reason,” said Dr Shah. If it’s due to any medical condition, they should be appraised of the possible way, and if it’s due to any misconception, it should be allayed with logical argument, he added. Senior IMA officials said that the focus would be districts with very less coverage of first and second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gps-to-check-vax-status-of-patients/articleshow/87690596.cms||---
---||Delhi||Successive CJIs showed concern at air pollution||New Delhi: For the past six years, the Chief Justices of India have repeatedly given clarion calls for urgent measures to find sustainable solutions to the problem of noxious air — emitted from industries, vehicles, dust particulates and stubble burning by farmers — choking the northern states, especially the national capital and its surrounding areas. The CJIs have poignantly described the grave impact caused by pollution on people’s homes. If in October 2015, the then CJI H L Dattu had said that his grandson looks like a ‘Ninja’ at home by wearing masks, the present CJI N V Ramana’s words on Saturday portrayed that the situation at Delhiites’ homes have not changed much in the past six years. CJI Ramana said, “People have to wear masks even at home because of the dangerous levels of pollution. We need urgent drastic steps to bring down the AQI levels from the present 500 to a manageable 200-300. If needed, the industries, construction sites and factories can be closed, a lockdown can be declared for two or three days, and farmers can be told to stop stubble burning for a few days.” CJI Dattu’s successor, Justice T S Thakur had made an anguished remark over Delhi’s pollution in December 2015. “Delhi has earned a bad name as the most polluted city. Last week, a judge from the International Court of Justice came to Delhi. It is very embarrassing for us to tell him that this is the level of pollution in Delhi,” he said. Two future CJIs — Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant — who were part of the bench headed by CJI Ramana, on Saturday also echoed the views of earlier CJIs. Justice Chandrachud, who is to become CJI in November next year, said, “The pollution levels of Delhi affects the school children severely. Despite the severe air quality, the schools are open and little children are exposed to it. Have you done anything about it?” Justice Kant, who would be CJI in November 2025, took exception to the Delhi government laying blame at the doors of farmers for resorting to stubble burning causing the Delhi air to turn noxious. “Has the Delhi government imposed any ban on factories and construction activities in the last seven days?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/successive-cjis-showed-concern-at-air-pollution/articleshow/87691509.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This year, over 1.21 lakh candidates have qualified in Eamcet. As per figures shared by Eamcet convenor Navin Mittal, of the 79,790 engineering available seats across Telangana, 19,797 seats have been left vacant. Last year, 17,101 seats were left vacant, which is lower than this year’s figures. This, even as the number of available seats were much the same -- 78,270. Many of these are left vacant in not only core engineering courses such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical and electronics engineering, but also in new tech streams such as cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and data sciences, among others. “Many students who could not get a seat in colleges of their choice have joined private universities wherein job guarantee schemes are being promoted. Students are giving a miss to local colleges and preferring private universities and autonomous colleges resulting in large vacant seats in Telangana,” said KVK Rao, general secretary of All India Federation of Self-Financing Technical Institutions. Close to 90% seats in computer science and IT-related courses, 67% seats in civil, mechanical and allied courses and 60% in other engineering courses have been filled.

Prashant Ranpise, head of PMC’s fire brigade department, said the norms set by national building code for fire safety have been used for audit. “The lacunae at the hospitals were revealed,” he said. He said the improvement of firefighting infrastructure was needed for better safety of these medical establishments as well as staff and patients. As per the PMC officials, the fire brigade has scrutinised over 240 hospitals, including civic hospitals. PMC had issued notices to as many as 61 private hospitals for flawed fire fighting system. The decision was taken after the mishap in Virar hospital. “The private hospitals have completed maintenance works suggested to them in audit. They have submitted the compliance letters,” he said.

The child had a congenital condition with an underdeveloped left side of the heart, a condition known as ‘univentricular heart.’ Cardiothoracic surgeon Anupam Das said the patient had to undergo two surgeries for the same at the two places, the first being done at AIIMS-Delhi in 2014 wherein the deoxygenated blood from upper part of her body was diverted directly into her lungs. “The second, which was more difficult and complicated, was accomplished by the CTVS team in AIIMS-Jodhpur. An artificial conduit was placed between the vein bringing the deoxygenated blood from lower part of the body to the right pulmonary artery”, said Das adding that the entire procedure was done on the beating heart. He said the surgery was successful and the girl had been discharged in a perfectly healthy condition. This surgery is also notable in a sense that it is the first case of redo surgery being performed in the department of CTVS in AIIMS-Jodhpur, which has carried out 15 surgeries for various congenital heart diseases ranging in age from 6 months to 23 years in past 3 months. Interestingly, all these patients had been previously referred to centres outside Rajasthan for surgeries. Director Sanjeev Misra said the cardiothoracic department of the institute was in the process of establishing a centre of excellence for congenital cardiac surgeries soon in western Rajasthan and aims to perform all complex congenital cardiac surgeries with good results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/aiims-jodhpur-perform-complex-heart-surgery/articleshow/87691085.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Gold at 9-month high of Rs 51,000||AHMEDABAD: Continuing its rally, gold price touched a nine-month high on Saturday to touch Rs 51,000 per 10g in the Ahmedabad market. The last time gold touched this level was January 30 this year, when prices hit Rs 51,000 here, according to bullion traders. Analysts attribute the rally in gold prices to surge in demand of gold in the international market. Explaining reasons, Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA), said, “International gold prices have rallied to the level of $1,864.5 per ounce, according to world gold council. This is primarily due to increased demand for gold for industrial use. That apart, rising global inflation has also propelled prices of gold further up as gold is customarily perceived as a hedge against inflation.” From a low of Rs 49,200 per 10 gram just ahead of Diwali, pure gold price increased by Rs 1,800 in merely 10 days in the local market. Analysts also attribute the surge in yellow metal price to the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar. A similar trend was observed in silver. Silver prices touched Rs 67,500 per kg in the local market on Saturday -- up by Rs 3,000 per kg since Diwali, when price touched Rs 64,500 per kg. The rally in gold as well as silver prices is expected to continue till the end of the year. With increased demand, a rise in prices is expected. Throughout the Diwali festive season, gold and silver demand remained buoyant, largely propelled by muhurat purchases of wedding jewellery, light-weight jewellery as well as coins and bars. However, bullion traders suggest that with the recent surge in price of gold through this week, customer footfalls have reduced. “People who were buying coins and bars for investment purpose tend to keep a close watch on the prices. With a dramatic increase in prices, bullion demand has taken a hit and people may wait a few weeks for prices to stabilize,” said Hemant Choksi, a city-based bullion trader. “Jewellery demand has marginally taken a hit with increased prices. Those who have weddings planned are definitely buying as they’re left with little choice,” said Zaveribhai Zaveri, president, Gujarat Jewellers’ Association (GJA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-at-9-month-high-of-rs-51000/articleshow/87690604.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Aurangabad||Over 10 lakh Covid vaccine doses administered in Aurangabad city||AURANGABAD: Amid official boost to the Covid vaccination drive, Aurangabad city on Friday crossed the 10 lakh vaccination mark. As per the official data, over 6.2 lakh first doses and more than 3.8 lakh second doses have been administered within the municipal limits of Aurangabad city. With this, of the total target population of 10.5 lakh, 59% beneficiaries have received the first dose, while the percentage of fully vaccinated citizens has reached 36%. The authorities have appealed to the remaining beneficiaries to get their doses at the earliest. Dr Paras Mandhlecha, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer, said, “We have identified areas with low vaccination numbers and concerted measures are being made to enhance the vaccination coverage. We have started a door-to-door vaccination campaign among other measures in these areas.” The number of lactating and pregnant mothers taking vaccination is very less, even when the experts have advised them to get immunization at the earliest. Dr Asha Sakolkar, a gynaecologist and obstetrician said, “The Covid infection invites more health challenges to lactating and pregnant mothers.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 50% people won’t know they have diabetes till tested, says professor Sanjay Bhadada||CHANDIGARH: Prevalence of prediabetes is higher and by getting screening done on time, this medical condition can be reversed, PGI’s endocrinology dept head Prof Sanjay Bhadada tells Shimona Kanwar ahead of World Diabetes DayIs there any increase in the number of new patients registered for diabetes at PGI? If yes, what are the causes you would attribute for the rise?In a study supported by the ICMR, the prevalence of diabetes in Chandigarh was 13% and the highest in the country. We also did a study for bone health in which we excluded the diabetics. But in that study as well, we found 20% prediabetics. If most of the people are screened and tested, 50% will not be knowing they have diabetes unless there is complication with one or the other organ. Covid saw diabetic patients as the most vulnerable to the virus. How can the survivors take care due to long Covid? How many long Covid patients are you seeing and with what complications?We are not specifically seeing long Covid patients, but those who have diabetes are coming with higher blood glucose levels. This may be attributed to taking steroids over a period of time. And in case they stop or lower the steroids dose, they run the risk of hypoglycemia — low blood sugar. What can be done to prevent diabetes? Chandigarh has seen high prevalence of this NCD. Please give a list of advice to prevent it. Any screening tests once a year?Being an Indian is itself a risk for being diabetic due to ethnicity. The screening age outside our country is 40 years of age, while it is 30 years in India. We need to lower this age group soon as we are seeing younger diabetic patients. If a person is middle aged and overweight, tests like Hb1Ac, blood glucose and blood pressure must be done once every year, while for others it can be done after two years. A diabetic patient has to be very careful with bone, foot and eye health. What are the facilities we have in PGI or what more we plan for their eyes, foot and bone complications?We are planning to have a point of care treatment in the PGI for all the investigations of diabetes. This implies that for follow up, a patient has to first get his height, weight evaluated , visit a dietician and then get eyes and foot tests done under one roof. By the time the reports come, he can get a better consultation for assessment by the doctor after seeing all these reports. If this model succeeds, we will also have a cardiologist and a nephrologist for this point of care treatment. Our department is also working on having a data base of all the patients registered so that we can have details like sex, age wise of the patients undergoing treatment. Such a registry will help us to know screening age, what age complications set in. Can pre-diabetes be reversed? If yes, how? Also, what’s the best way to manage diabetes?It can be reversed by losing 10% of the body weight, by exercising and not by diet alone. Diet modification and not leading a sedentary lifestyle. Results can be seen in six months. For diabetes management---diet control, exercise, oral drugs and then insulin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/50-people-wont-know-they-have-diabetes-till-tested/articleshow/87690603.cms||Shimona Kanwar

However, even when the district administration gave permission to open all the other parks in the city, no decision has been taken to open this park. The park which is spread over 40 cents of land was renovated at a cost of Rs 62 lakhs. People from the locality used to come to the park in the morning and evening to work out and also to relax with their family. The park has a capacity to accommodate 200 people at a time. Even though a group of people had given a memorandum to reopen the park to the secretary of the city corporation, no action has been taken till now. “The government has given permission to open the zoo and museum to the public, but they are not giving the permission to open the Kowdiar park. The authorities have not provided any justifiable reason for this also. We are planning to reach out to the human rights commission if the corporation fails to give the permission”, said Shefin Kowdiar, president, royal Kowadiar protection forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-decision-on-reopening-of-kowdiar-park/articleshow/87674043.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Rahul Gandhi a part-time politician: BL Santhosh||Mangaluru: BJP national general secretary B L Santhosh referred to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as a 'part-time politician' and took a dig at his tweets. “We don't know where he tweets from because he is a part-time politician. People (Congress leaders) here begin tweeting in response to his statements and make fools of themselves. They have no regard for dedication, efficiency, or hard work. Hence, we need a Congress-Mukth Bharat,” he said while delivering the valedictory address at the state-level workshop organised for representatives of 24 cells of BJP here on Saturday. “Our goal is to liberate India from the ideology of the Congress, not to eliminate the Congress from the country. A strong opposition party is essential in a democracy. The aim of Congress-Mukth Bharat is not to destroy the Congress, but rather its anti-national ideologies,” Santhosh said. “The country should be made self-sufficient by providing jobs and opportunities for everyone. However, they (the Congress) turned India into a begging nation. Congress leaders believe that news about them will appear on the front page of newspapers I f they target Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Hence , they continue to criticise Modi. When elections are approaching, they begin making allegations against RSS. Congress leaders should stop being demagogues because they have lost the public's trust. In Congress, there is a dearth of reliable leadership,” the general secretary said. “The Congress was the party that committed the most sins in the name of Gandhiji. While criticising the BJP, politicians such as former chief minister Siddaramaiah keep asking if anyone has sacrificed their lives for India's independence. We had not been born then. During the emergency, it was the BJP and RSS leaders who instilled confidence in the public and were jailed,” he added. “In a veiled attack on the JD(S), Santosh said there are many political parties that use the words ‘social’ and ‘secular’ in their names. “I am still not sure what secular ideologies they carry. Those secular politicians have become advocates of caste and dynasty politics,” he said. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, ministers Kota Shrinivas Poojari and S Angara were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rahul-gandhi-a-part-time-politician-bl-santhosh/articleshow/87689800.cms||---

In a statement, Kataria said that I completely disagree with her statement and the freedom that the country enjoys is because of the sacrifice of lakhs of freedom fighters. No one should term it as the freedom given in charity. If someone thinks that we achieved freedom in 2014, it is wrong. Raghveer Meena, Congress leader and member of the CWC, had questioned BJP’s stand on this controversy. Replying to his question, Kataria categorically dismissed Kangana’s statement and said that many freedom fighters and countrymen have struggled for India’s freedom in their own ways and their ultimate motive was to achieve freedom. No doubt, the nation building works have progressed from 2014 onwards but the country’s freedom certainly was not in alms, he said. Kangans’s statement has raked controversy across the nation and a case against her has been registered against her at many police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kataria-opposes-kanganas-remark-on-independence/articleshow/87691089.cms||---

Singh who has been struggling to wipe off the internal fight in the BJP over the leadership told media persons that ‘I will speak to him on this issue, I have not gone through the complete statement.” Following the debacle in two assembly segments and local body polls, state BJP is in damage control mode by reaching out to its sidelined leaders and hinting at removing the presidents of eight to 10 districts over non-performance. BJP state in-charge Arun Singh met former education ministers, Ghanshyam Tiwari and Kalicharan Saraf, who are away from the limelight for quite a long time. Singh is in Jaipur to attend the two-day organisational meeting held a marathon meeting with state BJP leaders and heads of all frontal organisations on a concluding day on Saturday. The party leaders discussed the upcoming statewide campaign against Congress government on deteriorating law and order, unfulfilled promise of farmers loan waiver, reducing VAT on fuel by the state. Directions were given to the frontal organisations to prepare a strategy to ensure that from party workers to commoners are involved in the series of protests against the state government.

Rai said citizens should appeal to the environment ministry through social media to take necessary action on the emergency issue. Speaking to ANI, Rai said, “I wrote a letter to Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav twice over the issue of stubble burning, but did not get any response yet. I don't know why the Centre is not responding as this is an emergency situation.” “I think Delhiites should also appeal to the Union minister through social media to take necessary action over this emergency situation of air pollution in Delhi.

Vakil’s says “Illegal non-vegetarian food joints near educational institutions, religious places should be removed as passersby have problems due to the stench emanating from such joints”. Vakil claimed that meat of illegally slaughtered animals is being sold in public places. “The civic body should take action against such outlets under provisions of the GPMC Act such as Sections 331 (2), 334, 376 (6), 382 (b) and 335,” the letter says. Section 331(2) says, “No person shall establish a private market for the sale of, or for the purpose of exposing for sale, animals intended for human food, or any article of human food or livestock or articles of food for livestock or shall establish or maintain a private slaughterhouse except with the sanction of the commissioner who shall be guided in giving such sanction by the decisions of the corporation.” “Illegal non-vegetarian food outlets are hurting people’s religious sentiments and are also against Indian culture,” Vakil wrote. These provisions prohibit private markets and private slaughterhouses, the import of cattle without the commissioner’s license and gives powers to the commissioner to expel any non-vegetarian outlets and slaughterhouses operating without the commissioner’s permission. On September 30, the civic body announced a drive against illegal ‘non-vegetarian’ food carts across the city that are operating without valid municipal food vending licences.

---||Delhi||South Delhi hospital reports rare case of post-dengue mucormycosis||NEW DELHI: A leading private hospital in Delhi on Saturday said they recently found a rare case of mucormycosis in a 49-year-old patient post his recovery from dengue. In a statement, the Apollo hospital said, the patient had come to the hospital, complaining about a sudden loss of vision in one eye, 15 days after his recovery from the vector-borne disease. Tests confirmed the patients had mucormycosis, a deadly fungal infection. During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year, a large number of cases of mucormycosis were reported. Mucormycosis post dengue is a new observation and hence, patients with a recent history of dengue should remain actively updated about their health and consult a healthcare expert immediately after noticing any new symptoms, doctors at the hospital said. Dr Suresh Singh Naruka, senior consultant (ENT), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, who is leading the treatment of the patient, said, “A rare case of black fungus (mucormycosis) came into our view when the patient came to the hospital, reporting a sudden loss of vision in one eye post dengue fever. It is rare to see mucormycosis as a post-recovery complication in a dengue patient as this condition is generally seen in people who have a history of diabetes, compromised immunity and various other infections.” The case reported at the Apollo hospital in south Delhi comes amid a huge spike in the number of dengue cases in the national capital. According to a civic report on vector-borne diseases released on Monday, nine deaths and a total of 2,708 dengue cases have been recorded this season till November 6, which is the highest count since 2017 for the same period. Over 1,170 cases were logged in the first week of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-delhi-hospital-reports-rare-case-of-post-dengue-mucormycosis/articleshow/87691094.cms||---

Inaugurating an upgraded 100-bed ICU in the state-run Niloufer Children’s Hospital, the minister said the government was planning to add another 800 beds at the hospital. The minister said the government has also plans for recruiting doctors and medical staff and setting up four hospitals in four sides of the city and a medical college in each district to ensure that the best of healthcare facilities were provided to the poor. “While we have been working on strengthening the government health infrastructure since the pandemic hit us, Rs 133 crore has been allocated to tackle a possible third wave. When Telangana was formed, there were only five government medical colleges which has now gone up to 21. Nine more colleges will be operational from next year. We stood first in Covid-19 vaccination rate and we will continue to improve on various parameters,” said the minister. A cabinet sub-committee headed by the minister, which was formed in June this year, will review government hospitals, staff, infrastructure facilities, etc., and submit a report. The Hyderabad Software Entrepreneurs’ Association had donated Rs 18 crore as part of corporate social responsibility to improve infrastructure in government-run hospitals in the state, the minister added.

According to the villagers, four persons — Surendra Nath Bharti, Anil Singh, Manjeet Singh and Shashi Singh — had announced that they would contest for the post of mukhiya from the panchayat and started campaigns. When the villagers approached them last month, saying that only one of them should fight for the polls, none of them are willing to back out. Hence, the villagers decided to hold an election on their own to select the unanimous candidate for the upcoming polls. The villagers then set up a polling booth at the village temple and printed ballot papers for the exercise. A few locals, Bikhu Singh, Asdev Singh, Balgobing Baitha, Awadh Singh, Yaswindra Yadav and others were given the roles of polling officials and some youths were given the charge of security. On Friday, 629 residents of the village cast their votes during the polls which started at 10am. The result was announced in the evening and Manjeet Singh was declared as the winner. Commenting on the polls, Bhikhu Singh said, “Out of four candidates, Manjeet Singh won and he will be our mukhiya candidate when the state government announces the election dates. While Manjee Singh got 416 votes, Surendra Bharti received 62 votes, Shashi Singh 73 and Anil Singh got 33 votes. A total of 29 votes were declared invalid.” One of the villagers said, “No one will be allowed to contest against him.” Shashi Singh, who came second, announced that he will donate Rs 11,000 to Manjeet Singh to contest the election. Surendra Bharti also said he contribute 5,000 to Manjeet Singh. Meanwhile, Mayurhund block development officer Saket Kumar Sinha told TOI that the dates were not announced for panchayat elections and said everyone, who is eligible, has the right to contest the polls. “I am aware of the pre-poll in the Manjhgawan panchayat where the villagers elected their mukhiya candidate. But if anyone wants to contest from the panchayat after polls dates are notified, no one can block any candidature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chatra-village-elects-mukhiya-before-state-announces-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87690378.cms||---

Jamtara plans clubs for elderly to unwind||Ranchi: The district administration at Jamtara has decided to convert buildings into clubs and recreational centres exclusively for the senior citizens to provide them with an opportunity to interact socially and unwind. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Jamtara deputy commissioner Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said, “We have planned one club each across six blocks and they are expected to become operational by mid-December.” He added, “The idea for an exclusive club-cum-recreational centre for senior citizens struck us after coming across instances of depression among them due to various issues. I was searching for ways to address the problem and that’s when we decided to put abandoned or unused buildings to good use.” He further said, “The government often spends crores of rupees in constructing buildings but quite often some of these structures remain unused or underutilized leading to wastage of public money. Also, abandoned buildings become potential crime hotspots. Hence, we thought of converting buildings where the basic infrastructure is in place and all that is required is a little innovative intervention to transform them into a healthy place.” The groundwork for the project has already begun and once ready, the administration will constitute a management committee from among the locals to run the clubs. “The local block development officer will be an ex-officio member of the committee. The local committee can run these clubs in the way that keeps the atmosphere lively. The club will have indoor games like carrom board and ludo and a TV. Once a month, we will organise health check-up camps and other activities,” the DC said. Jamtara is one of the six districts that comprise the Santhal Pargana commissionary. Over the years, this sleepy town has become notorious as the phishing capital of India because of the numerous incidents of cybercrimes originating from here. To channelize the youths in the right direction, the district administration earlier this year successfully initiated another innovative plan of setting up libraries across all its panchayats. “Today, all our 118 panchayats have fully functional libraries with over 35,000 books where thousands of youths across different age groups spend time reading daily. We have also come up with a dedicated website where details of all the libraries are mentioned. Regular classes are held daily on various topics at each place, details of which are updated on the website,” the DC said, adding that the district administration is focusing on social engineering to help Jamtara shun its negative image.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/feeling-blue-jamtara-plans-clubs-for-elderly-to-unwind/articleshow/87690366.cms||ASRP Mukesh

While the showers are a boon for those who had harvested kharif crop and were preparing to sow the rabi ones, they are detrimental to the growers who are yet to harvest their kharif crop or had left the harvested crop in barn without shed. Under the influence of a low-pressure, which originated over the Bay of Bengal and lies centered over north interior Tamil Nadu and its neighborhood, extending upto 3.6km above mean the sea level, caused rain in the southern parts of Jharkhand. Ranchi recorded 19mm rainfall, while Jamshedpur recorded 7.6mm since Saturday morning. According to a bulletin, issued by the IMD, the trough now runs from the cyclonic circulation over north interior Tamil Nadu to Gangetic West Bengal across Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and extends upto 0.9KM above the mean sea level. Director of Ranchi IMD centre, Abhishek Anand, said the rainfall activity is likely to continue in the southern and northeastern parts of the state in the next 48 hours. “Rainfall activity would reduce subsequently and there would be a drop in the day temperature during the next 48 hours,” he added. The night temperature is likely to fall, bringing in the winter chill once the cloud cover subsides. Weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University, Dr Abdul Wadood, advised farmers to spread dry their harvested crops to avoid fungal infection in case it was drenched in the showers. “Ideally, kharif crop should have been harvested by now but due to delayed monsoon and delayed sowing in some parts of the state, around 30% crop cover is yet to be harvested,” he said, expressing concern that the maturity time of these crops would be further delayed by around a week now due to the current rainfall. “Farmers, who had harvested kharif crop and were preparing their fields for rabi sowing, can make the best use of the showers and go for rabi sowing once the rainy days are over,” Wadood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sudden-weather-change-to-impact-crop-yield/articleshow/87690357.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A century ago, an unwelcome royal guest left a trail of riots in Bombay||I want you to know me and I want to know you". It was not to a shy princess but to a burning Bombay that a prince uttered those words a hundred Novembers ago. Silk sarees and trams were ablaze in Elphinstone Road on the hot winter morning of November 17, 1921 when a sun-tanned, navy-captain-uniform-clad Prince of Wales Edward VIII stepped off a ship called Renown at the Gateway of India for the first time to thank the country and the city for their contributions to the First World War. "..it was Bombay which gave Godspeed to thousands of India's soldiers who left her shores to fight the battle of the Empire in the Great War and it was Bombay which received and tended them when they were war-worn and wounded on their return," said the future emperor before leaving the city war-worn and wounded in his wake.  India was still sore from the scars of 1919's Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Bombay was in the grip of Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement when this quickly-forgotten four-day-long violent chapter of Mumbai's history called 'The Prince of Wales Riots' unfolded. In anticipation of the future emperor's arrival, the then Viceroy, Lord Reading, had planned a grand welcoming ceremony and 80,000 copper medals were specially minted with the words: "Visit of His Royal Highness. Bombay. November 1921". Gandhi, on his part, announced a hartal on the day of the Prince's visit saying: "If a robber held a feast at our expense, would we attend it?"  "After Gandhi set alight his bonfire of foreign-made cloth at 10.30 am, striking mill workers stormed out of the Elphinstone Mills compound and burned a few trams and automobiles," wrote historian Dinyar Patel in his 2008 research paper on the communal riots in which Hindu and Muslim supporters of Mahatma Gandhi--angered by violations of the hartal-- attacked Parsis and members of "other supposedly loyalist minorities".  Besides robed maharajahs and sober-suited soldiers, attendees included Mumbaikars chiefly from the Parsi, Anglo-Indian, and Jewish communities. “Despite the thousands of placards displayed in every nook and corner of the city appealing in the name of Mr Gandhi for a boycott of the Prince's visit, people began to flock towards their chosen points of vantage along the route fixed for the Royal procession from Apollo Bunder to Government House..." said a TOI report. After the ceremony, crowds saw men wearing Gandhi caps or the Khilafat fez on the streets throwing stones at vehicles passing by Marine Lines and Charni Road. Soon after the prince left for Malabar Hill's Government House, crowds at Kalbadevi began throwing stones at trams and at New Nagpada, a mob tried to set fire to the police station, killing three Indian constables  By mid-day on November 19, at least three Zoroastrian fire temples were attacked and on November 20, a mob of 500 Parsis, armed with bamboo sticks, gathered on Princess Street to defend the Atash Behram fire temple, revealed Patel.  News of the violence reached Gandhi. An anonymous Mazgaon writer recounted how Nusserwanji Dhondy, a Parsi who had rushed to help non-cooperators control riots in Khetwadi on November 18, faced the wrath of both Gandhi supporters and members of his own community. "Dhondy subsequently died of ‘Acute Mania from effects of the Bombay Riots’," said Patel. Usha Thakkar, president of Mani Bhavan--Gandhi's place of residence in those tumultuous years--said that the leader was "pained to see the outbreak of violence." In a pamphlet in which he vowed not to eat or drink anything but water until the tensions ended, Gandhi wrote: "The swaraj that I have witnessed during the last two days has stunk in my nostrils." When the violence subsided finally on November 20, Gandhi drafted a public statement to Bombay residents pledging cross-communal harmony before breaking his fast the next day. As for the Prince, he left Bombay for his four-month maiden journey across India after watching a polo match, shaking hands with 3000 guests at the Government House reception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-century-ago-an-unwelcome-royal-guest-left-a-trail-of-riots-in-bombay/articleshow/87692227.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Matheran panel to look into transport difficulty at hill station||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Saturday directed the Matheran Monitoring Committee to look into a resident’s grievance on lack of transport for students, the elderly and the differently abled and submit a report . A vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar heard a petition by Sunil Shinde, a retired schoolteacher, to quash or amend a February 4, 2003 notification of Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) that declared Matheran and surrounding region an ‘ecologically sensitive zone’. He prayed to allow entry of LPG/CNG/electric vehicles for essential goods and to provide transport for school children, senior citizens and the differently abled. Shinde’s petition said that due to MoEF’s notification, horses and handcarts involving human labour are used as means of transport. “This makes cost of living for residents in Matheran and surrounding areas very high,” it said. It added that 30,000 residents currently face a hard time and since the pandemic began, residents are paying Rs 250 extra per gas cylinder. The petition said that since transportation is not available, children have to walk miles every day to reach school. “Senior citizens and differently abled also have a tough time moving around Matheran area,” it added, and said that though Mahabaleshwar and Dahanu are eco-sensitive zones, the MoEF has not banned vehicle traffic there. “The banning of vehicles from ECZ of Matheran is illegal and unconstitutional as Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, does not cover vehicles under its ambit,” the petition stated. Shinde’s advocate argued that only ambulances and fire-engines are allowed. On Friday, he said students have to walk 5km to school. “We can’t expect students to walk 5 km up-down,” said Justice Kathawalla. On Saturday, government pleader Poornima Kantharia said one of the schools is hardly 3.5 km from Dasturi Point. But Justice Kathawalla said, “Students cannot be expected to walk that distance.” The Centre’s advocate, Rui Rodrigues, submitted MoEF’s recent office memo on re-constitution of the committee saying it can look into Shinde’s grievance. The committee is directed to hear Shinde and submit a report after 2 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-asks-matheran-panel-to-look-into-transport-difficulty-at-hill-stn-in-mumbai/articleshow/87692243.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘MCOCA confession valid in other offences in same case’||Mumbai: Observing that confessions recorded under the MCOCA Act can be used against the accused to convict them for other offences in the same case even if the charges under the stringent act are dropped, a special court this week found two men guilty and sentenced them to 7 years rigorous imprisonment for attempting to extort Rs 1 crore from a city builder in 2015 at the behest of wanted accused, gangster Vijay Shetty. The court also fined the accused, Sujit Rao (30) and Lohit Anchan (37),Rs 1 lakh each. Of the fine amount, if recovered, Rs 50,000 will be paid to the builder as compensation. The two accused are in jail since 2015. Charges under MCOCA were dropped as the prosecution could not prove that there was more than one chargesheet against Shetty, head of the alleged crime syndicate, a requirement under the act. The court said xthe prosecution had failed to establish that the “so-called gang leader” Vijay Shetty alias Vijay Anna, named in the first chargesheet and Vijay Shetty alias Bala Anna shown in the second was one person. “Admittedly, the chargesheeted accused were not previously chargesheeted. Therefore, the basic requirement for invoking the provisions of MCOC Act that the gang leader was facing more than one chargesheet during last 10 years and that the competent court had taken cognisance of the offence against him, remains to be established,” the court said. Twenty-seven witnesses, including the builder, deposed in court. The prosecution had submitted that in 2015, the accused had conspired to extort Rs 1 crore by threatening to kill the builder and his family members. It was alleged that while the builder began to receive calls in May 2015, the next month he approached the joint commissioner of police (crime) and a copy of his complaint was given to the Anti-Extortion Cell. The court relied on accused Anchan’s confession statement where he “admitted his guilt of making phone calls and demanding ransom for himself as well as for the wanted accused Vijay Shetty and Dhanraj”. “In view of the above observation, I conclude that by the evidence of prosecution witnesses the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that accused, wanted accused Vijay and Dhanraj have hatched criminal conspiracy to commit extortion by threatening calls to prosecution witness [builder] and that the accused have made threatening calls and demanded cash of Rs 2 lakh for settling the dispute and threatened the informant [builder] to kill him,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcoca-confession-valid-in-other-offences-in-same-case/articleshow/87692281.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Mumbai awaits Mahim mela in honour of Sufi saint||MUMBAI: The musical instruments daff and nagara fell silent suddenly and remained paused for months. During the painful pandemic when lives went topsy turvy the number of devotees to places of worship was curtailed to just a few who comprised the trustees and khadims or those serving at the shrines. But, after the reopening, the foot falls at the iconic Mahim Dargah or mausoleum of secular Sufi saint of Mumbai, Makhdoom Ali Mahimi, have increased. It has rekindled the hopes that the dreary months are behind us and the famous Mahim Mela will return. As the annual Mahim Mela (December 18--28) nears, Mahim Dargah management, owners of giant Ferris wheels, swings and owners of temporary eateries at the “entertainment zone” hope the authorities will grant permission to hold the Mela. "We have written to commissioners of police and BMC seeking if any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the annual Mahim fair has been made. We will follow all the guidelines required for visits of devotees to the shrine," said Mahim Dargah's managing trustee Sohail Khandwani. He added that all measures would be taken to avoid crowding at the Dargah and no individual or group would be allowed to bring DJs in the Dargah's vicinity. "Playing loud music at a sacred place like a Sufi's shrine is forbidden and we request devotees not to bring or play DJs," he said. Besides the spiritual significance of the mela when thousands of sandals (flower petals, shawl, sandal paste), including the first sandal from the Mumbai police, are traditionally offered to the Saint, the mela’s entertainment zone too attracts thousands. Giant Ferris wheels, swings, eateries, shops selling toys and dresses attract families. Thousands await the mela for the whole year as they earn money during the 10-day festival that helps them see through the year. “Now that the government has allowed entertainment activities in open maidan where jhoolas (swings) rides operate, the Mahim mela too should be allowed. This is an open ground with three gates where private guards can help police in managing the crowd. Everyone should be required to wear a mask,” said Fazil Zubair, founder-chairman, Maharashtra Anand Mela Association. “If other states have allowed melas to be held, what will stop the state government from allowing Mumbai’s biggest annual mela.” Zubair’s family has put up Ferris wheels at the mela since 19970s. He said in the last 18 months or so the equipment of wheels and rides have been rusting.  “Over 10,000 people are directly dependent on this mela. The mela is also a source of revenue for the government. The mela will be a big booster to the families of people who earn money through sales or working during the 10-day festival,” said Aslam Khan who too has put up a Ferris wheel at the mela since 1970. For Hafeez Yaqoob Patel, the mela will give a “new lease of life” to jhoola operators who desperately need money to stay in the business. “I have already scrapped two jhoolas and there are many like me who hope to get a booster through this mela,” said Patel. A lot rides on this annual mela which commemorates Makhdoom Mahimi, a leading Sufi scholar of his time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-awaits-mahim-mela-in-honour-of-sufi-saint/articleshow/87692283.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Bangar has been under pressure after the bribe incident. Belapur BJP MLA Manda Mhatre had demanded a probe to weed out corruption in the department. Bangar was contemplating internal transfers for more than five years. Those transferred include 16 permanent employees and 17 contractual employees, including office superintendents, administrative officers and clerks. Most have been sent to the health department and the rest have been posted in administrative departments, fire and ward offices. Patil was in the department for over 10 years. Only six employees have now been left in the department, and they include a stenographer and peons. Meanwhile, most employees working in the health department will soon be transferred to the local body tax wing to square up vacancies. “We want transparency and accountability in the civic administration,” said Bangar.

Khan is out on bail since September. The case will come up for hearing on November 20. The NCB moved the plea citing certain recently found material for which the voice samples were needed. The NCB had arrested Khan in July this year, alleging he invested funds in drug trafficking along with arrested British national, Karan Sejnani. The NCB had accused Khan of being part of a syndicate and involved in dealing with, peddling and consumption of drugs. At the time of granting him bail, the court had said the quantum of contraband seized as per the chemical analysis report was not a “commercial” quantity and the charges of abetment and conspiracy made out by the NCB do not apply. The court also pointed out that there was “nothing except the statement of the accused and the co-accused” to link them with contraband. Of 194kg drugs seized, active constituents of cannabis were found in 1.2kg, which puts the quantity of contraband in the “intermediate” category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-seeks-sameer-khans-voice-samples/articleshow/87692290.cms||---

---||Mumbai||With train services resuming, runaway kids head for Mumbai||I'm here to kill Salman Khan because he murdered Sushant Singh Rajput." That's what a 16-year-old boy told officials at a local children's home a few months ago when asked why he had fled his home in UP. What followed were five routine counselling sessions during one of which he threatened to kill the officials "for catching me". On connecting with his friends through social media, the officials traced the aggressive teen's family in UP who came down to fetch him. "When we advised them to seek professional therapy for him, they told us he had been addicted to PUBG, a multiplayer game that was banned in India last year," says a child welfare officer, who has seen the mobile game's legitimate variants fuel the kind of truancy that's threatening to make up for the recent lockdown-induced dip in the number of missing children admitted in the child care institution he heads. "Many kids had taken loans to play the mobile games and ran away fearing their family's reactions on discovering the debt," he says.  In a trend that CCTV cameras at CST and Churchgate would attest to, truancy came to a screeching halt when Covid put a stop to incoming trains during the lockdown. Of late, however, with railway services resuming, children's homes of Matunga, Mankhurd, Dongri, Thane, Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi are beginning to fill with passport photos of minor boys and girls from UP and Bihar who board CST-bound trains. "On probing, they say they are here on tour," says a child welfare official.  If you chart Maharashtra's graph as per National Crime Records Bureau's data of missing children, you would find a cheerful sagging arc starting from 4388 in 2016 to 1711 in 2018. The curve jumps up again in 2019 with the state reporting nearly 4000 missing children but then this is somewhat flattened in 2020 thanks to the state tracing over 4800 missing children. A chunk of these reunions with families were a consequence of intervention by NGOs such as Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi's Bachpan Bachao Andolan as well as Operation Muskaan, the centre's initiative to reunite missing children with their families since 2014.  Recently, as part of Operation Muskaan's latest round, Mumbai Police is reported to have carried out 145 reunions in a month-long drive in June when it found that 909 children in the city were missing. Some of these children were not even reported missing by their families and were found begging on the streets, says a recent article in a daily. Data provided to TOI by Thane Police's Child Protection Unit (CPU)--which saw the number of missing children in the city of lakes drop almost by half between 2019 and 2021--shows that the unit has traced 515 of 598 children reported missing this year. "Young kids tend to remember things like wells and trees, which we have traced to places such as Shahapur and Wada," says a senior officer. Out of 598 children who went missing in Thane city this year, 463 were girls. Though the Thane CPU--which is in the throes of sudden transfers--has not been able to provide reasons for the skewed gender ratio, clues can be found in NCRB's data for Maharashtra, the state that reported the highest number of missing women last year. Six per cent of the 900-odd trafficking victims in the state, the report says, were children. Incidentally, one such case cracked by Thane CPU even made it to a celebrated crime re-enactment TV series whose anchor is now a certified crime scene investigator. While confiding about a recent climb in cases of teen boys from far-flung small towns eloping into Mumbai with minor girls, a city-based child welfare official admits that Operation Muskaan has helped children's homes break the "language barrier". "It puts missing children from far-flung towns in UP and Nepal in touch with cops from their hometowns who speak the dialect," he says. Breaking the ice isn't easy, says Arun Yadav, a volunteer with the NGO My Home India--which started reuniting missing kids with their families in the same year as Operation Muskaan in 2014. "While escorting them back home, we have to stay up all night in the train for fear that the kid might run away," says Yadav whose boss Shravan Jha confesses that the slump in work afforded him enough free time to compile all of the NGO's successful 2000-odd reunions. "Each of them is a sitting-duck OTT documentary," he says, inviting us for a glimpse of the file which contains stories, including that of a 13-year-old musically-inclined girl from Udupi who took a literal leap of faith the same day that she won a high-jump contest.

It said there was unexplained delay in giving better medical care and she died due to the doctor’s negligence. Justice R.K. Agrawal (president) and Dr S M Kantikar (commission member) dismissed an appeal by a Nallasopara hospital and doctor who runs it, challenging a February 2015 state commission order which held them liable for medical negligence. The state commission had directed them to pay Rs 16 lakh to the widower and his two daughters but the hospital had challenged it. Quoting Susan Wiggs, National Commission said, “There is something about losing a mother that is permanent and inexpressible a wound that will never quite heal.” On September 20, 1995, at 5.30am, the woman started bleeding and at 6.30am a lower segment caesarean section was performed after consent from her husband, and at 9.30am her second daughter was born. The hospital asked for blood bottles and four were organized by 10.30am. Due to anxiety, the co-brother of the complainant husband , Dr. Ram Barot, contacted a gynaecologist who phoned the Nallasopara doctor, asking him to shift her to Bhagwati hospital for an emergency hysterectomy to save her life. Dr Barot organized 18 bottles of her blood type. The National Commission order said after alleged refusal she was finally shifted at 4.30pm, when she was declared dead before admission. “It was an act of omission from the (doctor) wherein it fell below that of the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in his field,” said the National Commission. Their advocate, Anand Patwardhan, argued that there was no medical negligence. But consumer activist Shirish Deshpande as authorised representative for the widower and daughters said she was shifted to Bhagwati belatedly and died due to “hemorrhagic shock following surgery” as mentioned in her post-mortem. He submitted a medical expert opinion that since it was her second delivery with a rare A- blood type, the hospital should have kept her blood type available, as there were chances of unexpected uncontrolled haemorrhage. The commission directed the hospital and doctor to pay Rs 1 lakh as litigation cost too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-payout-hiked-to-rs-20l-for-family-of-woman-who-died-during-childbirth/articleshow/87692313.cms||Swati Deshpande

The clarification by a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar, was on a petition by the couple from Mumbai who hail from Chaubari village, Bachao taluka, Gujarat. On the pretext of placating her family, the 22-year-old woman was taken to Chaubari and forcibly “married” to another who assaulted and tortured her. She escaped to Mumbai. The judges were informed by prosecutor Prajakta Shinde that six persons, including her second “husband”, his brother, the woman’s father, her brother, the village sarpanch and the community head, were arrested immediately after lodging of an FIR on Thursday. On Friday, they were remanded to police custody till November 17. Advocate Deepa Chawan for the couple referred to the FIR lodged against the woman at Bachao police station at the instance of the second husband. The judges then said their November 5 order granting police protection also refers to that FIR. “The order passed by this court shall continue until further orders,” said Justice Kathawalla.

The prosecution submitted Waze did not provide relevant information about former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s whereabouts. It iterated that for wanted accused number one, Singh, Waze extorted huge amounts of money from cricket bookies by threatening them with arrests. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap submitted that the investigators wanted to find out if there are other victims, including bookies and prominent businessmen. The prosecution further said that the circulation of money after extortion also needed to be ascertained. “The extortion amount is yet to be recovered. It is also necessary to find out how the extortion money was used by the accused,” the prosecution said. The remand plea also said cops wanted to find out how many times such extortion had taken place. “The complaint mentions extortion done of BMC contractors. We want to probe it further,” the remand plea said. The crime branch had said the investigation into the complaint of businessman Bimal Agarwal had brought to light that Singh started the extortion racket immediately after Waze was reinstated in 2020.  Waze’s lawyer Aarti Kalekar said he was under tremendous pressure due to the Centre and state and contemplating giving his statement under 164 of Criminal Procedure Code. Such statements are recorded before the magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-sent-to-crime-branch-custody-till-monday-now/articleshow/87692337.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Calling it a breach of provisions of the NDPS Act, special judge V V Patil said, "In the present case, the search was undertaken by a female panch who is not an empowered officer to effect the search and, therefore, there is a breach of Section 42 of NDPS Act... present accused is entitled to grant of bail on that ground." No proof to show Satija acted in conspiracy, says spl courtNupur Satija’s advocate Ayaz Khan had submitted before the special court that according to law, a panch is not empowered to search and recover contraband, and it has to be done by officers empowered by the NDPS Act. He said a 1985 notification revealed officers of and above the rank of inspector in the NCB are empowered to exercise powers and perform duties specified in Section 42. The prosecution had submitted that the drugs were found wrapped in sanitary napkins. While Satija (29), Delhi residents Gomit Chopra (28) and Ishmeet Singh Chadha (33) and city resident and alleged peddler Shreyas Nair (23) were granted bail on October 30, detailed order copies were made available on Friday. In Satija’s case, the court said, “Admittedly, personal search of accused as well as search of room of accused was (under)taken by (a) female panch witness. Admittedly, there was no lady officer present and no panchanama was carried out by person authorised for that purpose.” It said there was no specific evidence on record to show the accused had acted in conspiracy with each other. It noted that other accused, Aryan Khan (23), Arbaaz Merchant (26) and Munmun Dhamecha (28), had been granted bail by HC. Chopra, a make-up artist and guest on ship, was held on October 3. Three grams of cocaine and ecstasy pills were allegedly recovered. Granting Chopra bail, the court said though prosecution had relied on WhatsApp chats between Satija and him, the conversations are only regarding consumption and not regarding sale, purchase or for any other use. “I find substance in the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicants that on the basis of WhatsApp chats, at the most it can be said the applicants are consumers of contraband,” the court said, while accepting advocate Kushal Mor’s submissions. The court said only Section 27(a) of NDPS Act, which attracts punishment up to one year, was applicable. A businessman, Chadha, also a guest on ship, was held on October 3. Allegedly 6.5 gms of MDMA was recovered, and he named Nair as his supplier. Nair was held a day later. The court said barring Chadha’s statement, prosecution failed to bring on record specific evidence to show Nair supplied the contraband.

The number of deaths increased to 49 compared to 41 and 28 on Friday and Thursday, respectively. A health officer said the increase was due to a reconciliation exercise. "Out of the total 49 deaths reported on Saturday, 34 deaths are more than a week old. Of these 34 deaths, 26 are from Raigad, five from Thane and one each from Buldhana, Nashik and Pune," he said. Except on Wednesday, the daily tally in the state has been under 1,000 since November 5. In Mumbai, the daily tally kept under 300 for the third day, with 246 testing positive for the virus on Saturday. Only two deaths were registered, taking the toll to 16,290 since March 2020. The daily cases haven't yet gone up substantially although it is a week since Diwali and many experts had feared that cases could increase due to crowding and socialising during the festival. While daily tests were below 1 lakh (60,000 on some days) during the Diwali week, the numbers increased to 1.15 lakh in Maharashtra. On Saturday, the BMC update showed 41,078 tests were done, higher than the average of 35,000 tests a day. Active cases in the state (12,219) and Mumbai (3,577) continued to dip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/daily-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-rise-to-999-deaths-move-up-to-49/articleshow/87692341.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating the two-day Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan. Citing Savarkar’s example, Shah said, “Had it not been for Veer Savarkar, we would have been using English words only.” Shah also said that very few people know that Savarkar worked a lot for ‘Swabhasha’ and Rajbhasha’. “He made a Hindi dictionary and introduced many words.

---||Mumbai||Cops want ‘proclamation’ issued against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The crime branch will move a plea before the magistrate’s court seeking issuance of proclamation against “absconding” accused, former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, and two others, Vinay Singh and Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti, in an alleged extortion case where they threatened a businessman and hotelier and extorted money. The crime branch said that a non-bailable warrant was issued by the court on October 30, but the trio were not available at their respective addresses. It alleged that they had gone into hiding after the case was registered. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said that once proclamation is issued by the court, an accused has to appear within 30 days. “If an accused fails to appear within this time, then proceedings can commence for attachment of their properties,” Jagtap said. The crime branch moved the plea before the court on Saturday. However, it was referred to the in-charge court, where the crime branch will file the plea on Monday. The plea will also invoke Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), through which an absconding accused’s properties can be attached. The crime branch said that cops had gone to Param Bir Singh’s Malabar Hill home on November 10. But due to his absence, the warrant could not be served. The statements of a police guard stationed at the building and the cook were recorded. The police guard told them that for the last three months, Singh had not come to the building. He said Singh’s family also did not live there, and he did not know the whereabouts of any of them. The cook said that he had been living and working in the building for over a year. He too said that neither Singh nor his family had been to the premises in the last three months. Vinay Singh’s wife told cops that he had not been to their Kandivli apartment since the FIR was registered in the case. She also claimed that he had not been in touch with her. The woman said she was unaware about his current location. At Bhatti’s Versova home, his wife too gave a similar statement. On Wednesday, the magistrate court issued a non-bailable warrant against Singh in an extortion case. This was the third such non-bailable warrant issued against Singh. Last month, a Thane court as well as the 37th metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Singh in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-want-proclamation-issued-against-param-bir/articleshow/87692348.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||28 per cent of 1,574 Mumbai hospitals fail to comply with fire norms||MUMBAI: As many as 435 of 1,574 hospitals, nursing and maternity homes in Mumbai inspected by the fire brigade till October 31 were found to have not complied with fire safety norms. This report comes in the wake of an investigation into the blaze at Ahmednagar Civil Hospital that killed 11 Covid patients, pointing towards inadequate fire-fighting equipment in the hospital. Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said their teams visited 1,574 private, BMC, state and central government hospitals and found lacunae in fire-safety requirements. “Of these, 1,139 have complied with fire safety measures while the rest have not. However, upon serving them notices, many have complied,” said Parab, adding it is an ongoing audit and notices to violators are served under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. Data also shows 254 of the nursing homes that were visited were closed at the time of inspection. Fire officials said the most common violation is the absence of fire alarms, sprinklers and smoke detectors in these premises. TIMES VIEWFires like at the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, Bhandara District Hospital and Sunrise Hospital in Bhandup show the unpreparedness of the administrations to deal with such calamities. Poor fire-fighting equipment combined with lack of stringent audits are leading to the loss of precious lives. This year has already seen multiple devastating fires and therefore it is imperative that authorities take strict action against those who violate safety norms.Kandivli corporator Kamlesh Yadav said the BMC must also crack down on the many nursing homes that are operating illegally in the city. “I had contacted the medical officer of every ward and found that there are over 241 unauthorized nursing homes in the city which must either be shut or they must be made to apply for permission. If they have no permission, how can one expect any kind of fire safety measures on their premises,” said Yadav who had also raised the issue in the civic standing committee meeting recently. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said while the civic body grants permission, it is often found that nursing homes or hospitals, due to space crunch, utilize more than what they are permitted to. “This then puts a load on the existing electrical infrastructure, which in any case faces a high load with NICU and ICU medical machinery and air-conditioners operating the entire day. Hence, it should be first checked if more than the actual space granted by the BMC is being used by the premises,” said Miranda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-28-of-1-6k-city-hosps-fail-to-comply-with-fire-norms/articleshow/87692367.cms||Richa Pinto

Mumbai is now among the handful of cities and towns — Bhubhaneswar, which was the first in the country, Indore, Ladakh and Kinnaur, among others — to have statistically completed 100% first-dose coverage. Unlike the single-dose Covid vaccines available in the West, the Covid vaccines available in India require two shots for completion. Around 1.5 crore vaccine doses have been given out so far in Mumbai, and the BMC is now focusing on completing the second shot coverage. Till Saturday, 60,33,148 (65% of the city’s adult population) were fully vaccinated. “We will not stop giving the first shot as 92.3 lakh was just a projection based on the census data and the number of eligible citizens. The total adult population of the city could be higher as new people keep coming into the city,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We want to continue vaccinating till everybody living in Mumbai or working here is safe,” added Kakani. There is another reason for the BMC to continue offering the first vaccine shot: many beneficiaries could have come from neighbouring satellite cities especially in the earlier months when vaccines were in a short supply. “Mumbai is geographically integrated with nearby satellite cities, so there is a possibility that 10% of the total beneficiaries so far came from outside the city,” said Kakani. On Saturday, the Centre’s Cowin portal showed that 89,529 people had taken the vaccine in Mumbai. The BMC update said a reconciliation exercise had been carried out, leading to 31,730 shots given in private hospitals between May and October being added to take Saturday's tally to 1,18,237. The Thane Municipal Corporation said it had delivered over 50,000 vaccine doses since it started the door-to-door drive in Thane four days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-crosses-its-adult-population-figure-of-9239902-for-first-dose/articleshow/87692376.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Prediabetes detected in 1 in 3 persons tested in Mumbai’||MUMBAI: Every third person who tested their blood sugar in Mumbai has prediabetes, according to a five-year data analysis of 2.9 lakh patients by a national laboratory. As the name suggests, prediabetes is a precursor or an early warning system to diabetes. While the latest International Diabetes Federation report has pegged the number of Indian adults affected by diabetes at 74 million, the prediabetes burden is high at 40 million too. Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi, chair of IDF-South East Asia region, said, “Apart from diabetes, India has two big burdens. One is prediabetes and the other is asymptomatic diabetes. A solution would be to start diabetes screening from 25 years of age as against the present 30 years.” A group of endocrinologists have made this suggestion to the central health officials. While there is no estimate with local authorities about the incidence of prediabetes, private laboratory SRL Diagnostics released a report on 2.9 lakh samples received for glycosylated/glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test from January 2017 till September 2021 in Mumbai that gives an idea: 37% of all these samples tested were positive for diabetes and 37% tested positive for prediabetes. In the 31-45 age group, the report said over 40% samples tested prediabetic and over 23% were found to be diabetic, proving that the onset of diabetes is earlier among Indians. SRL laboratory’s Dr Kshama Pimalgaonkar said, “One in six people with diabetes in the world is from India. What is more alarming is that a staggering number of the population is also living with prediabetes, which can be prevented from turning into a chronic condition.” Another survey of 5,000 people done by health-tech company Fitterfly showed people under 40 years are at the highest risk of prediabetes. “Of the millions who have prediabetes in India, 70% of them could convert into Type 2 diabetes over the next five to 10 years,’’ said Dr Arbinder Singhal of Fitterfly. His survey found 74% of the respondents were obese or overweight, 59% had a family history of diabetes and 44% were not active as per World Health Organisation’s recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. “Weight loss of 8 to 12kg in the at-risk population will cut the risk of diabetes by 50%,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prediabetes-detected-in-1-in-3-persons-tested-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/87692384.cms||---

However, the AQI has now remained in the ‘severe’ category for ten straight days. Taking initiative to clean the city air, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board recommended a cumulative fine of Rs 65.5 lakh on eight polluters on Saturday. Track the pollution level in your city“During our survey, we found a violation of road dust norms on Pustha Road in Kanawani and recommended a fine of Rs 50,000 on GDA (Ghaziabad Development Authority) and GMC (Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation)," said a UPPCB official. The road runs parallel to the Hindon river on the banks of which sand gets stored. "No step has been taken to stop dust pollution there despite alerting the two agencies a few days ago,” said the official. The seven other polluters are private developers, found to violate construction and demolition waste norms. Meanwhile, Noida remained the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day on Saturday, with an AQI 464 in the ‘severe’ category. On Friday, the AQI was 488. Greater Noida, on the other hand, recorded an AQI of 408 in the 'severe' category on Saturday, an improvement over its AQI of 478 on Friday. PM2.5 is the major pollutant in Greater Noida while both PM10 and PM2.5 contribute almost equally to the pollution levels in Noida. Amid severe pollution levels, Noida’s environmental committee meeting has been preponed for early next week. “The committee usually meets once a month on a fixed date. However, I’ve asked for it to be arranged on Monday or Tuesday, ahead of schedule. We hope that we can discuss some concrete implementable solutions that are urgently required,” said Suhas LY, Noida district magistrate. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Saturday imposed penalties worth Rs 12 lakh on environmental polluters. A Rs 5 lakh penalty was imposed on the Noida Authority over the construction of Noida Convection and Habitat Centre in Sector 94. Other penalties were imposed on private developers and plot owners. Meanwhile, the anti-smog tower planned by the Noida Authority will be inaugurated on November 17. The 20-metre high tower will be located along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway on the stretch leading to the DND flyway. Just like an air conditioner, the fans in the tower are supposed to suck in polluted air while the filter is supposed to take out the dust particles before releasing the fresh air into the environment. Costing nearly Rs 2.5 crore, it is expected to control pollution levels within a radius of 1km. However, some residents and air quality experts said that the device has been placed in a location where people spend too less time for it to be effective. It may not even benefit the nearest residential and commercial/institutional areas such as sectors 15, 15A, 16A and 17, which are some distance away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/noida-most-polluted-for-second-day-aqi-in-gzb-still-severe/articleshow/87692412.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Noida||Noida most polluted for second day, AQI in Ghaziabad still ‘severe’||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: The air quality in Ghaziabad improved a little from 486 on Friday to 441 on Saturday. However, the AQI has now remained in the ‘severe’ category for ten straight days. Taking initiative to clean the city air, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board recommended a cumulative fine of Rs 65.5 lakh on eight polluters on Saturday. Track the pollution level in your city“During our survey, we found a violation of road dust norms on Pustha Road in Kanawani and recommended a fine of Rs 50,000 on GDA (Ghaziabad Development Authority) and GMC (Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation)," said a UPPCB official. The road runs parallel to the Hindon river on the banks of which sand gets stored. "No step has been taken to stop dust pollution there despite alerting the two agencies a few days ago,” said the official. The seven other polluters are private developers, found to violate construction and demolition waste norms. Meanwhile, Noida remained the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day on Saturday, with an AQI 464 in the ‘severe’ category. On Friday, the AQI was 488. Greater Noida, on the other hand, recorded an AQI of 408 in the 'severe' category on Saturday, an improvement over its AQI of 478 on Friday. PM2.5 is the major pollutant in Greater Noida while both PM10 and PM2.5 contribute almost equally to the pollution levels in Noida. Amid severe pollution levels, Noida’s environmental committee meeting has been preponed for early next week. “The committee usually meets once a month on a fixed date. However, I’ve asked for it to be arranged on Monday or Tuesday, ahead of schedule. We hope that we can discuss some concrete implementable solutions that are urgently required,” said Suhas LY, Noida district magistrate. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Saturday imposed penalties worth Rs 12 lakh on environmental polluters. A Rs 5 lakh penalty was imposed on the Noida Authority over the construction of Noida Convection and Habitat Centre in Sector 94. Other penalties were imposed on private developers and plot owners. Meanwhile, the anti-smog tower planned by the Noida Authority will be inaugurated on November 17.

The girl was last seen by her elder sister (10) walking on a lane towards the family's one-room tenement in Shramik Kunj 2. The park in Sector 108 where the body was found is 2km from her home. Police said a tooth of the girl was missing, her ear had a piercing and a slipper (not hers) was found near the body. An FIR has been filed against unknown persons on charges of murder and abduction. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander told TOI, "We are investigating the case. But one thing is clear - someone known to the family is behind the murder. The girl seems to have been accompanied to the park (where she was found dead) by someone she knew," he added. Quoting from the autopsy report, Sujeet Upadhyaya, the SHO of Phase 2 police station, said the girl was possibly killed an hour or two after she went missing around 1pm on Thursday. The autopsy, he said, revealed that the girl had died of shock and haemorrhage due to ante-mortem injuries. Police have ruled out sexual assault. The girl had gone out to play around Thursday noon with her 10-year-old sister at a nearby park. When she wanted to go home, the sister had accompanied up to the lane that leads to their house. "Both of us were playing in the park. I took my sister to the lane that leads to Daksh's house and then our home. She told me she could go alone," the 10-year-old told TOI on Saturday. The family of Daksh, a neighbour, said they hadn't seen the six-year-old girl around that time. The victim was the sixth girl child of Anuradha, who had married twice. She has two daughters - aged 19 and 21 - with her first husband. Eleven years ago, Anuradha married Ram Kumar, who owns a kiosk selling bidis and cigarettes. The couple have four daughters, of whom the six-year-old was the youngest. Anuradha said she suspected some neighbours were behind her daughter's murder. "I believe someone from the neighbourhood might have killed our child," she said but didn't elaborate why she felt so. A neighbour this correspondent spoke to said Anuradha and Ram Kumar often had fights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/6-year-old-noida-girl-found-dead-in-park/articleshow/87692475.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Nagpur||Yavatmal police suggest MBBS student died in road rage; 3 ‘real killers’ nabbed||YAVATMAL: The Yavatmal police on Saturday claimed two youths have been arrested and a juvenile in conflict with law rounded up for the murder of Ashok Pal, a final year MBBS student of Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal. Yavatmal SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal explained the circumstances under which the murder took place, suggesting that Pal, a resident of Thane district, was killed in a road rage incident. “The trio was on a motorbike which hit Pal who was returning to his hostel from the college library on the campus on Wednesday night. This led to a verbal duel which ended in stabbing of the MBBS student to death,” he tod media on Saturday. The agitating students and doctors have been claiming that Pal’s murder was an act of revenge and that police “are acting under politial pressure to protect the real murderers”. The arrested youths have been identified as Rushikesh Gulabrao Sawale (23), a resident of Mahavir Nagar, and Pravin Sanjeev Gundajwar (24), a resident of Savitribai Phuley Society. The SP said the trio has confessed to committing the murder. In another revelation, the SP declared that the two youths arrested earlier and remanded in police custody are inncocent. “They were arrested on the basis of complainant filed by dean Dr Milind Kamble, medical superintendent and PRO Dr Surendra Bhuyar,” said the top cop and added that they would be released as per legal procedure. The SP said, “The arrests of the real murderers would put the speculations to rest. The motorcycle and weapons used in the crime have been seized. The juvenile offender has two other crimes already registered against him.” “The arrested youths will be produced before the court on Sunday,” said the SP said adding that the city PSO Nandkishor Pant is investing the case. A reward of Rs one lakh cash was declered for cops involved in nabbing the trio. On threats issued by a Shiv Sena neta to the agitators in front of district collector Amol Yedge, the SP Bhujbal said he has been booked and a order will be issued soon prohibiting his entry to the campus. On Saturday, Director of Medical Education Dr Dilip Mhaiskar visited the college and assured the agitating students to fulfill their demands at the earliest. A five-member team from MUHS too interacted with the students and assured to resolve their issues. Dr Aniket Gaurkhede representing the protesters told TOI that said that they are insisting on adequate compensation for the next of kin of the deceased. The agitators rejected an aid of Rs5 lakh announced by Digras MLA Sanjay Rathod of Shiv Sena from the CM’s relief fund. The IMA observed one day OPD bandh to express solidarity with the agitating students. The alumini offered Rs5 lakh aid for the next of kin of Ashok Pal while IMA district unit has given Rs3 lakh to the family. One of the IMA members has declared to bear the education expenses of Pal’s younger brother and sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-police-suggest-mbbs-student-died-in-road-rage-3-real-killers-nabbed/articleshow/87691090.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Tripura violence fallout: 4-day curfew in Amravati, internet snapped||NAGPUR: As violence erupted in various parts of Amravati during the Saturday bandh call by saffron outfits, police imposed a four-day curfew and blocked internet in sensitive areas. Saturday’s bandh call was in response to Friday’s protest rallies by Muslim organizations to condemn the recent violence in Tripura. That rally witnessed stone-pelting in which some shops were damaged, leading to the bandh call. Internet services in the city will remain suspended for three days to prevent the spread of rumours that fuel violence, said city police commissioner Arti Singh. Internet towers have been blocked in the city’s sensitive areas. To aid the police force there, about hundred cops and 10 officers from Nagpur have been sent. Also, one or two companies of state reserve police force (SRPF) are expected to reach Amravati soon. BJP Amravati rural district president Nivedita Chaudhary has given a call for Amravati district bandh on Sunday. On Saturday morning, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags hands and raising slogans, came out on streets in Rajkamal Chowk area of the city, around 670km from Mumbai. Some members of the mob hurled stones at shops in Rajkamal Chowk and other places, police said, adding that the cops lathi-charged the protesters to bring the situation under control. Against the backdrop of back-to-back incidents of stone-pelting on Friday and Saturday, additional police commissioner Sandip Patil issued orders imposing curfew within the city limits under sections 144(1), (2), (3) of CrPc to avoid any untoward incidents. Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of houses. A gathering of more than five people is not allowed, as per the order. On Friday, stone pelting was reported during rallies taken out by Muslim organizations to protest against incidents in Tripura, at Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal. Police have so far arrested 20 people and detained four others by registering 20 FIRs under various charges, including rioting, in connection with Friday’s incidents. In Amravati, over 8,000 people had gathered outside the district collector’s office on Friday to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community in Tripura be stopped. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of Kotwali police station. Launching a veiled attack on opposition BJP, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the violence in Amravati and other places was aimed at destabilising the MVA government. Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Raut said the state government is firm in the saddle and real faces of the perpetrators of violence will be exposed soon. “Raising the bogey of violence, they (opposition) will meet the state governor and write letters to the Union home ministry claiming that the (law and order) situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating. This will happen in the future too. But the state government is firm in the saddle,” Raut said. State Congress president Nana Patole accused BJP of conspiring to provoke riots ahead of next year’s assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. “BJP wants to polarize the society ahead of UP elections. People should not fall prey to such tactics,” he said. Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said some anti-social elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by throwing stones at shops. “The state government will take necessary action. However, some people are using this for political gains,” she said and appealed to people to not believe rumours. The minister also urged all party leaders to strive to establish peace, in a meeting of the peace committee. Amravati MP Navneet Rana said politicians must now focus on bringing the situation under control. “I appeal to the guardian minister (Thakur) and (Sanjay) Raut saheb to please not politicize the issue. It is time for all to come together and ensure peace in our city,” said Rana in a video message. AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel also condemned the violence in Amravati. “I want to question those leaders in the state who came to power by taking the votes of Muslims why they didn’t condemn the violence in Tripura. If this violence in Maharashtra is a ‘tit for tat’ by any political party, then this is the example of irresponsibility,” he said. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it was wrong to organise rallies in the state for an incident that “never occurred” in Tripura and appealed to people to exercise restraint. “The Tripura government and local police have clarified that no religious place of a minority community was burned down. They have issued pictures of the same as well. I appeal to both the communities to observe restraint,” the former chief minister told reporters in Mumbai. He added that political parties in the state government should not give inflammatory statements. Meanwhile, 31 places have been earmarked as communally ‘sensitive’ in Nagpur and put under special security surveillance. Around 5,000 cops have been deployed across the city, including in plain clothes, and crime branch personnel have been assigned vigilance tasks. City police chief Amitesh Kumar has appealed to citizens to remain calm and refrain from spreading and believing rumours.

---||Kolkata||The Bounceback||Kolkata: Too many people miss the silver lining because they are expecting gold, but Kolkata’s leading real estate players know life is about finding those silver linings and turning them into gold. The pandemic blow notwithstanding, Credai’s national chairman H V Patodia, who is from the city, and its Bengal president Sushil Mohta are optimistic about a realty flourish in Kolkata and its suburbs. Both believe that the market momentum gathered in August-September and being carried forward to November could get better over the next few months. The reasons are aplenty. The Bengal budget has reduced the stamp duty by 2% on registration of all kinds of properties, which has been extended to January 31 by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In addition, the guideline value (circle rate) on properties has been reduced by 10%. H V PatodiaKnight Frank India — one of India’s leading real estate consultancies — noted that Kolkata Metropolitan Area or Greater Kolkata’s real estate market had received a major boost ever since the state government announced the 2% rebate on stamp duty for registration of all documents (except those of amalgamation of contiguous land) in its budget in July 2021. Experts feel the move has been instrumental in prompting homebuyers to complete registration of properties previously purchased as well as create new demand for the sector. In fact, buoyed by the stamp duty cut, 6,861 units were sold in Kolkata’s primary residential market in Q3 (July-September). Sushil MohtaAccording to data available, the Q3 period this year witnessed a total of 15,160 residential sales deeds being registered in KMA, marking a 122% year-on-year (YoY) growth over the third quarter of 2020. The months of July, August and September this year noted a YoY increase of 39%, 268% and 79% over the respective months of 2020. As the stamp duty cut was only applicable for 22 days in July, the real upward momentum came in August before slowing down in September owing to the onset of the inauspicious ‘Shradh’ period of 11 days, beginning September 20. “Owing to a period of heightened momentum in registration of residential sales deeds in August 2021, it constituted 48% of the quarterly total,” a real estate consultant said. Patodia said there was a major increase in demand in Kolkata. “The home loan rate is at its lowest, which is a reason,” he said. Mohta observed that the sentiment was strong in October and till date in November. “The trend is very encouraging as far as residential real estate is concerned. The first 10 days of this month have been really good,” he said. “The real estate industry has strongly coped with the challenges of the pandemic and has recuperated to follow a growth trajectory despite all odds. The past few months have been extremely encouraging for us, with sales touching record highs. As home loan interest rates are at a historic low and stamp duty has been slashed in an excellent initiative by the Bengal government, people are keen to buy homes. I am confident that this is just the beginning and the momentum will sustain itself in the coming months,” said Sanjay Jain, managing director of Siddha Group. Sanjay JainIn terms of micro-markets, south Kolkata emerged on top, accounting for nearly one-third of total residential sales deeds registered, followed closely by north Kolkata. A good number of residential sales deeds were registered in several municipalities in North and South 24 Parganas, which are part of modern-day Kolkata’s vast urban agglomeration. “While the stamp duty cut has pushed registration of residential sales deeds across micro-markets and apartment sizes, the highest percentage jump has been observed in the unit sizes of 93sqm (1,000sqft) and above. This is indicative of homebuyers, in possession of residential assets of a higher value, taking the advantage of the temporary window of stamp duty cut to come forward and register their assets. During the Q3 period this year, apartments above 93sqm saw a massive 403% jump in registration over the same quarter in 2020,” a leading consultant said. Siddharth PansariFor the first nine months of the 2021 calendar year, 35,149 residential sales deeds were registered, marking a 102% annual increase over the same period in 2020. Director of Primarc Group Siddharth Pansari said the last quarter had seen exceptional sales across segments in and around Kolkata. “The need for space in this hybrid virtual world has drastically increased and brought in permanent lifestyle changes like work-from-home or study-from-home. Even at increased prices, the demand is constant and will stay,” Pansari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-bounceback/articleshow/87691190.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rain, tired elephant herd throw up challenges for forest dept in E Burdwan||Burdwan: Cloudy weather and rain have posed fresh challenges to the forest department and the district administration trying to drive away a herd of elephants in East Burdwan. The animals walked 15-16km on Friday and are resting in Bhalki jungle under Ausgram (II) block. The calves — around 10 of them, including a newborn — have slowed the herd’s movement and it has rested for about 10 hours. The forest department has decided to give the elephants, who have strayed into villages, several hours’ break before attempting to drive them towards Bankura. This has been done so that the calves can recuperate and the herd can regroup after getting split up on Friday evening. While the calves were visibly tired after being shunted around by villagers and hulla parties, the splitting up of the pack into splinter groups may prove a headache for the department. Hulla teams from Bankura, East Burdwan and West Burdwan are waiting for the weather to clear before trying to reassemble the elephants. Two teams will be with the herd and another will keep close watch to avoid unwanted incidents with humans. One of the major challenges for forest officials will be vehicle movement on NH-2 when the animals cross the highway. Instructions have been given to control traffic. Debal Roy, principal chief conservator of forests, wildlife, told TOI: “If the weather is suitable, we will start drive work. Our teams and plan are ready.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-tired-elephant-herd-throw-up-challenges-for-forest-dept-in-e-burdwan/articleshow/87691077.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||SEC seeks security plan for Bengal municipal polls||Kolkata: The State Election Commission has asked the Bengal government to submit a detailed plan of security arrangements for Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporation elections on December 19. SEC chief Saurav Das held a meeting with chief secretary H K Dwivedi, home secretary B P Gopalika, health secretary N S Nigam and DGP Manoj Malviya on Saturday over the security arrangement on the day of polls and also on the hours of polling in tandem with provisions under the West Bengal Municipal Act. The SEC wanted to know from the state government if it wanted deployment of central forces apart from state police. State officials told the SEC that they had adequate state police personnel and would submit the proposed security arrangements for the polls on Tuesday. SEC officials said that by next week the number of voters for KMC would be finalised after getting details of the electorate in the 2021 Assembly polls. For HMC, the SEC will finalise it by December 5, as it will take time to omit the voters of Bally municipality. In 2015, Bally municipality was amalgamated with HMC and now it has been delinked. For KMC, the poll panel plans to use 5,000-plus booths keeping in mind the pandemic situation. For following Covid-safety norms, use of sanitizers and gloves have been suggested along with use of thermal guns at entry points. The SEC has started testing the EVMs to find out whether they are functioning properly. There will be no VVPAT with the EVMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sec-seeks-security-plan-for-bengal-municipal-polls/articleshow/87691056.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kunal submits Ramayana works to cops in defence of Sita statement||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress general secretary Kunal Ghosh on Friday submitted academic works on Ramayana to police in Tripura to prove that his “Sitar Patal Prabesh” (Sita’s entry to earth) remark didn’t amount to a criminal offence. Ghosh’s remark had led to five FIRs against him in Tripura, several lodged by police themselves, from hurting religious sentiments to criminal intimidation. He was questioned at Tripura’s Bagma police station on Friday by five officers. Ghosh stepped into the police station on Friday with the original text of Valmiki Ramayana, apart from the Oxford Companion to World Mythology by David Leeming. He was also carrying Nrisinghaprasad Bhaduri’s ‘Ramayani’, Haraprasad Mukhopadhyay’s ‘Khola Chokhe Ramayan’ and Nabanita Deb Sen’s treatise on Sita apart from several other research works. He also summarized his findings in a note and submitted that with the officials questioning him. “I never disrespected any religion or any epic. My statement was based on decades of research backed by scholarly articles and books,” Ghosh told the officers. “No part of the remark was a figment of imagination. They were from the Valmiki Ramayana and to negate my speech, the police will have to disown those portions of the epic too. There is a place at Bithoor in Uttar Pradesh where Sita is believed to have entered the abyss,” Ghosh said, speaking to TOI on Saturday. A few days ago, Ghosh had spoken on Sita’s ‘Patal Prabesh’, arguing that she was exiled when she was pregnant and, in the end, chose to end her worldly life. Ghosh had also spoken on the use of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans to spread political terror and intimidate and attack people, including women. The FIRs followed this statement, he said. Bhaduri, whose literary work was quoted by Ghosh, said: “When Sita was summoned before Ram from the jungle where she was exiled, she was again asked to pass through fire. That ground beneath her feet split wide open and she went inside. How we interpret that now is subjective. Even Laxman never agreed to her ordeal of fire.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kunal-submits-ramayana-works-to-cops-in-defence-of-sita-statement/articleshow/87691052.cms||---
---||Kolkata||32.5L fully jabbed in Kolkata with 32.4L vaccine-eligible population||KOLKATA: The number of people who have got both doses of their vaccine in Kolkata has now outstripped the city’s vaccine-eligible population. More than 32.5 lakh people in Kolkata have got both doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. The number of people eligible for the vaccine in the city is 32.4 lakh, according to Bengal government data shared with the Centre. A more detailed break-up of Kolkata’s 18-plus population is expected when the State Election Commission releases the voter list ahead of the December 19 Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls. Around 80.8 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in Kolkata till Saturday evening, out of which more than 48 lakh have received only their first dose and the rest both doses. The “apparent discrepancy in statistics” — vaccine recipients being more than the eligible population — can be explained by the large daily migratory population that Kolkata hosts, say officials. “Many people who come to work in the city may have taken the vaccine here instead of a health centre near home,” one official explained. Officials say the “100% double-dose” mark is more significant than what the numbers suggest. Kolkata, because of its population density and greater mobility, has been at the peak of Bengal’s Covid curve. It has reported 3.2 lakh Covid cases and 5,193 Covid deaths; it reported its first Covid case on March 23, 2020, and its first Covid death two days later. Over 20% of Bengal’s 16 lakh Covid cases and 27% of Bengal’s Covid deaths have been reported from the state capital. But Kolkata has also had the added advantage of a robust private-sector healthcare service to complement the KMC and state-run Covid Vaccination Centres. Officials have now set themselves the target of “rectifying” Kolkata’s vaccination gender gap. The city suffers from the sharpest male-female gap in the state when it comes to vaccination. More than 44 lakh of Kolkata’s vaccinated population of 80 lakh-plus are men; only about 36 lakh are women. The gap is much less in Bengal; 4.2 crore males have got the jab along with 4.1 crore females. About 2.4 crore of Bengal’s eligible population (of 7 crore) have received both their vaccine doses. The CoWin dashboard has captured several key vaccination trends over the last 30 days that suggested Kolkata was inching towards the “100% vaccination” target. Both government-run and private vaccination centres have seen the demand for the second shot rise in the recent past. The sharpest second shot-versus-first shot gap occurred on October 26; 38,097 people took their second dose that day compared to 6,388 first-dose recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/32-5l-fully-jabbed-in-kol-with-32-4l-vax-eligible-population/articleshow/87691427.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 52-year-old auto driver dies after falling into manhole in Dum Dum||KOLKATA: A 52-year-old man, who fell into an open manhole near Seven Tanks Road in Dum Dum on Friday night, died hours later in hospital. Locals pulled him out after hearing his screams and admitted him to RG Kar Medical College & Hospital where he died in the early hours of Saturday. Doctors said they tried flushing out the sewage water he had gulped but his condition deteriorated quickly and the toxins in the water could have led to his death. Autorickshaw driver Ranjan Saha had parked his rented auto at the owner’s residence at Seven Tanks and was on his way home in Dum Dum’s Bediapara about 15 minutes away when the mishap happened around 9.45pm. Saha’s shattered family blamed the civic authorities for turning a blind eye to the open manhole that claimed his life. His wife, Soma, said the death had plunged their lives into uncertainty as he was the sole bread earner. Their elder son Akash is in college while younger son Kisan studies in Class III. “Without a job, we will perish. There should be a proper investigation into the incident. We should be provided a job on humanitarian grounds,” she said. Tarak Singh, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation administrator overseeing sewerage and drainage department, blamed state PWD officials for not acting on an alert that the civic body had issued on missing manhole covers during the deluge in September. The chairman of KMC’s board of administrators, Firhad Hakim, said the police needed to conduct an inquiry into the death and find out what had actually happened. Ward coordinator Pushpali Sinha did not rule out the possibility of foul play but cops said there was no evidence of homicide. “No one has lodged a complaint. Prima facie, there is no evidence that he was pushed by someone,” a police officer said. Locals said the cover of the manhole into which Saha fell would often be removed at night by youths from the adjoining slum to relieve themselves. Some even claimed that Saha had toppled while relieving himself into it. One of Saha’s relatives, Chandrasekhar, said the 52-year-old probably did not spot the open manhole due to poor lighting at the spot. Missing manhole covers is not a new menace in Kolkata and its neighbourhoods. A racket stealing manhole covers at night and selling them as scrap iron still operates in some areas, said a civic official, recounting the tragic death of a toddler in Ultadanga area after the child fell into an open manhole a few years ago. The civic authorities seem to have learnt no lessons from a more recent example where a woman got trapped in an open manhole in New Town in September. The woman was rescued after two-and-a-half hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/52-year-old-auto-driver-dies-after-falling-into-manhole-in-dum-dum/articleshow/87691445.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||All in a day: CBSE 1st term exam, evaluation, uploading of marks||KOLKATA: Thirty minutes after board examinees finish writing their term one papers, the CBSE will release answer keys and school principals will have to ensure that the OMR sheets are corrected and marks uploaded on the CBSE portal the same day. This was among the announcements made by Sanyam Bhardwaj, the board’s controller of exams, at a virtual meeting with school heads and district/city co-ordintors on Saturday. This is the first time that such speedy same-day corrections will be done. Though the corrections and uploading of marks will be done in schools, the OMR sheets will have to be parcelled to the board the same day for random cross-checking. The corrections will be done by the teachers under the supervision of external observers appointed by the board. Each evaluator will be given 30 OMR sheets and the evaluation is to be done between 1:45 pm and 4 pm. The answer keys will be sent at 1 pm. It is not necessary for subject teachers to correct relevant OMR sheets. The marks will have to be uploaded on the CBSE portal between 4 pm and 4:30 pm. “I call this design-thinking. The board exam this time feels like any national-level competitive exam. Writing to uploading of marks will just take a few hours,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School. Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy felt this was fool-proof planning. “In these Covid times, one cannot delay anything. Introducing OMR sheets in board exams is indicative of how short and sharp processes are expected to be now,” she said. The board has also asked schools to open up multiple rooms and ensure that only 12 candidates are seated in a room to ensure distancing. It has asked schools to distribute mock OMR sheet test papers among examinees from Monday. “Last year’s situation of average marking led to many a heartbreak. This year, at least board examinees will be able to write an exam and earn the marks they deserve. We can only heartily accept the new CBSE X and XII format,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-in-a-day-cbse-1st-term-exam-evaluation-uploading-of-marks/articleshow/87691413.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||TMC picks Luizinho Faleiro for Rajya Sabha, Mahua Moitra to head Goa unit||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress named former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro as its candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal left vacant following the resignation of Arpita Ghosh nearly two months ago. TMC also tasked Mahua Moitra, its Krishnanagar MP, to immediately take charge of the party’s Goa unit. Faleiro will file his RS nomination on Tuesday and elections will be held on November 29. Faleiro, TMC’s all-India vice-president, is the third candidate from outside Bengal after Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Sushmita Dev to have received the party’s ticket for Rajya Sabha. “We are extremely pleased to nominate Luizinho Faleiro to the Upper House of Parliament. We are confident that his efforts towards serving the nation shall be appreciated widely by our people,” the AITC tweeted. Seventy-year-old former Navelim MLA Faleiro is TMC’s face in Goa when the party is making forays in the state after a resounding victory against BJP in the Bengal assembly polls. With TMC’s tally in the Bengal assembly rising to 218, Faleiro’s passage to Rajya Sabha is but a formality. Amid speculation that Faleiro’s nomination was a “broad hint” that the party might not project him as Trinamool’s CM face in the 2022 Goa assembly polls, party seniors put such speculation to rest saying that Faleiro would be contesting the Goa elections as well. Later, party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee issued a press release, which read that party chairperson Mamata Banerjee “looks forward to a brighter future for Goa, with All India Trinamool Congress paving the way with courage and wisdom”. The release said Moitra was being appointed TMC’s Goa unit’s state-in-charge with immediate effect. In a statement, Moitra thanked her party for the opportunity and said, “Looking forward to doing my very best.” Earlier, Trinamool had made Dev a part of the party’s Tripura committee, heading into the November 25 Agartala Municipal Corporation elections. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh seized the opportunity to say Trinamool chose to field a candidate from outside Bengal depriving “Banglar meye” (Bengal’s daughter) Arpita, who was made to resign from Rajya Sabha. Arpita said she was quite happy that a person like Faleiro was nominated for the seat she vacated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-picks-luizinho-for-rs-mahua-to-head-goa-unit/articleshow/87691051.cms||---

This dedicated system is first-of-its-kind for Coal India Limited (CIL) as well as Mahagenco. The Rs200 crore project has coal carrying capacity of 6,000 metric tonne per day. “The pipe conveyor system is a step in the direction of developing a modern, efficient and eco-friendly mode of coal transportation from mines to power project,” said Raut. He claimed that it will go a long way in mitigating environmental impact of road transproation by eliminating dispersed coal dust and vehicular emissions. “It will also help in avoiding coal pilferage and facilitate assured quality and quantity of coal to power plants at lower transport costs,” he said. The minister further said that a similar system of over 16.5km is being built from five mines in Nagpur WCL area to supply coal to Khaparkheda and Koradi power plants in Nagpur district. He also revealed plans for building a floating solar project having capacity of 105 MW power generation in Irai dam here. “We have given formal approval for the project worth Rs660 crore. Approval is pending with the Union ministry for unconventional energy,” he said adding that it will also provide employment to 100 people. Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar raised issue of high pollution caused by power plants and other industries, and welcomed the initiative of Mahagenco towards curbing pollution. On presence of tigers and other predators in CSTPS area, he demanded construction of a compound wall around the project area. He also raised concerns over fly ash from ash bund of CSTPS flowing into Irai river and demanded immediate measures. Energy minister Raut agreed to demand for the compound wall and assured that measures are being taken to strengthen the ash bund. Minister of state for power, Prajakt Tanpure, MLA Prathibha Dhanorkar, MLA Kishor Jorgewar, ZP president Sandhya Gurnule, higher officials of power ministry, Mahagenco and WCL were present during the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6km-pipe-conveyor-system-for-coal-transport-launched/articleshow/87691204.cms||---

Two soldiers were killed during a shootout with militants in the Hoshab area of Pakistan’s Turbat district, while a third soldier was killed while trying to clear an improvised explosive device in a related incident, the armed forces’ communications wing said. Earlier on Saturday, two policemen were killed and six civilians injured, including a young girl, in attacks in northern Pakistan near Afghanistan as local Taliban militants agreed a month’s ceasefire after talks with the government, police said. The cease-fire between Pakistani Taliban — known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan — and the Imran Khan government was announced on Tuesday. The policemen were killed by an improvised explosive device near the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where they were posted at a reservoir. “The other attack took place on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, where a policeman and five including a young girl and three women were injured. The explosives were planted in a motorcycle targeting a police patrol in the area, said Ali Raza, a senior police officer. A TTP spokesman denied responsibility for the attacks, saying the militant group will abide by the ceasefire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/5-securitymen-die-in-attacks-in-pakistan-near-afghanistan-border-amid-government-ttp-deal/articleshow/87692498.cms||---

They came in a car, used a gas cutter to open the machine and escaped in less than 20 minutes. The bank manager, Pankaj Kumar Panday, said, “We had closed the bank and the ATM kiosk at 6pm Thursday. Around 4.45am, I got a call from a local that the ATM kiosk was broken into. I came to the bank branch and informed the police.” “Thieves have stolen Rs 9.74 lakh from the ATM. We have a gunman during the daytime, but there is no guard at night, when the bank and the kiosk are closed,” he added. Police said the footage of the CCTVs installed in the area showed two masked men came in a car around 2.15am. “They first moved the cameras of two CCTVs installed outside the bank upwards with a stick so that their images were not recorded and then they sprayed a liquid on the CCTV camera installed inside the kiosk. The duo cut the cash box of the machine with a gas cutter and took out money. The theft was executed in around 15 to 20 minutes after which they sped away in their car,” said a cop. Bhondri police post in-charge ASI Daljit Singh said, “A case has been registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) and 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC. Even as we have asked the banks to deploy guards at night too, the branch had not.” Sources in police said, “The image of the vehicle in which the accused had come has been recorded in a camera, but it is difficult to see its registration number because of darkness.” Police said since the village is around 12 kilometre from Bondri police post, it is not easy for cops to ensure complete security there. Meanwhile, Ludhiana rural police on Friday asked the banks to deploy security guards and install secret cameras too. Ludhiana rural SSP Rajbachan Singh said, “The bank branch didn’t have a guard for night. We have asked the banks to take adequate measures. They have been directed to have hidden cameras, too.” SIMILAR INCIDENTS November 2, 2019: Masked men uprooted SBI’s Pakhowal branch ATM that contained more than Rs 23 lakh and escaped with it in wee hours June 3, 2019: Thieves tried to loot an ATM of a private bank at Heera Singh Road in Jagraon at night hours May 11, 2019: A group of miscreants decamped with a private bank’s ATM at Kishanpura Chowk, Hambran Road, after holding a security guard hostage at gunpoint November 10, 2017: Looters struck at an ATM in Qila Raipur village in Dehlon and ran away with lakhs of rupees after breaking the machine with gas cutters||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/thieves-break-open-atm-in-sidhwan-bet-flee-with-rs-9-74l/articleshow/87673444.cms||---

However, if they are found to be symptomatic for COVID-19 on arrival or during the home quarantine period, they shall undergo testing and treatment as per protocols. "Children under 5 years of age are exempted from both pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic for Covid-19 on arrival or during home quarantine period, they shall undergo testing and treated as per laid down protocol," the Health Ministry guidelines on November 11. The Health Ministry said that the guidelines for international arrivals in India have been reviewed in view of increasing vaccination coverage across the globe and the changing nature of the pandemic. "The global trajectory of Covid-19 pandemic continues to decline with certain regional variations. The need to monitor the continuously changing nature of virus and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) must still remain in focus," the guideline said. This standard operating procedure (SOP) shall be valid from November 12 (00.00 hours IST) till further orders, the Ministry stated. The revised guidelines also state that 15 days must have elapsed since the completion of the COVID-19 vaccination schedule. On arrival, de-boarding should be done, ensuring physical distancing and thermal screening of all passengers is carried out by the health officials present at the airport. Contacts of suspected cases are co-passengers seated in the same row, plus three rows in front and three rows behind, along with identified cabin crew.

---||Ludhiana||83% of dengue cases are from urban areas||Ludhiana: The district’s dengue count has climbed to a five-year high. Of the cases reported this year, around 83% were from urban areas, including Ludhiana city, Khanna and Jagraon. According to the health department report, the number of dengue cases in Ludhiana was 1,534 till November 12. It is the second-highest count since 2015, when 1,876 cases were registered. There were 1,509 cases in 2019 and 489 in 2018. Of this year’s 1,534 cases, 1,266 (82.5%) were from urban areas of the district. And of the 1,266 cases, 1,136 (89.7%) were from Ludhiana city. Khanna had 67 cases and Jagraon 63. The rural areas had 268 cases (17.47%). In rural parts, Koom Kalan had the highest 47 cases, Sahnewal had 44 and Sudhar 40. There are 3,811 suspected cases in the district. The health department officials said more cases were expected before November-end. A health department official said, “More cases are being reported from urban areas, as population density is more there as compared with rural sections. Dengue cases are reported in October and November. Steps are being taken to check the disease.” Officials said the department teams destroy larvae and the municipal corporation carries out fogging. Experts said cases were being reported because of various reasons. “Earlier, the cases would be more in one year and less in the other. However, there are fluctuations in cases every year. It depends on weather conditions too. Rain increases the incidence due to accumulation of water. In urban areas, cases are more as there is congestion with more close buildings and more close contact,” said Dr Daljit Singh, former principal of DMCH. The civil surgeon couldn’t be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/83-of-dengue-cases-are-from-urban-areas/articleshow/87673413.cms||Shariq Majeed

The officials are dependent upon the old receipts, if residents have maintained these, or they ask them to pay the fee, saying that it is quite nominal and will help in regularising their connections. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had, on November 9, asked the officials to conduct the survey in blocks 29, 31, 32 and 34. Out of these, unique identity numbers are linked to properties only in block 34 and the officials can check the records with one click, while for other blocks the UID numbers are yet to be attached. However, the officials claimed that employees ask for the receipt or some old water supply bill that can prove that their connection is legal, but failing to show any proof can get them a notice. All these four blocks cover 50% of the area falling under the MC. The officials claimed that there were 70,973 properties in block 29; 74,008 in 31; 31,688 in 32; and 33,064 in 34. Requesting anonymity, an official claimed that they were told to scan properties door to door, which was not possible. He said despite involving staff from other branches, it was proving difficult as office work suffered. MC superintendent Abdul Satar said, "Since there are old buildings in the areas, we are simply asking for some proof of legal connection. And in the absence of it, we are serving notices, giving them three days to bring proof or pay fee. Charges are nominal, so we are convincing people to pay to regularise their connections.” Another superintendent, Vivek Verma, said, “At first only a receipt or a bill is being checked. If it is not there, then employees check it through the UID number, as in block 34 all properties are linked with it.” Probe marked into overcharging plaint As soon as a video of three MC employees overcharging water and sewerage connection regularisation fee in ward 27 went viral, the officials of operation and maintenance cell recommended action against them. Executive engineer Ranbir Singh said, “We recommended action against them and now the MC commissioner will decide the next course.” Later in the day, MC commissioner marked an inquiry to joint commissioner Ankur Mahindroo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mcs-survey-for-checking-all-defaulters-ill-planned-exercise/articleshow/87673400.cms||---

However, in the evening, they called off the stir after getting an assurance on their demands from deputy chief minister O P Soni. Nurses’ association chairman Manjeet Kaur said, “Forty-nine staff nurses protested in support of their demands of pay parity, food, uniform allowances, removal of anomalies related to Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, regularisation of contractual staff, among others. We called off our strike after a meeting with deputy CM O P Soni, who said our demands will be fulfilled next week.”Even as they were on strike, contractual staff were working, so patient-care services were not affected, Manjeet Kaur added.The strike, however, gave patients a tough time. Neha, a resident of Giaspura, said, “I am pregnant and getting treated at civil hospital. On Friday, the services were hit. Doctors don’t have staff while they were seeing patients. I had come on Monday, too, but had to return because of the strike and on Friday I had to wait for long.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/patients-hassled-as-nurses-go-on-strike-at-civil-hosp/articleshow/87673352.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP may fix onus of restoring road on agency that digs it up||BENGALURU: BBMP plans to implement a rule pinning the responsibility of restoring a road on the agency that digs it up. Additional chief secretary and BBMP administrator Rakesh Singh said, "The coordination between civic agencies is not great. Roads are being dug up by Bescom, BWSSB, KPTCL, and even OFC companies. Hence, we are planning to implement a rule mandating that whichever agency digs up a road will be completely responsible for restoring it once work is over. The ward-level Palike engineer will supervise things." At present, agencies ask BBMP for permission to dig up roads and have to a deposit with it an amount for restoration work. Singh said these days, many agencies tend to just say they have paid the money. "The new rule will bring in a lot of transparency into the system and is also likely to put an end to the blame game that leads to delay in road restoration," he said. Citizens welcomed the initiative but wondered if the BBMP has thought things through. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha said, on paper, it is definitely a good rule, do agencies that dig up roads have the competence to restore them? BBMP must also impose penalty on agencies that fail to restore roads in the given time frame. Citizen groups also believe ward committees should be informed about the roads that will be dug up and they should also be part of the restoration process, as it is they who will suffer if it is not done properly. Jagadeesh Reddy, a member of NGO Varthur Rising, said, "The concept that the responsibility of road restoration lies with the agency that digs it up is ideal. But do the other agencies have the expertise to carry out this work as BBMP would? A detailed study needs to be done into this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-bbmp-may-fix-onus-of-restoring-road-on-agency-that-digs-it-up/articleshow/87692601.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar row: Forest principal secretary wanted ‘action taken’; Bennichen Thomas a scapegoat?||IDUKKI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After documents in the public domain made it clear that the Kerala government was in cahoots with the Tamil Nadu government to cut trees at the Mullaperiyar dam site, the LDF regime quickly suspended chief wildlife warden Bennichen Thomas for issuing the controversial order. However, two letters (accessed by TOI) from the principal secretary of forest department to four senior forest officials seeking necessary clearance for felling of trees near the baby dam reveal that Bennichen was possibly being made a scapegoat and that he had only acted on orders from people higher up in the hierarchy. The first letter, dated October 19, 2020, addressing principal chief conservator forests and head of forest force, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, principal chief conservator of forests (forest management) and deputy director of Periyar Tiger Reserve — with subject: 'Forest and wildlife department; strengthening of baby dam, removal of shrubs and felling of trees in and around Mullai Periyar Dam, Baby Dam, Necessary clearance requested’ — asks them to take action and furnish an action taken report. A letter for Tamil Nadu public works department, dated September 3, 2020, is mentioned as a reference. The letter from forest principal secretary states: “I am to forward herewith a copy of the letter referred above and to request you to take action in the light of Honourable Supreme Court verdict, existing rules and directions of government of Kerala in this regard and furnish a detailed action taken report to government urgently.” After nine months, the forest principal secretary again sent a letter to the same officials and sought a detailed action taken report. This letter, which mentions the earlier letter dated October 19, 2020, states: “I am to invite your attention to the reference cited and to request you to furnish the detailed action taken report called for therein to the government urgently. Copy of the reference cited is enclosed herewith for ready reference.” Meanwhile, forest minister A K Saseendran continues to claim that he was unaware of any such development. Saseendran is reportedly upset that the forest principal secretary along with other officials kept him in the dark about the orders issued on tree cutting at Mullaperiyar. The minister himself, and his party NCP, have sought action against the forest department officials. NCP state president P C Chacko said he has asked the chief minister to take strict action against the officials. “The order has been issued without the knowledge of the forest minister, which means that serious disciplinary action will have to be taken against the officials. When it comes to interstate issues, the minister and government have to take decisions, not officials,’’ said Chacko. “The principal forest secretary's letters reveal that the chief wildlife warden issued the tree felling order following pressure from the top level,” said environmentalist M N Jayachandan. "It has to be noted that Bennichen Thomas had denied permission for tree cutting near baby dam area earlier when he was deputy director, Periyar Tiger Reserve. The new tree felling order shows that some people used these officials as tools for implementing their agenda," Jayachandran added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mullaperiyar-row-forest-principal-secretary-wanted-action-taken-bennichen-thomas-a-scapegoat/articleshow/87692591.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The Tele-Law initiative of the Department of Justice, launched in 2017, is a free service for the poor and marginalised sections of the society. The downloadable app version of the service available on phones would help to rapidly expand its reach and cover the entire population where those eligible will continue to get free service. It has already helped more than 12 lakh beneficiaries, including people from SC/ ST communities and women. Rijiju had earlier mentioned that the government is working towards taking the justice delivery system to the doorstep of the people. Rijiju, who felicitated frontline Tele-Law workers assembled from across the country, said downloading the ‘Citizens Tele-Law Mobile App’ would optimise the citizen centric justice delivery mechanism. The Tele-Law app is a first of its kind initiative wherein anyone can download the application and avail services of a lawyer, according to the law ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-launches-mobile-app-version-of-tele-law-service/articleshow/87692638.cms||---

One person is feared to have been washed away at Mullaiyaru while state disaster response force and police rescued 2,267 people belonging to 755 families and relocated them to 48 rescue centres. Flooded tracks and landslips disrupted Nagercoil-Thiruvananthapuram and Nagercoil-Tirunelveli rail traffic. "More than 40,000 cusecs of water flowed through Thamiraparani river at Kuzhithurai on Saturday evening against the river's capacity of 20,000 cusecs," an official said. The district recorded an average rainfall of 100.48mm in 24hours till 8am on Saturday. In Chennai, at least 78 locations and 167 streets continued to face water stagnation on Saturday. Some areas in Alwarpet, Kodambakkam, Madhavaram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Semmencherry and Perumbakkam continued to remain under knee-deep water. The IMD said a new low-pressure area had formed over south Andaman Sea at 8.30am on Saturday. While the city may be spared from the new weather system, some areas may get light to moderate spells for the next two days due to a cyclonic circulation. The state government, meanwhile, formed a 14-member panel under retired bureaucrat V Thiruppugazh to to suggest ways to devise flood control methods and design storm water drains to reduce flood impact.

While the ruling YSRC holds a clear edge in all municipalities and Nellore, all eyes will be on the contest in Kuppam, which is the constituency of TDP chief and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. Kuppam, which was upgraded into a municipality after the YSRC came to power in the state in 2019, is going for its first election. The town is the headquarters of the assembly constituency, and has been voting for TDP and Naidu since 1989. While the former chief minister is taking it as a prestige issue and has deputed senior leaders of the party, including his son Nara Lokesh, for campaigning, the ruling YSRC is keen to win wrest the municipality. Besides the 12 municipalities and Nellore municipal corporation, by-elections are being held in 12 divisions in seven municipal corporations, and 13 wards in 12 municipalities across the state following the death of the candidates in the elections held earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stage-set-for-pending-ap-local-body-polls-as-campaign-ends/articleshow/87692656.cms||Gopi Dara

However, after the videos of minor girls levelling sexual abuse charges against the pastor went viral in social media, the police intervened and booked a case against him on Saturday. According to a senior police officer, the accused has been taken into custody and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/pastor-booked-under-pocso-act-for-abusing-minor-girls-in-aps-kurnool/articleshow/87692681.cms||---
---||India||India under Congress was semi-Islamic state, says BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday said barring the interregnum of the Vajpayee government, India before 2014 was a semi-Islamic state. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi also alleged that Congress member Rahul Gandhi’s derogatory remark on Hinduism led to violence in Maharashtra and fake news was purposely spread after large scale ruckus took place across the state. “Under the Congress rule, India was partially a Muslim nation. I’m saying so with full responsibility because Sharia provisions were part of the constitutional system,” he said, referring to practice like instant talaq, now barred, and grant of Haj subsidy, since discontinued. In an apparent reference to the Rajiv Gandhi government bringing a law to override an SC order in the Shah Bano case, Trivedi said the judgment was overruled to give primacy to Sharia provisions. “Overriding an SC judgment was not done even in a Muslim state,” Trivedi said, adding, “Insulting Hindu religion is in Congress DNA.” He alleged that the violence in Maharashtra over the “false” news of mosques being targeted in Tripura and Congress leaders’ comments attacking Hindutva were part of a conspiracy. “Large scale violence, Rahul’s remark against Hindutva and Salman Khurshid comparing Hindutva with Islamic terrorist outifts can’t be a coincidence but smacks of a larger conspiracy of spreading hatred against Hindu religion,” he said. Trivedi said it was Rahul’s tirade against Hindu religion, which stirred Congress workers in Maharashtra. “It seems he has been an inspiration to his party workers in Maharashtra in defaming Hindutva and driving an organised campaign to stoke communal discord and violence,” he added. Asserting that Shivaji’s rule was also associated with Hinduism, Trivedi said leaders like Rahul can’t comprehend the concept and asked him to read up his own party stalwarts like Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Jawaharlal Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-under-congress-was-semi-islamic-state-says-bjp/articleshow/87692695.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Brisk business during Diwali washed out by rain||CHENNAI: After months of poor business due to pandemic, the hospitality and retail sector in the city was badly affected by the recent rain. Footfalls in restaurants and retail shops that had picked up during the festival season, dropped significantly, while the occupancy rate at hotels in Chennai and in the tourist hotspot of Mamallapuram was minimal. Business establishments in the commercial hub of Pondy Bazaar that was bustling till the Diwali weekend are yet to revive from the impact of rain. An eatery with empty seats has trimmed its menu because of poor footfalls over the past four days. On Saturday, though parking was full along the 'Pedestrian Plaza', the weekend crowd was missing.  The situation was similar in the wholesale and retail textile market of Washermenpet. Hotels in the city and Mamallapuram recorded several cancellations of bookings due to heavy rain and some conferences scheduled at five-star facilities were put off this week. For instance, TTDC's Beach Resort Complex at Mamallapuram has only 30% to 40% confirmed reservations, which touched 95% in the past three months. G Venkat, an employee at an ornaments outlet at Pondy Bazaar said business and walk-ins had dipped. "Our business picked up during Ayudha Puja and peaked during Diwali, but fell flat due to rain. When shops reopened post-Covid lockdown, there was a shortage of products, while customers were available. Now, products are in plenty, but no takers," he said. A V S Marimuthu, high-level committee member of Washermenpet Cloth Merchants Association said the market records an average sale of 100 crore daily. "Diwali saw brisk business. However, rain cost our business, which is hardly 10% of the normal trade in our market," he said, adding that traders were expecting a revival from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-brisk-business-during-diwali-washed-out-by-rain/articleshow/87692708.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Police on Friday visited a park in the city where namaz is regularly offered after a photo of the congregation was tweeted by a user and asked the gathering not to offer Friday prayers there. On Friday, Twitter user Tribhuwan Pratap Singh posted the photo of the Noida Authority park in Sector 65 where namaz was being offered. Tagging official Twitter handles of Noida police, UP Police, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s office and others, Singh tweeted: “This is not a masjid but a park in Sector 65. 250 members of Muslim community are offering namaz here in violation of Covid guidelines. Please take note.” In 2018, when protests in Gurugramhappened for the first time, police had stopped Friday prayers at a park in Sector 58. “A controversy had been witnessed over offering of namaz at the Noida Authority park in December 2018. A notice was issued by the Sector 58 police station to companies in the area to ask their employees not to offer namaz collectively at a public park. After that, it stopped. Then Covid happened. Now that the situation is improving, people have again started to offer namaz here,” a police officer told TOI. Phase III SHO Vivek Trivedi said they took note of the tweet and visited the spot where several workers employed in the nearby export, garment and other factories had gathered. “The community members had been offering namaz collectively. They were informed that since 2019, namaz was not being allowed at the public park and it cannot be allowed in future as well. They were explained the rule and they promised they will not offer namaz here again,” Trivedi said. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar told TOI as per rules, any religious activity could not be allowed at a public place. Among those who tweeted to question the namaz gathering at the Sector 65 park was Ambuj Bharadwaj, social media coordinator for Panchjanya, the weekly magazine published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/namaz-stopped-at-noida-park-after-tweet/articleshow/87691444.cms||Shikha Salaria

Of the amount, the five allegedly withdrew Rs 2.5 lakh from his bank account. In his police complaint, Ravi Kumar, a Nandgram resident employed as a sanitary worker at a Delhi school, claimed that he had given a loan of Rs 2.5 lakh to a woman, named Neelam, introduced to him by one of his acquaintances. When Ravi asked Neelam to pay up as agreed upon earlier, she expressed her inability to repay the loan and promised to arrange a bank loan instead, “which the victim needed for giving alimony to his wife as part of their divorce”, according to the complaint. “I was in dire need of money, so I agreed to their proposal. Neelam introduced me to her friend Hemlata and with help of two others — Omkar and Kuldeep — helped me in opening a bank account with the UP Cooperative Bank’s Raj Nagar Extension branch,” said Ravi. The four allegedly told Ravi that they knew the bank manager who would help him in procuring a loan of Rs 3 lakh. “They made me sign some blank documents and took a couple of leaves from my cheque book.” “The amount was subsequently transferred into my account, but much later I realised that I owed the bank Rs 5 lakh. I also came to know that they had fraudulently withdrawn Rs 2.5 lakh from my account using the signed cheques that they had taken from me,” Kumar said. On his complaint, an FIR under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471(forging document) and 506 (criminal intimidation) was lodged against the five accused at the Kavinagar police station on Friday. “We have registered a case against Neelam, Hemlata, Omkar, Kuldeep and the manager of the Cooperative Bank. They had allegedly conspired to cheat the victim,” said a police officer. “No one has been arrested yet. A probe is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bank-manager-among-5-booked-for-duping-customer/articleshow/87691454.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Bengaluru||Post Covid, diabetes seen in many 30-40 year olds in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Doctors in city hospitals have come across a trend of people in the 30-40 age group, all of whom have recovered from Covid-19, seeking treatment for diabetes. While some experienced extreme fatigue, others suffered from eyerelated problems, only to know later that they’ve been living with undiagnosed diabetes. “Compared to the pre-pandemic era, the number of youngsters seeking treatment for diabetes has shot up by 5-10% now. They have all recovered from Covid. We don’t know if Covid itself has been a contributing factor. The virus seems to have affected beta cells in the pancreas which produce insulin. In some cases, overuse of steroids during the treatment may also have led to diabetes,” said Dr Dwarakanath CS, endocrinologist. He added that in many cases, the person would be having pre-existing diabetes, but was diagnosed only after testing positive for Covid. As per the state health and family welfare department, a majority of the Covid burden was seen among youngsters in the age group of 30-39. Over 6.8 lakh Covid patients in Karnataka were in this bracket. Doctors at Apollo Hospitals have taken up a study to understand how many patients developed diabetes post Covid. “Diabetes status among Covid-recovered persons is being studied. In five cases that I have come across, diabetes was noticed post Covid. They came to us when they suffered from an eye infection or developed a blood clot in the retinal vein. These are post-Covid sequelae which we are seeing now,” said Dr Shalini Shetty, senior consultant ophthalmologist, Apollo Hospitals. While all the five cases of eye-related issues were seen in Covid-recovered persons below 40, one of them was a woman, said Dr Shetty. A senior doctor from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute said Covid impaired blood sugar levels among many patients and has led to insulin dependence in some. “The pandemic is still on and we don’t know if the onset of diabetes seen after Covid is reversible with medication,” the doctor said, refraining from commenting on the exact percentage of new diabetes cases. “It’s tough to quantify the rise in diabetes, unless a study is done locally,” the professor said. Covid directly could cause diabetes or precipitate it in a person with risk factors, by causing insulitis or inflammation of the endocrine tissues in the pancreas that regulate glucose levels, and hence lead to elevated sugar levels, said the doctor. Dr Pallavi D Rao, endocrinologist, Specialist Hospital, said one of the first questions she asks her patients is if they were infected with Covid earlier. “The question is pertinent as medicines have to be tailored differently for those with post-Covid recovery. We don’t know how the pandemic is going to pan out, but Covid has led to substantial risk of diabetes,” said Dr Rao. Irrespective of the pandemic, diabetes is increasing every decade, said Dr Swathi Sachin Jadhav, endocrinologist from Sagar hospitals. She said in some cases, people who had no diabetes prior to Covid, have seen its onset. “We tested past three months’ sugar levels of Covid patients when they showed high sugar levels. In some patients, there was no history of high sugar levels prior to the infection and the onset of diabetes happened during Covid. However, there are several unanswered questions on the new onset of diabetes post Covid,” said Dr Jadhav. According to Dr Manohar KN, secretary, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India, Karnataka, though there is definitely a rise in diabetes cases because of Covid leading to insulitis, lockdown-induced weight gain could have also caused the condition. “It would be too early to quantify the increase in diabetes cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/post-covid-diabetes-seen-in-many-30-40-year-olds-in-karnataka/articleshow/87692740.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Pilot is expected to become a general secretary in Congress. The post of media in charge (communications department) is up for change as Randeep Surjewala is holding the dual charge of media and general secretary in charge of Karnataka. It is to be seen if Pilot gets the charge of a state or some other position. Pilot on Friday met party president Sonia Gandhi at her residence in the national capital amid speculations of a possible cabinet reshuffle and other key appointments in Rajasthan. After the meeting, Pilot said Congress wants to strengthen the state organisation ahead of the assembly elections which will be held in 2023. On Thursday, Pilot met senior Congress leader KC Venugopal ahead of the Gehlot-Sonia Gandhi meeting. The much-awaited cabinet rejig and appointments have been pending ever since the Covid pandemic broke out. The Assembly by-polls had also been delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speculation-rife-sachin-pilot-could-be-made-aicc-general-secretary/articleshow/87692742.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Galloping fuel prices force Musthafa to commute to school on horseback||THRISSUR: When schools reopened in Kerala on Nov 1, after more than a year and a half, one thing that was bugging most parents was transportation for the kids -- there was no guarantee of social distancing in crowded school buses while more exclusive conveyance would bore a big hole in their already Covid depleted pockets. Veliparambil Akbar from Chenthrappinni killed both birds (safety and expense) with one stone -- he bought a horse for his son Muhammad Musthafa to ride to Government LP School, Korikkuzhi, where he is a third standard student. “I bought the horse for about Rs 1.20 lakh, and I raised the money by selling my Bullet,’’ Akbar said. He says he has to spend around Rs 180 per day to maintain the horse, and feels it's less expensive than maintaining a sedan. He is also now free from the fear of his 8 yr-old getting infected during the commute to school and back. Akbar’s two elder sons are studying in nearby schools. The six-year old mare, christened Surumi, is quite docile, and Akbar was able to learn horse-riding by himself. Lessons in the YouTube channels also came in handy and he taught his three sons to handle Surumi at the nearby beach. Akbar, who is working as a construction contractor, uses his horse for work-related travel as well. “I bought the horse from a trader in Palakkad three months ago. My son has already learnt horse-riding. Now I accompany him to school, and bring back the horse after dropping him. Eventually we are planning to tether the horse somewhere near the school and keep some feed and water near it. My son will then be able to ride alone,” Akbar said. Musthafa of course is ecstatic, not just because of the daily saunter but also the attention it has brought him. “I’m thrilled to go to school on horseback. My schoolmates and teachers are also happy. Some friends are asking me to teach them horse riding,” Musthafa said. Incidentally, in April 2019, a girl student C A Krishna had ridden a horse to Holy Grace Academy in Mala to appear for CBSE 10th standard examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-galloping-fuel-prices-force-musthafa-to-commute-to-school-on-horseback/articleshow/87692755.cms||T Ramavarman

Her cremation is scheduled to take place in Delhi on Sunday. Mayawati’s father Prabhu Dayal passed away almost exactly a year back on November 19, at the age of 95 years. The news of the death was issued by party’s national general secretary and MP Satish Chandra Mishra who said that Ramrati was undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital and died of heart failure. “May everyone get the strength to bear this loss. Her final rites will be conducted on Sunday after Behenji reaches Delhi and other family members can also come together,” Mishra said. Party sources said that immediately after getting the news of her mother’s death, the former UP chief minister left for Delhi and paid her last respects to her mother at her Thyagaraj Road residence. “Behenji was extremely close to her parents and after losing her father in 2020, she had directed party workers not to celebrate her birthday this year, which is ordinarily a big event for us. She had been in Lucknow for several days due to elections but left as soon as she received the sad news on Saturday afternoon.

On Friday, the US justice department said Bannon, 67, was indicted on one count for refusing to appear for a deposition last month and the other for refusing to provide documents in response to the committee's subpoena.  He is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday and will appear in court that afternoon, a law enforcement official said. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Bannon’s indictment reflects the justice department’s “steadfast commitment” to the rule of law. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars. The indictment came as a second expected witness, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, defied his own subpoena from the committee on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bannon-indicted-for-contempt-over-congress-capitol-riots-inquiry/articleshow/87692808.cms||---
---||Chennai||It's raining paint parties now||CHENNAI: When she wanted to throw her friend a bridal shower, Karishma Menon and her gang of girls decided to paint the town red. Literally. With acrylic paints, brushes and aprons, they filled their canvases with the silhouette of a woman against a vivid backdrop. “We wanted to do something different and had seen photos of paint parties on Instagram. Since the bride loves painting, we thought a paint party would be fun,” says Karishma. “We hosted it at a café, all of us wore pink. It was therapeutic, especially as the bride was stressed out with all the wedding planning.” Private paint parties — where people get together to learn how to create a painting from scratch under the guidance of an instructor — are getting popular across cities. While earlier they were held in malls, public spaces, art galleries, and for corporates, outfits are now curating these creative experiences for weddings, birthdays, kitty parties and anniversaries. Playing with colours can be destressing and healing. And paint parties are ideal when you are cooped up at home due to the pandemic or the inclement weather as they can also be held online. Indrajala Moturi and Mridul Sahuwala, founders of IlluminArty which organised the paint party for Karishma and her friends, initially focused on doing art workshops for corporates when they launched their company in 2017. “We did our first public paint part in Chennai in December 2018 at a lounge bar and after that there was no turning back. And when we held public events, we got bookings for private parties,” says Indrajala, adding that IlluminArty is an experiential creative workshop company. “A paint party is a 90-minute guided art session where a resident artist or IlluminArtist teaches participants step by step how to create a painting,” says Indrajala, adding that the theme is conceptualised beforehand. “We did one, based on the artist S H Raza on request, and also a 1990s theme party. The venue is chosen by the host. We provide the art material — easel, canvas, brushes, acrylic paint — and the guests get to keep the painting they make.” Ruchi Mehta, founder of The Paint Social which has hosted paint parties across the country, says they did get requests to conduct these parties for baby showers during the pandemic. “Many people wanted to do it before and after the second wave. We prefer offline events as it’s a social event where people meet, chat, relax and paint,” she says. “And I prefer to have a minimum of 10 people though we have hosted it for 100 to 200 people when we do corporate events.” Other companies, like IlluminArty, switched to virtual parties during the pandemic. “We did Insta Lives every Friday and Saturday and our followers painted with us. So we began doing online events, where we sent kits to people and then hosted a 60-minute session on Zoom,” says Indrajala. Drishya Gupta, for instance, threw her mother Seema Goyal a paint party to mark her 50th birthday last year. “It was in August and the pandemic was raging. So I wanted to do something special but also ensure it was safe. So I got six or seven of her friends home, the instructor got online and we all made a painting of a ballerina,” she says. “I served wine, finger food and everyone had a great time as few of them had ever painted on a canvas or used an easel.” Mumbai-based Vinisha Savla, founder of Paintology, has also been conducting virtual paint parties across the country. “Many people are WFH in their hometowns, so we send art kits to them and then decide the day and time,” says Vinisha, who launched the company four-and-a-half years ago after a trip to Australia with her husband. “We were strolling down the streets of Surfers Paradise and saw a small place where people were seated, sipping on wine and painting. The concept was really new to me but playing with colours really de-stresses you.” And that’s the charm of these parties. “Each colour has a property — blue is cool and soothing, green is close to nature,” says Vinisha, whose company specialises in acrylic painting and fluid art, where you pour colours on canvases to create unique art works. “We create a cut-out of your initial and pour paint on to it,” she says. And while most participants are newbies apprehensive of wielding a brush, all companies have instructors who make the process simple and destressing. “Anybody, of any age, can paint. I introduce people to the medium and they get so engrossed that they don’t even know how three hours have gone by,” says artist Virali Vatsal Shah, who works with Paintology. There are no hard and fast rules. “If it is a detailed painting, the drawing is already done so guests can just focus on the painting. But there is no restriction, you can use your imagination and add whatever you want to the painting,” says Virali. Ruchi says they have different concepts. “For a corporate team building event, we broke down a painting into 16 different canvases and each person painted one bit,” she says. Charges vary depending on the number of people, medium, and so, but usually ranges between ₹1,500 and ₹3,000 a head. But, for the participants, it is all about the experience. “None of us knows how to paint and we were nervous about it. But our paintings turned out well. They are a memory of the bridal shower we had,” says Karishma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-raining-paint-parties-now/articleshow/87692811.cms||Priya Menon
---||Lucknow||Azamgarh backed 2 former CMs, got nothing in return: Yogi Adityanath||AZAMGARH: Taking a potshot at Samajwadi Party (SP) leadership, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that “Azamgarh backed two former CMs and also sent them to Parliament. But, the duo distorted the image of the district and created a crisis of identity for the people of the area as this place turned into a harbour of extremists and terror modules.” Addressing a public meeting following foundation laying of the state university here on Saturday by Union home minister Amit Shah, the CM said, “Development work is taking place in the same Azamgarh, which had given two chief ministers to UP and also sent the duo to Parliament, but ironically they only tarnished its image. The youth of Azamgarh used to be denied entry into hotels and not given rooms on rent whenever they went outside the state and the people of the area were facing an identity crisis.” ‘4.5L got jobs in my tenure, none kin of PM, Shah or mine’The CM added, “These were the same people who divided the society in the name of caste and promoted only family members and relatives.” Targeting SP over dynastic politics, CM Yogi said, “Whenever a job recruitment drive was started in its regime, the members of a family and their relatives used to roam like characters of Mahabharata to extort money from the aspirants. In my regime, government jobs have been offered to 4.5 lakh youth while 3 lakh youth have been recruited on contract basis. And none of them are relatives of Modi, Shah or myself.” Taunting SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for not even visiting his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh during the Covid-19 pandemic, Yogi said: “Members of this family will come in elections to mislead and win, but they would never be seen helping people of their constituency during a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.” “But, in the same Azamgarh where over one lakh migrant labourers returned during the pandemic, my government not only ensured their safe return but also arranged free ration, tests, medicine and vaccine. “The free ration distribution will continue among 15 crore beneficiaries till the festival of Holi in 2022,” he added. Yogi said, “Now, Azamgarh has changed and Purvanchal Expressway is becoming the pivot of your development. The airport of the district is 95% complete. UP’s youth will be ‘smart youths’ as the government is all set to give smart phones and tabs in their hands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/azamgarh-backed-2-former-cms-got-nothing-in-return-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87692818.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Chennai||When tech meets Tholkappiyam: Chennai artists collaborate for NFT musical project that can be heard in 19,440 ways||CHENNAI: On a chilly evening at Manhattan’s glittering Terminal 5 earlier this month, thousands watched as digital artist Beeple’s iconic $69 million non-fungible token (NFT), ‘Everydays — The First 5000 Days’, made its public debut. And setting the tone for this historic event — the world’s first NFT-focused music, art, and technology festival titled ‘Dreamverse’ — were sounds from the Tamil soil. In the project titled ‘Pann’, musical moods that outline landscapes such as Kurinji (mountain), Neidhal (ocean) and Marudham (agricultural fields) in ancient Sangam literature, have been woven into a sublime arrangement of programmable music by 41 visual and musical artists from Chennai. The project was commissioned for the mega event by MetaKovan (aka Vignesh Sundaresan), founder and financier of the NFT investment fund Metapurse. But in what will be a colossal milestone for independent artists from Tamil Nadu, ‘Pann’ will be minted as an NFT on Async Art — an experimental art movement built on the blockchain — in November. The initiative promises to open those like Chennai singer and music composer Pradeep Kumar and Tamil folk star Anthony Daasan up to a burgeoning tribe of collectors and connoisseurs fuelling the NFT market. “When the project came to us a couple of months ago, we were led by one strong drive: to connect as many artists as possible directly to a global audience,” says Pradeep, also the brain behind ‘Pann’. “The greatest gift of a block chain-powered art space is that it empowers the artist to perform with complete ingenuity and freedom, and witness their value addition to a vast, evolving and decentralised space,” he says. The musical piece comes in 19,440 combinations it can be heard in. These are created out of nine layers containing a wide range of instruments, vocals and ambient sounds. So, if a collector buys one layer, they can literally fashion out the master track as per their choice using the variations available to them. Variations for each layer have also been recorded live — including sounds from different landscapes of Tamil Nadu and electronic layers from a modular synthesiser. The technology has been developed on the Etherium blockchain that enables smart contracts and royalties to be coded into it. So, for every layer and master track purchased, the artist gets remunerated through an automated system. "This is really the beauty of the NFT space. It cuts out the intervention of record labels and streaming platforms – which in this case - could be likened to middlemen. The artist gets their due and the audience gets the real worth of the artwork they’re purchasing,” says Radar With a K, an independent music producer and one of the artists in ‘Pann’ Anthony Daasan, who has painstakingly worked his way up from singing at funerals to becoming an indisputable voice of folk art in Tamil cinema, sees this as an opportunity to catapult struggling folk artists to brave new heights. “I am determined to include as many of our brothers and sisters in this movement. It could keep precious performing traditions alive and incentivize the younger generation to flourish them,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-tech-meets-tholkappiyam-chennai-artists-collaborate-for-nft-musical-project-that-can-be-heard-in-19440-ways/articleshow/87692828.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Maoists abduct, kill 2 villagers in Balaghat||BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Maoists have stepped up violence in the vicinity of Kanha National Park, killing two villagers in Balaghat district in an apparent revenge attack in the wee hours of Saturday after branding them police informers. A band of 15-20 armed Maoists kidnapped victims Jagdish and Santosh from their homes in Malakhedi village around 3am on Saturday, Balaghat SP Abhishek Tiwari said. They dragged the duo to a spot near the village where a woman Maoist had been gunned down last year, and shot them dead. This is the second Maoist killing in a year, and the seventh in four. Maoists left letters on the bodies, accusing them of working for the police, and asking SP Tiwari "not to influence people in the region". On November 7, 2020, a 25-year-old woman Maoist, Sharda, carrying a reward of Rs 8 lakh, was killed in an encounter with police near Malakhedi in Baiher, some 90km from the district headquarters and 450km from Bhopal.  Jagdish and Santosh were killed by the Maoists' Khatia-Mocha Dalam, which is active in Balaghat and tribal-dominated Mandla districts of MP, said police.  It could be retaliation for the killing of Sharda, who was a native of Bijapur in neighboring Chhattisgarh and was wanted in 18 cases. She was member of Khatia-Mocha Dalam, and carried bounties of Rs 3 lakh in Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5 lakh in Chhattisgarh. A month later, in December 2020, two more women Maoists - Savitri and Shoba - were shot dead in an encounter with security forces in Balaghat. They were members of Darrekasa and Malajkhand Dalams. The gunfight took place in Borevan forest in Kirnapur, about 100km from Malakhedi. Police officers say that a portion of Kanha National Park is virtually under the control of Maoists. Forest guards don't patrol those areas, and neither are tourists allowed there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-maoists-abduct-kill-2-villagers-in-balaghat/articleshow/87692885.cms||---

While it stood at 441 on the day, it was 448 the previous day. According to the officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a reduction in moisture content during the day and marginal rise in wind speed have allowed slight dispersal of pollutants, but the AQI is likely to stay in the ‘severe’ to ‘very poor’ categories for the next few days due to unfavourable weather conditions. All monitoring stations in the city reported ‘severe’ air on Saturday. The AQI reading was 435 at Gwalpahari, 403 at Sector 51, 414 at Teri Gram and 409 at Vikas Sadan. “Winds have picked up speed during the daytime with a speed of 6-8 kmph, which has allowed the dispersal of pollutants to some extent and improved visibility. However, the air quality level is likely to remain ‘severe’ or ‘very poor’ due to dip in temperature, increased humidity and slower winds which will prevent dispersal,” the IMD said. The minimum temperature dropped from 13.4 degrees Celsius on Friday to 11.3 degrees on Saturday, while the daytime temperature was at 25.5 degrees, three notches below the season’s normal. Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said they are making “all efforts” to improve air quality. “We implemented precautionary measures from October 1 and now, we have optimitised our efforts and are continuously engaging every stakeholder to mitigate the air pollution. We urge residents not to carry out activities which contribute to pollution such as open burning of waste, and encourage them to opt for carpooling,” an official said. Activists, meanwhile, pointed towards lack of enforcement by government agencies for the rising AQI. “Construction activities and waste burning are going on unabated and polluting industries and DG sets are being run without any checks. As of now, the government has no will to address this emergency situation,” said Abhishek Srivastava, an environmental engineer and a member of Citizens For Clean Air, a residents’ group. Doctors have advised people to avoid outdoor activities. “People who have a history of respiratory diseases need to remain watchful. We should also have a good balanced diet which is rich in protein and avoid outdoor activities during the peak pollution times,” said Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant and head of the department of pulmonology at Paras Hospital. Meanwhile, Delhi continued to be a gas chamber for the second day in a row. Its air quality remained under ‘severe’ category despite a slight improvement towards Saturday noon due to supportive weather conditions and drop in farm fire share in the city’s pollution. The pollution monitoring agencies expect a very slight and temporary relief on Sunday to lower end of ‘severe’ or upper end of ‘very-poor’. According to the weather department, the slight improvement within the severe category on Saturday was a result of increased wind speed. However, the winds are expected to slow down from Sunday evening again, thereby increasing the pollution levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-chokes-on-severe-air-for-second-day-on-the-trot/articleshow/87691634.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Centre's quick nod, Habibganj is now Rani Kamlapati station||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the quick renaming of Habibganj railway station after Rani Kamalapati. The Madhya Pradesh government had sent the proposal on Friday and the nod came in no time. "In childhood, we used to hear 'Taal to Bhopal Taal Baaki Sab Talaiya , Raniyon Mein Rani to Kamalapati Rani Baki Sab Ranaiyya' (Bhopal's lake is the best among lakes, and among queens, Kamlapati is the greatest). Kamala Park has already been developed in her name in Bhopal. Modiji has enhanced the pride and honour of tribes by renaming Habibganj as Rani Kamlapati railway station on the occasion of Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas," the CM said. The redevelopment of the 42-year-old station has come at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore for the first phase. Phase-2 is expected to cost Rs 350 crore. Aimed at meeting global standards, the station is designed to avoid crowding - both on the platforms and the approach roads outside. It has 160 CCTV cameras, along with facial recognition technology. India's first railway station redeveloped through PPP mode will be inaugurated by the PM on Monday. Representatives of the Gond community met the CM to express their joy.. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday wrote a blog on Rani Kamlapati, the Gond queen after whom Habibganj station has been renamed. Going back in history, Chouhan has written how Kamlapati, the daughter of Raja Kirpal Singh Sarautia of the princely state of Salkanpur, Sehore, was "intelligent and courageous" from her childhood and had "mastered education, horse riding, wrestling and archery". "As a skillful Senapati, she fought wars with her father's military and her female team. She kept protecting her kingdom from invaders," the CM writes. She married Nizam Shah, the son of Suraj Singh Shah who reigned over the state of Ginnaurgarh. King Nizam Shah built a seven-storeyed palace in Bhopal as a token of love for Rani Kamalapati in 1700 AD. "Today, its remains can be seen in the park of the Upper and Lower Lake," he writes. "Gond Rani Kamalapati is relevant even today, 300 years later, and we are grateful for being able to honour her for her sacrifice. Every part of Bhopal narrates her story. The echoes of her sacrifice can be heard in the waters of the lakes here," the CM has written, referring to her "Jal Samadhi". It's after her death in 1723 that the rule of Nawabs started in Bhopal, led by Dost Mohammad Khan. "I have had the privilege of installing a grand statue of Rani Kamlapati at her Jauhar site outside her palace. On the occasion of Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, a replica of her statue will be presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modiji," he writes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-centres-quick-nod-habibganj-is-now-rani-kamlapati-station/articleshow/87692925.cms||---

The accused, police said, was part of a larger gang that would similarly target houses in the upscale societies in DLF areas of the city. According to police, the accused would seek work at houses and flee with valuables after a few days. Several items of gold jewellery, including eight bangles, four chains, eight pairs of earrings, eight rings and four pendants, have been recovered from the accused, identified as Laxmi, police said. Eleven silver coins and three locker keys have also been found.

---||Gurgaon||Eateries, bars in Haryana can operate at 100% capacity||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Saturday allowed restaurants, bars, gyms, spas and club houses to operate at full capacity, provided these commercial establishments followed social distancing norms and other Covid-appropriate behaviour. Cinemas and multiplexes were also permitted to operate at 100% seating capacity. As Covid cases have been on the lower side for the past several weeks now, the government asked residential universities to prepare a schedule for students to return to campuses in phases. The state, however, stopped short of lifting the lockdown and extended it by a fortnight till November 28. Since July this year, single screens and multiplexes had both been running at 50% capacity. Owners welcomed the move, saying it would help them tide over the losses incurred during the two subsequent lockdowns. “We suffered huge losses. In the past year and a half, we had been shut on most days. When we opened, we were told to operate at only 50% capacity. All the shows of the recently released Sooryavanshi were full. Had the decision been announced a week ago, we could have garnered considerable revenue. But we are happy with the government’s decision. We are hoping to make some profits this month as there are a few big movies lined up now. We will follow strict Covid protocols, like we have been doing for so long,” said Sanjay Barjatya, the regional head of Miraj Cinemas. Owners of restaurants, which have been allowed several relaxations in their timings over the past few months, are still waiting for corporate houses to call employees to offices. “In a city like Gurugram, office workers form the major chunk of our customer base. So far, only 10-15% of the corporate crowd have been visiting the eateries near their offices. We have been getting families and local residents and the business is about 70% of what it used to be. Gurugram has a huge corporate base and we are hoping normalcy in terms of attendance will return by this year,” said Gagan Vashisht, the owner of Dhaba 29. For social gatherings, however, the cap stays. In indoor areas, no more than 200 people would be allowed at a time. In open spaces, the number of guests can be up to 500. Despite the reducing numbers, the Gurugram administration warned people against letting their guard down. “The government has been easing restrictions in phases. However, people should continue to stay alert. The wedding season is here, so gatherings will happen. It is extremely important for people to take all precautions while attending such events,” deputy commissioner Yash Garg said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/eateries-bars-can-operate-at-100-capacity/articleshow/87691645.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Bhopal||MP: Kamlapati, first state-of-the-art railway station built on PPP mode||BHOPAL: November 15 will mark a significant day in the history of Indian Railways. Rani Kamalapati Railway Station (formerly Habibganj Railway Station) in Bhopal, redeveloped on a PPP model, is set to become India's first railway station to deliver the never-seen-before facilities in the country, officials say. This station revamped on the lines of world-famous Heidelberg Railway Station of Germany, will have airport-like facilities for passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the 'Rani Kamalapati Railway Station' revamped at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore (first phase-station work) on November 15. Rs 350 crore have been earmarked for commercial renovation. The revamped station boasts of a huge parking area that can accommodate 300 cars, 850 two-wheelers, rickshaws, taxis and even buses. The most attractive part of the station is the newly-constructed air-concourse. It is a 84m x 36m central air space, equipped with a modern waiting room, sitting amenities, food stalls and other facilities that are said to avoid congestion on platforms. Air-concourse facility will be available for passengers actually boarding the trains. It has been constructed by dismantling the old foot-over-bridge (FoB). There will be large LED screens for entertainment and multiple delicious cuisine shops in the air-concourse. The air concourse lounge will have a space for 700 passengers at a time.

---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh high court says need to establish if ‘Pahari’ has own script||SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh high court has said directions could not be issued to the state government to declare Pahari as an official language of the state unless it was established on record that Pahari (Himachali) language had its own script and that a common Pahari dialect was spoken throughout the state. The HC said this while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) petition which sought directions for the state government to declare Paharias an official language of the state. The court set the petitioner at liberty to approach the department of language art and culture of Himachal Pradesh, with his demand for undertaking a research to promote a common Pahari (Himachali) nuclear language structure and nuclear Tankri script. A division bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Sabina, in a recent order, said if the petitioner approached the respondents, or the state, through its additional chief secretary (language, art and culture) for the prayer made in his petition, it would be for the said authority to consider the same in accordance with law. This petition was filed with a prayer that the state government be directed to declare Pahari as one of the official languages in Himachal Pradesh in any script and also direct them to promote research towards a longterm formal Pahari (Himachali) nuclear language structure and nuclear Tankri script. It was also prayed that the state government be directed to promote Pahari (Himachali) and other local languages as the medium of instruction in primary and middle-level schools as per the New Education Policy 2020 and to demand the inclusion of Pahari (Himachali) language as a separate category for the 2021 Census and simultaneously undertake an awareness campaign to create awareness amongst the masses, especially the youth of the state who speak Pahari (Himachali), to get it marked as their mother tongue in the upcoming Census. In response to the query pointed out by this court, the counsel for the petitioner did not dispute that dialect of the Pahari spoken in different areas of Himachal Pradesh, differed from area to area. Even Ashok Sharma, advocate general, assisted by additional advocate general Vikas Rathore, submitted that not only the dialects of Pahari language would differ from one district to another district of the state, but even in a single district of the state, in different areas, different dialects of Pahari language were spoken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hc-says-need-to-establish-if-pahari-has-own-script/articleshow/87691549.cms||---

A low pressure trough that had formed across Tamil Nadu and Odisha moved up north into Gangetic Bengal that triggered the clouds and is set to lead to more rain on Sunday and Monday, the Met office said. While it will continue to remain cloudy till Tuesday, the minimum temperature slid up to 23.3 degree Celsius on Saturday and maximum dropped to 27.3 degree Celsius. The rain could be light to moderate over the next two days, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre. “The low-pressure trough moved into Bengal as expected and has resulted in clouds and rain. Rain will continue and could get moderate either on Sunday or Monday,” said RMC director GK Das. While the cloud cover is set to persist till Tuesday, the lowpressure trough will start weakening from Tuesday. “It will lose steam and should fizzle out,” added Das. The cloud cover has pushed the minimum temperature well above 20 degrees while it has pulled the maximum down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parts-of-kolkata-get-drizzles-met-spies-more-rain/articleshow/87693019.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Covid-19: Second dose coverage below 50% in 32 districts of Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh government's all out efforts to woo every eligible individual to get vaccinated against Covid-19 notwithstanding, 32 districts of Madhya Pradesh have reported less than 50% second dose vaccinations. The state government has set a target of achieving 100% vaccination of eligible people by the year end. According to state health department records, a total of 5,02,60,585 people have been administered the first dose of vaccine. Of those, 2,51,64,497 or 50% have been fully vaccinated with both the doses. There are 8 districts including Barwani, Singrauli, Alirajpur, Satna, Jhabua, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Sheopur where the second dose vaccination percentage is less than 40%. The lowest is in Barwani where only 36.21% of those who have received the first dose have also received the second dose of the vaccine. Thus, there are a total of 32 districts in the state where the vaccination percentage is less than 50%. Among the districts where there has been better vaccination includes Indore where 67% of those who have received the first dose have also been administered with the second dose, in Jabalpur it is 66%, Ujjain 63%, Bhopal 62% and Datia 61.9%. Sources said that if full vaccination has to be achieved by year end, then drives like the one initiated on November 10, are a must because if average vaccination for past one and half months is seen it is less than 2.5 lakh per day and in a bid to achieve full vaccination by year end, it needs to be above 5.5 lakh per day now. However, vaccination status is likely to improve in coming days as several measures are being taken at both state and district levels to get people to vaccination centres across the state. The state government has roped in the fair price shops to make sure that the message is driven among the public that beneficiaries would be entitled to subsidized ration only if they are fully vaccinated. Similarly, in several districts, the local administration is taking different measures and are urging religious leaders and organisations to spread the message for vaccination. Besides, traders' bodies and hotel associations are being encouraged to allow only fully vaccinated people in for services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-second-dose-coverage-below-50-in-32-districts-of-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/87693028.cms||Amarjeet Singh
